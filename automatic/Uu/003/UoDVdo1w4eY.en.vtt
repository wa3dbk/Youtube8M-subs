00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.590
 When the afternoon of the previous day fell 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.360
 they heard quick steps and voices of 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.519
 Anguish through the school hallways 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.370
 Saint Augustine in the historical sector of 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.469
 popayÃ¡n the rush was carried by the girls 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.330
 ninth graders who are distressed 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.580
 they came to where the director of 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.590
 group to tell him that four of his 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.430
 partners showed fainting and 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.260
 seizures was that she gets girls of 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.290
 ninth they played 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.260
 charly charly and then a moment in 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.470
 that the pencil started moving so strong 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.080
 like a whirlpool and then in which 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.180
 I had asked came over and fainted 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.040
 and began to convulse and two girls the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.660
 they continued to faint after 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.520
 director of the group to see the anguish 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.070
 of the minors ran to the classroom 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.230
 classes to learn that young women 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.440
 they had been playing the so-called 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.970
 charly charly were closed to a series of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 facts in which they began to play 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.760
 a game called charly charly 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 that are a bit faint 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.500
 there was even a case where a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.909
 partner gave him convulsions 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.250
 many things started happening in the day 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.740
 yesterday after analyzing the situation 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 and to meet with the girls of the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.860
 degrees that were involved in 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.479
 this fact the coordinator of the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.550
 educational institution Saint Augustine said 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.409
 that corrective measures be taken the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.119
 St. Augustine College directives have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.040
 taken what happened as a fact of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.750
 young students who in their curiosity 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.399
 they tried a game that is popular in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.440
 social networks and that for an explanation 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.840
 physical and scientific allows a pencil 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.979
 move that's why teachers and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.690
 coordinators of the institution 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.789
 education have faced the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.630
 inconvenience that they have expressed what 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.759
 happened they started working or playing or 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.090
 bother with a program that they call 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.000
 charly charly and some of the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.700
 students who do not have the ability 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.860
 enough to handle the forces 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780
 positive ones were influenced by the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
 negative forces 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.200
 as there are girls who are nervous there 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.000
 others that have some strength when 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.470
 they see that a pen moves then 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.619
 they think it's that the devil is there 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.980
 stuck and the negative forces do that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.140
 the nervous part will trigger the pencil 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.670
 it simply moves because it is located 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.440
 in a position that any change of 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.630
 wind direction heat or tremor 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.120
 affects causing the sensitive movement 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.890
 the directives of Saint Augustine brought together 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.959
 today to his students who explained what 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.880
 really happens and the consequences that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.220
 it brings the letting itself be influenced in a way 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.500
 negative for social networking issues 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.709
 to see the corrections that are taken 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.769
 for this situation is orientation both 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.569
 spiritual as psychological and in this 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.510
 moment as you can see here I have 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.400
 the degrees this specifically degree 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.670
 ninth that was where the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.800
 circumstance and then let's chat 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.380
 about this situation to give the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.390
 relevant guidance we hope that 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.090
 this does not return to virosis as they do 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.590
 other things through the internet 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.030
 called is for parents 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.830
 so that they are aware of what 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.480
 can see their children in the networks 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.370
 social pages since this 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.200
 problematic derives from saturation and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.570
 the exposure our children have 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.180
 and girls of all kinds of material in 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.250
 Internet with my camera and I do not see it 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.990
 this was an information service of 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.410
 fernando rojas for news 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.410
