00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the staff all good then it is the following me 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.750
 I stopped to think about releasing 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.460
 as you know but the company does not 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.370
 had a certain day to record non-video 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 had certain content recorded what I 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.170
 it was on the tile and I realized that it 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.090
 it's working so now do not you days 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.029
 certain to have video on the channel until 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.250
 thinking on Monday the fourth and sixth and in the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 Saturday and Sunday at the weekend have 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810
 Something different but I still do not 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 I know so maybe I have and maybe not anymore 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.850
 Monday, Wednesday and Friday are the days 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.710
 and I did not mention which 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.020
 contents will be these days as you 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 they see I 'm not at home then 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 it's kind of tricky for the owner 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.540
 and he had these things but I wanted 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.250
 make this video for you today not to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.370
 to leave you with nothing but 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.809
 Over the course of two days I'm posting 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.059
 right on my facebook page fan 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.109

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.350
 monitor and also to live Question 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.820
 It 's for you, it's days, then I 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.629
 I will also have a certain day to do the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.100
 stream 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.990
 but if by chance on the day that had not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 that it's the will to do, but the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.030
 days that I have right will have a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.890
 string and how can I not see it in the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.799
 youtube over the internet 90 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.270
 I do the TV teaching and the link here too. 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.920
 in the application you are not following yet 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.530
 Follow me there because I do not love 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
 stream on youtube stream only on 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 tweet 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.570
 Other thing I asked on twitter for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 What do you think I should 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 improve on videos what should improve 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.540
 on the channel and you told me then I 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 I got all the tips I'll do on 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.350
 Next video Wednesday is already going to be 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 video will likely follow in play 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.439
 of it because I'm not at home so I 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.409
 I got to do something much more 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.320
 made for you and will have a video 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.720
 so Wednesday and can be ae 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.360
 I also have two news to say 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.009
 for you the one is that youtube released 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.930
 for us a very cool tool of 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.700
 a community that is where people 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.130
 Can you see which others are 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.290
 those who are more active than those 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.930
 comment on the videos that the former do not 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.880
 favorites that share then I 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.399
 I decided to use this tool since the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.550
 youtube available to us and I'll do it 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.730
 the following every week I'll look 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 I'll get the four or five more 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.260
 active and I will call to play a game 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.940
 with me 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.060
 probably turns on flashes than the game 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.850
 by group play but if the person 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.680
 if people are not playing 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.890
 the flash and we found another game to 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.690
 I'll record and steam on the channel that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.610
 I think this gives an incentive if a 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.320
 little more because sometimes you watch 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.640
 A video talking is not that it is not 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.590
 important i will not let 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.140
 but everything is important there and that is 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.360
 important then I think this is a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.560
 myth of encouragement to you and you 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.060
 help and there are people in there in the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.020
 people talk people record video 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.720
 talking to you and the other 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.360
 thing is that I want people ask too much 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.100
 to play with me right then instead of the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.340
 to do in particular sometimes I go there in the 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.010
 twitter talked game now the people who 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.710
 made the twitter account here on twitter 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.360
 who discovered the flash through me that 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.090
 made against mine and went ahead that 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.950
 is here in the description link is it I go 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.650
 call because you can see the right 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.500
 unique name of the people who created 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.010
 so I'll call four people 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.750
 also a week and I'll record video with 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.270
 you turn off the leds 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.150
 If that's low, I'll go. 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.920
 make one with you will play explaining 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.950
 the case have doubts asking 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.080
 playing they had no doubt in cases this 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.989
 It's already good, we already have the brother. 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.489
 game it and these will be the game place 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.350
 of the week every week will have a 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.750
 gameplay then it will be a week with the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.000

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.520

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.450
 It is not too bad then gives so takes ten 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.580
