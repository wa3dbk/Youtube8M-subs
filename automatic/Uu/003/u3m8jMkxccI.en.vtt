00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.990
 your eyes will all agree that this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 it's not a knife and I believe this well 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 is the new miracle black iii the first 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 of the perfect series and see immediately that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 the handle a is not an ordinary knife 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.250
 a recess for a comfortable grip like that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.490
 the hand and raised does not touch the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.910
 cutting board and the blade is hard and tempered e 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.070
 the soft blade thanks to the 3 in 1 thread 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.470

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.910
 the knife maybe during the holidays vi 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.360
 will happen to slice the roast beef 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.730
 turkey chicken asbi or roasted kg of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.220
 chicken with every movement of Rome you have 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.820
 perfect but maybe you will have food 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.100
 frozen 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.290

 Lots of people ruin knives 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.420
 rubbing it blade on the cutting board and me 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.250
 as you can see infili I know well inside 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.200
 this would ruin any cutting board 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.400
 knife but not frozen salmon and I have 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.720
 more than you could do in all 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.610
 life 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.479

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.520

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.010
 prefer if you do not use my knives 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 you will remember me you will go home and 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.159
 with the everyday knife you know 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 what you will do for your own 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.640
 my mother's family pieces as you do from 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.560
 50 years how many did it 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.020
 here's one 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.810
 with another you have ever tried buttering 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.190
 such a thing can put it in the toaster 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.780
 impossible to hear told me that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.849
 this is the miracle plater and series 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.950
 perfect this serves to slice of 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.489
 all the one thing he can't do e 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.610
 my mother 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.190
 in short it is a spectacular thing and also 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.160
 on something as pure as a potato 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.560
 look scuttled fit and cut the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.630
 half put it back together and prepare it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.220
 to cook these you see these 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.620
 are the notches to release the food 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 it was n't done and I 'm not done yet 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.480

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.760

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.530

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.730
 when you want to stuff a chop of 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.560
 pig with this knife 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.209
