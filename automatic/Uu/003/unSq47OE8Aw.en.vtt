the way I showed you a moment ago but
you<00:02:32.150> have<00:02:32.330> different<00:02:32.750> kind<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.140> aligners<00:02:33.590> and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
you have different kind of aligners and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.220 
you have different kind of aligners and
your<00:02:36.220> instrument<00:02:37.299> so<00:02:38.299> what<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.900> will<00:02:39.019> need<00:02:39.170> to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
your instrument so what you will need to

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.420 
your instrument so what you will need to
do<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:40.750> on<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.230> valves<00:02:42.650> look<00:02:42.830> for<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.099> number

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
do is on the valves look for the number

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.550 
do is on the valves look for the number
you'll<00:02:44.390> see<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.690> Winston's<00:02:45.110> number<00:02:45.349> one

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
you'll see that Winston's number one

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.620 
you'll see that Winston's number one
it's<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.890> first<00:02:46.130> valve<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.330> you're<00:02:47.450> going<00:02:47.599> to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's the first valve so you're going to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.930 
it's the first valve so you're going to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
align that number up with your second

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.630 
align that number up with your second
valve<00:02:50.150> slide<00:02:50.510> or<00:02:50.720> with<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.799> inner<00:02:52.310> part

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
we're getting set up to practice and

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.649 
we're getting set up to practice and
getting<00:05:09.979> our<00:05:10.219> stands<00:05:10.550> out<00:05:10.879> and<00:05:11.149> music<00:05:11.479> books

getting our stands out and music books

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.290 
getting our stands out and music books
ready<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:12.139> go<00:05:12.289> it's<00:05:12.559> really<00:05:12.830> easy<00:05:13.039> to<00:05:13.249> bump<00:05:13.669> the

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
ready to go it's really easy to bump the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.959 
ready to go it's really easy to bump the
casings<00:05:14.839> and<00:05:15.139> get<00:05:15.349> tiny<00:05:15.649> tiny<00:05:15.979> dents<00:05:16.279> that

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
casings and get tiny tiny dents that

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.809 
casings and get tiny tiny dents that
will<00:05:17.149> also<00:05:17.389> cause<00:05:18.229> valves<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:19.039> stick<00:05:19.339> if

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
will also cause valves to stick if

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.359 
will also cause valves to stick if
that's<00:05:20.119> the<00:05:20.389> case<00:05:20.659> we<00:05:21.619> will<00:05:21.800> need<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.069> send<00:05:22.279> it

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:22.369 
that's the case we will need to send it

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:24.999 
that's the case we will need to send it
to<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.520> repairman<00:05:23.059> to<00:05:23.240> have<00:05:23.389> it<00:05:23.740> addressed<00:05:24.740> and

really careful with the valve so we

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.559 
really careful with the valve so we
