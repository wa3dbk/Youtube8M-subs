00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
you have it that's pretty much what it

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:45.700 
you have it that's pretty much what it
looked<00:01:35.960> like<00:01:40.000> my<00:01:41.000> coffee<00:01:41.409> deal<00:01:44.350> just<00:01:45.350> like

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
looked like my coffee deal just like

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.700 
looked like my coffee deal just like
that<00:01:46.070> that's<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.729> camera<00:01:47.180> view<00:01:47.439> all<00:01:48.439> right

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that that's the camera view all right

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.980 
that that's the camera view all right
so<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:52.310> they<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.520> have

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
so there you have it they don't have

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
so there you have it they don't have
wireless<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> had<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.270> use<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> wire<00:01:58.670> pc

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
wireless so I had to use the wire pc

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.210 
wireless so I had to use the wire pc
port<00:01:59.970> on<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> camera<00:02:00.960> which<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.100> have

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
port on the camera which I have

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.680 
port on the camera which I have
disconnected<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:03.530> mounts<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.650> top<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.100> here

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
disconnected here mounts on top of here

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.590 
disconnected here mounts on top of here
that's<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:08.569> hope<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.840> helped<00:02:10.110> someone
