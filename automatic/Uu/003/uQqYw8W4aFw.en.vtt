today's video I'm going to show you how
I<00:00:08.429> mix<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.480> deep<00:00:10.230> conditioner<00:00:10.950> for<00:00:11.130> my<00:00:11.280> hair<00:00:11.580> now

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.440 
I mix a deep conditioner for my hair now
this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.170> probably<00:00:14.070> one<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.969> most

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
this is probably one of the most

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.130 
this is probably one of the most
important<00:00:16.109> things<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.310> comes<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:18.140> being

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
important things when it comes to being

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
important things when it comes to being
on<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> healthy<00:00:19.680> hair<00:00:19.830> journey<00:00:20.070> maintaining

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
on a healthy hair journey maintaining

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.279 
on a healthy hair journey maintaining
healthy<00:00:21.480> hair<00:00:22.070> maintaining<00:00:23.070> your<00:00:23.519> length

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
healthy hair maintaining your length

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.630 
healthy hair maintaining your length
retaining<00:00:25.289> growth<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.779> reason<00:00:28.199> is

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
retaining growth and the reason is

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.990 
retaining growth and the reason is
particularly<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.820> curly<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.480> afro<00:00:31.199> hair

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
particularly with curly or afro hair

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.110 
particularly with curly or afro hair
because<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.300> our<00:00:33.600> curl<00:00:34.079> pattern<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.399> moisture

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
because of our curl pattern the moisture

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.810 
because of our curl pattern the moisture
and<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.840> natural<00:00:37.260> sebum<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.250> released

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and the natural sebum that is released

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.410 
and the natural sebum that is released
at<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.360> roots<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.840> our<00:00:40.020> hair<00:00:40.730> can't<00:00:41.730> make<00:00:42.149> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
at the roots of our hair can't make it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
at the roots of our hair can't make it
quite<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.829> actual

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
quite all the way down the actual

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
quite all the way down the actual
spirals<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.300> caught<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
spirals they kind of get caught in the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.510 
spirals they kind of get caught in the
kinks<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> right<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
kinks and don't make it right the way to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880 
kinks and don't make it right the way to
the<00:00:47.730> end<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.210> need<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.660> help<00:00:49.320> put<00:00:49.649> in

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the end so we need to help put in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.479 
the end so we need to help put in
moisture<00:00:50.870> especially<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.020> our<00:00:52.140> ends<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
moisture especially in our ends to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
moisture especially in our ends to
ensure<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> our<00:00:54.390> hair<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.870> elastic<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
ensure that our hair is elastic and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.479 
ensure that our hair is elastic and
supple<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.940> your<00:00:57.090> hair<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:58.489> dry

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
supple because if your hair is like dry

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
supple because if your hair is like dry
and<00:01:00.230> unable<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.469> move<00:01:02.070> flexibly<00:01:03.019> when<00:01:04.019> it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and unable to move flexibly when it's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
and unable to move flexibly when it's
moved<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> break<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.869> easily

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
moved it's going to break very easily

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.710 
moved it's going to break very easily
whereas<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.640> kind<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.150> supple

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
whereas if it's kind of like supple

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.469 
whereas if it's kind of like supple
because<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.439> put<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.799> moisture<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:12.090> not

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
because you put in moisture it's not

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.330 
because you put in moisture it's not
going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> break<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.979> really

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
going to break so it's really really

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
going to break so it's really really
important<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> was<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.049> most<00:01:16.320> important
