00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.720
 I want to become stronger 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.960
 Because this world is very cruel 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.680
 The flowers were dying, now being cut off 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.040
 He whispered into her ear: 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.720
 Do you want to come with me? 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.320
 I asked you if you want to take my hand? 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.680
 How can I refuse! 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.140

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.200

 Yes, I am very strong, than I ever thought 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.460
 Fly higher, run faster 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.780
 But don't forget the truth

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.080
 But why are you sad?

 This world is very strange 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.740

 want to be disconnected 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.040

 What do you want from me? 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.320
 No matter you want it or not 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.960
 I still have to chase the enemy 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.820
 I am not free in this world 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.020
 What do you want from me? 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.200

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.060
 Fly higher, run faster 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.060
 Don't forget the truth 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.460
 (That's right, I'm stronger than I ever thought.) I'm still very strong 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 (I cut the wilted flowers) He made a garland
