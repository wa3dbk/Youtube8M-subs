at his oh no from oh no tech and today I

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.529 
at his oh no from oh no tech and today I
have<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> 4k<00:00:15.570> gaming<00:00:16.310> video<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.789> guys<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.970> 4k

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
have a 4k gaming video for you guys a 4k

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
have a 4k gaming video for you guys a 4k
build<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.410> all<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.800> 4k<00:00:20.250> gamers<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:20.760> there

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
build for all of you 4k gamers out there

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.700 
build for all of you 4k gamers out there
and<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.330> reason<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:21.869> decided<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.410> make

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and the reason I really decided to make

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.560 
and the reason I really decided to make
this<00:00:22.859> video<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.460> 4k<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.119> becoming

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
this video is because 4k is becoming

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.540 
this video is because 4k is becoming
more<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.170> more<00:00:25.439> part<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.800> our<00:00:25.949> consumer<00:00:26.279> it's

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
more and more part of our consumer it's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
more and more part of our consumer it's
heck<00:00:26.730> market<00:00:27.150> today<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.900> why<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.619> make<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
heck market today so why not just make a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.209 
heck market today so why not just make a
video<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:30.660> help<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> guys<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.040> make

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
video to help you guys that want to make

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.250 
video to help you guys that want to make
a<00:00:32.430> gaming<00:00:32.820> bill<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.270> centered<00:00:33.690> around<00:00:33.840> 4k

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
a gaming bill that's centered around 4k

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
a gaming bill that's centered around 4k
now<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.130> probably<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.730> cheapest<00:00:36.239> for

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
now this is probably the cheapest for

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
now this is probably the cheapest for

before I blogger on any longer let's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.049 
before I blogger on any longer let's
start<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.800> video<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.550> start<00:00:44.820> us<00:00:44.910> off

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
start off with the video to start us off

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.180 
start off with the video to start us off
with<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> processor<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> went<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> AMD

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
with the processor I went with the AMD

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.819 
with the processor I went with the AMD
eight<00:00:47.399> core<00:00:47.730> 8350<00:00:48.660> clocked<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.140> four<00:00:49.350> point<00:00:49.649> oh

giga hertz and the real reason I one

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
giga hertz and the real reason I one
with<00:00:51.870> AMD<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> has

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
with AMD here is just because it has

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
with AMD here is just because it has
eight<00:00:53.879> cores<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.510> don't<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> Intel<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
eight cores I don't know that Intel is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
eight cores I don't know that Intel is
faster<00:00:56.100> clock<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.670> clock<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.329> single

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
faster clock for clock and in single

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
faster clock for clock and in single
threatening<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.620> case<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.340> want<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
threatening but in case you do want to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.279 
threatening but in case you do want to
do<00:00:59.820> something<00:01:00.090> while<00:01:00.420> you're<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.899> kicking

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
do something while you're for kicking

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.470 
do something while you're for kicking
which<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.710> pretty<00:01:02.250> crazy<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.789> its<00:01:03.000> own<00:01:03.210> right

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
which is pretty crazy in its own right

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.990 
which is pretty crazy in its own right
for<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> case<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> say<00:01:04.769> stream<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> 4k

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
for the case you want to say stream a 4k

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120 
for the case you want to say stream a 4k
game<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.439> an<00:01:07.590> advantage<00:01:07.890> with

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
game then you do have an advantage with

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.770 
game then you do have an advantage with
AMD<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> extra

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
AMD just because you have the extra

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
AMD just because you have the extra
cords<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> mention

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
cords there with it and not to mention

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
cords there with it and not to mention
that<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.360> under<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.810> hundred<00:01:12.960> dollars<00:01:13.409> too

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that it's under two hundred dollars too

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100 
that it's under two hundred dollars too
so<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.460> fit<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.240> nicely<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.990> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
so that can fit really nicely into this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
so that can fit really nicely into this
budget<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.860> cool<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> processor<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> decide<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
budget so cool the processor I decide to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.600 
budget so cool the processor I decide to
go<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> noctua<00:01:18.990> air<00:01:19.350> cpu<00:01:19.979> cooler<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
go with the noctua air cpu cooler and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
go with the noctua air cpu cooler and
the<00:01:20.880> reason<00:01:21.030> i<00:01:21.210> didn't<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.540> liquid<00:01:21.869> cooling

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the reason i didn't know liquid cooling

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.539 
the reason i didn't know liquid cooling
is<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.560> there's<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.369> much

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
is because there's just so much

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
is because there's just so much
customization<00:01:24.150> let's<00:01:25.110> liquid<00:01:25.409> cooling<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
customization let's liquid cooling that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.859 
customization let's liquid cooling that
it<00:01:25.950> can't<00:01:26.159> confuse<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.030> people<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.810> i

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it can't confuse a lot of people so i

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
it can't confuse a lot of people so i
decided<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> scrap<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.560> idea<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.310> go

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
decided to scrap that idea and just go

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.719 
decided to scrap that idea and just go
with<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.270> cpu<00:01:30.960> air<00:01:31.290> cooler<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
with a cpu air cooler and the not so it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
with a cpu air cooler and the not so it
really<00:01:33.000> goes<00:01:33.240> without<00:01:33.390> saying<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.320> really

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
really goes without saying it's a really

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.310 
really goes without saying it's a really
good<00:01:34.740> cooler<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.700> only<00:01:35.880> about<00:01:36.150> 50<00:01:36.689> bucks<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
good cooler for only about 50 bucks and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.990 
good cooler for only about 50 bucks and
it<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:37.920> keep<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> temperatures<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it will keep the temperatures on the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.920 
it will keep the temperatures on the
pretty<00:01:39.420> high<00:01:40.049> demanding<00:01:40.950> 8350<00:01:41.759> low<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.509> it

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
motherboard as for the ram I decide to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.240 
motherboard as for the ram I decide to
go<00:02:26.870> 16<00:02:27.650> gigs<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.700> y<00:02:28.940> 8<00:02:29.210> gigabyte<00:02:29.810> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
go 16 gigs to y 8 gigabyte a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.460 
go 16 gigs to y 8 gigabyte a
dual-channel<00:02:31.480> 1600<00:02:32.480> megahertz<00:02:32.660> gram<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
dual-channel 1600 megahertz gram and the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.200 
dual-channel 1600 megahertz gram and the
reason<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.830> really<00:02:34.100> went<00:02:34.280> with<00:02:34.400> 16<00:02:34.790> gigs<00:02:34.970> is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
reason I really went with 16 gigs is

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.000 
reason I really went with 16 gigs is
just<00:02:35.390> because<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:35.840> had<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.140> money<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.620> afford

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
just because we had the money to afford

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.880 
just because we had the money to afford
and<00:02:37.430> 16<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:38.030> know<00:02:38.960> that<00:02:39.140> eight<00:02:39.440> games<00:02:39.710> is

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
and 16 I know that eight games is

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.550 
and 16 I know that eight games is
definitely<00:02:40.550> enough<00:02:41.030> for<00:02:41.450> gaming<00:02:42.050> but<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.350> can

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
definitely enough for gaming but you can

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.290 
definitely enough for gaming but you can
future-proof<00:02:43.130> that's<00:02:43.370> build<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.700> little<00:02:44.000> bit<00:02:44.120> I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
future-proof that's build a little bit I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.780 
future-proof that's build a little bit I
just<00:02:44.330> add<00:02:44.660> another<00:02:44.690> eight<00:02:45.380> gigs<00:02:46.010> for<00:02:46.580> about

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
just add another eight gigs for about

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.460 
just add another eight gigs for about
another<00:02:46.910> 60<00:02:47.480> bucks<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:47.870> since<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
another 60 bucks so since we have the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.080 
another 60 bucks so since we have the
money<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.740> spend<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.130> pretty<00:02:49.340> much<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.520> case

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
money to spend it's pretty much the case

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.600 
money to spend it's pretty much the case
of<00:02:50.390> why<00:02:50.690> not<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.380> do<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.710> so<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.220> decided<00:02:52.550> to

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
of why not just do it so I decided to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.610 
of why not just do it so I decided to
put<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:52.910> into<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.300> build<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.870> you're<00:02:54.350> good

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
put that into this build and you're good

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.070 
put that into this build and you're good
to<00:02:54.650> go<00:02:54.770> with<00:02:55.010> 16<00:02:55.370> gigs<00:02:55.520> which<00:02:56.180> also<00:02:56.390> does<00:02:56.750> help

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
to go with 16 gigs which also does help

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.780 
to go with 16 gigs which also does help
with<00:02:57.230> multitasking<00:02:57.770> video<00:02:58.460> editing

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
with multitasking video editing

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.760 
with multitasking video editing
streaming<00:02:59.240> and<00:02:59.360> all<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.810> if<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.350> do<00:03:00.500> want<00:03:00.680> to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
streaming and all that if you do want to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.650 
streaming and all that if you do want to
do<00:03:00.860> that<00:03:01.040> with<00:03:01.190> for<00:03:01.430> camp<00:03:01.670> as<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.390> storage

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
do that with for camp as for the storage

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.230 
do that with for camp as for the storage
I<00:03:02.990> did<00:03:03.290> need<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.590> add<00:03:03.830> an<00:03:03.980> SSD<00:03:04.460> because<00:03:04.790> we<00:03:04.970> will

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
I did need to add an SSD because we will

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.570 
I did need to add an SSD because we will
need<00:03:05.570> any<00:03:05.900> speed<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.530> we<00:03:06.680> can<00:03:06.860> possibly<00:03:07.040> get

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
need any speed that we can possibly get

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.660 
need any speed that we can possibly get
since<00:03:07.880> we<00:03:08.030> are<00:03:08.270> going<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.720> be<00:03:09.100> gaming<00:03:10.100> at<00:03:10.220> 4k

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
since we are going to be gaming at 4k

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.150 
since we are going to be gaming at 4k
and<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.270> SSD<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> chose<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.170> Kingston<00:03:12.770> hundred

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
twenty gigabyte SSD it's really not much

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.940 
twenty gigabyte SSD it's really not much
I<00:03:17.090> can<00:03:17.150> say<00:03:17.270> about<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.810> other<00:03:18.140> than<00:03:18.350> that<00:03:18.410> an

I can say about this other than that an

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.210 
I can say about this other than that an
SSD<00:03:19.400> can<00:03:19.610> almost<00:03:19.880> be<00:03:20.410> 600<00:03:21.410> sent<00:03:21.590> faster<00:03:22.010> than<00:03:22.130> a

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
SSD can almost be 600 sent faster than a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.460 
SSD can almost be 600 sent faster than a
regular<00:03:22.459> hard<00:03:23.000> drive<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.230> use

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
regular hard drive and so you can use

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.890 
regular hard drive and so you can use
this<00:03:24.680> SSD<00:03:25.100> as<00:03:25.340> your<00:03:25.520> primary<00:03:25.900> operating

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
this SSD as your primary operating

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.500 
this SSD as your primary operating
system<00:03:27.380> drive<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.489> also<00:03:28.730> just<00:03:29.239> put

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
system drive and you can also just put

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.530 
system drive and you can also just put
your<00:03:30.160> regular<00:03:31.160> applications<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.120> here<00:03:32.330> and

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
your regular applications on here and

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.640 
your regular applications on here and
then<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.810> can<00:03:32.989> store<00:03:33.260> your<00:03:33.290> other

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
then you can store your other

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.949 
then you can store your other
applications<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.640> one<00:03:35.150> terabyte<00:03:35.690> hard

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
applications on the one terabyte hard

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.290 
applications on the one terabyte hard
drive<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.470> will<00:03:36.680> also<00:03:37.250> be<00:03:37.430> added<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:38.209> this

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
drive that I will also be added to this

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.360 
drive that I will also be added to this
build<00:03:38.600> these<00:03:39.140> who<00:03:39.410> combined<00:03:39.830> will<00:03:40.010> be<00:03:40.130> less

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
build these who combined will be less

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.640 
build these who combined will be less
than<00:03:40.550> 125<00:03:41.420> dollars<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:42.080> are<00:03:42.410> really

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
than 125 dollars so you are really

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.380 
than 125 dollars so you are really
getting<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.190> pretty<00:03:43.489> good<00:03:43.670> deal<00:03:43.880> out<00:03:44.330> of

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
getting a pretty good deal out of

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.390 
getting a pretty good deal out of
beastie<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.230> now<00:03:45.590> at<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.770> moment<00:03:46.100> that<00:03:46.190> most

beastie and now at the moment that most

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.190 
beastie and now at the moment that most
of<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.640> have<00:03:46.730> probably<00:03:46.760> been<00:03:47.450> waiting<00:03:47.810> for<00:03:48.080> it

this<00:04:24.060> car<00:04:24.300> but<00:04:24.479> just<00:04:24.780> fine<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.380> does<00:04:25.830> very<00:04:26.460> very

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
this car but just fine it does very very

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.999 
this car but just fine it does very very
very<00:04:27.240> well<00:04:27.539> at<00:04:27.750> 4k<00:04:28.110> gaming<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.650> beats<00:04:28.830> out

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
very well at 4k gaming and it beats out

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.400 
very well at 4k gaming and it beats out
a<00:04:29.039> lot<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.400> other<00:04:29.610> sli<00:04:30.120> or<00:04:30.389> crossfire<00:04:30.479> cards

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
a lot of other sli or crossfire cards

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.820 
a lot of other sli or crossfire cards
with<00:04:31.979> only<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.430> single<00:04:33.090> card<00:04:33.479> it<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.139> dual<00:04:34.440> GP

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
with only a single card it is dual GP

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.610 
with only a single card it is dual GP
but<00:04:35.009> it's<00:04:35.130> only<00:04:35.280> one<00:04:35.580> is<00:04:35.759> single<00:04:36.150> card<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:37.050> for

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
but it's only one is single card so for

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.950 
but it's only one is single card so for
about<00:04:38.039> fifteen<00:04:38.370> hundred<00:04:38.400> dollars<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.270> get<00:04:39.900> a

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
about fifteen hundred dollars you get a

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.290 
about fifteen hundred dollars you get a
pretty<00:04:40.380> good<00:04:40.470> deal<00:04:40.800> just<00:04:41.610> because<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:42.090> does

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
pretty good deal just because it does

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.600 
pretty good deal just because it does
come<00:04:42.509> with<00:04:42.539> a<00:04:42.750> liquid<00:04:42.990> cooling<00:04:43.590> off<00:04:43.800> set<00:04:44.340> and

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
come with a liquid cooling off set and

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.350 
come with a liquid cooling off set and
it<00:04:45.389> does<00:04:45.599> extremely<00:04:46.139> well<00:04:46.320> at<00:04:46.770> for<00:04:47.130> katie<00:04:47.400> and

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
it does extremely well at for katie and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.800 
it does extremely well at for katie and
since<00:04:48.630> we<00:04:48.780> are<00:04:49.020> using<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.889> 295<00:04:50.669> x2<00:04:51.330> which<00:04:51.539> has<00:04:51.780> a
