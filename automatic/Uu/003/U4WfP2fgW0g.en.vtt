this is the Citra and Zara you're right
you've<00:00:13.469> seen<00:00:13.499> thousands<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.280> them<00:00:14.429> around<00:00:14.610> and

of your time and I might just convince
you<00:00:33.510> otherwise

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.979 

the<00:00:49.489> ride<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:49.850> handling<00:00:49.910> of<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:50.510> car<00:00:50.719> is

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
the ride and handling of this car is

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.779 
the ride and handling of this car is
very<00:00:51.079> good<00:00:51.350> indeed<00:00:51.620> it's<00:00:51.949> not<00:00:52.010> exceptional

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
very good indeed it's not exceptional

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.270 
very good indeed it's not exceptional
but<00:00:52.910> it's<00:00:53.089> okay<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:54.409> is<00:00:54.559> supremely

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
but it's okay and it is supremely

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.340 
but it's okay and it is supremely
comfortable<00:00:56.179> behind<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.600> wheel<00:00:56.809> everything

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
comfortable behind the wheel everything

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.529 
comfortable behind the wheel everything
falls<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.829> hand<00:00:58.010> easily<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.579> really<00:00:59.300> really

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
falls to hand easily and really really

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.389 
falls to hand easily and really really
comfortable<00:01:00.109> seats<00:01:00.350> best<00:01:00.620> I've<00:01:00.800> sat<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.190> for<00:01:01.339> a

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
comfortable seats best I've sat in for a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.660 
comfortable seats best I've sat in for a
very<00:01:01.640> long<00:01:01.850> time<00:01:02.769> it's<00:01:03.769> also<00:01:04.009> remarkably

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
very long time it's also remarkably

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.359 
very long time it's also remarkably
quiet<00:01:05.030> especially<00:01:05.360> at<00:01:05.750> motorway<00:01:06.110> speeds

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
quiet especially at motorway speeds

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.680 
quiet especially at motorway speeds
partly<00:01:07.369> because<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.789> engine<00:01:08.119> is<00:01:08.149> only<00:01:08.330> doing

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
partly because the engine is only doing

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.990 
partly because the engine is only doing
less<00:01:09.140> than<00:01:09.170> two<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.710> half<00:01:09.860> thousand<00:01:10.340> rpm<00:01:10.460> at

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
less than two and a half thousand rpm at

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.630 
less than two and a half thousand rpm at
70<00:01:11.509> but<00:01:11.960> also<00:01:12.110> because<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:13.009> new<00:01:13.250> diesel

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
70 but also because this new diesel

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.880 
70 but also because this new diesel
engine<00:01:14.000> really<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.840> very<00:01:14.990> very<00:01:15.289> refined

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
engine really is very very refined

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.889 
engine really is very very refined
probably<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.640> quietest<00:01:16.820> diesel<00:01:17.450> I've<00:01:17.600> known

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
probably the quietest diesel I've known

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.410 
probably the quietest diesel I've known
and<00:01:18.140> Citroen<00:01:18.920> say<00:01:19.220> that<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.909> is<00:01:20.090> actually

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
and Citroen say that this is actually

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.660 
and Citroen say that this is actually
quieter<00:01:20.990> than<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.470> petrol<00:01:21.920> engines<00:01:22.310> ara

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
quieter than the petrol engines ara

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.139 
quieter than the petrol engines ara
models<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:24.500> usual<00:01:24.920> criticism<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.789> diesel

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
models the usual criticism of a diesel

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.510 
models the usual criticism of a diesel
engine<00:01:26.479> car<00:01:26.750> like<00:01:27.080> this<00:01:27.319> is<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.619> although

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
engine car like this is that although

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.609 
engine car like this is that although
there<00:01:28.789> is<00:01:28.909> plenty<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.420> power<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.080> torque

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
there is plenty of power and torque

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.699 
there is plenty of power and torque
available<00:01:31.299> it<00:01:32.299> all<00:01:32.539> comes<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.110> very<00:01:33.319> narrow

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
available it all comes in a very narrow

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.029 
available it all comes in a very narrow
range<00:01:34.039> of<00:01:34.759> revs<00:01:35.140> now<00:01:36.140> although<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.649> means

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
range of revs now although that means

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.980 
range of revs now although that means
that<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.280> get<00:01:37.429> lots<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.819> grunt<00:01:38.179> low<00:01:38.450> down<00:01:38.750> so

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
that you get lots of grunt low down so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.690 
that you get lots of grunt low down so
you<00:01:39.080> don't<00:01:39.110> have<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.560> thrash<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.069> thing<00:01:40.250> to

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
you don't have to thrash the thing to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.820 
you don't have to thrash the thing to
get<00:01:40.880> anywhere<00:01:41.299> it<00:01:41.899> also<00:01:42.170> means<00:01:42.679> that

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
get anywhere it also means that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.620 
get anywhere it also means that
sometimes<00:01:43.459> for<00:01:43.970> example<00:01:44.030> when<00:01:44.479> you're

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
sometimes for example when you're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.960 
sometimes for example when you're
overtaking<00:01:45.319> you<00:01:45.770> kind<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.100> run<00:01:46.340> out<00:01:46.459> of<00:01:46.490> engine

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
overtaking you kind of run out of engine

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.430 
overtaking you kind of run out of engine
and<00:01:47.119> you're<00:01:47.209> forced<00:01:47.569> into<00:01:47.690> making<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.229> gear

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
and you're forced into making a gear

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.139 
and you're forced into making a gear
change<00:01:48.470> just<00:01:49.369> when<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.610> really<00:01:49.819> don't<00:01:50.000> want

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
change just when you really don't want

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.499 
change just when you really don't want
to<00:01:50.209> make<00:01:50.360> one<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.920> engine<00:01:52.459> cures<00:01:53.060> that

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
to make one this engine cures that

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.200 
to make one this engine cures that
