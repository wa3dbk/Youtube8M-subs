for<00:00:09.960> video<00:00:10.170> when<00:00:10.410> i<00:00:10.440> should<00:00:10.559> i<00:00:10.679> move<00:00:10.800> my

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
for video when i should i move my

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.280 
for video when i should i move my
goalkeeper<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.429> sprint<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:12.030> brackets<00:00:12.690> RT<00:00:13.080> or

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
goalkeeper with sprint in brackets RT or

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.270 
goalkeeper with sprint in brackets RT or
when<00:00:13.410> should<00:00:13.559> i<00:00:13.590> moving<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.040> slower

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
when should i moving with slower

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430 
when should i moving with slower
movement<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.389> holding<00:00:15.660> an<00:00:15.750> LT<00:00:16.080> button

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
movement which is holding an LT button

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.740 
movement which is holding an LT button
so<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.369> time<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.760> i<00:00:17.820> use<00:00:17.970> RT<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.510> don't

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
so the time that i use RT I don't

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.000 
so the time that i use RT I don't
actually<00:00:18.869> tend<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.320> use<00:00:19.470> sprinting<00:00:19.890> that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
actually tend to use sprinting that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.170 
actually tend to use sprinting that
often<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.490> I'm<00:00:20.640> trying<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> run<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
often and this I'm trying to run to a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.109 
often and this I'm trying to run to a
ball<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.449> clear<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.800> sometimes<00:00:23.039> use<00:00:23.310> LT

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
ball to clear it and I sometimes use LT

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.790 
ball to clear it and I sometimes use LT
to<00:00:24.300> actually<00:00:24.570> manually<00:00:24.930> position<00:00:25.350> myself<00:00:25.439> for

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to actually manually position myself for

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.099 
to actually manually position myself for
shots<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.640> obviously<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> lb<00:00:27.390> button<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
shots but obviously the lb button is the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.050 
shots but obviously the lb button is the
one<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.439> used<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.800> position<00:00:28.920> itself<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
one that used to position itself but I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.930 
one that used to position itself but I
find<00:00:30.300> LT<00:00:30.720> does<00:00:30.990> work<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.260> well<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:31.980> well<00:00:32.279> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
find LT does work really well as well so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.220 
find LT does work really well as well so
if<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> try<00:00:33.450> doing<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.989> longer

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
if you want to try doing that for longer

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
if you want to try doing that for longer
shots<00:00:34.410> using<00:00:34.590> LT<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.130> position<00:00:35.430> yourself<00:00:35.760> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
shots using LT to position yourself it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
shots using LT to position yourself it
won't<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.899> bigger<00:00:37.200> movement<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.739> keep<00:00:37.920> your

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
won't do as bigger movement so keep your

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.410 
won't do as bigger movement so keep your
goalie<00:00:38.250> facing<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> ball<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.149> won't<00:00:39.329> make

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
goalie facing the ball we won't make

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.580 
goalie facing the ball we won't make
them<00:00:39.540> turn<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> start<00:00:40.379> running

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
them turn around when you start running

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860

sprinting to the back post and then just

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.800 
sprinting to the back post and then just

the face using the sprint button and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.020 
the face using the sprint button and

phase now I believe I have experimented
with<00:02:29.370> other<00:02:29.520> whether<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> builds<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.480> well

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
with other whether the builds as well

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.920 
with other whether the builds as well
but<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.060> listing<00:02:33.510> through<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.780> is

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
but it just listing through this is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
but it just listing through this is
probably<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> best<00:02:34.470> one<00:02:34.740> for<00:02:34.800> me<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.610> don't

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the top corner short so I can get down

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.570 
the top corner short so I can get down
to<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.500> low<00:02:55.590> shot<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.130> can<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> pass

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
to the low shot so I can get to pass

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.729 
to the low shot so I can get to pass
across<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.820> faces<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.500> find<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
across the faces and I just find that

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.430 
across the faces and I just find that
everything<00:02:59.070> works<00:02:59.280> using<00:02:59.520> six<00:02:59.880> before<00:03:00.440> and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
everything works using six before and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.780 
everything works using six before and
that's<00:03:01.860> pretty<00:03:01.950> much<00:03:02.040> all<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> questions<00:03:02.700> to
