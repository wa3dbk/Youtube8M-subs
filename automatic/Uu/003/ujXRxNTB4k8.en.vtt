00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:32.699 

I'm<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:22.870> gonna<00:02:23.050> seal<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.290> up

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.380 

so<00:02:33.709> this<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.220> trick<00:02:34.459> these<00:02:34.819> little<00:02:35.090> clips

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so this is the trick these little clips

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.089 
so this is the trick these little clips
you<00:02:35.690> start<00:02:35.959> at<00:02:36.050> one<00:02:36.080> end<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> finish<00:02:36.980> at

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
you start at one end and you finish at

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.500 
you start at one end and you finish at
the<00:02:37.220> other<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.760> ensure<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.239> it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
the other so you can ensure that it's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:03:00.630 
the other so you can ensure that it's
totally<00:02:39.019> sealed<00:02:57.910> all<00:02:58.910> right<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.299> sealed

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
totally sealed all right it's sealed

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.800 
totally sealed all right it's sealed
this<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.489> now<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.760> it's<00:03:05.060> in<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.269> bag<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.720> can

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
this so now that it's in the bag I can

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.300 
this so now that it's in the bag I can
actually<00:03:06.049> put<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.530> anywhere<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.160> my

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
actually put this anywhere in my

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.370 
actually put this anywhere in my
refrigerator<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.420> you'll<00:03:08.750> want<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:08.959> flip<00:03:09.230> it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
refrigerator and you'll want to flip it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.800 
refrigerator and you'll want to flip it
about<00:03:09.650> once<00:03:10.130> or<00:03:10.310> twice<00:03:10.370> within<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> 24<00:03:11.540> hours

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
about once or twice within the 24 hours

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.960 
about once or twice within the 24 hours
then<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.079> can<00:03:12.200> stay<00:03:12.380> in<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> fridge<00:03:12.970> you're

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970

then it can stay in the fridge you're
short<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.329> time<00:03:14.569> or<00:03:14.810> space<00:03:15.140> dry<00:03:15.650> burning<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.130> a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
short on time or space dry burning is a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.350 
short on time or space dry burning is a
great<00:03:16.579> option

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360
