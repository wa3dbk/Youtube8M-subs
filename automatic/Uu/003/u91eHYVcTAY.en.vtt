really I mean I think we play well we
probably<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.920> enough<00:00:26.010> chances<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.670> kill<00:00:27.150> up

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
again they have dependently as well that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320 
again they have dependently as well that
he<00:00:28.830> could<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> change<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> course<00:00:30.210> of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
