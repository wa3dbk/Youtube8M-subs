guide I'm going to be leaving a

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.589 
guide I'm going to be leaving a
description<00:01:59.550> at<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.880> end<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.179> video<00:02:00.300> and

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
description at the end of the video and

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.300 
description at the end of the video and
the<00:02:00.660> annotation<00:02:01.289> thing<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:02.069> you<00:02:02.160> guys<00:02:02.250> can

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the annotation thing so you guys can

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.309 
the annotation thing so you guys can
check<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.599> skip<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.110> part

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
check that out and just skip to the part

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.410 
check that out and just skip to the part
where<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.800> talking<00:02:05.250> about<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.970> pet<00:02:06.149> attack

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
where I'm talking about the pet attack

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.839 
where I'm talking about the pet attack
macros<00:02:06.899> you're<00:02:07.440> going<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.890> how<00:02:08.369> much<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.759> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
macros you're going to see how much of a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.850 
macros you're going to see how much of a
difference<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.509> makes<00:02:09.780> when<00:02:10.050> switching

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
difference it makes when switching

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.670 
difference it makes when switching
targets<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.000> basically<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:12.930> macro<00:02:13.500> your

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
targets so basically it just macro your

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
targets so basically it just macro your
abilities<00:02:14.130> with<00:02:14.490> /<00:02:14.760> pet<00:02:15.030> attack<00:02:15.300> make<00:02:15.599> sure

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
abilities with / pet attack make sure

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.260 
abilities with / pet attack make sure
its<00:02:15.930> first<00:02:16.260> or<00:02:16.620> else<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.920> won't<00:02:17.099> work

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
its first or else it won't work

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.460 
its first or else it won't work
all<00:02:19.270> right<00:02:19.390> guys<00:02:19.510> let's<00:02:19.690> do<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> quick<00:02:20.080> example

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
all right guys let's do a quick example

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.199 
all right guys let's do a quick example
really<00:02:20.800> quick<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.580> I'm<00:02:21.849> going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.120> have

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
really quick so I'm going to have

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.780 
really quick so I'm going to have
someone<00:02:22.420> invokes<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.110> right<00:02:23.379> now<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.860> i'm

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
someone invokes one right now and i'm

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.309 
someone invokes one right now and i'm
going<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.209> start<00:02:25.420> switching<00:02:25.720> targets

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
going to start switching targets

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.350 
going to start switching targets
constantly<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.489> see<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.030> fast

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
constantly you can see what a fast

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.559 
constantly you can see what a fast
response<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.140> switching<00:02:29.709> targets<00:02:30.099> now<00:02:30.910> i'm

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
response it is switching targets now i'm

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.759 
response it is switching targets now i'm
going<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> give<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:31.930> guys<00:02:32.170> an<00:02:32.319> example<00:02:32.379> right

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
going to give you guys an example right

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.660 
going to give you guys an example right
after<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.870> me<00:02:34.870> not<00:02:35.050> using<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.830> pet

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
after this of me not using the pet

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.330 
after this of me not using the pet
attack<00:02:36.940> macros<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:37.930> i<00:02:37.959> would<00:02:38.170> still<00:02:38.349> urge<00:02:38.860> you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
attack macros but i would still urge you

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.339 
attack macros but i would still urge you
guys<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.550> check<00:02:40.000> out<00:02:40.150> my<00:02:40.360> geeky<00:02:40.750> macro<00:02:41.110> video

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
guys to check out my geeky macro video

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.960 
guys to check out my geeky macro video
at<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.620> end<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> video<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:42.670> skip<00:02:42.940> to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
at the end of the video and just skip to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.190 
at the end of the video and just skip to
that<00:02:43.090> part<00:02:43.209> because<00:02:43.630> should<00:02:43.720> probably<00:02:44.080> give

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
that part because should probably give

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.690 
that part because should probably give
you<00:02:44.230> guys<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> better<00:02:44.860> understanding<00:02:45.580> about

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
you guys a better understanding about

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
you guys a better understanding about
how<00:02:46.510> responsive<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:48.239> now<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.540> what

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
how responsive this is now this is what

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.630 
how responsive this is now this is what
happens<00:02:50.080> when<00:02:50.200> i<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:50.560> not<00:02:50.830> use<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.190> macros

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
happens when i do not use the macros

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.270 
happens when i do not use the macros
watch<00:02:51.880> how<00:02:52.060> slow<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:53.049> one<00:02:53.290> takes<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
watch how slow this one takes to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.120 
watch how slow this one takes to
actually<00:02:54.849> switch<00:02:55.510> targets<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:56.860> about<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
actually switch targets it's about a

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.539 
actually switch targets it's about a
five<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.910> 10<00:02:58.180> second<00:02:58.660> delay<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:59.769> I<00:03:00.099> would<00:03:00.310> use

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
five to 10 second delay so I would use

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.830 
five to 10 second delay so I would use
these<00:03:00.670> macros<00:03:01.090> guides<00:03:01.329> are<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.690> help

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
these macros guides are going to help

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.630 
these macros guides are going to help
you<00:03:01.930> out<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.410> much<00:03:02.680> that's<00:03:03.069> why<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.250> was<00:03:03.400> so

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640

excited<00:03:03.790> about<00:03:04.269> how<00:03:04.930> Blizzard<00:03:05.290> added<00:03:05.680> an

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
excited about how Blizzard added an

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:18.690 
excited about how Blizzard added an
attack<00:03:06.099> bar<00:03:06.400> function<00:03:06.880> just<00:03:07.150> one<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
attack bar function just one that

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.600 
attack bar function just one that
basically<00:03:18.910> concludes<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.989> kind<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.680> 5.4

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
basically concludes the kind of 5.4

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.069 
basically concludes the kind of 5.4
invokes<00:03:22.030> one<00:03:22.389> little<00:03:23.109> guide<00:03:23.410> thing<00:03:24.269> but<00:03:25.269> again

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079
