now typically i won't review a Star Wars
figure<00:00:10.620> because<00:00:10.830> just<00:00:10.980> because<00:00:11.070> most<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
figure because just because most of the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.299 
figure because just because most of the
time<00:00:11.759> they're<00:00:12.509> pretty<00:00:12.750> generic<00:00:13.049> looking<00:00:13.309> but

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
time they're pretty generic looking but

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.709 
time they're pretty generic looking but
there<00:00:14.429> are<00:00:14.519> special<00:00:14.880> ones<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.450> like

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
there are special ones that really like

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.140 
there are special ones that really like
that<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.199> will<00:00:16.379> review<00:00:16.730> this<00:00:17.730> being<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> case

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
that I will review this being the case

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.890

with flow kun typically a favor the you

know the Marvel Legends toy biz or the
sigma<00:00:24.900> six<00:00:25.109> figures<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.430> six<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
sigma six figures you know the six to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.470 
sigma six figures you know the six to
eight<00:00:27.240> inch<00:00:27.949> figures<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.609> mean<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> there

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
eight inch figures but I mean the there

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.999 
eight inch figures but I mean the there
occasionally<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
occasionally are some that are on the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
occasionally are some that are on the
smaller<00:00:32.250> scale<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.390> like

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
smaller scale that you really do like

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
smaller scale that you really do like
and<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.870> happens<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> them<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and this happens to be one of them so

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.889 
and this happens to be one of them so
one<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> first<00:00:36.210> thing<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.540> noticed<00:00:36.809> about

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
one of the first thing I noticed about

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
one of the first thing I noticed about
this<00:00:37.260> figure<00:00:37.620> as<00:00:37.770> soon<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.040> took<00:00:38.100> him<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
this figure as soon as I took him out of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.670 
this figure as soon as I took him out of
his<00:00:38.790> packaging<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.200> lack<00:00:40.649> of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
his packaging was the lack of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
his packaging was the lack of
articulation<00:00:41.460> points<00:00:41.809> we'll<00:00:42.809> take<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> look<00:00:43.140> at

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
articulation points we'll take a look at

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
articulation points we'll take a look at
that<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.770> second<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.820> first<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that in a second but first have a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.139 
that in a second but first have a
close-up<00:00:45.840> look<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> figure<00:00:46.920> itself<00:00:47.149> nice

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
close-up look at the figure itself nice

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.029 
close-up look at the figure itself nice
headsculpt<00:00:48.570> nice<00:00:49.140> paint<00:00:49.469> applications

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
headsculpt nice paint applications

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189 
headsculpt nice paint applications
really<00:00:50.969> don't<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.660> paint<00:00:52.079> issues

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
really don't see a lot of paint issues

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
really don't see a lot of paint issues
the<00:00:52.890> only<00:00:53.070> issues<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.370> i<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.699> are<00:00:54.030> maybe

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the only issues that i can see are maybe

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.020 
the only issues that i can see are maybe
on<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> where<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.190> elbow<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> can

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
on the where the elbow is here you can

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.959 
on the where the elbow is here you can
see<00:00:57.149> there's<00:00:57.329> some<00:00:58.309> white<00:00:59.309> paint<00:00:59.550> whether<00:00:59.850> it

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
see there's some white paint whether it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
see there's some white paint whether it
should<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.329> kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> maroon<00:01:01.440> color<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
should be kind of a maroon color and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.889 
should be kind of a maroon color and
there's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.120> sloppiness<00:01:03.600> as

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
there's a little bit of sloppiness as

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.399 
there's a little bit of sloppiness as
far<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.880> where<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> white<00:01:06.240> goes<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
far as the where the white goes and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
far as the where the white goes and
transfers<00:01:07.799> into<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.280> maroon<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.540> other<00:01:09.750> than

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
transfers into the maroon but other than

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.050 
transfers into the maroon but other than
that<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.260> nice<00:01:10.619> paint<00:01:11.060> applications

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
honest out of here not really hands but

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.240 
honest out of here not really hands but
a<00:01:48.479> swivel<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.500> only<00:01:49.680> swivels<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.159> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
a swivel and it only swivels in this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.630 
a swivel and it only swivels in this
direction<00:01:50.659> no<00:01:51.799> knee<00:01:52.799> articulation

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.800 
whatsoever and no ankle articulation so
it<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:57.000> problematic<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it can be a little bit problematic to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
it can be a little bit problematic to
stand<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.229> times<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.659> in<00:02:00.659> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
stand at times but it can be in a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.539 
stand at times but it can be in a
standing<00:02:01.020> position<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.530> his<00:02:01.680> own<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:02.490> a

standing position on his own just a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.859 
standing position on his own just a
little<00:02:02.700> bit<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.000> finicky<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
little bit more finicky because you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.700 
little bit more finicky because you
don't<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.369> knee<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:05.610> ankle<00:02:05.670> articulation<00:02:06.710> as

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
don't have knee or ankle articulation as

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.839 
don't have knee or ankle articulation as
far<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:07.920> accessories<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.459> gets<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.700> little

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
far as accessories he gets this little

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.540 
far as accessories he gets this little
nice<00:02:09.209> little<00:02:09.239> uh<00:02:09.629> hood<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.860> slip<00:02:11.069> over<00:02:11.220> his

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
nice little uh hood and slip over his

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.290 
nice little uh hood and slip over his
head<00:02:11.879> like<00:02:12.300> that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
head like that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.200 
head like that
and<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:16.380> course<00:02:16.500> he<00:02:16.740> has<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.340> two<00:02:17.520> standard

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
and of course he has the two standard

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.820 
and of course he has the two standard
lightsabers<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:18.900> they're<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:19.350> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
lightsabers but they're actually of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
lightsabers but they're actually of
different<00:02:20.220> lengths<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.180> one's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
different lengths as you can see one's

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.420 
different lengths as you can see one's
shorter<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.930> other<00:02:21.960> one<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.010> I've

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
shorter than the other one and I've

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.040 
shorter than the other one and I've
noticed<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.790> his<00:02:24.060> right<00:02:24.570> hand<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.960> little

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
noticed that his right hand is a little

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.600 
noticed that his right hand is a little
tighter<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.980> hold<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.250> little<00:02:26.340> more

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
tighter so you can hold a little more

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.170 
tighter so you can hold a little more
firmly<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:28.500> his<00:02:28.800> right<00:02:29.070> hand<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.610> little<00:02:30.060> more

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
firmly in his right hand a little more

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.680 
firmly in his right hand a little more
solid<00:02:30.390> grip<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.410> also<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:33.030> him

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
solid grip but you can also have him

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.990 
solid grip but you can also have him
pulled<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.050> other<00:02:34.260> blade<00:02:34.650> or<00:02:34.980> saber<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.820> guess

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
pulled the other blade or saber I guess

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.640 
pulled the other blade or saber I guess
you'd<00:02:36.150> say<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.350> other<00:02:37.470> hands<00:02:37.710> like<00:02:38.100> that

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
you'd say and the other hands like that

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.010 
you'd say and the other hands like that
now<00:02:40.650> he<00:02:40.710> does<00:02:41.250> get<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.570> gauntlet<00:02:42.570> lightsabre

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
now he does get the gauntlet lightsabre

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.290 
now he does get the gauntlet lightsabre
and<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:44.000> clips<00:02:45.000> over<00:02:45.270> his<00:02:45.450> forearm<00:02:47.300> like

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and this clips over his forearm like

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.280 
and this clips over his forearm like
that<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.150> already<00:02:51.690> for<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:53.690> very<00:02:54.690> fast

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that so there is already for a very fast

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.360 
that so there is already for a very fast
and<00:02:55.560> furious<00:02:56.100> lightsaber<00:02:56.790> battle<00:02:57.180> uh<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:59.220> a

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and furious lightsaber battle uh it's a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.570 
and furious lightsaber battle uh it's a
nice<00:02:59.550> figure<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.650> was<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.770> surprised<00:03:02.190> about

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
nice figure I was just surprised about

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.420 
nice figure I was just surprised about
the<00:03:02.959> articulation<00:03:03.959> or<00:03:04.170> lack<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.500> articulation

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
the articulation or lack of articulation

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.350 
the articulation or lack of articulation
in<00:03:05.520> certain<00:03:05.790> points<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.820> say<00:03:09.090> their

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
in certain points but like I say their

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.440 
in certain points but like I say their
