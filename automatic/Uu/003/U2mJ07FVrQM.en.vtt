 she is located transmit something 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.859
 when I believe that the chef at kinect a 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.759
 a percent creation 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.029
 at the end of the year 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:15.139
 I think we are really in the exchanger m time in a 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.509
 style always a vehicle from me too 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.509
 the power to meet him percent and the dancers 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.659
 it is the great privilege besides of the other 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.400
 the job here is a job not 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.439
 it is to be in this exchange of power to find together 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.399
 the true value finally of 2 separate from the body and growth 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.830
 in europe we know very well that the danÃ§a absolute 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.460
 this universal side is a universal language that can be understood the park 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.730
 everybody 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.570
 the movement continues 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.489
 just a month ago I carry the classic vocabulary is my axis 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.190
 main read then I use for what I would call the sensitivity the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.690
 same day today the strings today 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.290
 percent of our company jc to find this gateway with them 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.480
 with the questions if who are who we are at sex today's 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.790
 not just 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.180
 the same day German museums 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.750
 hen the ballet is gone 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 only an entertainment 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.180
 in 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.440
 for one hundred years 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 the world 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.530
 the body of his son 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.450
 but I think the body has changed since 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.909
 blois very well through for example the same dance material it depends 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.870
 interpreters 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.340
 day 3 effectively to the notion of creating an interpreter 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.100
 and you today today it is clear that we do not think 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.569
 the software start five years ago 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.979
 but not give an example in these mirages serge lifar mean little 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.330
 almost 22 years 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.580
 for the giro dance two years ago it was a novella pontois it was 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.350
 definition 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.110
 two stars of the paris opera and it is clear that yann maturing it is 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.260
 clear that he was no longer the same either 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.600
 is that for the bodies are not the same 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.740
 then we can not go home too 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.050
 while our society 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.790
 for the time being engaged too 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.029
 fins 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.190
 resonance duration of 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.870
 of thought and mentality and two engines of time that makes that body 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.870
 human can say to himself left the mayor 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.309
 from here the exit from behind 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.989
 it's always the story of the content I think that really needs a conflict that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:48.969
 to justify oneself 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.599
 I've already found myself on stage in the context of replay 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.529
 jpl of the same sex 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.499
 so what to count is something that is really driven justified I think 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.029
 we can start dreaming 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.029
 in every sense of the term 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.129
 I think it's always a little bit the subject you finally put 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.739
 there in five and that leads to maybe using things that become them 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.939
 more virulent 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.669
 our society also sometimes also need people like that very closely 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.669
 The registers 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.529
 she counts 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:28.869
 at this moment it is a progression the market is happiness 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.619
 by common agreement 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.720
 the ofac each time and sings vere and nanette glushak 1 edonkey 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.720
 the title of the ballet elsewhere and the title of the evening 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.450
 the judge hothry the theme of the property 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.980
 the link between beings and I made a proposal of the first ballet that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.090
 is called a table we could imagine a kind of cannibalism 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.649
 domestic 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:50.549
 back from this table 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.999
 e with the quartet's music at number eight opus on chostakovich's dance 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.999
 create very expressive and spectacular and very virulent music 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.119
 this is the first ballet 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.879
 then a creation for truly 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.059
 the cx-7 and manou love for his stories of a symbolic couple 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.379
 represented by three couples 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.089
 and who finally revisits three hectares which are those of the youth 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:14.010
 of adulthood 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.329
 and the holy war 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.030
 and on his iphone without sinister on stage 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.470
 to find out more 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.380
 and then that the mutation of monique guiraud roof silence of the opera of 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.159
 Paris 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.449
 who finally wanted to accompany me poor the Moorish pavane 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.940
 it's a ballet we'll say since the mythical team 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.220
 and there too not a little the goal is to try to know how 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.650
 did she sweep such a legend it's othello 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.710
 % and everyone can in today's day try to 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.469
 update of the year in a hit version 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.430
 in the harbor of now what with that ourselves 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.529
 and it ends up developing some that m 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.529
 lupus recognize however that it has already been 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:07.789
 the 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.789
 % 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.710
 let's go to 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.749
 no 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.210
 saha 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.300
 then to do 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.480
 it's not that old 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.020
 if a judge wants to capture that path I think it's a story all to 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.440
 does the staff 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.980
 I'm the retiree we're going to say Paris Opera for about one 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.630
 year and a half I made a total break I have not in this part so much during 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.229
 a year which is equivalent to climbing 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.220
 it was pretty violent and finally you can not stop we're going to say 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.369
 the shovel 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:17.069
 four interiors finally to a rediscovery to what I am so 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.860
 choreographer eq have given I go by myself to be able to try to 

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:24.999
 find the gesture where the choreographic helpers and so you have to be 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.709
 forced to be afraid of an agreement that can be the most mobile more untied 

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:32.089
 so I chose other ways finally people even the body 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:37.359
 by the yoga system and it's true that here I understand what does the 

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:40.899
 job what you have left this baggage I understand what it means also the 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.899
 absolutely incredible body memory 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.120
 it is true that I am at the base of classical training but I have a lot 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.550
 worked too I'm very familiar with the dead contemporary dance that 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.050
 fact that i can mad hatter quite easily follow different styles 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.440
 the south of the island 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.420
 but that's a bit of the proposal I would like to make with ballet 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.610
 of the capitol of Toulouse 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.930
 stopped finally opening up the choice a little bit of body spirit 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.930
 to go to the other 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.830
 Ben Ali 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:27.139
 here is a time 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.139
 at 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:40.680
 problem
