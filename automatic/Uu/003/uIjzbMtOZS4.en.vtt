over the last couple years have been
Anaheim<00:01:38.220> LA<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.460> even<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
Anaheim LA and it's it's not even on the

Anaheim LA and it's it's not even on the
same<00:01:42.090> radar<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.710> big-time

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
same radar as this one this is big-time

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.760 
same radar as this one this is big-time
this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.090> rough<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> tough<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
this is this is rough and tough as it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
this is this is rough and tough as it
gets<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
gets and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
gets and
I'm<00:01:49.380> much<00:01:49.710> fun<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
I'm much fun with this be if this was a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.209 
I'm much fun with this be if this was a
playoff<00:01:51.270> series<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:52.289> would<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.710> great

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
playoff series it would be great

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.100 
playoff series it would be great
okay<00:01:53.549> first<00:01:53.850> key<00:01:54.060> moment<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> goal

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
okay first key moment is when the goal

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
okay first key moment is when the goal
gets<00:01:55.409> disallowed<00:01:55.860> by<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.039> referee<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.729> now

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
gets disallowed by the referee and now

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.279 
gets disallowed by the referee and now
they're<00:01:57.000> taking<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.329> really<00:01:57.630> long<00:01:57.780> time<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
they're taking a really long time on the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.569 
they're taking a really long time on the
review<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:58.770> were<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> guys<00:01:59.070> saying<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.490> the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.830 
bench I don't know I mean I was nervous
just<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.579> there<00:02:02.850> were<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.119> many<00:02:03.240> people

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
just because there were so many people

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
just because there were so many people
you<00:02:04.140> couldn't<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.530> tell<00:02:04.799> what's<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.490> on
