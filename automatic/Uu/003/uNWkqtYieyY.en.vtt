mechanical<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.190> suspension<00:03:38.880> seems<00:03:39.210> a<00:03:39.300> little

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
mechanical a suspension seems a little

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.590 
mechanical a suspension seems a little
bit<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.350> weak<00:03:40.650> side<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:41.240> you<00:03:42.240> can<00:03:42.390> feel

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
bit on the weak side here you can feel

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.040 
bit on the weak side here you can feel
absolutely<00:03:43.070> every<00:03:44.070> single<00:03:44.700> bump<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.930> I'm

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
absolutely every single bump and I'm

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.870 
absolutely every single bump and I'm
happy<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.350> it's<00:03:46.560> got<00:03:46.710> satellite<00:03:47.160> radio<00:03:47.580> but

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
happy that it's got satellite radio but

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.870 
happy that it's got satellite radio but
I'm<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.210> that<00:03:48.300> in<00:03:48.480> 10<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.930> really<00:03:49.230> necessary

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
I'm not that in 10 is really necessary

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.800 
I'm not that in 10 is really necessary
so<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:50.910> know<00:03:51.000> I've<00:03:51.150> gotten<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.450> trouble<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
so I know I've gotten in trouble in the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.540 
so I know I've gotten in trouble in the
past<00:03:51.990> for<00:03:52.350> doing<00:03:52.560> donuts<00:03:52.950> but<00:03:53.130> i<00:03:53.310> don't<00:03:53.490> know

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
past for doing donuts but i don't know

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.640 
past for doing donuts but i don't know
let's<00:03:53.700> give<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:53.970> another<00:03:54.120> shot<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.440> we<00:03:58.530> already

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
let's give it another shot so we already

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.280 
let's give it another shot so we already
took<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.980> look<00:03:59.160> at<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.790> green<00:04:00.150> sliced<00:04:00.810> apples

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
took a look at the green sliced apples

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.860 
took a look at the green sliced apples
but<00:04:01.920> green<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.340> not<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.700> only<00:04:02.730> colors<00:04:03.420> offered

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
but green is not the only colors offered

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.570 
but green is not the only colors offered
and<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.080> i<00:04:04.110> thought<00:04:04.320> i<00:04:04.530> would<00:04:04.590> pick<00:04:04.860> up<00:04:05.070> every

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
and so i thought i would pick up every

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.030 
and so i thought i would pick up every
color<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.600> these<00:04:06.840> are<00:04:07.020> available<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.800> to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
color that these are available and to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.990 
color that these are available and to
show<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.220> which<00:04:08.460> one<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.760> know<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.910> guys

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
show you which one you know you guys

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.970 
show you which one you know you guys
might<00:04:09.270> want<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.600> pick<00:04:09.690> up<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.440> here<00:04:10.740> we've<00:04:10.950> got

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
might want to pick up so here we've got

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.710 
might want to pick up so here we've got
yellow<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.790> can<00:04:11.910> see<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.090> differences<00:04:12.450> here

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
yellow you can see the differences here

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.160 
yellow you can see the differences here
between<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:14.100> two<00:04:14.400> it's<00:04:15.180> green<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.750> it's

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
between the two it's green and it's

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.560 
between the two it's green and it's
yellow<00:04:16.560> they<00:04:17.130> both<00:04:17.340> say<00:04:17.550> real<00:04:17.880> sliced<00:04:18.300> fruit

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
yellow they both say real sliced fruit

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.140 
yellow they both say real sliced fruit
this<00:04:18.750> one<00:04:18.930> says<00:04:19.200> Fuji<00:04:20.040> apple<00:04:20.430> slices<00:04:20.670> one<00:04:20.970> says

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
this one says Fuji apple slices one says

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.300 
this one says Fuji apple slices one says
pineapple<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:21.989> strawberry<00:04:22.770> slices<00:04:22.950> you're

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
pineapple and strawberry slices you're

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.740 
pineapple and strawberry slices you're
gonna<00:04:23.400> get<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.580> little<00:04:23.730> bit<00:04:23.820> more<00:04:23.940> variety<00:04:24.090> in

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
gonna get a little bit more variety in

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.410 
gonna get a little bit more variety in
each<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.160> for<00:04:26.340> real<00:04:26.370> quick<00:04:26.700> size<00:04:26.880> comparison

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
each so for real quick size comparison

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.920 
each so for real quick size comparison
here<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.230> next<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.040> iphone<00:04:29.850> 6<00:04:30.330> plus<00:04:30.420> i

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
here it is next to the iphone 6 plus i

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.230 
here it is next to the iphone 6 plus i
can<00:04:31.410> see<00:04:31.560> almost<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.010> same<00:04:32.220> length<00:04:32.550> but

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
can see almost the same length but

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.570 
can see almost the same length but
certainly<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.290> sliced<00:04:34.620> fruit<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.160> little

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
certainly the sliced fruit is a little

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.370 
certainly the sliced fruit is a little
bit<00:04:35.670> on<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.820> thicker<00:04:36.030> side<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:37.080> know<00:04:37.170> you'd

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
bit on the thicker side you know you'd

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.470 
bit on the thicker side you know you'd
figure<00:04:37.710> as<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:37.980> new<00:04:38.370> product<00:04:38.820> apple<00:04:39.090> try<00:04:39.330> and

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
figure as a new product apple try and

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.510 
figure as a new product apple try and
thin<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.750> down<00:04:39.870> but<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.770> does<00:04:40.980> have<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> fanless

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
thin it down but it does have a fanless

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.580 
thin it down but it does have a fanless
design<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.240> because<00:04:43.080> i<00:04:43.200> know<00:04:43.260> everybody's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
design and because i know everybody's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.170 
design and because i know everybody's
going<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.770> yell<00:04:44.010> at<00:04:44.040> me<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.340> didn't<00:04:44.730> bring<00:04:44.970> in

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
going to yell at me I didn't bring in

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.440 
going to yell at me I didn't bring in
any<00:04:45.390> Android<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.170> here<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.190> galaxy<00:04:47.730> s6<00:04:48.210> edge

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
any Android I here is the galaxy s6 edge

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.900 
any Android I here is the galaxy s6 edge
so<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.170> can<00:04:49.350> see<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.740> size<00:04:49.950> comparison<00:04:50.640> here

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
so you can see the size comparison here

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.060 
so you can see the size comparison here
between<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.480> two<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.470> we'll<00:04:52.590> put<00:04:52.740> this<00:04:52.860> right

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
between the two and we'll put this right

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.920 
between the two and we'll put this right
in<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.310> middle<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:53.790> we'll<00:04:53.970> make<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.180> make<00:04:54.900> a

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
in the middle so we'll make a make a

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.279 
in the middle so we'll make a make a
sandwich<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.620> speak<00:04:55.830> out<00:04:55.980> of<00:04:56.040> these<00:04:56.190> guys

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.349 

Oh
