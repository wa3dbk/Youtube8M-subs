down<00:01:39.410> there<00:01:39.890> trying<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.190> get<00:01:40.340> combos<00:01:40.850> or<00:01:41.150> even

down there trying to get combos or even

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.400 
down there trying to get combos or even
higher<00:01:41.600> scores<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:43.580> can<00:01:43.610> do<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.210> hint<00:01:44.510> if

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
higher scores you can do a hint if

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.030 
higher scores you can do a hint if
you're<00:01:45.560> stuck<00:01:45.860> like<00:01:46.070> I<00:01:46.340> was<00:01:46.550> two<00:01:48.040> more

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
you're stuck like I was two more

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.920 
you're stuck like I was two more
combinations<00:01:49.520> leads<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:52.390> more<00:01:53.390> high<00:01:53.660> power

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
combinations leads to more high power

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.010 
combinations leads to more high power
gems<00:01:54.350> which<00:01:54.710> will<00:01:54.860> lead<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.070> bigger<00:01:55.400> scores

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
gems which will lead to bigger scores

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.070 
gems which will lead to bigger scores
that's<00:01:57.020> essentially<00:01:57.820> classic<00:01:58.820> mode<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.840> on

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
that's essentially classic mode it's on

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.980 
that's essentially classic mode it's on
time<00:02:00.910> so<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.360> just<00:02:03.050> play<00:02:03.320> until<00:02:03.649> baseline

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
time so you can just play until baseline

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.180 
time so you can just play until baseline
diamond<00:02:05.990> mine<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.380> butterflies<00:02:06.830> these<00:02:07.070> are

diamond mine and butterflies these are

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.340 
diamond mine and butterflies these are
two<00:02:07.430> modes<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.820> we<00:02:07.970> created<00:02:08.350> specifically

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
two modes that we created specifically

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.240 
two modes that we created specifically
for<00:02:09.470> bejeweled<00:02:10.070> 3<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:12.320> now<00:02:12.620> but<00:02:12.830> you'll<00:02:12.980> live

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250

on Windows 8 here and I can tell you
that<00:02:18.410> these<00:02:18.650> are<00:02:18.709> two<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.310> most<00:02:19.400> popular

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
that these are two of the most popular

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.320 
that these are two of the most popular
modes<00:02:20.090> at<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.630> end<00:02:20.989> so<00:02:21.580> when<00:02:22.580> we<00:02:22.790> were<00:02:22.940> doing

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
modes at the end so when we were doing

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.850 
modes at the end so when we were doing
all<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.630> beta<00:02:23.810> testing<00:02:24.290> these<00:02:24.500> were<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.770> ones

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
all the beta testing these were the ones

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.600 
all the beta testing these were the ones
that<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.250> fill<00:02:25.489> up<00:02:25.760> with<00:02:25.910> right<00:02:26.630> away<00:02:27.400> now<00:02:28.400> this

see<00:03:24.860> I'm<00:03:25.010> thinking<00:03:25.220> lower<00:03:25.580> with<00:03:26.120> every<00:03:26.420> match

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
see I'm thinking lower with every match

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.240 
see I'm thinking lower with every match
the<00:03:27.470> ground<00:03:27.800> around<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.570> will<00:03:29.620> give<00:03:30.620> way<00:03:30.860> and

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
the ground around it will give way and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.690 
the ground around it will give way and
take<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.240> lower<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.459> get<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:34.580> there<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:36.610> need<00:03:37.610> to

take you lower so get in there I need to
clear<00:03:37.910> these<00:03:38.090> two<00:03:38.330> spots<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:39.050> have<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.950> game

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
clear these two spots to have the game

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.640 
clear these two spots to have the game
over<00:03:40.430> there's<00:03:40.670> one<00:03:40.940> two<00:03:41.840> all<00:03:42.170> right<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.560> I've

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
over there's one two all right so I've

over there's one two all right so I've
cleared<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.870> I've<00:03:44.870> now<00:03:45.110> gone<00:03:45.320> 20<00:03:45.769> feet<00:03:45.980> below

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
cleared that I've now gone 20 feet below

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.660 
cleared that I've now gone 20 feet below
the<00:03:46.310> ground<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.209> have<00:03:47.920> 49<00:03:48.920> seconds<00:03:49.489> and

to<00:03:50.330> get<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.630> this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
to get to this

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.870 
to get to this
next<00:03:51.970> white<00:03:52.180> line<00:03:52.420> now<00:03:53.020> this<00:03:53.140> will<00:03:53.350> go<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.880> long

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
next white line now this will go a long

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.720 
next white line now this will go a long
way<00:03:55.210> down<00:03:55.480> I'm<00:03:55.750> at<00:03:55.870> 20<00:03:56.170> feet<00:03:56.320> down<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.830> think<00:03:57.670> the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
way down I'm at 20 feet down I think the

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.290 
way down I'm at 20 feet down I think the
farthest<00:03:57.970> I've<00:03:58.210> ever<00:03:58.480> done<00:03:58.660> that's<00:03:58.960> about<00:04:00.300> 600

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
farthest I've ever done that's about 600

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.420 
farthest I've ever done that's about 600
feet<00:04:01.330> down<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:01.990> I<00:04:02.110> know<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.380> goes<00:04:02.530> way<00:04:02.920> deeper

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
feet down and I know it goes way deeper

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.560 
feet down and I know it goes way deeper
than<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.160> just<00:04:06.640> just<00:04:07.180> kind<00:04:07.330> of<00:04:07.450> de

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
than that so it just just kind of de

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.240 
than that so it just just kind of de
digging<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.110> exploring<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.800> finding<00:04:08.950> the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
digging and exploring and finding the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.390 
digging and exploring and finding the
treasures<00:04:10.020> has<00:04:11.020> an<00:04:11.170> own<00:04:11.320> appeal<00:04:11.740> I<00:04:12.040> think

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
treasures has an own appeal I think

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.090 
treasures has an own appeal I think
that's<00:04:12.700> why<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:12.940> was<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:13.180> popular<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:14.100> within

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
that's why it was so popular and within

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.860 
that's why it was so popular and within
the<00:04:15.970> pot<00:04:16.180> camp<00:04:16.390> offices<00:04:16.810> itself<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:21.870> think

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
the pot camp offices itself and I think

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.990 
the pot camp offices itself and I think
also<00:04:23.650> there's<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.070> whole<00:04:24.250> different<00:04:24.580> strategy

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
also there's a whole different strategy

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760 
also there's a whole different strategy
at<00:04:25.120> play<00:04:25.330> here<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.840> have<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.620> know<00:04:26.740> you

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
at play here you have to you know you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.910 
at play here you have to you know you
need<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.400> work<00:04:27.550> horizontally<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:29.470> get<00:04:29.680> all

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
need to work horizontally to get all

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.310 
need to work horizontally to get all
these<00:04:30.280> pieces<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.730> end<00:04:31.420> pieces<00:04:31.810> like<00:04:32.140> this

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
these pieces that end pieces like this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.410 
these pieces that end pieces like this
one<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.740> that'd<00:04:32.920> be<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.160> hardest<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.670> get<00:04:33.820> I'm

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
one and that'd be the hardest to get I'm

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.910

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
it rises higher when it gets to the top

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.790 
it rises higher when it gets to the top
if<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.060> spider<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.780> in<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.229> road<00:05:38.410> that<00:05:38.710> the
