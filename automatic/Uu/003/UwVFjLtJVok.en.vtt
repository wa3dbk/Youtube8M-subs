00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
always like to lower the presser foot

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.160 
always like to lower the presser foot
when<00:01:42.909> I'm<00:01:43.030> doing<00:01:43.329> this<00:01:43.450> because<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:43.960> see

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
when I'm doing this because I can see

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.109 
when I'm doing this because I can see
what<00:01:44.409> lines<00:01:44.740> show<00:01:45.159> through<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.609> presser<00:01:46.090> foot

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
what lines show through the presser foot

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.419 
what lines show through the presser foot
kind<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.929> where<00:01:48.359> and<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.619> once<00:01:50.859> you're<00:01:51.039> happy

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
kind of where and then once you're happy

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.819 
kind of where and then once you're happy
after<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.240> few<00:01:52.570> adjustments<00:01:53.289> of<00:01:53.439> where<00:01:53.649> the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
after a few adjustments of where the

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.310 
after a few adjustments of where the
words<00:01:54.009> gonna<00:01:54.189> be<00:01:54.340> placed<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:56.049> go<00:01:56.200> ahead

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
words gonna be placed you can go ahead

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.389 
words gonna be placed you can go ahead
and<00:01:56.619> stitch<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:56.920> out<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.740> one<00:01:59.950> thing<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.219> want<00:02:00.369> to

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
and stitch it out so one thing I want to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.929 
and stitch it out so one thing I want to
point<00:02:00.609> out<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:00.999> that<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.630> pretty<00:02:01.929> easy

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
point out is that this is a pretty easy

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.419 
point out is that this is a pretty easy
design<00:02:03.939> I<00:02:04.329> believe<00:02:04.710> horizontal<00:02:05.710> access<00:02:06.280> in

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
design I believe horizontal access in

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.419 
design I believe horizontal access in
general<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.110> lot<00:02:08.410> easier<00:02:08.830> especially<00:02:08.890> if

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
general is a lot easier especially if

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.839 
general is a lot easier especially if
you<00:02:09.580> have<00:02:09.700> word<00:02:09.940> groupings

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
you have word groupings

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.000 
you have word groupings
you're<00:02:12.180> usually<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.689> having<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.409> recoup<00:02:13.799> as

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you're usually not having to recoup as

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
you're usually not having to recoup as
much<00:02:17.359> if<00:02:18.359> I<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> need<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:19.890> multiple

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
much if I have a need to do multiple

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.679 
much if I have a need to do multiple
planes<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> horizontal<00:02:23.370> pattern<00:02:23.969> now<00:02:24.299> I'll

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
planes on a horizontal pattern now I'll

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.140 
planes on a horizontal pattern now I'll
certainly<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.469> a<00:02:25.500> video<00:02:25.859> but<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:27.030> gonna

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
certainly do a video but this is gonna

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the way is a three color design but I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.170 
the way is a three color design but I
did<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.680> twice<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.310> did<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.609> initial<00:03:03.030> one

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
did this twice I did the initial one

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.300 
did this twice I did the initial one
with<00:03:03.359> this<00:03:03.540> green<00:03:03.840> here<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.829> didn't<00:03:05.129> like

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
with this green here and I didn't like

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.539 
with this green here and I didn't like
the<00:03:05.519> color<00:03:05.549> scheme<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.739> what<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.189> see<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
the color scheme so what you see in the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.080 
the color scheme so what you see in the
beginning<00:03:08.819> of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> video<00:03:09.419> is<00:03:10.109> different<00:03:10.409> than

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
what you see it there what you see

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.039 
what you see it there what you see
during<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.980> video<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:15.269> then<00:03:15.750> there's<00:03:15.959> a

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
during the video and then there's a

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.939 
during the video and then there's a
close<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:16.470> at<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.829> end<00:03:16.949> but<00:03:18.709> we'll<00:03:19.709> go<00:03:19.829> ahead

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
close up at the end but we'll go ahead

close up at the end but we'll go ahead
and<00:03:20.129> stitch<00:03:20.489> through<00:03:20.819> this<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.329> once<00:03:21.659> you've

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
and stitch through this and once you've

I just wanted snug to my battlefield as

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.430 
I just wanted snug to my battlefield as
possible<00:03:28.739> without<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.250> bottom<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.819> F

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
possible without the bottom of the F

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.409

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
experimented a lot with that yet but I

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.520 
experimented a lot with that yet but I
probably<00:04:01.349> will<00:04:01.829> be<00:04:01.889> or<00:04:02.310> making<00:04:02.609> my<00:04:02.699> own<00:04:02.729> funds

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530

videos I try to get to all the comments
that<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.989> can

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
that I can

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.300 
that I can
there's<00:04:14.960> been<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> lot<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.500> them<00:04:15.740> lately<00:04:15.950> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
there's been a lot of them lately and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.420 
there's been a lot of them lately and
it's<00:04:16.459> hard<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> get<00:04:17.330> to<00:04:17.480> all<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.690> them<00:04:17.870> so

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
it's hard to get to all of them so

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.470 
it's hard to get to all of them so
basically<00:04:19.430> what<00:04:19.640> I've<00:04:19.730> been<00:04:19.850> doing<00:04:20.180> is

common reoccurring question and I don't
answer<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.790> it's<00:04:26.690> because<00:04:27.080> I'm<00:04:27.230> probably
