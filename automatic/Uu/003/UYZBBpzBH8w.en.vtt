00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
America feels tacked on there's no real

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.580 
America feels tacked on there's no real
sense<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.180> conflict<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.229> least<00:01:43.259> no

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
conflict worth investing in this could

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.510 
conflict worth investing in this could
be<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.350> stuck<00:01:46.619> too<00:01:46.829> closely<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
be because they stuck too closely to the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
be because they stuck too closely to the
source<00:01:47.759> material<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.450> understand<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.320> not

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
source material I understand that not

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
source material I understand that not
every<00:01:49.829> single<00:01:50.189> movie<00:01:50.520> character<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
every single movie character can be a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.210 
every single movie character can be a
ground<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.780> reworking<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> Mandarin

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
ground of reworking like the Mandarin

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.160 
ground of reworking like the Mandarin
but<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.149> feels<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> movie<00:01:55.020> was

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
but here it feels like the movie was

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
but here it feels like the movie was
just<00:01:55.409> slacking<00:01:55.860> off<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.670> real<00:01:56.850> problem

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
just slacking off but the real problem

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
just slacking off but the real problem
with<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> Winter<00:01:57.810> Soldier<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> never

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
with the Winter Soldier is that it never

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
with the Winter Soldier is that it never
goes<00:01:59.310> far<00:01:59.670> enough<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.180> any<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> its<00:02:00.719> aspects

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
goes far enough with any of its aspects

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.139 
goes far enough with any of its aspects
which<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.770> astonishing<00:02:02.130> considering<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
which is astonishing considering that

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
which is astonishing considering that
this<00:02:03.329> movie<00:02:03.689> clocks<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.229> almost<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.890> long

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
this movie clocks in at almost as long

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
this movie clocks in at almost as long
as<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> Avengers<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:06.600> when<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> movie

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
as the Avengers just when the movie

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.020 
as the Avengers just when the movie
threatens<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.829> become<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.429> interesting

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
threatens to become really interesting

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.210 
threatens to become really interesting
or<00:02:09.149> go<00:02:09.420> above<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.929> beyond<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.739> cuts<00:02:11.039> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
or go above and beyond it just cuts to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.520 
or go above and beyond it just cuts to
the<00:02:11.340> neck

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the neck

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.380 
the neck
see<00:02:11.770> there<00:02:12.250> are<00:02:12.370> great<00:02:12.610> scenes<00:02:12.910> early<00:02:13.270> on

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
see there are great scenes early on

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.180 
see there are great scenes early on
between<00:02:13.630> Steve<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.260> friend<00:02:14.530> from<00:02:14.590> his<00:02:14.860> past

between Steve and a friend from his past

between Steve and a friend from his past
but<00:02:15.610> it's<00:02:15.790> over<00:02:16.180> before<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.630> can<00:02:16.750> even<00:02:17.050> stars

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
but it's over before it can even stars

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.320 
but it's over before it can even stars
and<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:17.800> never<00:02:18.040> brought<00:02:18.340> up<00:02:18.370> again<00:02:18.819> there's

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
hidden depth to the Falcon because he is

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.699 
hidden depth to the Falcon because he is
part<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.640> PTSD<00:02:22.180> support<00:02:22.810> group<00:02:23.050> but<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.560> only

part of a PTSD support group but it only

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.949 
part of a PTSD support group but it only
gets<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.190> few<00:02:24.430> lines<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.819> dialogue<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.480> yeah

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
plays a SHIELD agent who seems like she

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.400 
plays a SHIELD agent who seems like she
would<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.580> really<00:02:30.760> important<00:02:31.330> at<00:02:31.450> first<00:02:31.720> but

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
would be really important at first but

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.190 
would be really important at first but
then<00:02:32.680> she<00:02:32.950> hardly<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:34.000> any<00:02:34.209> presence<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.050> the

then she hardly has any presence in the
film<00:02:35.470> she's<00:02:35.739> completely<00:02:36.250> pointless<00:02:36.580> she<00:02:37.060> adds

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
film she's completely pointless she adds

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.110 
film she's completely pointless she adds
nothing<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.260> movie<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.190> film<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.850> such

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
a freaking hurry to get from one plot

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.699 
a freaking hurry to get from one plot
point<00:02:42.940> from<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.420> scene<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.959> next<00:02:44.080> that

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
point from one scene to the next that

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.710 
point from one scene to the next that
it's<00:02:44.890> difficult<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.550> feel<00:02:45.730> committed<00:02:46.180> to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
it's difficult to feel committed to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.810 
it's difficult to feel committed to
what's<00:02:46.930> happening<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:48.070> movie<00:02:48.459> has<00:02:48.670> an

what's happening if this movie has an

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.180 
what's happening if this movie has an
extended<00:02:49.360> director's<00:02:49.870> cut<00:02:50.110> then<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.709> would<00:02:50.950> pay

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
extended director's cut then I would pay

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.280 
extended director's cut then I would pay
good<00:02:51.220> money<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.940> see<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.390> because<00:02:52.900> Captain

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
good money to see it because Captain

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.170 
good money to see it because Captain
America<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.739> Winter<00:02:53.860> Soldier<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> good

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
America the Winter Soldier is a good

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180 
America the Winter Soldier is a good
movie<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:56.230> feels<00:02:56.410> like<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.890> there<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
movie but it feels like that there is a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.100 
movie but it feels like that there is a
great<00:02:57.580> one<00:02:57.819> trying<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.300> burst<00:02:58.569> through<00:02:58.930> the

great one trying to burst through the
seams<00:02:59.380> another<00:03:00.280> problem<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.180> plays

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
seams another problem is that it plays

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.180 
seams another problem is that it plays
the<00:03:01.420> shoutouts<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.230> previous<00:03:02.620> movies<00:03:02.980> more
