00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.730
 to the most important network 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.289
 r 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.490
 people 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.240
 If not reported that everything would 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.240
 hooked there 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.010
 in the preseason of elm used 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.809
 unusual methods to stimulate the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.809
 team game between his players 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.780
 we have the option of one with the hand and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.670
 another will pass with the foot if you do it is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.230
 crazy if you do not go with american but 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.660
 we do not look for equipment that has the 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.370
 reaction sometimes comes a pass and what 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.350
 we give wrong because we are not concentrated 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.250
 let's keep trying many things 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.250
 of more the temporary career 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.090
 and you say what's up with this do not play this 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.250
 for three they started being very bad 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.240
 then they were accommodating when the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.320
 idea is that the three also 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.430
 communicate let's go to the right 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.430
 ultraleft hit him 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.110
 the pre-season stage very strong and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.650
 the muscles contract a lot then 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.650
 It is important 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.510
 we have fun with anything like 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.510
 the preseason is long 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.240
 equally the transvestite gained mobility 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.410
 of the forwards and the pass the pass 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.319
 precise that we have to give to them 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.550
 we are important that we already started 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:02.630
 to give us because the work has been 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.630
 heavy is also important to handle 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.330
 when 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.330
 in acapulco that of many 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 Y 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.420
 he does not realize and for someone he is 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.370
 really important to be able to get a 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.890
 photo many times the fact of being 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.300
 tired of arriving from a triple session and 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.370
 the truth that I did not even want to 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.349
 get up but anyway what 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.170
 we do and with the new people 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.970
 marcaste de martín romagnoli of lush 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.250
 that returns from villa geo that has 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.599
 played at a high level of youth 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.400
 which is one more of the campus that has 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.170
 added not being a star but has 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.849
 a human quality then that makes see 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.069
 that here there are no figures here is a 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.599
 team and the team wins x and xi the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.580
 Sunday your mind is 3 goals and no 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.319
 you train Tuesday and Wednesday on Sunday 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.030
 that enters you do not play and it's said for 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.340
 that there are no surprises we have a day 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.019
 more tired but already to finish the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.340
 day we did a little bit of I went right now 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.299
 we got to bathe to arrive and already to 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.790
 rest 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.989
 so for 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.340
 adentramiento tomorrow is 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.340
 early and that will be heavy 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.750
 We live in the room of Javier Cortez 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.639
 because he had a stomp during the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.500
 Afternoon practice we already sent you the 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.500
 ice but let's see what else you need 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.970
 many of the hairstyle 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.330
 of pressure from the bottom up 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.729
 it has also existed 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.550
 to see if we have between morning 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.159
 javier cortés is 23 years old 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.439
 he is one of the players of the quarry his 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.340
 permanence in the first team is not 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:03.120
 assured now an anti-inflammatory 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.120
 tomorrow we have treatment 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.180
 anything our 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.969
 also javier buena charla sanchez 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.129
 thank you everything is very important not from 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.509
 start of the day until we finish the 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.479
 doctor and start pending we 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:21.610
 communicates this blow to the Latin divide the 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.319
 medication is but we have got 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.780
 much that we know is the right one that 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.740
 It gives us but it does not help us much 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.740
 very important these visits 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.420
 we are applying the therapy 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.850
 ultrasound to decrease a small 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.040
 inflammation that really has the type 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.560
 of treatment should not cause them 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.720
 no discomfort feel the current 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.360
 electrical or stimulations but not 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.880
 it must be annoying and painful time who 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 is receiving treatment from the 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.880
 precipitation and ice in the tendon 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.160
 patellar 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.050
 twice for one hour a day 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.050
 and it's after those trainings 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.930
 what makes the season different 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.210
 other equipment from my point of view is 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.210
 excellent since we put the boys 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.250
 others
