the last things tighten up and
everything's<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.300> place<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.020> DubLi<00:02:45.410> pipe

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
everything's in place is the DubLi pipe

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.210 
everything's in place is the DubLi pipe
that<00:02:45.800> goes<00:02:45.830> onto<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.220> turbo<00:02:50.950> last<00:02:51.950> but<00:02:52.130> not
