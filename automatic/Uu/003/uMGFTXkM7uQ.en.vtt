00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello how about friends your portal the ray 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.050
 sonora dotcom presents its section 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 rare animals this time will know the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.330
 free the free is the hybrid product 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.550
 of the cross between a lion and a tigress its 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.490
 aspect is that of a gigantic lion with 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.130
 diffuse tiger stripes as well as 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 lions the male ligands develop 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.619
 mane its scientific name is panthera 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.779
 leo tigris the free usually comes to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 measure up to 4 meters and get to weigh 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.480
 up to 500 kilograms with what has a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.420
 larger than his father lion and his 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.399
 mother tigers to this is explained because the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.649
 growth inhibitory gene is 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.899
 transmits maternally in the lions 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 and paternal in the tigers so the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.390
 free does not inherit any gene of this type 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.969
 and its legs and legs grow all their lives 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.219
 on the other hand they are short in 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.770
 relationship to the body because if they stop 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.260
 grow because of it, it is possible that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.420
 male ligaments plus elders reach 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.940
 be prevented from walking to the no 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 be able to sustain its own weight 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.950
 opposite case is given with the pull also 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.930
 called ti chrono ti gral this crossing 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.600
 between tiger and lioness produces an animal 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.070
 smaller and stylized with some legs 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 and long tail that give it an aspect 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.920
 lanky and less corpulent is to say 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 little imposing is precisely the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.230
 human influence responsible for that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 there are usually liggers tigers and 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.910
 lions do not share territories of 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.580
 way they would have little chance 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.250
 of meeting to form this strange 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.890
 crossing at present lions and tigers 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.350
 they only coexist in nature in the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.690
 forest of here in india 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.720
 formerly they coexisted in persia 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.270
 china and probably in verÃ­n jia by 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.470
 another part the habits of both species 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.240
 are very different 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.580
 predominantly daytime and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.770
 discovered in the most nocturnal lion and 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.560
 forest in the tiger what does more 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.540
 unlikely yet the crossing in nature 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.360
 many of the hybrids generated between 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.640
 different species are born sterile 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.979
 however females can be 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.770
 fertile in some cases and have arrived 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.260
 to mate with tigers to produce a 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.880
 offspring called tiger or with a 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.880
 lion being a danger
