00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.460
 hello to the other day we saw a little 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.960
 how was it on an engine in 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.410
 case so with a variation that does not 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.340
 did not move a calais variation so 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.719
 and today we are going to look a little 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.529
 how is it going at the setting 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.470
 10 years variations our engine is good 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.480
 set in lengthening our skin we have 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.919
 modified what we had to modify our 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.449
 flap and so that's it now we're going 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.070
 watch the adjustment of the variation 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.720
 proper so ragga game in 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.340
 first we will start by setting a 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.710
 little bit legal and we're going to try 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.700
 to refine a little the thing so in there 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.230
 there are pebbles 5 g so I think we 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.290
 made a first pass to see where we 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.290
 is 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.049
 here we are with our first curve of 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:47.060
 variation so then we see that from 0 to 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.600
 40 km time we will say that we are on the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.180
 clutch face and 50 to 120 km / hour 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.710
 on the variation face there what we 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.090
 see is that one travels to work 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.590
 pretty much the curve is fine 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 right from 0 to 40 km time on the other hand 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.550
 sees that from 50 to 120 kilometers hour there 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.319
 we do anything 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.179
 should all flat should go along the 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.360
 twenty-year line while two horses 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.890
 and the whole thing collapses 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.480
 is that we are in fact very much 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.400
 too heavy are legal and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.220
 drive inverters the drive is suffering 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.450
 too fast makes us fall diets 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.450
 and therefore follows the loss of power 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.300
 so that's actually we had 6 x 4 g 7 and 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.140
 there I just put 6 x 4 g iii in 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.140
 keep what's going on 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.730
 for the second variation yard so 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.030
 we see that rises still going strong 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.220
 on the other hand we see that between 50 and 120 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.020
 km hour there it clearly changes the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.600
 music one the variation works 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.910
 a lot better and we start having a 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.510
 thing that works really well there a 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.900
 curve that is quite flat 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.670
 so here we were all in three there I 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.170
 returns while framing of looking at it 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.770
 that's going on but in my opinion it's going to be 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.770
 a little too light 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.040
 so here's our third curve there we 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.170
 sees that bompard still so strong on 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.580
 down on the other hand at the top we can see 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.870
 begins to be below the curve 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.470
 blue what we just did 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.760
 red curve what happens is that 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.670
 well we are just too light 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 now there the goal now is going to be 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.940
 to find juggling between the assignors 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.890
 foot weight 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.590
 you she to really find the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.930
 curve as flat as possible so here 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.910
 I'm finished 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.780
 my engine the variation curve is 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.970
 completed so I have 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.650
 and work mainly so on 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.120
 my carburation galaxy in may spring in 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.930
 trip so I put the springs 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.169
 clutch hard enough on the back a 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.520
 engine 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.930
 who does not have too many couples so we 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.560
 help with clutch springs 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.849
 quite a lot tense behind so in 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.169
 the pretty good red occurrence one of 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:50.940
 red stage6 a gear stage6 so 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.250
 there we see that from 0 to 40 km at the curve 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.260
 it's considerably straightened out we're 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.790
 at nineteen horses at 40 km time so 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.550
 it's still an acceleration 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.860
 strong 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.009
 then the phase of variation between 50 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.469
 and 100 km hour so l is 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.779
 she is really clean very stable and 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:14.339
 after a tiny drop a little 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:20.039
 little between 100 and 120 kilometers an hour 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:22.770
 but hey, who is not that bad? 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.219
 the c1 77 big bore so for me it 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.909
 still works really well 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.909
 There it is, thanks
