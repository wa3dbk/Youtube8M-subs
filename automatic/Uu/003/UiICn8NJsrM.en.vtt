00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
do on a camping trip so I pulled out a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
do on a camping trip so I pulled out a
piece<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> foil<00:00:40.790> imagine<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.059> meal<00:00:42.329> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
piece of foil imagine that your meal is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
piece of foil imagine that your meal is
going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.620> area<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> want

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
going to be about this area and you want

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.100 
going to be about this area and you want
to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.550> able<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> bring<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> foil<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.660> roll<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
to be able to bring the foil up roll it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
to be able to bring the foil up roll it
down<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.559> small<00:00:46.800> holes<00:00:47.129> seal<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.180> bring<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
down as small holes seal it and bring it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.680 
down as small holes seal it and bring it
in<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.010> probably<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.969> an<00:00:51.059> 18<00:00:51.449> piece

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
in so this is probably about an 18 piece

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.500 
in so this is probably about an 18 piece
of<00:00:51.930> foil<00:00:52.170> an<00:00:52.379> 18<00:00:52.800> inch<00:00:53.010> piece<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.430> foil<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
of foil an 18 inch piece of foil so the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
of foil an 18 inch piece of foil so the
first<00:00:54.750> thing<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.399> spritzer

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
first thing is I have a little spritzer

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
first thing is I have a little spritzer
with<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> oil<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.109> we'll<00:00:58.260> just

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
with a little bit of oil so we'll just

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.160 
with a little bit of oil so we'll just
spray<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.890> bit<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> oil<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.570> foil

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
spray a little bit of oil on the foil

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.139 
spray a little bit of oil on the foil
and<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> next<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.370> put<00:01:02.550> some<00:01:02.760> onions

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and the next thing is to put some onions

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.590 
and the next thing is to put some onions
onions<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.780> about<00:01:04.019> 95<00:01:04.769> percent<00:01:05.040> moisture<00:01:05.600> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
onions are about 95 percent moisture so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
onions are about 95 percent moisture so
they're<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.650> could<00:01:07.979> burn<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
they're going to they could burn on the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
they're going to they could burn on the
outside<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.880> they<00:01:09.000> gets<00:01:09.210> too<00:01:09.420> hot<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.930> it'll

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
outside if they gets too hot but it'll

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.710 
outside if they gets too hot but it'll
add<00:01:11.010> moisture<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> it'll<00:01:12.330> keep<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
add moisture to it and it'll keep the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
add moisture to it and it'll keep the
other<00:01:12.900> things<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.439> burning<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.430> next<00:01:14.729> thing

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
other things from burning the next thing

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
other things from burning the next thing
will<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.240> cures<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.110> take<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> little

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
will be cures because they take a little

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.499 
will be cures because they take a little
bit<00:01:16.740> longer<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.580> put<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> few<00:01:17.970> carrots<00:01:18.330> on

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
bit longer so just put a few carrots on

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.830 
bit longer so just put a few carrots on
there<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.960> couple<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.740> potatoes<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:21.090> then

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
comes the hamburger so I'm going to take

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
comes the hamburger so I'm going to take
probably<00:01:24.780> about<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> quarter<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> pound<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
