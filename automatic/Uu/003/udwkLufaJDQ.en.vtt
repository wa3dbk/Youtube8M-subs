 mickey as stated on the site 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.540
 the manufacturer here is 16 gigs built 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.020
 memory the ability to expand by 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.570

 2600 milliamp hour battery 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:40.130
 Simka stone and oleophobic quality 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.470
 cover enough mediocre traces 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.440
 remain but easy enough 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.970
 removed well that we launch and so the smartphone 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.840
 only one is launched here for now 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.910
 Desktop 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.130
 externally on the shell it is nothing 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.940
 different from all other samsungs 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.430
 traditionally layout settings 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.020
 let's go and see which version 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.480
 android 4 4 4 version 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.810
 whether the update should be checked and so 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.720
 latest update already set to 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.480
 this plan is great and I want more 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.650
 check one thing is sure to have 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.440
 discrepancies between the data on the official 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.600
 site on internal memory and others 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.030
 criteria is healthy and so pay attention 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.160
 which is total device memory 8 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:37.190
 gigabyte available place 482 i.e. 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.860
 site slightly incorrect information 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.510
 first impression of the design and of its 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.580
 work is very positive 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.129
 it works smartly enough 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.039
 focal complaints 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.529
