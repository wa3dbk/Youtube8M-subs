00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
hard drives together which I actually do

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959 
hard drives together which I actually do
and<00:00:51.360> also<00:00:52.350> an<00:00:52.620> e<00:00:52.800> SATA<00:00:53.039> port<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:53.760> my

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and also an e SATA port which my

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.610 
and also an e SATA port which my
computer<00:00:54.420> doesn't<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.020> SATA<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.530> if

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
computer doesn't have a SATA but if

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.029 
computer doesn't have a SATA but if
yours<00:00:55.890> does<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.000> three

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
yours does you can get up to three

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
yours does you can get up to three
gigabits<00:00:59.039> per<00:00:59.280> second<00:00:59.850> i<00:00:59.969> believe<00:01:00.270> using<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
gigabits per second i believe using that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.889 
gigabits per second i believe using that
e<00:01:01.530> SATA<00:01:01.980> port<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> front<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
e SATA port and then on the front you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.469 
e SATA port and then on the front you
also<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.379> an<00:01:04.470> indicator<00:01:04.949> light<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.610> indicate

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
also have an indicator light to indicate

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.719 
also have an indicator light to indicate
what<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.260> writing<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.860> reading<00:01:08.220> but

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
what if it's writing your reading but

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.090 
what if it's writing your reading but
one<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.720> weird<00:01:10.049> thing<00:01:10.290> about<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
one really weird thing about it is the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
one really weird thing about it is the
light<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> time<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.439> when

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
light is on all the time and then when

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.130 
light is on all the time and then when
it's<00:01:13.740> actually<00:01:13.950> reading<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.360> writing<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it's actually reading or writing it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's actually reading or writing it
actually<00:01:16.590> flashes<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:18.030> turns<00:01:18.299> off<00:01:18.509> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
actually flashes or it just turns off so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
actually flashes or it just turns off so
when<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> lights<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.369> basically<00:01:20.549> means

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
when the lights on that basically means

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.140 
when the lights on that basically means
it<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.990> standby<00:01:22.470> mode<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.790> it's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it is in a standby mode but when it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.890 
it is in a standby mode but when it's
flashing<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.939> not<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.689> means

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
flashing or it's not even on that means

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.929 
flashing or it's not even on that means
that<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.200> reading<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:28.650> writing<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.729> now

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that it's reading your writing so now

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
that it's reading your writing so now
for<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.299> pros<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.840> hard<00:01:31.110> drive<00:01:31.259> first

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
for some pros of this hard drive first

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
for some pros of this hard drive first
of<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> very<00:01:32.790> fast<00:01:33.150> hard<00:01:33.509> drive<00:01:33.780> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of all it is a very fast hard drive and

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.550 
of all it is a very fast hard drive and
I<00:01:35.009> actually<00:01:35.520> compared<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.570> USB<00:01:36.840> hard

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
I actually compared it to a USB hard

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
I actually compared it to a USB hard
drive<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> had<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.909> one's<00:01:39.119> hooked

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
drive that I had and this one's hooked

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.990 
drive that I had and this one's hooked
up<00:01:39.479> using<00:01:39.689> firewire<00:01:40.170> 800<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:41.369> about<00:01:41.549> twice

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
up using firewire 800 it's about twice

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389 
up using firewire 800 it's about twice
as<00:01:42.210> fast<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> USB<00:01:43.229> hard<00:01:43.560> drive<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> get

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
as fast as the USB hard drive and to get

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.249 
as fast as the USB hard drive and to get
this<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.700> paper<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.090> actually<00:01:45.329> used<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.930> program

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
this on paper I actually used a program

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.149 
this on paper I actually used a program
called<00:01:46.710> X<00:01:47.009> bench<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:48.110> showed<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.590> tested

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
called X bench which showed and tested

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.999 
called X bench which showed and tested
both<00:01:50.549> hard<00:01:50.850> drives<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.869> proved<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
both hard drives and it proved that the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.200 
both hard drives and it proved that the
firewire<00:01:53.490> 800<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.360> about<00:01:55.310> twice<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.640> fast<00:01:56.850> as

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
firewire 800 is about twice as fast as

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.429 
firewire 800 is about twice as fast as
the<00:01:57.390> USB<00:01:57.990> hard<00:01:58.860> drive<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.490> also<00:02:00.479> did<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.079> real

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the USB hard drive I also did a real

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.830 
the USB hard drive I also did a real
world<00:02:01.710> speed<00:02:02.070> test<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.909> dragged<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.509> 1

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
world speed test and I just dragged a 1

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.660 
world speed test and I just dragged a 1
gigabyte<00:02:04.290> file<00:02:04.619> onto<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.159> hard<00:02:05.369> drive<00:02:05.549> from

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
gigabyte file onto the hard drive from

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.270 
gigabyte file onto the hard drive from
my<00:02:05.850> desktop<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.689> took<00:02:07.079> less<00:02:07.409> than<00:02:07.469> 15

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
my desktop and it took less than 15

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
my desktop and it took less than 15
seconds<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.910> transfer<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:09.720> timed

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
seconds to transfer it I actually timed

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
seconds to transfer it I actually timed
it<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> stopwatch<00:02:11.750> also<00:02:12.750> there's<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.050> lot

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
it with a stopwatch also there's a lot

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
it with a stopwatch also there's a lot
of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.940 
of
on<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.880> whether<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> netbook<00:02:16.709> or

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
on this so whether you have a netbook or

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.900 
on this so whether you have a netbook or
you<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.540> huge<00:02:18.560> desktop<00:02:19.560> gaming<00:02:20.340> machine

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
you have a huge desktop gaming machine

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.839 
you have a huge desktop gaming machine
you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.270> connect<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.590> your<00:02:22.620> computer<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
you can connect it to your computer it

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.350 
you can connect it to your computer it
is<00:02:24.540> also<00:02:25.280> formatted<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.550> both<00:02:26.880> windows<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
is also formatted for both windows and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.360 
is also formatted for both windows and
mac<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.260> plug<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.530> play<00:02:28.860> right<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
mac so it's plug and play right of the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.220 
mac so it's plug and play right of the
box<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:29.970> can<00:02:30.120> also<00:02:30.300> transfer<00:02:30.930> files

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
box and you can also transfer files

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.160 
box and you can also transfer files
between<00:02:31.410> platforms<00:02:32.630> one<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> other

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
between platforms one of the other

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.460 
between platforms one of the other
noticeable<00:02:35.069> things<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.150> when<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.720> get

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
noticeable things is that when you get

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.220 
noticeable things is that when you get
the<00:02:37.800> box<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.430> comes<00:02:38.610> with<00:02:38.910> all<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.690> cables

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the box it comes with all of the cables

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.590 
the box it comes with all of the cables
that<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.500> need<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.610> know<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.850> lot<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.239> other

that you need and I know a lot of other

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.050 
that you need and I know a lot of other
companies<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.769> hard<00:02:44.580> drive<00:02:44.760> will<00:02:44.910> have

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
companies like a hard drive will have

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.820 
companies like a hard drive will have
any<00:02:45.330> SATA<00:02:45.540> port<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:45.959> they<00:02:46.050> won't<00:02:46.230> include<00:02:46.590> an

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
any SATA port but they won't include an

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.559 
any SATA port but they won't include an
e<00:02:46.980> SATA<00:02:47.220> cable<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.239> case

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
e SATA cable but this is not the case

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.900 
e SATA cable but this is not the case
verbatim<00:02:49.230> will<00:02:49.620> actually<00:02:50.040> include<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.760> e

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
verbatim will actually include your e

verbatim will actually include your e
SATA<00:02:51.209> cable<00:02:51.630> your<00:02:51.780> firewire<00:02:52.170> 800<00:02:52.470> USB<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.549> all

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
SATA cable your firewire 800 USB and all

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.270 
SATA cable your firewire 800 USB and all
of<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.150> other<00:02:54.299> ones<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:54.810> there<00:02:55.650> are<00:02:55.799> some<00:02:56.010> cons

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
of the other ones so there are some cons

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.009 
of the other ones so there are some cons
with<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.730> hard<00:02:57.000> drive<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.510> first<00:02:57.750> thing

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
with this hard drive the first thing

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.039 
with this hard drive the first thing
it's<00:02:58.260> large<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.160> sort<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.760> takes<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.870> lot

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
it's large and it sort of takes up a lot

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.199 
it's large and it sort of takes up a lot
of<00:03:01.080> space<00:03:01.440> on<00:03:01.590> your<00:03:01.650> desk<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.220> have<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.640> actually

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
of space on your desk I have it actually

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.390 
of space on your desk I have it actually
sitting<00:03:03.510> vertical<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.230> my<00:03:04.380> desk<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.310> it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
sitting vertical on my desk so that it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.430 
sitting vertical on my desk so that it
doesn't<00:03:05.580> take<00:03:05.880> up<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.239> as<00:03:06.510> much<00:03:07.140> space

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
doesn't take up this as much space

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.759 
doesn't take up this as much space
another<00:03:08.310> thing<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:09.060> don't<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.260> it's

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
another thing I don't like is that it's

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.820 
another thing I don't like is that it's
kind<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.640> noisy<00:03:12.120> Drive<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:13.380> don't<00:03:13.650> really

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
kind of a noisy Drive you don't really

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.740 
kind of a noisy Drive you don't really
notice<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:14.549> you're<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:14.880> noisy<00:03:15.299> room<00:03:15.540> but

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
notice it if you're in a noisy room but

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.410 
notice it if you're in a noisy room but
if<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.080> very<00:03:16.380> quiet<00:03:16.709> or<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:18.060> have<00:03:18.239> your

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
if it's very quiet or you have your

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.319 
if it's very quiet or you have your
office<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.049> your<00:03:19.530> bedroom<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.519> when

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
office and your bedroom like I do when

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.970 
office and your bedroom like I do when
you're<00:03:21.540> laying<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.930> bed<00:03:22.109> at<00:03:22.320> night<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.829> it's

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you're laying in bed at night and it's

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.840 
you're laying in bed at night and it's
just<00:03:23.940> set<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.200> standby<00:03:25.799> which<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.250> sort<00:03:26.790> of

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
just set on standby which is sort of

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.729 
just set on standby which is sort of
weird<00:03:27.030> because<00:03:27.299> it's<00:03:27.600> still<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.019> when<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.620> in

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
weird because it's still on when it's in

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.160 
weird because it's still on when it's in
standby<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.090> sort<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.570> makes<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.959> little

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
standby but it sort of makes a little

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.990 
standby but it sort of makes a little
bit<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.440> noise<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.920> overall<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.970> really

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
bit of noise so overall it's a really
