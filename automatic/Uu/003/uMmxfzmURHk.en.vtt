 Horse help but you have to be patience

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.760
 waiting 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.560
 Finally the time has come 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.599
 Andrea Kutsch is there on the grounds of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.399
 equestrian sports club leverkusen 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 Today you are at Linda and her bÃ¼low 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.239
 take care of it before you can start 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 once the riding hall can be prepared 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.079
 because yourrea needs andrea 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.149
 Carriage a so-called round pen 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 which is a round gehege the ideal 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 diameter also has around the horse without 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.020
 longe to be able to move freely 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.520
 Andrea Kutsch dedicates to work in it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.250
 for linda and her horse, that is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.399
 upcoming training a completely new 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.399
 challenge is 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 when we come to the hall 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.439
 a moment must be countries and willow 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.659
 but still on their use in the hall 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.040
 wait andrea coach and team samples 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.960
 still with the grid elements 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.220
 after he willow in the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 trailer to pilot 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.049
 I did not feel anything but later 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.689
 first linda and her horse are at 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.700
 lead by andrea kutsch observes the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.420
 horse whisperer brings horse and rider 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.350
 on course 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.119
 great so you can see already 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.979
 it is clear that the horse is in the right direction 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.740
 speed throughout determined 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.390
 not in the bad room so in the beginning on 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.580
 the shots that I have seen have 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.750
 i thought it would dominate and now 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.430
 I rather say it very much 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.290
 anxious and just looking for 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.509
 name leader position who cares if 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.060
 happened and something in the emergency 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.259
 Now she takes over the horse ok 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.030
 countries then you can once to me 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.799
 then I take over the horse once 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.990
 and then I do it once 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.759
 a communication process and now 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.259
 important is you stop drives first 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.380
 roadway and then you stay 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.170
 stand exactly and where controlled so far 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.720
 Andrea Kutsch takes over that means I 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.340
 must be direction and speed 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.440
 can determine because otherwise what they are 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.470
 will certainly make them remain from 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.209
 Hangers are available whenever she wants 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.310
 Now it will happen again, you read that 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.420
 and here it pulls back and said 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.350
 nebelo tip never never never stop never 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.850
 but i go ahead so i explain 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.190
 principle willow grad times the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.450
 How I play through ours 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.890
 partnership for the next couple 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.140
 Minutes here so imagine 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.329
 Andrea Kutsch leaves at work 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.650
 not just on her belly feeling 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.329
 she was not just a student of 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.950
 famous monty roberts her 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.690
 Findings about working with horses 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.829
 she has a scientific one 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.900
 basis 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.299
 when dealing with horses sets andrea 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 Carriage on nonviolence for the animals 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.650
 Rather respond to a slight signal 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.160
 as willow is on a strong hand there 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.160
 no exception 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.510
 only very few signals but clear 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.790
 signals 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.549
 now smell my shoulders passively times 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.440
 on the side angle and please 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.930
 that she can come to me quickly 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.590
 andrea asserts herself as the leader 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.540
 That adds up to years one says okay 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.159
 I come after this thorough 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.019
 Preparation goes directly to the 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.239
 trailer quickly build the team the grid 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.890
 elements around andrea carriage can now 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.870
 direction and speed at willow 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.739
 controlling a miracle healer is her 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.599
 not anyway 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.549
 even with her, the horse shied away from the 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.680
 trailer linda looks intently and 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.090
 the minutes pass with the help of 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.579
 Guitar elements will be easier to print 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.159
 exercised and finally gives 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.599
 in the hands of your leader what 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.489
 not before within four and a half hours 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.230
 Solving hours was creating andrea 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.169
 Carriage in under an hour 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.950
 Linda is excited about it in the 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:04:00.109
 Trailer in it only from outside 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.730
 now it's time to swap linda 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.010
 Your horse should also be loaded alone 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.969
 can be after last instructions 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.650
 it seriously a selection more here 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.079
 here control and now watch trailer 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.849
 and goes straight ahead pure straight 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.849
 go in trailers right to attention 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.900
 why did it with her 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.090
 owner wants to go to the 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.010
 trailer solves the tension of the day 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.810
 yourself and how it feels at the end 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.000
 very different has the hand before four 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:37.180
 years to the culprit already it can start 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:45.130
 and hates a good feeling so the beginning 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:49.960
 is done good that he is so and now 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.360
 at least in the first step now 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.070
 Foreigners just stay with Andrea and Carriage 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.070
 and her team will help her
