00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:04.872
This is gonna be good.

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:06.573
Do we really
have to do this?

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.408
Yes, we're not
communicating.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.643
We need help.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.044
We're not
communicating?

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.379
Yeah, we're not
communicating.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.881
I don't even know what
you're saying right now.

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:14.915
(door opens)

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.250
Hello.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.051
Hi, I'm Chrissy Teigen.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.586
I'm so sorry
about the wait.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.288
Come on in.
Thank you so much
for seeing us.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.023
No problem.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.501
It's gonna
be fine.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.271
So let's get started.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.173
First of all, how long
have you two been together?

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.909
Four years.
Well, we had a good run,
if that's what you mean.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.610
Well, I think it's great
you guys are both here.

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:45.179
It shows that
this relationship

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.947
is something that's important
to the both of you.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.882
I'm sorry,
aren't you a model?

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.384
She's a supermodel.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.519
You sound like a real
ass(bleep) right now.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.188
I actually was a model,

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:55.923
but now I'm a clinical
social worker

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.157
and I really love it.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.525
You know, I'm really
enjoying this now

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.928
and I mean, who wants
to ride a horse naked

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.129
for the camera
all the time?

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.932
I'd rather just
do that on my own.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.433
And as you know, modeling
is great,

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.936
but you hit 27
and suddenly, you're old.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.071
Oh, that's not old.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.606
Amy's 37.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.074
I'm 32.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.576
Yeah, but you're
a drinker.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.444
All right, so let's talk about
what brought you two here.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.513
I'll start.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.281
Um...

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:24.985
You know, when,
when Amy gets jealous,

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.621
I get really
frustrated.

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.090
So I have to like,
you know,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.660
go to the gym and then
I gotta sweat it out.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.495
Just... (growls)

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.197
And Amy?

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.501
Well, I, I feel like
he's cheating on me.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:44.505
You just need to learn
to believe that I'm not.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:48.675
Uh, well, these sound
like two very conflicting
perspectives, obviously--

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.145
Can you put your glasses
back on, please?

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.347
Of course.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.515
Thank you.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:55.983
No, no.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.484
No, no, no.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.486
No,
don't do that.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:03.290
Okay, uh, well, he never has sex
with me, like at all.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.058
It's because
I don't want to.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.327
And Amy, how does
that make you feel?

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:11.331
That makes me feel unattractive,
Chrissy Teigen.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.067
You know what, Kevin,
maintaining self-esteem
for a woman

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.435
can be really difficult.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:18.071
I think we all feel
a little bit ugly sometimes.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.443
All right, I want
to try a role play.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:24.645
I'm going to be Amy.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.346
Kevin, I'd like you
to say to me

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.549
all the things that you'd
like to do to Amy in bed.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.083
Okay--
No.

00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:31.451
I don't think that's
a good idea for us--

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:34.621
First, I want to kiss
you for hours.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.156
And then I want
to run my fingers

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.092
through your long,
dark hair.

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:42.129
And then
I wanna drive you crazy

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:45.632
by licking you in places
no other man,

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.168
including John Legend,

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.103
has ever touched
before.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.572
All right,
why don't you now

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.007
say those things
directly to Amy?

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.509
It's okay.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.110
I think she got it.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.246
I don't think
this is helping at all.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.248
So it's agreed.
We're on a break.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.550
You know what I like
to do sometimes is kind of

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.552
finish off the session
with just one of you.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.588
I think that would be
the smartest deal here.

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.056
Okay, yeah.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.424
Amy, you'll take
a Citi Bike home, right?

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:12.159
I've never even used
a Citi Bike.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.961
It's really easy.
You just use a credit card.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:16.196
Actually, Kevin, I think it's
best if I finish with Amy,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.598
but, um, you know what?

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:21.101
My business cards
are still being made.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.070
But all my information
is on this for you.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.938
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.106
We have a calendar--

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.441
Wow,
this has everything.

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.109
I will put this
to use.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.112
Great, and then
I will see you Monday.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.547
Monday.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.215
Perfect.
I will see you then.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.450
Monday.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.652
See you at home.
See you.

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.589
Girl,
don't blow this, girl.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.091
What?

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.093
That man out there
is a total catch.

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:47.427
You need to lock it down.

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:50.964
Really?
(phone chimes)

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:53.600
Oh, gross.
It's a dick.
