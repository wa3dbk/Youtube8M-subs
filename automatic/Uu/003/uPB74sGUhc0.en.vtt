00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.370
 just talk to a lot of people 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 Always buy what you do is very 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.290
 short and not like the musician has the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.210
 lucky when you're better off traveling and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 know all Chile and its surroundings is its 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.279
 corner and the sad thing about chili is that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.190
 chile with long and narrow this country 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.070
 so strange between cordillera mar and ccoo 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.590
 complex this country happen things that are 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 they repeat in all the new Chilean the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.030
 north that way to have its waves 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 forest are forest 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.500
 hydroelectric itself these people are going 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.450
 killing life because a lot of people say 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.150
 is this a political issue if it is a theme 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.309
 political because life life is a 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.530
 political theme love life is love the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.059
 earth love the earth is to take care of our 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 people and our community 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.230
 who loves the earth is that nothing lives 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.570
 and this struggle of the Mapuche people in a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.800
 fight for life knowing this amount 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.750
 information handling 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 state terrorism this land was 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.650
 against from the Mapuche people 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.989
 direct this paraphernalia and 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.250
 schizophrenic way in which it has 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 shown by the Mapuche as a people 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.909
 terrorist because it has been such is the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 way in which the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.760
 communications has also been how 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.340
 glimpse like a people like from a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.560
 government is a democratic that is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 terrorist a people eating 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.479
 terrorists in which clear as one 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 as a musician I think it is impossible not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 feel not only touched what is 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 the struggle for life a political issue 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 so the next song I made 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 of carla with tremendous affection love affection 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.910
 admiration to all the people is very 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.740
 difficult in someone's shoes the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.860
 which are not expelling in a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.170
 violent with a project like this 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140
 I hard for me to rope a message 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.400
 as light and hope when I feel 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.590
 that these people who are in power and 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.960
 these people who have the power of me 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.479
 who believes with him thinks himself better 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.149
 with the power of the earth and you are going to create 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.710
 the communities and the people is totally 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.099
 It serves all of the requests only 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.509
 of the village then after that one 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.269
 that you have to stand, you always have to 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.500
 change the theme of identity and 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.120
 organizational possibility and I think that the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.370
 social organization is the only key 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.959
 that you find that it 's just let's go 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.790
 many people that we are very attentive what 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.310
 what is happening to start being 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.459
 that information and nothing a message of 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.140
 force much strength much newell that 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.660
 I insist as I said before are an example 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.360
 of fighting value and resistance by the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.130
 life for life up those who fight 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.410
 always always before all adversity 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.660
 even if you want to cheat them always always 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.660
 always by getting the word out 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.410
 inspire to get two awake 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.410
 with 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.410
 breathe 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.980
 yes the others 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.520
 doing alone 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.800
 the green eyes walk on the river without 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.660
 fear 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.660
 breathe and that desire 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.519
 no no 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.360

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.959
