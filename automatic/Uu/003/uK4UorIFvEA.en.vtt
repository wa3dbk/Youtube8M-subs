00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
have been better with the big clip size

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.870 
have been better with the big clip size
of<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.250> two<00:04:33.490> pp-2000<00:04:34.330> but<00:04:34.650> anyways<00:04:35.650> as<00:04:35.919> that<00:04:36.850> I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
of the two pp-2000 but anyways as that I

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.530 
of the two pp-2000 but anyways as that I
managed<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.510> get<00:04:37.720> my<00:04:38.500> score<00:04:38.770> in<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:38.950> end<00:04:39.070> or

managed to get my score in the end or
positive<00:04:40.540> Kitty<00:04:40.750> had<00:04:41.050> late

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
positive Kitty had late

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.170 
positive Kitty had late
and<00:04:42.380> actually<00:04:43.380> was<00:04:43.650> pretty<00:04:43.890> easy<00:04:43.950> because<00:04:44.250> I'm

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
and actually was pretty easy because I'm

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.940 
and actually was pretty easy because I'm
not<00:04:45.450> playing<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:45.930> often<00:04:46.410> with<00:04:46.530> tickle<00:04:46.800> good

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
not playing that often with tickle good

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.940 
not playing that often with tickle good
stuff<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.280> I'm<00:04:47.400> not<00:04:48.200> I'm<00:04:49.200> missing<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.770> lot<00:04:49.860> of

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
stuff so I'm not I'm missing a lot of

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.850 
stuff so I'm not I'm missing a lot of
shots<00:04:50.160> here<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:50.850> they're<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:52.350> really

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
shots here and they're so and a really

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.920 
shots here and they're so and a really
big<00:04:52.980> downside<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.640> SAT<00:04:53.880> abyss<00:04:54.120> we're

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
big downside of the SAT abyss we're

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.350 
big downside of the SAT abyss we're
going<00:04:55.230> just<00:04:55.470> for<00:04:55.710> Coco<00:04:56.580> stuff<00:04:56.820> only<00:04:56.970> kills

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
going just for Coco stuff only kills

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.080 
going just for Coco stuff only kills
that<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.710> reload<00:04:59.040> time<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.430> very<00:04:59.760> long

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
that the reload time is very long

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.120 
that the reload time is very long
between<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.630> shots<00:05:01.820> but<00:05:03.500> again<00:05:04.500> it<00:05:04.920> was<00:05:05.100> a

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
between the shots but again it was a

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.980 
between the shots but again it was a
pretty<00:05:05.430> much<00:05:05.580> gameplay<00:05:05.850> and<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.480> hope<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.960> like
