00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.660
 what signs sold today hand for me 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.629
 laden and giorgi I'm going to teach a 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.299
 little battery what I know because this 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.769
 instrument in the main instrument 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.049
 but he gladly taught them what 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.150
 I know how to do it to accompany a 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.750
 choir of worship in them busy 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.750
 is this one 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.800
 but I will explain a bit then 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.189
 this in the right hand I just leave 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.189
 base 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.090
 i 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.460
 and now here if we do this together with 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.460
 this would sound like this 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.380
 here it goes 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.520
 just like this for these two together 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.950
 now here you can add your hand 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.649
 left to start a chorus of 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.740
 worship because you can usually 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.100
 put the valuation to be able to take this 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.170
 sound 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.719
 well and then when I entered the body 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.579
 then you can touch the nerves and 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.950
 in the head but to begin 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.950
 simply just so measured 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.490
 ah 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.120
 ah 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.060
 but now for me all three what 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.760
 it costs more than first to unite the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.510
 three together so if you want we can 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.510
 do on these two 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.330
 i 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.069
 ah 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.280
 ah 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.900
 but now to join them 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.580
 to begin it starts here it sticks 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.580
 together with a chocolate hand 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.570
 and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.340
 again it would be 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 two 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.080
 but with a little more speed 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.440
 and so it is 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.600
 in a basic rhythm to accompany 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.130
 of adoration in the next video because it 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.470
 I can teach how to make it about 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.620
 redobles to start playing now 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.570
 the choir part that good for the choir 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.930
 it's just the same rhythm 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.420
 only that it would be played here and then if 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.820
 touch here in the symbol you can touch 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.730
 here you can touch here this is called 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.600
 wire the right as the raid is busy 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.660
 to be able to maintain that base there and that 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.520
 base and the others are can be called a 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.770
 splash because just like to make a 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.690
 effect but an editor is not maintained 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.480
 carlo but one stays here 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.480
 playing in the raid we can be like this 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.110
 and so it is that it is simply done 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.710
 good brothers that signs continue 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.710
 blessing
