 and such redies here, I'll leave red 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.759

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:43.970

 pieces of paper 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.689

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.510
 noodles not to cook with paper 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.349

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.690

 put the fridge so it is soaked 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.849
 Juice and before serving, I'll probably pour 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.090
 olive oil and how me stuffing is already of 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.060
 ready- made tomato sauce and pasta

 I, too, cooked so I mixed 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.230
 pasta with minced meat and add more basil 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:34.700
 quite a bit so me noodles already 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.580

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.370

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.840
 I tried this juice but other berries 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.930

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.140

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.680
 of course they are all the same because 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.600
 that when we want to drink without a difference 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.600
 just to drink something 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.630
