00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
good I find on these small compacts

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190 
good I find on these small compacts
under<00:00:32.309> these<00:00:32.640> lighting<00:00:33.059> conditions<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.930> do

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
under these lighting conditions I do

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.709 
under these lighting conditions I do
have<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.770> under<00:00:35.070> expose<00:00:35.100> by<00:00:35.790> gist<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.450> touch

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.440 
nice it won't be the same exact raw file
but<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.260> think<00:03:25.980> my<00:03:26.459> software<00:03:26.880> I'll<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.180> able<00:03:27.360> to

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
but I think my software I'll be able to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.150 
but I think my software I'll be able to
handle<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.910> there<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.330> look<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.070> here's<00:03:32.070> a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
handle it so there is a look so here's a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:44.130 
handle it so there is a look so here's a

things<00:04:52.479> in<00:04:52.690> here<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.900> noticed<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.760> I've<00:04:54.760> never

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
things in here I noticed that I've never

things in here I noticed that I've never
seen<00:04:55.300> before<00:04:55.510> among<00:04:56.080> them<00:04:56.350> is<00:04:56.560> auto<00:04:56.860> ISO

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
seen before among them is auto ISO

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.469 
seen before among them is auto ISO
settings<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.410> choose<00:04:59.950> your<00:05:00.220> maximum<00:05:00.940> ISO

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
settings you can choose your maximum ISO

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:08.370 
settings you can choose your maximum ISO
speed<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:03.430> rate<00:05:03.669> of<00:05:03.700> change<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:07.380> this

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
speed and the rate of change and this

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.310 
speed and the rate of change and this
camera<00:05:08.800> actually<00:05:08.950> has<00:05:09.310> an<00:05:09.430> ISO<00:05:09.850> range<00:05:10.180> from<00:05:10.570> 80

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
camera actually has an ISO range from 80

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.430 
camera actually has an ISO range from 80
to<00:05:12.660> 3200<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:15.940> should<00:05:16.150> be<00:05:16.180> pretty<00:05:16.690> pretty

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
to 3200 so it should be pretty pretty

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.860 
to 3200 so it should be pretty pretty
good<00:05:17.680> in<00:05:17.919> low<00:05:18.100> light<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:20.410> also<00:05:20.710> will<00:05:21.130> do<00:05:21.870> 720p

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
good in low light it also will do 720p

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.469 
good in low light it also will do 720p
video<00:05:25.979> so<00:05:26.979> we'll<00:05:27.400> take<00:05:27.640> a<00:05:27.669> look<00:05:27.880> at<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.180> here

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
video so we'll take a look at that here

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:34.070 
video so we'll take a look at that here
in<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:28.660> minute<00:05:30.479> there<00:05:31.479> are<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.870> menu<00:05:32.260> options

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
in a minute there are the menu options

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.670 
in a minute there are the menu options
just<00:05:35.080> in<00:05:35.290> case<00:05:36.630> you<00:05:37.630> were<00:05:37.750> wondering<00:05:38.229> and<00:05:38.500> you

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
just in case you were wondering and you

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.520 
just in case you were wondering and you
can<00:05:38.830> set<00:05:39.010> up<00:05:39.040> a<00:05:39.280> custom<00:05:39.310> menu<00:05:39.940> there<00:05:40.500> so

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.630 

there's<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.710> look<00:05:44.890> at<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.990> Canon<00:05:47.430> s95

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
there's a look at the Canon s95

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.500 
there's a look at the Canon s95
so<00:05:50.010> this<00:05:51.010> should<00:05:51.220> make<00:05:51.340> a<00:05:51.400> very<00:05:51.790> good<00:05:51.880> addition

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
so this should make a very good addition

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.740 
so this should make a very good addition
to<00:05:52.539> my<00:05:52.780> camera<00:05:53.229> kit<00:05:53.789> as<00:05:54.789> I<00:05:54.940> said<00:05:55.150> before<00:05:55.300> you

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
to my camera kit as I said before you

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.640 
to my camera kit as I said before you
can't<00:05:55.990> take<00:05:56.229> a<00:05:56.260> DSLR<00:05:57.010> every

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
can't take a DSLR every

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.510 
can't take a DSLR every
they<00:05:58.400> are<00:05:58.580> like<00:05:58.880> rather<00:05:59.120> large<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:01.220> image

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
they are like rather large the image

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.439 
they are like rather large the image
quality<00:06:01.759> is<00:06:02.620> not<00:06:03.620> comparable<00:06:04.130> with<00:06:04.699> my<00:06:04.880> 7d

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
quality is not comparable with my 7d

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.990 
quality is not comparable with my 7d
obviously<00:06:06.169> but<00:06:06.889> this<00:06:07.130> does<00:06:07.370> have<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.639> same

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
obviously but this does have the same

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.550 
obviously but this does have the same
sensor<00:06:08.449> as<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:08.630> G<00:06:08.960> 12<00:06:09.320> and<00:06:10.539> therefore<00:06:11.560> it's

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
sensor as the G 12 and therefore it's

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.279 
sensor as the G 12 and therefore it's
going<00:06:12.680> to<00:06:12.800> give<00:06:12.949> you<00:06:13.070> a<00:06:13.100> really<00:06:13.520> good

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
going to give you a really good

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.100 
going to give you a really good
high-resolution<00:06:15.460> clean<00:06:16.460> images<00:06:17.389> you<00:06:17.990> can
