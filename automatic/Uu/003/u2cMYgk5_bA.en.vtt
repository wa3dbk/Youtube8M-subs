00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.910
 if you take a multimedia review 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.759
 hours mechanic you know more about 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.259
 innovation and technology in the new pickup 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.509
 the road that now comes to the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.580
 2014 version and a vehicle that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.300
 always had in its history a lot of 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.220
 innovation 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.010
 if you are in our lab 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.779
 innovation to ours here always 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.980
 we can put some news 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.529
 that goes naked in the direction of that dog 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.570
 customer service is also 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 main innovation now that it arrives 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.469
 2014 everyone is talking this 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.969
 third door developed 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.950
 here in Brazil in december and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.280
 entirely here in brazil the novelty 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.129
 for this vehicle technology and the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
 our creation 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 here is for this type of vehicle but 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.370
 also as a real challenge 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 Many small automakers put a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.129
 portaria versa in this way is for us 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 was a very difficult challenge because 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.189
 not easy to make a door that connected us 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.229
 because it needs to be very 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.810
 more architectural host because 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.950
 You pull up the car. 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.600
 remain the same standards staandard 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.400
 and safety 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.369
 without a central one like the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.240
 aspect of road safety as 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.610
 is organizing security is 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 maintained at the same standards and from the side 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.040
 with something we can too 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.680
 clearly from the dakar kitur to the contour 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.530
 of the doors and the doors together gives the same 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 result of the assembly we have done it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.320
 see the term our virtual part and a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.930
 both after giving more this guarantee is 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.009
 the result of three physical tests on 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.219
 the vehicle made in proving something very 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.579
 interesting technical solutions with 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.770
 functionalities 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.210
 I watch to enter or leave this 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 third door how the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.099
 procedure to open procedure 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.040
 to house more than maximum safety 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.410
 we put the knob around 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.110
 given that delivery can not be done 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.519
 open or outside, nor is it within 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.129
 closed forest 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.379
 when you open the front door now 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.530
 you have accessibility and a knob that 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.590
 can be opened either from the outside 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.890
 wanting one of the different movements 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.890
 and if a fully patented 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.269
 in the faith of Batman in one is our 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.540
 grow in our idea we face and will 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.690
 give much more comfort to a customer 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.239
 which had but these opening maneuvers 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.310
 input and after uploading a project 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.410
 totally unheard of in the world until 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.880
 now no one has ever seen a pickup and 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.560
 still with the door reveals a third 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.780
 door like the one you're making 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.280
 here in Brazil is exactly the third 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.500
 door to door versa 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.140
 taking the amount of one Ameira 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.549
 very comfortable situation effectively 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.099
 us to arrive at this result 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.220
 we passed through a lot of study 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.530
 we also take the most scientific and 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.560
 doctor in my area who is the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.269
 economy where we rescue the man from 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.209
 oil is to do a study 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:26.349
 anthropologically the postures 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.540
 percentages of the human body and we 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.049
 better biomechanics, which means 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.209
 best postural placement of 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.040
 drive to get in the car 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:41.079
 without it is always the physical effort that 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.150
 the one that bothers the customer now 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.010
 in this work of yours 300 new 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.359
 components coming with the new road 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.340
 presents a new component 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.419
 practically the car is almost 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.169
 completely new because aesthetics 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:58.870
 world very expensive the dollar has a way out 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:01.269
 loan where the most imposing car 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.440
 It is also for you a vehicle over 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.959
 free time that is not a vehicle 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.980
 commercial and after a part of the door 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.530
 to this where even that which is visible 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.019
 took part in a dispute apart from the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.639
 money in posturing vehicle that is 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.829
 leader in its segment on the island as well 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.900
 highlight the volume capacity that 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.810
 offers you have been able to increase 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.380
 the volume 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.150
 development here because simple is 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.850
 It's true because we are raising from 30 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.669
 the bucket this guarantees one of 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.730
 maintain a higher volume load of cane 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.919
 Online engines remains remains the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.130
 novelty is the classical logic 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.940
 we also put here so the whole 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.080
 has an evolution is with the rest of the 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.080
 layer by vehicle via
