startup<00:00:17.340> wizard<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.850> definitely<00:00:18.720> suggest

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
startup wizard I definitely suggest

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.260 
startup wizard I definitely suggest
using<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:20.189> will<00:00:20.310> help<00:00:20.430> set<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.760> your<00:00:21.000> unit

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
using this it will help set up your unit

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.230 
using this it will help set up your unit
for<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> body<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.140> water<00:00:22.380> you're<00:00:22.590> fishing<00:00:23.240> so

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
for the body of water you're fishing so

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.849 
for the body of water you're fishing so
it's<00:00:24.390> gonna<00:00:24.510> ask<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.050> transducer<00:00:25.650> type

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it's gonna ask you what transducer type

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.679 
it's gonna ask you what transducer type
you<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.189> installed<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.119> most<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> time

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
you have installed so most of the time

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
you have installed so most of the time
it<00:00:27.869> will<00:00:27.990> come<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.529> transducer<00:00:29.250> that

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it will come with the transducer that

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.900 
it will come with the transducer that
has<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.990> 883<00:00:30.990> 200<00:00:31.439> kilohertz<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.340> 455

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
has the 883 200 kilohertz and the 455

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.479 
has the 883 200 kilohertz and the 455
800<00:00:33.540> down<00:00:33.690> scan<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.500> it'll<00:00:34.890> look<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
800 down scan and it'll look like this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.389 
800 down scan and it'll look like this
but<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> also<00:00:36.719> had<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.920> older<00:00:38.190> legacy

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
but if you also had the an older legacy

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
but if you also had the an older legacy
transducer<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> 83<00:00:40.200> 200<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:41.160> could

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
transducer just the 83 200 you could

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.360 
transducer just the 83 200 you could
select<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.790> transducer<00:00:42.739> or<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.160> have

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
select this transducer or if you have

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270 
select this transducer or if you have
the<00:00:44.640> 50<00:00:44.940> 200<00:00:45.120> plus<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:46.379> scan<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.100> select

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the 50 200 plus down scan you can select

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.700 
the 50 200 plus down scan you can select
this<00:00:47.520> transducer<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:48.989> situation<00:00:49.230> we

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
this transducer but in this situation we

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.799 
this transducer but in this situation we
have<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
have this one so you just go down to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.520 
have this one so you just go down to
this<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.170> hit<00:00:52.320> save<00:00:53.660> next<00:00:54.660> question<00:00:55.170> will<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this and hit save next question will you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.069 
this and hit save next question will you
primarily<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.550> unit<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.030> lakes<00:00:57.270> what

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
primarily use this unit on lakes what

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.750 
primarily use this unit on lakes what
this<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.379> doing<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.829> trying<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.280> set<00:00:59.460> up<00:00:59.579> your

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this is doing is trying to set up your

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.619 
this is doing is trying to set up your
use<00:00:59.940> mode<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.050> you're<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.730> saltwater<00:01:02.730> user

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
use mode so if you're a saltwater user

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
use mode so if you're a saltwater user
say<00:01:04.379> no<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> freshwater<00:01:05.309> user<00:01:05.790> say

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
say no if you're a freshwater user say

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
say no if you're a freshwater user say
yes<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.140> help<00:01:07.260> configure<00:01:08.250> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
yes and it will help configure this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.350 
yes and it will help configure this
owner<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> lake<00:01:10.880> are<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.090> going

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
owner so we are on a lake are you going

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.420 
owner so we are on a lake are you going
to<00:01:12.479> primarily<00:01:12.720> ice<00:01:13.229> fish<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.100> you're<00:01:14.250> ice

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to primarily ice fish so if you're ice

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.969 
to primarily ice fish so if you're ice
fishing<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> tell<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> unit<00:01:16.770> yes

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
fishing you want to tell the unit yes

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.149 
fishing you want to tell the unit yes
and<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.850> speed<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:18.930> sonar<00:01:19.290> change

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and it will speed up your sonar change

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.469 
and it will speed up your sonar change
your<00:01:20.310> color<00:01:20.490> palettes<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> lot<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
your color palettes and do a lot of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.929 
your color palettes and do a lot of
stuff<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> enhance<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> ice<00:01:22.560> fishing<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.580> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
stuff to enhance the ice fishing but in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.080 
stuff to enhance the ice fishing but in
this<00:01:24.060> case<00:01:24.270> we're<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.659> wrong<00:01:24.990> boat<00:01:25.759> do<00:01:26.759> fish

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
this case we're not wrong boat do fish

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.929 
this case we're not wrong boat do fish
and<00:01:27.299> less<00:01:27.450> than<00:01:27.780> 60<00:01:28.290> feet<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> water<00:01:28.939> it's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and less than 60 feet of water it's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730 
and less than 60 feet of water it's
asking<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.509> question<00:01:30.960> because<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.560> you're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
asking this question because if you're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
asking this question because if you're
in<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> shallow<00:01:32.369> lake<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.060> lots<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in a shallow lake with lots of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
in a shallow lake with lots of
vegetation<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.740> unit<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.159> help<00:01:35.400> dial

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
vegetation this unit can help dial

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
vegetation this unit can help dial
itself<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:36.930> lose<00:01:37.280> bottom

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
itself in so it will not lose bottom

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.880 
itself in so it will not lose bottom
very<00:01:38.430> often<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> does<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:40.320> will<00:01:40.470> regain

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
very often and if it does it will regain

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100 
very often and if it does it will regain
it<00:01:41.040> very<00:01:41.250> quickly<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.270> great<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it very quickly it's also great if you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.510 
it very quickly it's also great if you
have<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> trolling<00:01:43.799> motor<00:01:43.920> mount<00:01:44.310> where

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
have it on a trolling motor mount where

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.399 
have it on a trolling motor mount where
you<00:01:44.640> pull<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:45.000> transducer<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you pull your transducer in and out of
