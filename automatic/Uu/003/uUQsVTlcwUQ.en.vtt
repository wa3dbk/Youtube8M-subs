the app

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.380 
the app
feels<00:02:06.720> like<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:06.930> most<00:02:07.729> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.910> natural

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
feels like the most kind of natural

nothing<00:02:10.170> feels<00:02:10.289> natural<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.950> feels<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:11.910> much

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
nothing feels natural but feels as much

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.730 
nothing feels natural but feels as much
natural<00:02:12.210> playing<00:02:12.690> drums<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> mobile<00:02:13.560> device

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.610 
I made before on top of it so yeah now
we<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.770> see<00:02:50.000> we've<00:02:51.000> got<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.390> guitar<00:02:52.260> part<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
we can see we've got this guitar part I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.600 
we can see we've got this guitar part I
just<00:02:52.830> recorded<00:02:53.239> um<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:56.100> can<00:02:56.250> move<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
just recorded um and you can move it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.880 
just recorded um and you can move it
around<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.209> everything<00:02:59.000> um<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.530> play<00:03:01.739> your

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890

song<00:03:02.100> doing<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.200> it's<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.470> very<00:03:04.620> cool

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
song doing so I think it's a very cool

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.510 
song doing so I think it's a very cool
app<00:03:05.239> obviously<00:03:06.239> nothing<00:03:06.890> extremely<00:03:07.890> advanced

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
app obviously nothing extremely advanced

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.680 
app obviously nothing extremely advanced
but<00:03:08.850> um<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.450> think<00:03:10.350> if<00:03:10.680> you're<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.040> be<00:03:11.690> if

but um I think if you're going to be if

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.289 
but um I think if you're going to be if
you<00:03:12.840> want<00:03:13.080> some<00:03:13.760> maybe<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.880> really<00:03:15.120> like
