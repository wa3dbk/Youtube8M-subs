00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.789 
I'm only left with a space and one more
character<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.600> it's<00:01:49.719> not<00:01:49.840> private<00:01:50.049> so<00:01:50.530> again

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
character but it's not private so again

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.410 
character but it's not private so again
it's<00:01:50.979> like<00:01:51.100> Facebook<00:01:51.310> which<00:01:51.969> I<00:01:52.149> can<00:01:52.299> get

around what I would I kind of don't like

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.539 
around what I would I kind of don't like
is<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.789> is<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.979> available<00:01:57.219> to

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549

I think tasty mouthful BC maybe that's

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.010 
I think tasty mouthful BC maybe that's
completely<00:04:37.850> unrelated<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.810> certainly

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
completely unrelated but it certainly

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.240 
completely unrelated but it certainly
sounds<00:04:39.470> related<00:04:39.800> when<00:04:39.889> I'm<00:04:39.979> talking<00:04:40.190> about

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
sounds related when I'm talking about

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:49.830 
sounds related when I'm talking about
pork<00:04:41.060> shields<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:41.810> pork<00:04:42.199> swords<00:04:46.120> let's<00:04:47.120> see

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.610 

oh<00:04:50.840> wait<00:04:51.080> there<00:04:51.229> we<00:04:51.320> go

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
oh wait there we go

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.650 
oh wait there we go
why<00:04:52.010> all<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.280> pork<00:04:53.080> now<00:04:54.080> hey<00:04:54.590> he<00:04:54.740> says<00:04:55.660> he's

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
why all the pork now hey he says he's

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.180 
why all the pork now hey he says he's
updated<00:04:57.110> twice<00:04:57.320> so<00:04:57.500> he<00:04:57.590> missed<00:04:57.770> one<00:04:57.949> of<00:04:58.070> his

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
updated twice so he missed one of his

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.370 
updated twice so he missed one of his
updates<00:04:58.520> because<00:04:59.060> there's<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.449> course<00:04:59.479> no<00:05:00.350> way

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
updates because there's of course no way

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.620 
updates because there's of course no way
for<00:05:00.740> us<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.979> see<00:05:01.160> what<00:05:01.430> his<00:05:01.550> previous<00:05:02.060> messages

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
for us to see what his previous messages

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.189 
for us to see what his previous messages
were<00:05:03.190> so<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:05.180> know<00:05:05.270> an<00:05:05.360> interesting<00:05:05.599> attempt

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
were so you know an interesting attempt

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.770 
were so you know an interesting attempt
by<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.470> Nintendo<00:05:07.010> to<00:05:07.070> kind<00:05:07.430> of<00:05:07.490> blend<00:05:08.240> Twitter

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
by a Nintendo to kind of blend Twitter

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.200 
by a Nintendo to kind of blend Twitter
and<00:05:09.110> Facebook<00:05:09.349> and<00:05:09.889> their<00:05:10.130> 3ds<00:05:10.490> together<00:05:10.910> but

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
and Facebook and their 3ds together but

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.060 
and Facebook and their 3ds together but
ultimately<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.199> don't<00:05:12.470> think<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.800> works<00:05:12.979> very

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
ultimately I don't think it works very

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.820 
ultimately I don't think it works very
well<00:05:13.250> I<00:05:13.610> think<00:05:14.090> they<00:05:14.180> need<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:14.419> have<00:05:15.289> a<00:05:15.349> system

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
well I think they need to have a system

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.650 
well I think they need to have a system
that<00:05:15.979> allows<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.430> alert<00:05:16.789> up<00:05:16.940> here<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.330> think

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
that allows it to alert up here I think

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.540 
that allows it to alert up here I think
they<00:05:17.780> need<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.020> make<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.710> message<00:05:18.919> longer

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
they need to make the message longer

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.100 
they need to make the message longer
maybe<00:05:19.880> something<00:05:20.270> closer<00:05:20.449> to<00:05:20.570> Twitter<00:05:20.870> length

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
maybe something closer to Twitter length

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.700 
maybe something closer to Twitter length
and<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:22.280> think<00:05:22.550> that<00:05:22.729> they<00:05:22.880> need<00:05:23.060> to<00:05:23.590> would<00:05:24.590> be

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
and I think that they need to would be

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.320 
and I think that they need to would be
nice<00:05:24.860> if<00:05:25.010> they<00:05:25.130> allowed<00:05:25.310> direct<00:05:25.669> messaging<00:05:26.120> or

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
nice if they allowed direct messaging or

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.240 
nice if they allowed direct messaging or
if<00:05:26.780> nothing<00:05:27.260> else<00:05:27.380> at<00:05:27.560> least<00:05:27.620> an<00:05:27.800> archive<00:05:28.099> so

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
if nothing else at least an archive so

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.980 
if nothing else at least an archive so
you<00:05:28.340> could<00:05:28.460> see<00:05:28.580> what's<00:05:28.729> been<00:05:28.849> going<00:05:29.090> on<00:05:29.180> so

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
you could see what's been going on so

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.500 
you could see what's been going on so
there<00:05:30.289> you<00:05:30.380> go
