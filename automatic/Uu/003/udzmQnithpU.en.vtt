feature it's a good idea it's just I
guess<00:07:04.480> it's<00:07:04.660> pretty<00:07:04.990> bad<00:07:05.290> when<00:07:05.650> you<00:07:05.710> actually

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
guess it's pretty bad when you actually

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.960 
guess it's pretty bad when you actually
put<00:07:06.730> it<00:07:06.760> into<00:07:07.770> production<00:07:08.770> I<00:07:09.370> guess<00:07:09.760> you<00:07:09.940> could

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
put it into production I guess you could

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.170 
put it into production I guess you could
say<00:07:10.650> because<00:07:11.650> you<00:07:11.890> need<00:07:12.070> to<00:07:12.100> be<00:07:12.250> popular<00:07:12.580> you

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
say because you need to be popular you

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.060
