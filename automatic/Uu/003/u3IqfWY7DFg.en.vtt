simple<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.760> just<00:01:41.940> Tetris<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.870> but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
simple it's just Tetris right but

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
simple it's just Tetris right but
they're<00:01:44.010> actually<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:45.030> more<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630

they're actually the more the more I
play<00:01:45.810> did<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.080> realize<00:01:46.350> there's<00:01:46.560> they're

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
play did I realize there's they're

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.530 
play did I realize there's they're
symmetric<00:01:47.370> intricacies<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> should<00:01:48.630> say<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.440> it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
symmetric intricacies I should say to it

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.510 
symmetric intricacies I should say to it
see<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.110> clear<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.620> line<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.159> doesn't

once<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.970> send<00:02:06.420> two<00:02:06.600> lines<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:08.119> clear<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.200> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
once you send two lines we clear for you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.620 
once you send two lines we clear for you
send<00:02:10.409> three<00:02:10.590> now

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
send three now

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.450 
send three now
and<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.320> see<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> won<00:02:13.740> my<00:02:13.890> first<00:02:14.040> game<00:02:14.250> there

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
and you see I won my first game there

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.700 
and you see I won my first game there
are<00:02:14.550> 16<00:02:14.910> lines<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.510> his<00:02:15.690> 10<00:02:15.960> plus<00:02:16.260> i<00:02:16.380> had<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> KO

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
are 16 lines to his 10 plus i had a KO

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.460 
are 16 lines to his 10 plus i had a KO
so<00:02:17.490> i<00:02:17.520> get<00:02:17.700> myself<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.120> little<00:02:18.210> star<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.260> get

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
so i get myself a little star and I get

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.060 
so i get myself a little star and I get
to<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:20.490> closer<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.880> ranking<00:02:21.330> up<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.770> ranking

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
to get closer to ranking up the ranking

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.170 
to get closer to ranking up the ranking
system<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.550> game<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.820> actually<00:02:23.910> pretty

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
system in this game is actually pretty

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.600 
system in this game is actually pretty
cool<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.140> higher<00:02:25.260> rank<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.950> get<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
cool the the higher rank you get the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.300 
cool the the higher rank you get the
more<00:02:27.240> skilled<00:02:27.510> opponents<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.080> play

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
more skilled opponents you play

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.460 
more skilled opponents you play
basically<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.540> keeps<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.200> fairly

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
basically and it keeps you on a fairly

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.460 
basically and it keeps you on a fairly
good<00:02:31.790> skill<00:02:32.790> curve<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.300> think<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:35.930> also<00:02:36.930> combos

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
good skill curve I think but also combos

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.670 
good skill curve I think but also combos
so<00:02:38.130> if<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.730> say<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.090> clear<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:39.630> line<00:02:39.870> but

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
so if you say you clear one line but

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.470 
so if you say you clear one line but
then<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.980> clear<00:02:41.250> one<00:02:41.730> line<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:42.180> your<00:02:42.270> next

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
then you clear one line with your next

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.120 
then you clear one line with your next
block<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.930> one<00:02:43.200> line<00:02:43.410> with<00:02:43.590> your<00:02:43.680> next<00:02:43.950> block

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
block and one line with your next block

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.760 
block and one line with your next block
and<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.670> line<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.120> your<00:02:45.210> next<00:02:45.510> block<00:02:45.770> your

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
and one line with your next block your

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.340 
and one line with your next block your
combo<00:02:47.460> keeps<00:02:47.760> building<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.330> as<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:49.020> combo

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
combo keeps building and as your combo

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.680 
combo keeps building and as your combo
keeps<00:02:49.590> building<00:02:49.830> up<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.280> up<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.490> up<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.450> send

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
keeps building up and up and up you send

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.660 
keeps building up and up and up you send
more<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.080> more<00:02:52.230> lines<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.710> your<00:02:52.920> opponent<00:02:53.070> and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
more and more lines to your opponent and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.200 
more and more lines to your opponent and
so<00:02:54.360> that's<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.720> pretty<00:02:55.170> dangerous<00:02:55.590> way<00:02:55.770> to

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
so that's one pretty dangerous way to

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.860 
so that's one pretty dangerous way to
build<00:02:57.210> up<00:02:57.420> your<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:59.250> line<00:02:59.580> send<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.510> oh

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
build up your your line send it your oh

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.440 
build up your your line send it your oh
I<00:03:01.530> don't<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.460> I<00:03:02.490> was<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:03.030> there

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
I don't know what I was going for there

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.320 
I don't know what I was going for there
but<00:03:04.290> that's<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.950> good<00:03:05.190> way<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.370> piss<00:03:06.150> your

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
but that's it's a good way to piss your

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.660 
but that's it's a good way to piss your
opponent<00:03:06.780> off<00:03:06.900> at<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.410> very<00:03:07.590> least<00:03:07.800> you'll

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
opponent off at the very least you'll

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.940 
opponent off at the very least you'll
see<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:09.060> i<00:03:09.120> get<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> Tetris<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.930> sends<00:03:10.860> them

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
see here i get a Tetris and sends them

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.820 
see here i get a Tetris and sends them
over<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.310> him<00:03:11.460> which<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.360> just<00:03:12.510> fun<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:13.530> it's

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
over to him which is just fun it's it's

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.490 
over to him which is just fun it's it's
I<00:03:14.070> always<00:03:14.400> loved<00:03:14.790> knowing<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.960> there's<00:03:16.200> four

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
I always loved knowing that there's four

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.200 
I always loved knowing that there's four
lines<00:03:16.770> or<00:03:17.070> three<00:03:17.280> lines<00:03:17.460> going<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.090> my

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
lines or three lines going to my

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.910 
lines or three lines going to my
opponent<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:18.840> because<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.140> know<00:03:19.620> he's<00:03:19.770> going

see<00:03:24.720> these<00:03:24.840> little<00:03:25.020> bombs<00:03:25.380> these<00:03:25.710> little

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
see these little bombs these little

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.980 
see these little bombs these little
radioactive<00:03:26.550> symbols<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.270> gray<00:03:27.450> boxes

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
radioactive symbols on the gray boxes

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.170 
radioactive symbols on the gray boxes
the<00:03:28.590> gray<00:03:28.800> lines<00:03:29.070> are<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.730> ones<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.000> you

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
the gray lines are the ones that you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.670 
the gray lines are the ones that you
sent<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.510> your<00:03:30.630> opponent<00:03:31.050> now<00:03:31.230> when<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.470> put<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
sent to your opponent now when you put a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.430 
sent to your opponent now when you put a
block<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.490> bombs<00:03:33.270> they<00:03:33.720> blow<00:03:33.900> up<00:03:34.110> like<00:03:34.290> I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
block on the bombs they blow up like I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.250 
block on the bombs they blow up like I
just<00:03:34.500> showed<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:36.300> also<00:03:36.330> counts<00:03:36.930> to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
just showed you and that also counts to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.370 
just showed you and that also counts to
your<00:03:37.410> combos<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> while<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.990> is<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> good<00:03:40.350> idea

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
your combos so while it is a good idea

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.890 
your combos so while it is a good idea
to<00:03:40.980> send<00:03:41.250> your<00:03:41.490> opponent<00:03:41.940> as<00:03:42.270> many<00:03:42.540> lines<00:03:42.720> as

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
to send your opponent as many lines as

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.750 
to send your opponent as many lines as
you<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.980> can<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:45.120> combatted<00:03:45.780> by<00:03:46.760> simply

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
you can it can be combatted by simply

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.550 
you can it can be combatted by simply
putting<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.209> block<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.690> top<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
putting a block on top of the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.920 
putting a block on top of the
radioactive<00:03:49.860> piece<00:03:50.370> there's<00:03:51.209> quite<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> few

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
radioactive piece there's quite a few

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.470 
radioactive piece there's quite a few
layers<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.530> complexity<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.880> go<00:03:54.030> along<00:03:54.270> with

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
layers of complexity to go along with

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.380 
layers of complexity to go along with
this<00:03:54.630> game<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.430> keep<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.610> keep<00:03:57.330> you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
this game and keep you keep you
