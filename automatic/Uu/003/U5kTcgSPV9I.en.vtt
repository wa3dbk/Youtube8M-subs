you<00:01:40.180> do<00:01:40.330> get<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.570> retard<00:01:41.050> or<00:01:41.259> they<00:01:41.860> call<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.070> a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
you do get a retard or they call it a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.620 
you do get a retard or they call it a
rebate<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> sport

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.760 
Virginia Beach Virginia
that's<00:01:49.509> called<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.869> disaster

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
that's called a disaster

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.490 
that's called a disaster
and<00:01:51.670> rock<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.300> roll

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.830 

sliding<00:01:55.430> across<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.790> coping<00:01:56.360> there<00:01:56.510> now<00:01:56.660> he's

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
sliding across the coping there now he's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.510 
sliding across the coping there now he's
going<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.050> transition<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.740> smaller<00:01:58.130> ramp

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
going to transition to the smaller ramp

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.820 
going to transition to the smaller ramp
now<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.330> skaters<00:01:59.780> have<00:01:59.960> told<00:02:00.260> me<00:02:00.440> that<00:02:00.680> this

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
now the skaters have told me that this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.560 
now the skaters have told me that this
is<00:02:00.890> actually<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.460> new<00:02:01.670> wrinkle<00:02:02.060> for<00:02:02.090> them<00:02:02.390> for

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
is actually a new wrinkle for them for

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.390 
is actually a new wrinkle for them for
the<00:02:02.690> majority<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.260> them<00:02:03.560> they<00:02:03.590> are<00:02:03.770> not<00:02:04.100> used

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
the majority of them they are not used

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.100 
the majority of them they are not used
to<00:02:04.700> skating<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.510> ramps<00:02:05.930> that<00:02:05.990> are

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
to skating on ramps that are

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.480 
to skating on ramps that are
back-to-back<00:02:06.800> like<00:02:07.040> this

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
back-to-back like this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.340 
back-to-back like this
so<00:02:07.610> transitioning<00:02:08.240> from<00:02:08.390> one<00:02:08.750> ramp<00:02:09.080> to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
so transitioning from one ramp to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.110 
so transitioning from one ramp to
another<00:02:09.680> is<00:02:10.100> something<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.670> they're<00:02:10.820> all

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
another is something that they're all

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.180 
another is something that they're all
not<00:02:11.420> particularly<00:02:11.930> familiar<00:02:12.290> with<00:02:12.620> some<00:02:13.100> of

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
not particularly familiar with some of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.580 
not particularly familiar with some of
them<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.610> veterans<00:02:14.000> are<00:02:14.300> but<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.990> younger

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
them the veterans are but the younger

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.170 
them the veterans are but the younger
skaters<00:02:15.800> it's<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.640> be<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> new<00:02:16.910> wrinkle

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
skaters it's going to be a new wrinkle

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.820 
skaters it's going to be a new wrinkle
and<00:02:17.450> they're<00:02:17.570> having<00:02:17.840> some<00:02:18.020> problems<00:02:18.410> with<00:02:18.500> it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and they're having some problems with it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.190 
and they're having some problems with it
I<00:02:19.010> think<00:02:19.490> that<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> skater<00:02:20.300> who<00:02:20.480> uses<00:02:20.780> that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
I think that the skater who uses that

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140 
I think that the skater who uses that
transition<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.920> little<00:02:22.010> bit<00:02:22.220> more<00:02:22.490> going<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
transition a little bit more going to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.580 
transition a little bit more going to
get<00:02:23.270> some<00:02:23.420> additional<00:02:23.630> points<00:02:24.200> torque<00:02:24.410> that's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
get some additional points torque that's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.020 
get some additional points torque that's
probably<00:02:25.010> going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.340> help<00:02:25.520> their<00:02:25.760> Drive

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
probably going to help their Drive

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.510 
probably going to help their Drive

Sergey Ventura with a nice run finally
goes<00:02:28.730> down<00:02:29.230> let's<00:02:30.230> look<00:02:30.470> at<00:02:30.620> one<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.800> these

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
goes down let's look at one of these

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.130 
goes down let's look at one of these
maneuvers<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:31.940> see<00:02:32.150> these<00:02:32.330> guys<00:02:32.540> get<00:02:32.840> very

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
maneuvers you see these guys get very

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.690 
maneuvers you see these guys get very
high<00:02:33.380> up<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.890> air<00:02:34.010> they<00:02:34.220> are<00:02:34.340> able<00:02:34.670> to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
high up in the air they are able to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.700 
high up in the air they are able to
twist<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.750> board<00:02:36.020> around<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:36.650> do

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
twist the board around they do

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.590 
twist the board around they do

are not really familiar with a ramp
built<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:23.689> one<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.049> so

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
built just like this one is so

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.080 
built just like this one is so
consequently<00:03:24.530> they<00:03:25.010> tend<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.489> spend<00:03:25.700> most<00:03:25.879> of

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
consequently they tend to spend most of

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.729 
consequently they tend to spend most of
their<00:03:26.209> time<00:03:26.269> on<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:26.629> bigger<00:03:26.900> vertical<00:03:27.470> ramp

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
their time on the bigger vertical ramp

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.649 
their time on the bigger vertical ramp
and<00:03:28.519> that's<00:03:28.700> where<00:03:28.879> you're<00:03:29.030> going<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.329> see<00:03:29.510> the

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
and that's where you're going to see the

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.990 
and that's where you're going to see the
big<00:03:29.840> trips<00:03:30.140> nice<00:03:31.069> that<00:03:31.400> was<00:03:31.519> called<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.790> very

John Connor let's look at that twist

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.960 
John Connor let's look at that twist
again<00:03:42.010> 540<00:03:43.010> degrees<00:03:43.310> one<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.790> half

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970
