00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.639
 resorts 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:17.090
 belokurihe is fresh mountain air 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.740
 crystal clear water attentive 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.890
 staff treatment rooms 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.810
 equipped with the latest technology 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.650
 luxury accommodation rooms as well 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.230
 wide range of additional services 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.360
 resorts belokurihe is a unique chance 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.250
 get to know nature and stay 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.079
 a little away from the hustle and bustle 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.989
 why go to all sorts of exotic places 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.410
 near the equator where it is so hot during the day 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.930
 that you can fry eggs on the stones and where 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.890
 can be absolutely out of the blue 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.420
 pick up some tropical 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.730
 fever 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.800
 when with no less pleasure you can 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.640
 visit belokuriha 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.640
 and most importantly we have no zombies here 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.160
 I apologize for this small 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.140
 a gimmick but realistically I never 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.400
 I heard that we have some zombies here 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.350
 nibbling on someone 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.900
 or to make the entire resort extinct 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.570
 some kind of dumb experiment by scientists or 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.660
 Like that, people come to us to 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:36.170
 get healthy have fun and relax 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:38.330
 they are okay you understand so guys and 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.000
 women who did the original yes and 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.620
 he began to produce all sorts of devil 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 seed for your zombie hit 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.540
 and decided to bring under them all fat 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.850
 such a line so was born d 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.770
 Thailand reptile independently 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.440
 supplement not requiring the original 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.450
 the game and telling the story further 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.550
 adventures of four survivors in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.710
 original poor thing if you think that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.340
 hitting the ship our heroes found peace 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.369
 and comfort and coffee with cookies you deep 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.000
 You are mistaken here is exactly 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.170
 same as it was recently on the island 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.959
 of course the ship is losing control 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.810
 stumbles upon reefs inevitably endures 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.019
 wreck and our heroes turn out to be 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.320
 where would you think on the new tropical 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:28.750
 the island and in the best traditions cost us 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.750
 just catch your breath just like that 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.270
 okay okay, you already understand zombies too 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.660
 understood and e so generally even more so initially 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.520
 knew 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.250
 let's finally have a talk in the game 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.830
 although to be honest, then speak specially 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.650
 nothing rip tight different from 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.380
 original q thailand as picture 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950
 in a slightly bent and me reducing 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.810
 the mirror 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.060
 in other words, we face a little more 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.390
 role-playing rich in gameplay 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.980
 exterminated to the open world zombies and 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.230
 clinical but not too long 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.720
 having the same plot 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.940
 strengths and weaknesses 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.130
 that is, walk wandering in company with 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.100
 friends and kill the zombies here still 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.440
 cool though monotonous especially 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.810
 at first when there is no firearm at all I 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.770
 since the original I can not understand why 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.000
 have a character class 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.640
 specializing in gunshot 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.240
 weapons if it appears only after 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.030
 halfway through the game 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.910
 logic food in front of us all the same heroes 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.100
 plus one new former marine specially 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.560
 for which they invented and introduced a new type 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.920
 weapons claws against the rest 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.959
 characters this friend does not stand out 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.780
 not at all some there 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.010
 memorable character nothing at all 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.770
 except for a cap of positive 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.110
 changes I would note this from now on 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.209
 heroes and the next survivors 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.400
 will constantly change their place 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.590
 dislocation in fact the whole game will be 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.110
 come down to that first in one 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.080
 story quest find a new point then 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.880
 one or two quests to do the cleaning 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.370
 approaches to it by strengthening the position of a 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.430
 then once more and hold it 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.790
 will have from the waves of the upcoming Zamiatin 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.830
 hi was not too great 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.620
 but at least some process dynamics 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.750
 it gives and even it motivates at least 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.910
 a little but go through extra 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.740
 quests to collect all the trash that 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.580
 You can give your month we write to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.810
 they got faster faster and stronger and 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.380
 respectively during the very 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.000
 defense 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.550
 more help still introduced boats 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.830
 to swim because by 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.890
 the island where they threw our heroes 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.960
 recently passed all the monsoon and now there 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.660
 flooded areas more than 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.580
 enough though the architecture is first 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.130
 locations of such that almost where 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.640
 You can get there by car and by 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.950
 the boat 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.230
 another thing is that this very first island 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.510
 noticeably lost in the territory in order 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.140
 to study all the key points 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.330
 are located 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.210
 or on the road or near water 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.060
 left-right walk has no 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.240
 there is no sense even a parody of meaning 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.570
 because there in these very sides of 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.660
 roads or from a point you can stumble upon 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.060
 the so-called dungeons that is special 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.820
 locations crowded zombies and at the end 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.169
 which is worth some boss around 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.919
 lying around 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.400
 special or just rare loot 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.780
 hello mr pg in its purest form 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.480
 whole rip that even in the scenery 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.250
 duplicates his older brother begin 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.930
 we are on a tropical island afterwards 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.780
 We move to the city and in between times 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.860
 get into the catacombs of these very 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.710
 catacombs 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.979
 This is honestly the most memorable 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.930
 the only interesting place in the game 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.640
 moment for the entire passage in which I 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.250
 felt something similar to the atmosphere 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.380
 honestly though on the other hand the same 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.660
 moment shows that no damn not 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.960
 changed in terms of lighting which is like 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.210
 it was wooden and remained exactly like 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.760
 and the plot stayed head on clinical and 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.970
 staffed by the most worn my 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.000
 stamps from the final boss i'm not at all 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.940
 knew whether to cry whether to laugh well and 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.540
 up small spoiler 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.610
 it will all end by nothing 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.100
 if we sum up something before us 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.890
 strong prohodnyak class representative 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.930
 rip tight is essentially the same ddl 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.660
 he is in the same scenery with the same 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.450
 characters and a minimum of innovations with 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.130
 same meaningless and merciless 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.360
 plot and other other other other 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.980
 so recommended by the company 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.750
 the exclusivity of four people and 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.000
 if this company passed the original then 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.760
 here you can import your old ones 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.800
 characters play it alone yes 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.670
 if the original ddl is also not 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.920
 liked not recommended 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.990
 categorically and on it I will allow 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:14.610
 imagine dissolving in a cloud of white smoke 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.610
 to new meetings us top game room
