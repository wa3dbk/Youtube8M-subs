00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.599
 today a new video on the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.670
 Kanal and I want more here again 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 As I said, videos do unboxing videos 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.900
 I already announced but I 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.160
 would like to increase the quality because 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.340
 the video last time was pretty 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.170
 bad but today was a video again 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.340
 for photography and the topic 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.800
 I already have many perspectives 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.140
 you always say yes if yes 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.680
 you start with photography think me 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.480
 at that time not to the perspective 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.309
 but also advanced think yes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.829
 Perspective we do again 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.879
 down everything is right but 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.860
 you should still keep in mind one with as 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.390
 you can now you can me too 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.430
 Always explain it by example 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.500
 football field you can also play 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.640
 different corners of a motive 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.649
 If you have important pictures now 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 of anything makes any talk 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.969
 shooting has of some model then 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.649
 Do not just pay attention to it 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.210
 but do not just make it 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.460
 pay attention that you are not from above 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.680
 photographed but also possible 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.920
 cover many positions if you are 20 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.600
 Pictures then always the same place 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.610
 you'll get angry later or 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.380
 Maybe not, but I'll give you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.490
 as a tip with you will someday 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.259
 get angry if you continue 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.119
 to be advanced that she does not 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.159
 do the same looking for you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 as many different places as possible 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.200
 many how it works later he could always 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 still delete and try as possible 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.930
 many motives in your shooting with 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 or just your position 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.380
 to change 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.090
 rather for example in the example 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.860
 soccer field if you have a football game 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.180
 photographed then a look that he 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.009
 behind the gate is also with 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.020
 different focal lengths works 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.119
 then from one side of the field then 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 of the other team from and am 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.920
 Then we just take the picture 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.909
 what has become the best and puts 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.619
 do not always go to the same place 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.550
 do not try as much as possible 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.980
 could behave inconspicuously 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.510
 go do something at the concert 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.760
 sometimes that comes around when he does 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.440
 standing in the crowd and then too 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.410
 try other focal lengths too 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.000
 use and so on and there you can 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.230
 doing really great things and through 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.820
 This tip can actually be repeated 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.420
 right company out at the beginning 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.460
 I often did wrong then yes 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.040
 mostly put in one place so 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.350
 not always sometimes and this tip 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.940
 would like to give with you give 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.170
 there are still quite a few cases 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.710
 Not all of them are also a type for 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.080
 beginner and just try as possible 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.700
 many positions for your pictures too 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.640
 then just use that 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.430
 best picture and so doing professionals 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.420
 of course, too, and makes like profi and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.420
 I hope I can help you
