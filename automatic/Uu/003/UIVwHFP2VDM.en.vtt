00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.500
 good 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 The first thing to do is to leave 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.890
 this book will be in the description of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.890
 video 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.790
 and good 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.870
 Once the same link sometimes appears 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.490
 automatically here in 5 seconds or if 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.490
 do not stop automatic it's worth here 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.219
 good once you have downloaded the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.370
 full file that will take us 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.530
 a lot this is like a kilowatt x 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.400
 we go to my documents or where 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.400
 have your downloads 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.540
 it is not 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:47.440
 and if it's going to appear, it's active 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.750
 let's right click and extract here 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.710
 after 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.250
 if it appears to us that same mode is 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.250
 bring here 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.340
 then again this 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.350
 lately extra from here 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.330
 and after this we will appear this 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.580
 activision folder 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.100
 ultimate spider-man and this one has 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.200
 guarded 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.260
 you can do it in two ways 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.270
 since 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.720
 how are you going to go to my documents 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.970
 and that this folder can return everything 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.640
 you have to here or delete all the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.650
 folder replace it by the one that already 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.560
 you have or good for which you downloaded 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.560
 or just copy the shape 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.450
 Y 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.299
 eliminate everything you have from here and 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:53.340
 Pasting the ceip like that is a bit easier 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.420
 I think 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.569
 well you'll have two your suits the black 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.360
 all those but you'll have to go back to 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.810
 start the game from the beginning but 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.710
 you will have all the costumes all the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.500
 characters all places and everything 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.500
 let's do a little test 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:28.040
 before I clarified that this game in this 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.770
 computer or pc looks very bad 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.570
 graphics 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.240
 but I have another in which it looks better 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.810
 but in this I have the recorder and that 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.930
 and here I have a better good microphone 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.930
 I go 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.740
 I say good here 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.790
 well here all the characters have 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.830
 as I said all the covers 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.850
 all illustrations 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.850
 and the costumes 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.420
 as I said they look very bad but if 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.460
 you have a very good field that they have 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.810
 direct x 9 you will see very good 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.810
 I have in my hands here 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.050
 all right 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.000
 Y 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.849
 I have a table before 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.119
 for those who see the house of toys 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:41.300
 many remember that he had a one that 

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:45.680
 called spider-man after 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.039
 Well, if it just broke, it broke. 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.870
 the leg when it's starting to line 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.750
 and as it came 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.990
 and it breaks your leg so the videos of 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.440
 the house and the toys I will not do until 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.700
 in a while until there is a substitute 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.760
 there is no other idea so good the house of 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.210
 the toys is my original idea to 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.210
 less than me 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:23.150
