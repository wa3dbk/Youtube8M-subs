know an entirely new material here that
really<00:00:48.100> allows<00:00:48.550> us<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.970> create<00:00:49.150> this

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
really allows us to create this

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.830 
really allows us to create this
streamlined<00:00:50.650> design<00:00:51.240> that<00:00:52.240> you<00:00:52.450> take<00:00:52.630> a<00:00:52.660> look

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
streamlined design that you take a look

here<00:00:52.900> come<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.670> nine<00:00:55.360> series<00:00:55.630> has<00:00:55.900> been

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
here come the nine series has been

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.440 
here come the nine series has been
crafted<00:00:56.320> using<00:00:56.530> euro<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.760> why<00:00:58.000> is<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.240> room

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
crafted using euro so why is the room

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.930 
crafted using euro so why is the room
it's<00:00:59.200> a<00:00:59.350> lightweight<00:00:59.710> alloy<00:00:59.980> normally<00:01:00.700> used

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
it's a lightweight alloy normally used

on the spring game offer it will look
great<00:01:11.920> for<00:01:12.220> years<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.640> we<00:01:12.790> have<00:01:12.910> under<00:01:13.150> let
