thing<00:00:19.090> worried<00:00:19.359> about<00:00:19.539> intonation<00:00:19.810> this<00:00:20.710> is

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
thing worried about intonation this is

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.500 
thing worried about intonation this is
about<00:00:21.039> making<00:00:21.250> each<00:00:21.519> string<00:00:21.910> resonates<00:00:22.150> the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
about making each string resonates the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.259 
about making each string resonates the
best<00:00:22.750> of<00:00:22.869> its<00:00:22.990> ability<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:24.160> with<00:00:24.490> extend<00:00:25.150> range

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
best of its ability so with extend range

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
prototype of a minute yeah I can show

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.119 
prototype of a minute yeah I can show
you<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> couple<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.379> mine<00:00:49.530> live<00:00:49.710> around<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you a couple of mine live around the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.549 
you a couple of mine live around the
corner<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.809> may<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.870> expanding<00:00:52.440> more

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
corner that we may be expanding more

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.840 
corner that we may be expanding more
difficult<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.100> will<00:00:53.219> look<00:00:53.339> like<00:00:53.399> when<00:00:53.699> they

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
difficult they will look like when they

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
difficult they will look like when they
come<00:00:54.000> through<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.269> production<00:00:54.690> models<00:00:54.960> sure

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
come through as production models sure

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350 
come through as production models sure
okay

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.130
