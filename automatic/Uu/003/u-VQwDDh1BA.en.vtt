that<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.870> did<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:45.190> then<00:01:45.370> he<00:01:45.400> can<00:01:45.610> cancer<00:01:46.060> to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
that you did and then he can cancer to

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.880 
that you did and then he can cancer to
something<00:01:46.450> or<00:01:46.570> some<00:01:46.720> tip<00:01:46.900> damage<00:01:47.170> like

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
something or some tip damage like

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.719 
something or some tip damage like
drifting<00:01:48.630> fireballs<00:01:49.630> are<00:01:49.750> 10

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
drifting fireballs are 10

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.919 
drifting fireballs are 10
so<00:01:52.729> there's<00:01:52.909> me<00:01:53.060> being<00:01:53.240> proven<00:01:53.539> wrong<00:01:53.600> he

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
so there's me being proven wrong he

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.580 
so there's me being proven wrong he
missed<00:01:54.170> one<00:01:54.409> kick<00:01:55.009> of<00:01:55.130> ladder<00:01:55.340> optic<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.909> it
