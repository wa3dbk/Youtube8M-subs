the fourth wave of ships for x-wing is

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.330 
the fourth wave of ships for x-wing is
here<00:00:09.650> and<00:00:09.799> there's<00:00:09.920> a<00:00:09.980> lot<00:00:10.129> to<00:00:10.219> be<00:00:10.309> excited

about<00:00:10.820> among<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:11.450> contents<00:00:12.049> of<00:00:12.139> the<00:00:12.260> four<00:00:12.530> new

expansion packs however I think that the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.200

Thai<00:00:15.379> Phantom<00:00:16.039> is<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.309> most<00:00:16.550> exciting<00:00:17.060> of

that's<00:01:44.390> certainly<00:01:44.870> not<00:01:45.020> entirely<00:01:45.440> wrong<00:01:45.800> but

shortly the hull and shield values

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.000

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
aren't bad the ship is slightly more

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.920 
aren't bad the ship is slightly more
durable<00:01:55.460> than<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.670> standard<00:01:56.090> Thai<00:01:56.390> fighter<00:01:56.720> but

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930

phantoms have a very interesting upgrade
bar<00:03:11.420> as<00:03:11.540> well<00:03:11.720> they<00:03:12.440> can<00:03:12.590> take<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.739> crew<00:03:13.159> upgrade

and a systems upgrade this is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.619 
and a systems upgrade this is
interesting<00:03:15.950> because<00:03:16.400> no<00:03:16.730> other<00:03:16.879> tie<00:03:17.239> class

thirty-two points so here we see what is

probably the main drawback of this ship
it's<00:03:32.239> expensive<00:03:32.989> which<00:03:33.889> isn't<00:03:34.099> surprising

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
it's expensive which isn't surprising

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.000 
it's expensive which isn't surprising

cloak or Dee cloak that's kind of cool
and<00:05:56.240> will<00:05:56.420> make<00:05:56.570> Thai<00:05:56.780> phantoms<00:05:57.260> even<00:05:57.590> tougher

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
and will make Thai phantoms even tougher

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.440 
and will make Thai phantoms even tougher
to<00:05:58.010> damage<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.990> advanced<00:06:00.410> cloaking<00:06:00.710> device

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
to damage the advanced cloaking device

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.970 
to damage the advanced cloaking device
costs<00:06:02.450> a<00:06:02.510> whopping<00:06:02.540> four<00:06:03.200> points<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:03.830> can

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
costs a whopping four points and can

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.790 
costs a whopping four points and can
only<00:06:04.160> be<00:06:04.430> assigned<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:05.240> a<00:06:05.330> Thai<00:06:05.630> phantom<00:06:06.230> but

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
only be assigned to a Thai phantom but

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.560 
only be assigned to a Thai phantom but
this<00:06:07.010> is<00:06:07.130> going<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.370> get<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.580> ton<00:06:08.060> of<00:06:08.090> play

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
this is going to get a ton of play

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.930 
this is going to get a ton of play
because<00:06:09.410> it<00:06:09.530> allows<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:10.070> ship<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.340> perform<00:06:10.820> a

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
because it allows the ship to perform a

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.500 
because it allows the ship to perform a
free<00:06:11.180> cloak<00:06:11.630> action<00:06:12.140> after<00:06:12.530> making<00:06:12.770> an<00:06:12.980> attack

free cloak action after making an attack

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.600 
free cloak action after making an attack
this<00:06:14.510> is<00:06:14.630> incredible<00:06:15.320> because<00:06:15.950> a<00:06:15.980> Dee<00:06:16.280> cloaked

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610
