00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.469
 Talk about two pokemon playing pokemon ex 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.660
 and pokemon i 'll give you that 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.360
 innovations presented on show you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.289
 were yesterday or canoeing that was 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.449
 and just go to Japan so all those 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.890
 protagonists have now 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.080
 different types of skin so you can 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.359
 now many choose otherwise 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.250
 Now for a picture of some 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.960
 see selection and of which one can 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.340
 then choose one and so on 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.410
 which I then play the game by 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.110
 do not know if you can change everything and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.760
 as well as the eye color and everything 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.340
 In any case, that will be very nice 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.770
 cool so I think I'm very happy 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 because such a selection of so many 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.610
 variations value is very cool so it will 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.039
 the gameplay immensely change enormously 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.090
 even and i thought it was cool so i did 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.100

 Trailer was shown in the year 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.110
