00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
right yes so yeah so we got our pink

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.199

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
banner or pink tablecloth up like a

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.479 
banner or pink tablecloth up like a
banner<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.690> then<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.109> got<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.530> white<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:52.739> and

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
banner and then we got the white one and

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.949 
banner and then we got the white one and
you<00:03:53.700> really<00:03:53.970> can't<00:03:54.239> see<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> white<00:03:54.780> one

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
you really can't see the white one

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.500 
you really can't see the white one
because<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.860> kind<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.730> blends<00:03:56.970> with<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.300> wall

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
because it kind of blends with the wall

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.540 
because it kind of blends with the wall
but<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.900> reason<00:03:58.349> why<00:03:58.470> I'm<00:03:58.590> using<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:59.099> as<00:03:59.340> so

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
but the reason why I'm using that as so

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.649 
but the reason why I'm using that as so
we<00:03:59.730> can<00:03:59.940> stick

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
we can stick

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.989 
we can stick
really<00:04:01.140> easily<00:04:01.879> hopefully<00:04:02.879> I<00:04:03.120> think<00:04:03.930> though

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:04.999 
really easily hopefully I think though

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.809 
really easily hopefully I think though
was<00:04:05.999> a<00:04:06.439> banner<00:04:07.439> so<00:04:08.099> you're<00:04:08.280> gonna<00:04:08.370> see<00:04:08.670> and

was a banner so you're gonna see and

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.970 
was a banner so you're gonna see and

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
see that in just a little bit we are

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.180 
see that in just a little bit we are
almost<00:04:16.620> done<00:04:16.979> we're<00:04:17.789> at<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.030> last<00:04:18.269> letter<00:04:18.599> and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
almost done we're at the last letter and

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.310 
almost done we're at the last letter and
of<00:04:20.190> birthday<00:04:21.030> we're<00:04:21.509> gonna<00:04:21.630> put<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:22.019> and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
of birthday we're gonna put that on and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.189 
of birthday we're gonna put that on and
so<00:04:22.470> what<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.370> do<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:25.759> I'm<00:04:26.759> going<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.180> use<00:04:27.870> I'm

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
so what I do is I'm going to use I'm

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.029 
so what I do is I'm going to use I'm
using<00:04:28.229> regulars<00:04:29.780> just<00:04:30.780> ribbon<00:04:31.169> curl<00:04:31.650> ribbon

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
using regulars just ribbon curl ribbon

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.140 
using regulars just ribbon curl ribbon
okay<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.979> we<00:04:34.979> find<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.430> this<00:04:35.639> works<00:04:35.880> a

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
okay and we find that this works a

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.570 
okay and we find that this works a
little<00:04:36.449> bit<00:04:36.599> easier<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.080> glue<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.430> I'm

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
little bit easier to glue and so I'm

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.890 
little bit easier to glue and so I'm
just<00:04:38.610> kind<00:04:39.030> of<00:04:39.180> stapling<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.370> because<00:04:41.900> that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
just kind of stapling and because that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.950 
just kind of stapling and because that
you<00:04:43.050> can<00:04:43.229> use<00:04:43.410> whatever<00:04:44.479> ribbon<00:04:45.479> or<00:04:45.660> whatever

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
you can use whatever ribbon or whatever

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.839 
you can use whatever ribbon or whatever
but<00:04:46.110> we<00:04:46.229> find<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.830> actually<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.340> lot<00:04:47.610> it's

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
but we find this is actually a lot it's

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.999 
but we find this is actually a lot it's
a<00:04:48.000> lot<00:04:48.030> lighter<00:04:48.570> so<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.259> not<00:04:49.470> going<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.740> be<00:04:49.830> so

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
a lot lighter so it's not going to be so

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.290 
a lot lighter so it's not going to be so
heavy<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.490> hang<00:04:51.590> so<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.070> then<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.520> daraa<00:04:53.789> we

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
heavy to hang so and then the daraa we

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.909 
heavy to hang so and then the daraa we
just<00:04:54.479> pull<00:04:54.630> this<00:04:54.750> back<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.800> then<00:04:55.979> Hodari<00:04:56.840> is

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
just pull this back and then Hodari is

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.520 
just pull this back and then Hodari is
going<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.220> glue<00:04:59.810> we<00:05:00.810> just<00:05:00.990> kind<00:05:01.169> of<00:05:01.199> slide<00:05:01.410> it

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
going to glue we just kind of slide it

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.920 
going to glue we just kind of slide it
down<00:05:01.710> as<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.370> go<00:05:02.520> along<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:02.940> then<00:05:03.090> she<00:05:03.389> gets<00:05:03.599> to

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
down as it go along and then she gets to

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.560 
down as it go along and then she gets to
glue<00:05:04.139> that<00:05:04.410> on<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:07.620> we're<00:05:07.800> just<00:05:07.979> for<00:05:08.280> extra

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570
