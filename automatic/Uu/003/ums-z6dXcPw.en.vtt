00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.029 
another eight hour question I repeat so
it's<00:00:18.449> um<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:19.470> probably<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
it's um it's probably going to be a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.349 
it's um it's probably going to be a
little<00:00:20.430> ahead<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:22.609> how<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.970> doing<00:00:24.029> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
little ahead of how I was doing it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.009 
little ahead of how I was doing it
before<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:27.269> there's<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> couple<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.930> new

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
before so there's a couple of new

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.800 
before so there's a couple of new
additions<00:00:28.439> I've<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.769> Bart's<00:00:29.070> treehouse<00:00:29.810> and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
additions I've got Bart's treehouse and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930 
additions I've got Bart's treehouse and
they've<00:00:31.769> also<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> library<00:00:32.489> that's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
they've also got the library that's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.299 
they've also got the library that's
given<00:00:33.239> me<00:00:33.270> Bart<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.899> Milton<00:00:34.440> although<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
given me Bart and Milton although at the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:46.020 
given me Bart and Milton although at the
moment<00:00:35.340> they're<00:00:35.730> both<00:00:35.880> doing<00:00:36.059> 24-hour<00:00:36.719> quests

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.880 

that's<00:00:46.690> how<00:00:46.809> it's<00:00:46.960> going<00:00:47.110> at<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.320> moment<00:00:47.379> I've

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
that's how it's going at the moment I've

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.549 
that's how it's going at the moment I've
expanded<00:00:48.370> my<00:00:48.610> land<00:00:48.969> down<00:00:49.600> towards<00:00:50.170> this<00:00:50.320> way<00:00:50.379> I

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
expanded my land down towards this way I

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.229 
expanded my land down towards this way I
didn't<00:00:51.039> actually<00:00:51.129> realize<00:00:51.730> there<00:00:51.910> was<00:00:51.969> water

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
didn't actually realize there was water

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.850 
didn't actually realize there was water
down<00:00:52.480> there<00:00:52.629> but<00:00:52.899> apparently<00:00:53.769> there<00:00:53.890> is<00:00:55.860> so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
down there but apparently there is so

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.229 
down there but apparently there is so
I'm<00:00:56.949> probably<00:00:57.040> going<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.370> continue<00:00:57.760> expanding

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
I'm probably going to continue expanding

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.209 
I'm probably going to continue expanding
downwards<00:00:58.989> for<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.469> moment<00:00:59.680> it's<00:01:00.010> just

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
downwards for the moment it's just

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.790 
downwards for the moment it's just
cheaper<00:01:00.730> land<00:01:01.379> we'll<00:01:02.379> have<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.559> see<00:01:02.769> how

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
cheaper land we'll have to see how

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.030 
cheaper land we'll have to see how
things<00:01:03.040> go<00:01:07.200> I've<00:01:08.200> also<00:01:08.380> had<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:08.680> little<00:01:08.860> bit

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
things go I've also had a little bit

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.930 
things go I've also had a little bit
more<00:01:09.159> lucky<00:01:09.430> in<00:01:09.610> my<00:01:09.820> scratchies<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:11.729> I've<00:01:12.729> got

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
more lucky in my scratchies so I've got

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:22.050 
more lucky in my scratchies so I've got
a<00:01:12.970> couple<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.380> 2,500<00:01:14.380> prizes<00:01:21.060> probably

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
a couple of 2,500 prizes probably

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.210 
a couple of 2,500 prizes probably
attribute<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:22.509> towards<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.950> level

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
attribute that towards the level

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.310 
attribute that towards the level
increasing<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.270> have<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.479> feeling<00:01:25.899> it's<00:01:26.020> kind<00:01:26.229> of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
increasing I have a feeling it's kind of

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.190 
increasing I have a feeling it's kind of
rig<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.979> not<00:01:27.759> give<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:28.030> any<00:01:28.060> big<00:01:28.420> wins<00:01:28.659> until

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
rig to not give you any big wins until

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.380 
rig to not give you any big wins until
you're<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.380> higher<00:01:29.619> level<00:01:29.950> but<00:01:30.310> maybe<00:01:31.210> I'm

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
you're a higher level but maybe I'm

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:39.149 
you're a higher level but maybe I'm
wrong<00:01:31.509> let's<00:01:31.780> just<00:01:31.899> my<00:01:32.050> opinion<00:01:38.069> have<00:01:39.069> the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
wrong let's just my opinion have the

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.570 
wrong let's just my opinion have the
volume<00:01:39.310> all<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.580> way<00:01:39.640> down<00:01:39.850> search<00:01:40.119> for<00:01:40.270> that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580
