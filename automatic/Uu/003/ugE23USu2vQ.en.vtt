00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
collection and I was trying to decide

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.459 
collection and I was trying to decide
for<00:00:10.910> not<00:00:11.910> too<00:00:12.090> long<00:00:12.240> but<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.840> little<00:00:13.349> while

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
for not too long but a little while

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.330 
for not too long but a little while
about<00:00:13.740> which<00:00:14.250> knife<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.820> should<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.210> first<00:00:15.599> and

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
about which knife I should do first and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.450 
about which knife I should do first and
I<00:00:17.340> was<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.940> go<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> knife<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.400> I

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I was going to go with the knife that I

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.929 
I was going to go with the knife that I
use<00:00:20.990> most<00:00:21.990> often<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.830> daily<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.580> almost

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
use most often on a daily or almost

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.859 
use most often on a daily or almost
daily<00:00:24.600> basis<00:00:25.369> but<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> decided<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
daily basis but then I decided that the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.540 
daily basis but then I decided that the
best<00:00:27.900> thing<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.529> would<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> start<00:00:29.340> with

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
best thing to do would be to start with

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.740 
best thing to do would be to start with
the<00:00:30.480> knife<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.769> first<00:00:31.980> knife<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.750> got

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
when I was a kid and that would be this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
think i'm not sure but i think they make

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.920

this<00:01:40.290> knife<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.159> blue<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> blue<00:01:42.420> handle

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this knife in a blue with a blue handle

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.350

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
now but i got this one probably around

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
now but i got this one probably around
1991-92<00:01:48.360> something<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> back

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
1991-92 something like that and back

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
1991-92 something like that and back
then<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:51.149> only<00:01:51.329> made<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
then they they only made them with the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.940 
then they they only made them with the
red<00:01:52.079> handles<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> again<00:01:54.299> no<00:01:55.049> locking<00:01:55.439> blade

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
red handles so again no locking blade

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.389 
red handles so again no locking blade
which<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.159> greatest

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
which is you know not not the greatest

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.750 
which is you know not not the greatest
for<00:02:02.969> safety<00:02:03.509> but

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
for safety but

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
for safety but
and<00:02:05.660> can<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:07.520> does<00:02:07.730> have<00:02:07.880> its<00:02:08.090> benefits<00:02:08.180> I

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and can I it does have its benefits I

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.990 
and can I it does have its benefits I
guess<00:02:09.220> although<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.340> can't<00:02:10.610> think<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.850> any

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
guess although I can't think of any

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.520 
guess although I can't think of any
