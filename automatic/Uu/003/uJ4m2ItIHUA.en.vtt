00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.050
 a thick vegetation 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.400
 see what you think is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.890
 louis 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.630
 all full of branches trees bushes 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.750
 plants from all over 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.580
 you see it 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.640
 see if it is thick 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.640
 a kitchen 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.640
 we can also be thick 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.350
 mentally speaking if you can be 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.260
 thick 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.470
 why 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.830
 same 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.140
 the people who work in the kitchen 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.330
 we had a bad night we have not 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.190
 asleep as it was and then 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.750
 we are thick 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.230
 how much is surrendered 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.660
 but you have to do it because it's a 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 work 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.210
 and you have to be up to date and fight 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.740
 We can tell the boss or tell us 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.030
 we ourselves will not go because I 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.910
 I have a thick head 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.130
 expenses there is no crisis because the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.790
 people we have to go to work 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.200
 except very serious things because what 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.930
 it can not be done by a simple pain of 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.180
 head I have not found because annoy 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.740
 to the other colleagues who have pain 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.979
 of head the same thing you will have in your house 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.380
 take an aspirin take something calming 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.550
 when I was the boss, I said it again 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.440
 you because if this is a factory you do not go 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.590
 the person who takes the machine enters 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.530
 another and good machine is supplied 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.090
 continues its production in some places 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.490
 Of course it's usually like that now in 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.120
 a kitchen not in the kitchen if there are three 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.400
 cooks or two 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.280
 and we're just going staff and fails 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.920
 one because it comes because they get annoyed 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.150
 nobel we who are there are 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.220
 to go and turn a little for others 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.220
 let's be a little responsible 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.820
 now 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.060
 change it with the earth 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.060
 over the crowd or a blackberry flames 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.430
 let's start the classes we're going to put 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.019
 half a liter of milk when it boils 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.569
 milk you will put pulse of punches out the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.909
 about 6 when the milk arrives we will put 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.590
 an envelope of gelatin because an envelope for 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.420
 every half liter of milk we will close the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.069
 fire we will throw the envelope why the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.069
 gelatin and that 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.040
 but then when 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.329
 but there is more 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.209
 when it boils has three sachets of 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.069
 energy especially in 34 minutes 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.220
 of fat 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.709
 when it is practically mounted 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.709
 looking for jelly kids 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.440
 of this gelatin we continue studying 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.620
 for next care so you leave 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.080
 cooling and we're looking forward and videos of 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.360
 this gelatin here 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.790
 we will fix the force and they are 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.370
 tied that glaze by the effect of the 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.199
 tomatina 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.180
 and it's not a Latin costume to the people that 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.180
 does not know this watermark 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:01.979
 latina very well no more 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.130
 to accompany the whipped cream we have 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.010
 put a little bit of strawberry syrup 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.590
 here you see it is optional and this cream 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.330
 tastes like lemon because gelatine was 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.030
 lemon with that also has the advantage 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.980
 that is not cut us, it will never be there 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:30.980
 It is hard but that we enable to 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:33.320
 he is already accompanied by a sponge cake 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.660
 a cake or arrange what where 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.190
 you want me there's only one drink and here 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.250
 we have another plate some calamari 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.470
 stuffed and here we have another dish all 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.720
 in today's secret this has been this 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.660
 is the good that few people know so 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.210
 a cream is not cut to brown 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.950
 next day do not make us liquid because 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.380
 they usually make water but not the water 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.030
 you put gelatin and apart with flavor 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.730
 of the lemon so good can you put 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.820
 lemon gelatin orange gelatin 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.070
 you can such and jello flavors and you're 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.990
 20% of gelatin that cream put and already 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.030
 you have seen the glass forming 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.160
 and the glass of care that the cream does not 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.780
 the mounts much that is mounted 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.030
 but do not give him much with the beater 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.750
 because of how to cut when you put the 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.470
 gelatin you've already seen in another class 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.470
 what have you learned 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.550
 when we watch a barbecue 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.630
 whether it's veal or chicken 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.750
 I have always seen 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.910
 the classic clamps 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.650
 so you can understand it better 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.990
 giant forks I will say a 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.030
 fork so that people who do not know about 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.300
 what's going to understand me there are some forks 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.240
 long that they carry with some skewers go 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.220
 puncturing the race they go turning each 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.380
 Ten minutes are puncturing several times 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.240
 I was going to rotate what we do with this 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.340
 the street has to be turned but without 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.620
 click because if we puncture it we do 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.139
 hole refuses and the good comes out the 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.960
 we make it dry 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.599
 that's not like we puncture a boot 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.580
 We're going to puncture him with little needles 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.439
 We will not be dry because wine 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.780
 it's the same thing that meat is another 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:16.670
 history that we puncture here 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.050
 the blood we remove the body from the 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.740
 meat you do not have to prick the never 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:24.280
 simply turn the mime but without 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.280
 click the
