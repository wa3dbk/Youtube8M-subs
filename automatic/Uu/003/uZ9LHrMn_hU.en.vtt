00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.899
 who imposed the gold standard on the world 19 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.710
 centuries the Rothschilds why impose in 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.480
 the result of the napoleonic wars rotschilds 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.720
 I will concentrate the lionâ€™s share 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.850
 world gold reserves is certain that 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.039
 gold must not lie gold must 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.070
 work for that she must be 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.560
 claimed the best way to claim 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
 offer it to other countries 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.690
 or impose strange gold on others 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.219
 standard in england but it is clear that in 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.179
 Rothschild England felt 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.629
 the masters they passed the law in 1819 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.780
 about the gold standard and england has become 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.100
 the condition of the gold standard 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.229
 none of the other countries wanted 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 join the gold standard 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.260
 well, except for there australia and canada 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.859
 this is clear and all the British Commonwealth 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.870
 there is a command given from london and click 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:02.670
 heels and lead all that is necessary and here 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 european continental economy is not 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 wanted by no means wanted 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.969
 gold standard but here i have to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.850
 mention in this audience the name of Bismarck 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.460
 usually Bismarck is always called iron 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.990
 Chancellor, but I would call him golden 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 consoles why 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.840
 for a very simple reason it is likely 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.130
 that Bismarck was in a certain 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.409
 Rothschild dependence 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.909
 it is quite likely that this dependence 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.329
 Rothschild Bismarck increased in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.420
 As a result of this transaction, I am almost certain 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.549
 that such a deal was definitely Bismarck 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.100
 I wanted to unite Germany separate 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.240
 princedoms 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.710
 certainly what was needed was some 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.140
 economic and political support 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.429
 put aside the Rothschilds the Rothschilds 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.240
 said well we will assist you 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:59.280
 in return, you also give us a favor 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.249
 enter at a gold standard for that 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.049
 Bismarck throwing up his hands says I can not 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.619
 lead the gold standard because me 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.890
 no gold rothschilds say you 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.480
 Mr Bismarck will be gold and here 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.890
 begins its Franco-Prussian war 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.730
 ex-Prussian war as you know 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.069
 ends victory Germany and France 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.219
 must pay a contribution of 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.689
 five billion gold francs 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:31.069
 from where france has 5 billion gold 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:33.650
 francs france drained of blood france 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.709
 I checked for different sources of gold 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.639
 there were no more than 200 300 million 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.060
 gold front rothschilds announced 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:48.129
 loan loan france gold loan 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.620
 France all countries gave a visor and 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.780
 signed up for the golden loan of france 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.169
 were given 5 billion 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.540
 gold francs and quiet gold francs 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:02.449
 Germany then migrated to Germany 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.790
 in 1873 announced the introduction of gold 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:11.659
 standard and understand that without these 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.870
 intrigue europe for over western history 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.479
 19th century Europe we will not understand we will not understand 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.729
 the whole history of the 19th century is a struggle for 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.729
 imposing a gold standard on Europe
