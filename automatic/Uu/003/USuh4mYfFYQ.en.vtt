00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.360
 Minecraft actually originated from another game called RubyDung. 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.180
 Not many people know that this game is actually thinking about 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.960
 Another free online game for building Dward Fortress 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.000
 When Notch was developing RubyDung, he found another game. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.825
 Infiniminer 

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.695
 Infiniminer is a 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.634
 Infiniminer is an open source 

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:28.354
 Infiniminer is an open source multiplayer 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.188
 Infiniminer is an open source multiplayer block terrain 

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:29.790
 Infiniminer is an open source multiplayer block terrain sandbox 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.380
 Infiniminer is an open source multiplayer block terrain sandbox construction 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.133
 Infiniminer is an open source multiplayer block terrain sandbox construction and mining game 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.640
 So Minecraft, which was launched later, shares a lot of features with it (in fact, copy) 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.019
 The name Minecraft is an IRC user suggested with Notch. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.820
 But Notch originally intended to be named Minecraft: Order of Stone 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.500
 This is the first game video of this game. 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.900
 The original movie is called Cave game. 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.300
 Just four days later, May 17, 2009 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.680
 The first Alpha version of the game was released to the public. 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.200
 This photo is considered to be the first time this game has been shared by users. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.840
 49 minutes after the game is released 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.280
 And created and published the first block made in two and a half hours. 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.860
 Game characters - 8 bit style Mario 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.480
 If you have a little contact with the Minecraft gaming community 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.900
 You are very likely to have heard of Herobrine. 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.399
 He is a network urban legend in the game. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.040
 Looks like the protagonist Steve 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 Except that the eyes are completely white 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.520
 Different news points out that Herobrine originated in the middle of 2010 to the end of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.039
 4chan or Minecraft Forums during this time (Minecraft Official Forum) 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.960
 Since then, he has made a huge echo 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.559
 A large number of followers have created a variety of modules, material packages and skin styling 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.000
 Another way to keep Herobrine in the game 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.300
 It has become so popular, even game creators and developers 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.940
 Start making some tips and eggs for it 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.160
 For example, in several update patches 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.619
 They will add a line "Herobrine Removed" (remove Herrobine) 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 Or write in the Xbox360 version of Minecraft's read screen. 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.539
 "I think 4J Studio has deleted Herobrine, but I am not sure." 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.359
 However, like all online urban legends 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.500
 It does not exist 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 There is no code in the game to prove the existence of Herobrine. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.960
 And Notch himself officially stated that Herobrine is not in the game. 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.140
 There is no plan to add it in the future. 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.840
 Creeper is a very marked creature in Minecraft 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.840
 But the creation of Kuliba actually stems from an error. 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.640
 The coolie is when the pig's model body accidentally reverses the length and width 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.579
 Lead to tall body and short legs 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.920
 Notch likes its look and adds a green texture. 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.260
 So Kuliba was born like this. 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.000
 All creatures in the game are genderless 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.580
 Even the protagonist Steve is not male or female. 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.460
 Or both (XD 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.060
 The name Steve is actually just a trick for Notch. 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.380
 But the player insists on using this name and is widely used. 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.160
 To be precise, Steve should only be called " " 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.359
 To be precise, Steve should only be called a "player." 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.880
 Minecraft's map is quite huge 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.789
 I mean 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:13.509
 I mean really 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.420
 I mean it is really huge. 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.559
 It is so big that you can say that it is infinite, no wider than this. 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.580
 However, technically this is wrong. 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.000
 The map itself may be infinite 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.100
 But only part of the map can interact with the player, it can't be exceeded. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.359
 1 square equals 1 meter in Minecraft 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.167
 If the place where you stand is the center of the world 

00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:36.947
 You will be able to give 30 million squares in any direction 

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:41.600
 This is 60 million pieces on both the Z and X axes. 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.359
 This is equal to 3,600,000,000 square meters 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.600
 (He said that 7000 times is actually wrong, actually 7 times) 7 times larger than the surface of the earth. 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.299
 The terrain above the world's boundaries will be greatly simplified 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.020
 You will fall directly into the box and it is likely to cause the game to crash. 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.040
 There have been some amazing outrages over the years, which are obviously quite time consuming. 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.672
 Minecraft creation 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.739
 To name a few, the TV drama power game King's Landing 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.660
 Minecraft computer made of red stone 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.079
 A big city in the world of the Lord of the Rings (Minas Tirith Minas Tirith) 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.079
 Mirror's Edge 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.320
 An isometric model of a starship in a TV series StarCraft 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.219
 An original Minecraft world, Imperial City 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.580
 When you create a Minecraft world 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.840
 You are not creating a "1" world 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.857
 But "3" worlds 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.560
 The world that just entered is called the main world (Overworld) 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.320
 When you pass the portal you can reach another world 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.859
 These should be in narrative heaven and hell 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.840
 However, only the latter appears in the game, called The Nether. 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.020
 They originally called the third world Sky Dimension 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.460
 Later changed to the end (The End) 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.560
 Endermans' home 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.420
 If you've played Minecraft, you should know that this is definitely not heaven (XD) 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.260
 If you open the zombie pig man's material package 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.200
 You will find a hidden message on it 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.320
 This message is for Notch thanks to the inspiration of the zombie pig. 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.943
 Speaking of the material package 

00:05:19.943 --> 00:05:25.300
 The patterns of the three classic paintings are all from the game CS. 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.960
 Part of the success of Minecraft is believed to be due to constant updates. 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.159
 Frequently updated to extend the life of the game 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.500
 But because of the constant update, there will definitely be some ideas. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.360
 Not added to the current version 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.360
 Sometimes I want to know why 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.760
 For example gear should be added to the game 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.140
 But don't know why, they never did this 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.840
 The most likely reason is that it was replaced by the Redstone system. 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.380
 We don’t know the actual function of the gear. 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.380
 But this file has been deleted in the current version. 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.240
 Another idea is lantern 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.380
 Like a torch, you can hold it in your hand 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.700
 But it’s not like the torch is on the ground. 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.580
 This means that you can walk around with lanterns at night and see clearly. 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.400
 Emerald mine should not exist in the game 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.560
 It is adapted from previous ideas, ruby ​​mine 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.900
 In the final stage of implementation 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.560
 Developers find it difficult to distinguish between ruby ​​and redstone mines 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.560
 Ruby mine material package file is still in the game data 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.520
 They don't know when they will be used again 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.200
 The material package file of the game seems to contain the material package of the chair and the table. 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.800
 Makes many players think that furniture will join the game in a future update. 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.100
 But don't worry 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.440
 Many ideas and features that have been abandoned or shelved 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.800
 Still can join the game through Mods 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.040
 (thanks for watching) 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.240
 (I am really a (* ́∀`)~♥) 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.740
 (I am really a Minecraft (* ́∀`)~♥) 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.540
 (I am really a Minecraft chef (* ́∀`)~♥) 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.340
 (This is a good thing to say, all things I know _(:3 ∠)_)
