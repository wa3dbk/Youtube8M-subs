not gonna it's up it's like you saying
it's<00:02:01.770> easy<00:02:01.920> groups<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.880> three<00:02:03.540> teams

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's easy groups like where three teams

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's easy groups like where three teams
back

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
back

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.090 
back
again<00:02:04.930> yeah<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.260> lot<00:02:05.470> lot<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.770> them<00:02:05.860> will<00:02:06.010> be

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
again yeah a lot lot of them will be

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.059 
again yeah a lot lot of them will be
like<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.909> i<00:02:07.840> think<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.560> Koreans<00:02:08.950> will

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
like that and i think the Koreans will

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.370 
like that and i think the Koreans will
be<00:02:09.220> too<00:02:09.429> smart<00:02:09.670> for<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.000> Greeks<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.780> then<00:02:11.200> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
be too smart for the Greeks and then the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.590 
be too smart for the Greeks and then the
Nigerians<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.880> will<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.060> under<00:02:13.270> prepared

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
Nigerians I think will be under prepared

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.010 
Nigerians I think will be under prepared
not<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.800> as<00:02:14.950> organized<00:02:15.340> above<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.690> park

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
not not as organized above I think park

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.190 
not not as organized above I think park
and<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.100> Koreans<00:02:18.550> passing<00:02:19.000> game<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.510> going<00:02:20.110> to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
getting again you sure you don't get a

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.800

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.370 
said
yeah<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:13.019> South<00:04:13.260> Koreans<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:14.480> terms<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.629> yes

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380

but I think both physically Greece could
actually<00:04:20.070> have<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> concert<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.699> a<00:04:20.790> winner<00:04:20.970> but

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600
