do a portrait mode and you can as you
can<00:02:25.280> see<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:26.060> ipad<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.750> portrait<00:02:27.140> mode

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
can see the ipad is in portrait mode

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
can see the ipad is in portrait mode
right<00:02:27.440> now<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:28.460> kind<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.670> hard<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.940> see<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.210> bit

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
right now it's kind of hard to see a bit

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.540 
right now it's kind of hard to see a bit
but<00:02:29.690> there<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.160> portrait<00:02:31.520> mode

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
but there it is it is in portrait mode

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.060 
but there it is it is in portrait mode
you<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.210> also<00:02:32.510> set<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.990> into<00:02:33.140> landscape<00:02:33.860> mode

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
you can also set it into landscape mode

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.250 
you can also set it into landscape mode
right<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:35.330> see<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.870> kind<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.140> a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
right there you can see it is kind of a

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.830 
right there you can see it is kind of a
snug<00:02:36.500> fit<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> might<00:02:37.760> switch<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.330> tips<00:02:38.570> and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
snug fit so I might switch to tips and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.040 
snug fit so I might switch to tips and
to<00:02:39.590> get<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.770> better<00:02:40.120> fit<00:02:41.120> i<00:02:41.150> guess<00:02:41.390> up<00:02:41.630> i<00:02:41.810> was

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
to get a better fit i guess up i was

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.780 
to get a better fit i guess up i was
sitting<00:02:42.260> at<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.530> wrong<00:02:42.709> way<00:02:42.860> i<00:02:42.890> guess<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.580> is

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
sitting at the wrong way i guess this is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.000 
sitting at the wrong way i guess this is
the<00:02:43.820> way<00:02:43.970> you're<00:02:44.090> supposed<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.450> do<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:45.010> right

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
the way you're supposed to do it right

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.850 
the way you're supposed to do it right
there<00:02:46.160> there's<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.610> landscape<00:02:47.450> mode<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
there there's to landscape mode and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.199 
there there's to landscape mode and
there's<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.980> portrait<00:02:49.370> mode<00:02:49.520> again<00:02:49.670> there's

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
there's the portrait mode again there's

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.960 
there's the portrait mode again there's
little<00:02:50.570> slots<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.709> die<00:02:52.070> pad<00:02:52.340> supposed<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> sit

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
little slots we die pad supposed to sit

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.330 
little slots we die pad supposed to sit
and<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.750> guess<00:02:53.959> there's<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.290> room<00:02:54.739> for<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.010> cable

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
and I guess there's a room for the cable

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.070 
and I guess there's a room for the cable
when<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.760> plug<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.209> same<00:02:56.420> cable<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.870> there

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
when you plug in the same cable in there

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.990 
when you plug in the same cable in there
so<00:02:57.470> that's<00:02:57.650> pretty<00:02:57.800> cool<00:02:58.010> i<00:02:58.070> think<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.790> works

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
so that's pretty cool i think it works

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.420 
so that's pretty cool i think it works
really<00:02:59.270> good<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.140> far<00:03:00.320> i<00:03:00.380> mean<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.739> watch<00:03:01.310> a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
really good so far i mean it watch a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.760 
really good so far i mean it watch a
movie<00:03:01.790> seems<00:03:02.300> perfect<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.020> you<00:03:03.410> know<00:03:03.500> playing

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
apps and things like that so we'll look

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.340 
apps and things like that so we'll look
into<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.550> i'll<00:03:07.820> use<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.180> for<00:03:08.390> probably<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.170> few

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
into this i'll use it for probably a few

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.770 
into this i'll use it for probably a few
days<00:03:09.470> maybe<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.890> week<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.370> i'll<00:03:11.180> let<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.480> guys

what<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.269> think<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.320> far<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.860> 40<00:03:16.250> bucks<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.820> a

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
what I think so far it's 40 bucks it's a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.420 
what I think so far it's 40 bucks it's a
lot<00:03:17.600> better<00:03:17.750> price<00:03:18.080> than<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.320> apple<00:03:18.709> dock<00:03:18.950> for

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
lot better price than the apple dock for

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.820 
lot better price than the apple dock for
the<00:03:19.730> iPad<00:03:20.180> because<00:03:20.360> that's<00:03:20.630> 34<00:03:21.230> 10<00:03:21.410> bucks<00:03:21.620> more

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
the iPad because that's 34 10 bucks more

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.229 
the iPad because that's 34 10 bucks more
