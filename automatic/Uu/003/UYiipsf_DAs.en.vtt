um<00:00:17.370> in<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.240> last<00:00:18.420> video<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.200> was<00:00:20.040> talking<00:00:20.280> about

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
um in my last video I was talking about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.920 
um in my last video I was talking about
these<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.800> did<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.760> torque<00:00:24.030> on<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.390> bolt

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
these the did the torque on this bolt

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.760 
these the did the torque on this bolt
here<00:00:25.820> it<00:00:26.820> sounded<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.480> said<00:00:27.720> fifteen<00:00:28.440> but

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
here it sounded like I said fifteen but

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.960 
here it sounded like I said fifteen but
I<00:00:28.800> actually<00:00:29.010> met<00:00:30.000> 50<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:32.550> needs<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> be

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
I actually met 50 and this needs to be

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.010 
I actually met 50 and this needs to be
tightened<00:00:33.240> at<00:00:33.840> 50<00:00:34.530> foot-pounds<00:00:34.950> per<00:00:35.400> torque

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
tightened at 50 foot-pounds per torque

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.740 
tightened at 50 foot-pounds per torque
so<00:00:37.020> those<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.760> last<00:00:38.970> video<00:00:39.120> arm

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
so those it's all that last video arm

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.390 
so those it's all that last video arm
it's<00:00:40.080> supposed<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.380> be<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.590> 50<00:00:40.890> foot-pounds<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
it's supposed to be at 50 foot-pounds of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.350 
it's supposed to be at 50 foot-pounds of
torque

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
torque

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.390 
torque
pretty<00:00:42.780> much<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.470> I'm<00:00:43.620> getting

pretty much right now what I'm getting
ready<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> test<00:00:46.620> ground

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
ready to do is just do it a test ground

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.510 
ready to do is just do it a test ground
here<00:00:48.860> before<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.980> want<00:00:50.130> to<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.310> all<00:00:50.340> this

here before you want to put all this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
here before you want to put all this
back<00:00:50.700> together<00:00:51.020> because<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.410> take<00:00:52.680> hours

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
back together because it will take hours

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.370 
back together because it will take hours
and<00:00:53.489> we're<00:00:54.030> talking<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.540> 10<00:00:55.310> maybe<00:00:56.310> 15<00:00:57.380> you

don't want to get to the point that
you're<00:00:59.700> putting<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.600> fat<00:01:00.840> together<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
you're putting all this fat together and

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.460 
you're putting all this fat together and
find<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.950> that<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:03.229> there's<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.320> malfunction

I'm going to connect that to the actual
level<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:29.940> here<00:01:30.920> I'm<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> add<00:01:32.280> some

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
level over here I'm going to add some

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.780 
level over here I'm going to add some
new<00:01:32.580> fluid<00:01:33.500> right<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.670> new

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
new fluid right here and that's a new

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.000 
new fluid right here and that's a new
fluid<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
fluid here this is going to be a you

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.080 
fluid here this is going to be a you
know<00:01:38.159> clutch<00:01:38.700> fluid<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
know clutch fluid and then I get it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.830 
know clutch fluid and then I get it
bleed<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:44.150> pretty<00:01:45.150> much<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bleed it out pretty much we're going to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440 
bleed it out pretty much we're going to
bleed<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> system<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.299> all

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
bleed the system out and just get it all

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.320 
bleed the system out and just get it all
get<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.530> prepped<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:49.979> ready<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.250> go<00:01:50.490> once

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
get it all prepped and ready to go once

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.749 
get it all prepped and ready to go once
that's<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.930> done<00:01:52.790> we're<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> check<00:01:55.759> if

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that's all done we're going to check if

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.660 
that's all done we're going to check if
the<00:01:57.210> clutch<00:01:57.869> engages<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:58.740> disengaged<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.520> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the clutch engages or disengaged or I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.690 
the clutch engages or disengaged or I
even<00:01:59.970> do<00:02:00.090> anything<00:02:00.570> else<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> that's<00:02:02.369> pretty

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
even do anything else so that's pretty

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.570 
even do anything else so that's pretty
much<00:02:02.850> where<00:02:03.210> I'm<00:02:03.360> standing<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:04.080> now<00:02:04.580> when

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
much where I'm standing right now when

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.450 
much where I'm standing right now when
you<00:02:05.700> are<00:02:05.729> bleeding<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> system

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
you are bleeding the system

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.090

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
process I'm really not going to explain

to you how to bleed the system it's kind

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.420 
to you how to bleed the system it's kind
of<00:02:13.850> its<00:02:14.030> own<00:02:14.150> territorial<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:15.770> would<00:02:16.280> suggest

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
of its own territorial I would suggest

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.120 
of its own territorial I would suggest
if<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.000> don't<00:02:17.209> know<00:02:17.300> how<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.510> bleed<00:02:17.780> any<00:02:18.440> any

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.040 
if you don't know how to bleed any any
system<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:19.730> brakes<00:02:20.060> or<00:02:20.390> slave<00:02:20.600> Sandra's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
system like brakes or slave Sandra's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.740 
system like brakes or slave Sandra's
alone<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:22.069> online<00:02:22.390> YouTube<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.600> mean

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
alone on the online YouTube I mean

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.229 
alone on the online YouTube I mean
they've<00:02:23.870> got<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:24.170> lot<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.650> different<00:02:25.190> demos<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
they've got a lot of different demos to

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.260 
they've got a lot of different demos to
do<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:26.840> really<00:02:27.050> fairly<00:02:27.350> simple

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
do that and it's really fairly simple

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.970 
do that and it's really fairly simple
but<00:02:29.270> like<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.510> said<00:02:29.660> but<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.530> don't<00:02:30.709> have<00:02:30.830> time

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
but like I said but they don't have time

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.080 
but like I said but they don't have time
to<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.430> right<00:02:31.640> now

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
to do that right now

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.030 
to do that right now
so<00:02:32.660> you're<00:02:32.959> probably<00:02:33.170> seeing<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.560> next<00:02:33.709> video

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
so you're probably seeing the next video

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.750 
so you're probably seeing the next video
that<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:36.550> pretty<00:02:37.550> much

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
that it's going to be pretty much

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.670 
that it's going to be pretty much
already<00:02:38.000> bleeds<00:02:38.360> out

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
already bleeds out

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.260 
already bleeds out
and<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:40.730> ready<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.030> go<00:02:41.330> remember
