00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.879 
this is on a rival day so I like the
idea<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.489> think<00:03:17.489> 2k<00:03:18.060> maybe<00:03:18.889> maybe

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
idea of that but I think 2k maybe maybe

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.879 
idea of that but I think 2k maybe maybe
over<00:03:20.370> thought<00:03:20.699> how<00:03:21.120> enjoyable<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.500> would<00:03:22.709> be

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
over thought how enjoyable that would be

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.470 
over thought how enjoyable that would be
I<00:03:23.129> think<00:03:23.609> they<00:03:23.699> may<00:03:23.849> be<00:03:23.879> thought<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.389> was

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
I think they may be thought that was

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.750 
I think they may be thought that was
gonna<00:03:24.569> have<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> bigger<00:03:25.139> impact<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.579> whole

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760

best parts of crews like you can't

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.259

play<00:04:03.449> crew<00:04:03.810> all<00:04:03.989> together<00:04:04.199> so<00:04:05.010> like<00:04:05.220> when<00:04:05.370> you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
play crew all together so like when you

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.640 
play crew all together so like when you
don't<00:04:05.760> have<00:04:05.940> them<00:04:06.299> all<00:04:06.659> you<00:04:07.019> have<00:04:07.139> to<00:04:07.290> do<00:04:07.470> is

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
don't have them all you have to do is

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.369 
don't have them all you have to do is
just<00:04:07.859> go<00:04:08.069> and<00:04:08.489> run<00:04:09.479> with<00:04:09.599> some<00:04:09.810> computers

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
just go and run with some computers

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.289 
just go and run with some computers
which<00:04:10.949> is<00:04:11.099> I<00:04:11.310> think<00:04:11.340> what<00:04:11.879> was<00:04:11.970> one<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
which is I think what was one of the

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.089 
which is I think what was one of the
best<00:04:12.449> parts<00:04:12.780> about<00:04:12.840> crews<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.799> was<00:04:13.919> so

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
best parts about crews that it was so

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.240 
best parts about crews that it was so
