since I you know first tried to see clay
I<00:02:21.200> mean<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.770> guess<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.160> product<00:02:22.520> just<00:02:22.670> isn't

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
for me and that's fine it's cool but my

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.800 
for me and that's fine it's cool but my
opinion<00:02:27.350> definitely<00:02:27.500> still<00:02:28.010> stands

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
opinion definitely still stands

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.199 
opinion definitely still stands
especially<00:02:29.810> now<00:02:29.959> because<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.980> found<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.970> kind

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
especially now because I found it kind

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.030 
especially now because I found it kind
of<00:02:32.390> drawing<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.110> first<00:02:33.319> time<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.590> used<00:02:33.770> it<00:02:33.890> but

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
of drawing the first time I used it but

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.240 
of drawing the first time I used it but
my<00:02:34.160> hair<00:02:34.459> was<00:02:34.730> much<00:02:35.450> much<00:02:35.750> shorter<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.800> this

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
my hair was much much shorter so this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.710 
my hair was much much shorter so this
time<00:02:37.489> when<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.819> use<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.390> I'm<00:02:38.480> kind<00:02:38.660> of
