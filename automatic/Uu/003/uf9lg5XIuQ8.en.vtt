here wait okay you will see this um
center<00:02:22.450> line<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.850> on<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> other<00:02:25.210> side

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
center line here and on the other side

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.570 
center line here and on the other side
too<00:02:31.050> next<00:02:33.900> next

bring<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.550> central<00:02:40.420> line<00:02:41.340> bring<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
bring this to that central line bring it

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:51.230 
bring this to that central line bring it
to<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> center<00:02:43.030> line

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.820 

like<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.660> do<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> same<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.800> other

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.199 

and<00:03:31.380> also<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.950> other<00:03:31.980> side<00:03:32.220> now<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:32.940> open

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
and also on the other side now you open

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:52.520 
and also on the other side now you open
this<00:03:33.599> pocket

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.130 

okay<00:03:53.280> now<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:57.030> those<00:03:57.270> are<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.600> all<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
okay now so those are the all the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.090 
okay now so those are the all the
creases<00:03:58.650> now<00:03:59.030> you're<00:04:00.030> gonna<00:04:00.150> bring<00:04:00.740> this<00:04:01.740> one

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
creases now you're gonna bring this one

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:10.250 
creases now you're gonna bring this one
this<00:04:03.380> one<00:04:04.550> inside<00:04:05.550> here<00:04:07.700> then<00:04:08.900> put<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.020> like

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
this one inside here then put it like

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.650 
this one inside here then put it like
that<00:04:10.290> flapping<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:13.430> then<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.760> one<00:04:15.060> you're

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
that flapping it then this one you're

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.250 
that flapping it then this one you're
gonna<00:04:15.810> fold<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.450> at<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.720> zigzag

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
gonna fold it like that at the zigzag

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.340 
gonna fold it like that at the zigzag
fold<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:20.190> do<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.519> same<00:04:20.700> on<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.970> other<00:04:21.000> side

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
fold and do the same on the other side

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:29.270 
fold and do the same on the other side
like<00:04:22.350> this<00:04:22.620> open<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:24.140> like<00:04:25.140> that<00:04:27.560> then<00:04:28.560> like

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
like this open and like that then like

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.530 
like this open and like that then like
this<00:04:30.350> then<00:04:31.550> flatten<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:34.760> do<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.880> same<00:04:35.910> on<00:04:36.390> the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
this then flatten it do the same on the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:05:04.290 
this then flatten it do the same on the
other<00:04:36.570> side

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.350 

they're<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:06.570> nice<00:05:07.570> you're<00:05:07.840> going<00:05:08.110> to
