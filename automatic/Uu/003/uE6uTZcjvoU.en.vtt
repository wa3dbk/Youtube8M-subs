00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.780 
network I think that's pretty cool as
well<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.560> you're<00:02:12.770> not<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.950> part<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.340> such<00:02:13.760> a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
well because you're not a part of such a

small network with 5k subs only dgn has

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.370

a<00:02:17.240> lot<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.480> subscribers<00:02:17.720> because<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.230> lot<00:02:18.350> of

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
a lot of subscribers because a lot of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.720 
a lot of subscribers because a lot of
you<00:02:18.650> verse<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.920> stuff<00:02:19.100> like<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.640> think

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
you verse and stuff like that so I think

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.330 
you verse and stuff like that so I think
that's<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.570> direct<00:02:20.750> benefit<00:02:21.380> for<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.740> now

partnered rather than applying

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.100

and<00:06:02.230> yeah<00:06:02.830> so<00:06:03.130> I<00:06:03.370> think<00:06:03.700> this<00:06:04.000> method<00:06:04.420> works<00:06:04.600> so

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
and yeah so I think this method works so

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.110 
and yeah so I think this method works so
much<00:06:05.050> better<00:06:05.200> than<00:06:05.650> applied<00:06:06.430> just<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.790> normal

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
much better than applied just the normal

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.030 
much better than applied just the normal
way<00:06:07.270> because<00:06:07.600> sometimes<00:06:08.140> in<00:06:08.290> some<00:06:08.470> cases<00:06:08.740> if

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
way because sometimes in some cases if

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.040 
way because sometimes in some cases if
you<00:06:09.130> apply<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.400> normal<00:06:09.820> way<00:06:09.970> they<00:06:10.810> might<00:06:11.020> not

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
you apply the normal way they might not

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.530 
you apply the normal way they might not
even<00:06:11.380> accept<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:11.920> if<00:06:12.070> you<00:06:12.220> are<00:06:12.400> 750<00:06:13.270> views<00:06:13.450> a
