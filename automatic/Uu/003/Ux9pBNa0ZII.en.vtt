what I did is a this bike actually the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.060 
what I did is a this bike actually the
carburetor<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.410> usually<00:01:01.800> you've<00:01:01.920> got

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
air comes like this your carburetors

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.539 
air comes like this your carburetors
right<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:15.210> choke<00:01:16.340> this<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
right here this is your choke this is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
right here this is your choke this is
your<00:01:17.700> throttle<00:01:17.909> cable<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.049> idle

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
your throttle cable this is your idle

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.520 
your throttle cable this is your idle
speed<00:01:19.759> carburetors<00:01:20.759> right<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.080> that's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
speed carburetors right here so that's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.510 
speed carburetors right here so that's
really<00:01:22.710> special<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.400> find<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.860> you've<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.070> 1k

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
oil pump behind here and I just turned

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
oil pump behind here and I just turned
the<00:01:39.659> setting<00:01:39.960> down<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.380> gave<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> more<00:01:40.950> slack

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the setting down so I gave it more slack

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.840 
the setting down so I gave it more slack
from<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> cable<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.490> should<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
from the cable so that should do the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.240 
from the cable so that should do the
trick<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.810> yet<00:01:46.409> he's<00:01:46.710> supposed<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> give<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
trick not yet he's supposed to give it

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.249 
trick not yet he's supposed to give it
to<00:01:47.340> me<00:01:47.430> tomorrow<00:01:47.899> because<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:48.990> couldn't

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to me tomorrow because they couldn't

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.660 
to me tomorrow because they couldn't
find<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> when<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> went<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> pick<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> bike

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
find it when I went to pick up the bike

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
I mean all around the bikes pretty clean

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.660 
I mean all around the bikes pretty clean
the<00:01:56.520> front<00:01:56.909> court<00:01:57.329> doesn't<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.259> much

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
the front court doesn't have that much

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.359 
the front court doesn't have that much
left<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.820> it

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
left in it

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.289

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it's kind of hard to do with one hand

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.399 
it's kind of hard to do with one hand
but<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:04.530> kind<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.369> worn<00:02:05.549> out<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.000> front<00:02:06.409> the
