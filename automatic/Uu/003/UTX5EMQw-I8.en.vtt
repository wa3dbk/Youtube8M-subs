 barriers by integrating new characters from different worlds 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.259
 its flavor and therefore necessarily different from past years but 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.170

 to make their contributions 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.159
 so no less than 35 characters govern the cast 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.850
 in sixteen totally unpublished 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 what revive the interest around this new episode 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.320
 to bring them back to the leaks that would not have had the opportunity to

 the fed climbed the percentage of damage suffered which has the effect 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.050
 to weaken his physical resistance and expose him to attacks 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.360
 naturally more and more powerful 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.990
 obviously at first glance the game turns out a bit messy four

 fighters on a marennes also often riquiqui in the process of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.000
 spinning mandalas this causes a visual namco sound clipping at the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 limit of the bearable

 solo mode of big novelties have been made here 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.430
 the subspace emissary mode offers indeed a solo playable adventure mode 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:23.809
 or in cooperation 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.809
 which offers a lifespan of a dozen or so hours 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.040
 it is obviously the obligatory box for final game with 100% but especially 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.539
 to unlock trophies and other hidden characters from the game 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.600
 if the scenario is a union a wish and without great interest 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.149
 as to whether the game is playable with the wiimote and the 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.430
 nunchuk will answer us positively but to shine in the championships
