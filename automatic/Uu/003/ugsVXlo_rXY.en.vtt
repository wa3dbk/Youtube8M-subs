00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
so it's it's democratic but I think as

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.460 
so it's it's democratic but I think as
we<00:00:28.980> progress<00:00:29.689> rehearsing<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.900> also<00:00:31.019> know<00:00:31.320> we

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
we progress rehearsing we also know we

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.209 
we progress rehearsing we also know we
have<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.679> certain<00:00:32.040> time<00:00:32.219> frame<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:35.010> there

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
have a certain time frame and so there

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
have a certain time frame and so there
we<00:00:35.489> try<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.300> try<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.570> find<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.930> balance

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
we try all we all try to find a balance

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.000 
we try all we all try to find a balance
between<00:00:37.430> moving<00:00:38.430> forward<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.890> covering<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
between moving forward and covering the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.450 
between moving forward and covering the
piece<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:42.829> also<00:00:43.829> getting<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.309> our

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
piece and then also getting in our

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
piece and then also getting in our
individual<00:00:45.059> ideas<00:00:45.270> about<00:00:45.809> how<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.770> should

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
individual ideas about how we should

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.630 
individual ideas about how we should
shape<00:00:47.370> something<00:00:48.500> where<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.649> move<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.460> how<00:00:50.579> we

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
shape something where we move for how we

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.819 
shape something where we move for how we
breathe<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.930> know<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.800> about

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
breathe you know it's all about

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.790 
breathe you know it's all about
communication<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.239> sometimes<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.410> happens

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
communication and sometimes it happens

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
communication and sometimes it happens
that<00:00:56.010> people<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.370> opposite<00:00:56.820> ideas<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> then

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that people have opposite ideas and then

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.750 
that people have opposite ideas and then
it's<00:00:57.870> quite<00:00:58.620> interesting<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.430> there's<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's quite interesting to see there's a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.819 
it's quite interesting to see there's a
lot<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> energy<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.559> tried<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
lot of energy there and we tried to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.009 
lot of energy there and we tried to
figure<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.489> way<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.480> take

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
intimate so he wrote later as a

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
intimate so he wrote later as a
replacement<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.380> sketch<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.799> actually

Berger didn't approve of the skirt so so
much<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.100> he<00:01:26.340> thought<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.729> write<00:01:27.540> another

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
the piece and it's a big major chord

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.940 
the piece and it's a big major chord
when<00:03:14.849> he<00:03:14.940> first<00:03:15.180> speaks<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.079> says<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.799> know

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
when he first speaks and says you know

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.879 
when he first speaks and says you know
your<00:03:17.790> child<00:03:18.090> will<00:03:18.329> be<00:03:18.450> mine<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.019> it's<00:03:19.169> it's

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
your child will be mine and it's it's

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.750 
your child will be mine and it's it's
just<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:21.349> on<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.410> human<00:03:22.829> level<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.609> goes

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
just so on a human level so it goes

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.170 
just so on a human level so it goes
really<00:03:24.060> deep<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.889> yeah<00:03:25.889> if<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.880> think<00:03:27.090> it

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
really deep and yeah if I think it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.599 
really deep and yeah if I think it
touches<00:03:27.450> everyone<00:03:27.870> who<00:03:28.040> listens<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.250> it

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
touches everyone who listens to it

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.400 
touches everyone who listens to it
I<00:03:29.639> think<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.180> building<00:03:30.450> process<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
I think the building process of the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.530 
I think the building process of the
piece<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.799> always<00:03:32.220> subjective<00:03:32.549> because<00:03:33.359> there

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
piece is always subjective because there

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.710 
piece is always subjective because there
is<00:03:33.660> nor<00:03:33.959> no<00:03:34.560> right<00:03:35.010> or<00:03:35.370> wrong<00:03:35.400> it's<00:03:35.940> more<00:03:36.419> about

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
is nor no right or wrong it's more about

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.690 
is nor no right or wrong it's more about
how<00:03:37.380> do<00:03:37.440> we<00:03:37.650> feel<00:03:37.919> about<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.340> piece<00:03:38.549> and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
how do we feel about the piece and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.400 
how do we feel about the piece and
do<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:40.980> do<00:03:41.980> we<00:03:42.130> feel<00:03:42.490> it<00:03:42.610> is<00:03:42.850> more<00:03:43.480> subtle<00:03:43.870> or<00:03:44.230> do

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
do we do we feel it is more subtle or do

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.350 
do we do we feel it is more subtle or do
we<00:03:44.560> actually<00:03:44.590> feel<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.430> is<00:03:45.610> quite<00:03:45.940> an<00:03:46.180> a

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
always yeah it's always a search but

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.070 
always yeah it's always a search but
ultimately<00:04:18.519> we<00:04:18.790> go<00:04:18.970> with<00:04:19.180> what<00:04:19.359> we<00:04:19.390> feel<00:04:19.750> and

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
ultimately we go with what we feel and

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.630 
ultimately we go with what we feel and
in<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.440> concert<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:20.980> might<00:04:21.160> be<00:04:21.340> quite

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
in the concert it might be quite

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.330 
in the concert it might be quite
different<00:04:21.880> actually<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:23.050> what<00:04:23.410> we<00:04:23.620> decided<00:04:24.220> in

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
different actually to what we decided in

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.820 
different actually to what we decided in
the<00:04:24.430> rehearsal<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:26.290> should<00:04:26.560> be<00:04:26.710> the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
the rehearsal and that should be the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.970 
the rehearsal and that should be the
freedom<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.400> musician

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980
