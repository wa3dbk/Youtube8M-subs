if you did not train so hard in such a
I'm<00:02:44.480> pretty<00:02:44.750> sure<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.110> would<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.440> been<00:02:45.560> total

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
I'm pretty sure it would have been total

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.270 
I'm pretty sure it would have been total
total<00:02:46.849> annihilation<00:02:47.510> already<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.709> I

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
total annihilation already and I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.100 
total annihilation already and I
understood<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.090> from<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.510> very<00:02:50.630> start

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
understood that from the very start

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.509 
understood that from the very start
we<00:02:51.980> all<00:02:52.129> understood<00:02:52.549> that<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:54.280> while<00:02:55.280> there's

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
we all understood that and while there's

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.300 
we all understood that and while there's
some<00:02:55.730> compression<00:02:56.239> with<00:02:56.329> mica<00:02:56.810> with<00:02:57.410> Osama

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
some compression with mica with Osama

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.580 
some compression with mica with Osama
and<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.730> lunge<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.329> not<00:02:59.989> much<00:03:00.109> progressing

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
and you lunge in not much progressing

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.949 
and you lunge in not much progressing
with<00:03:00.680> chika<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.220> hope<00:03:01.400> she's<00:03:01.609> okay<00:03:01.940> but<00:03:02.329> she<00:03:02.510> she

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
with chika I hope she's okay but she she

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.720 
with chika I hope she's okay but she she
has<00:03:03.109> to<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.319> okay<00:03:03.350> it's<00:03:03.889> no<00:03:04.040> problem<00:03:04.310> at<00:03:04.579> all

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
has to be okay it's no problem at all

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.870 
has to be okay it's no problem at all
and<00:03:05.500> after<00:03:06.500> they<00:03:06.620> reached<00:03:06.889> up<00:03:07.130> where<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.700> say

and after they reached up where you say

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.710 
and after they reached up where you say
that's<00:03:08.090> low<00:03:08.299> couple<00:03:08.810> hints<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:10.389> hence<00:03:11.389> with

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
that's low couple hints and hence with

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.050 
that's low couple hints and hence with
advice<00:03:12.560> from<00:03:12.590> google<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.310> may<00:03:13.489> like<00:03:13.670> him<00:03:13.850> he

advice from google you may like him he
let<00:03:14.239> he<00:03:14.480> lost<00:03:14.840> two<00:03:15.200> hours<00:03:15.410> on<00:03:15.620> purpose<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:16.190> he

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
let he lost two hours on purpose so he

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.559 
let he lost two hours on purpose so he
could<00:03:16.459> get<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.609> guide<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.030> think<00:03:17.239> he's<00:03:17.359> so

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
could get the guide to think he's so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.229 
could get the guide to think he's so
crazy<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.200> defeat<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.859> guy<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.150> the

crazy to defeat the guy and and then the

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.059 
crazy to defeat the guy and and then the
rules<00:03:20.450> would<00:03:20.569> be<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:21.019> predictable<00:03:21.709> like<00:03:21.920> no

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
rules would be so predictable like no

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.280 
rules would be so predictable like no
tomorrow<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.359> know<00:03:23.480> that's<00:03:23.810> one<00:03:24.049> thing
