00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 here it has happened to you that we are one day 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.910
 on the train and we need internet but 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.950
 we do not need internet on the phone 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.630
 but we need internet in our 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.730
 computer in this video I'm going to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.910
 show how to share the internet of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.560
 phone with your computer we go with the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.150
 video because you can first do 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.699
 super fast videos because I've been 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.380
 making more videos and videos that still 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.029
 I have not managed to do as for example 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.010
 I'm doing the video of how to buy 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.510
 within the applications and still not 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.040
 It works for me as I want me to 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.469
 it works so I said good let me do 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.329
 a short video to upload something today and not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.010
 stay like this because I've already been three 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.800
 days that I do not upload video then you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.110
 you know we obviously need to have georg 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.360
 ratzinger will not work and in cydia 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.270
 let's look for these applications that is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 super simple is called ends you here 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.340
 I am here below looking here in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.950
 seeker and I will write 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 I finish you see how many options I 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.150
 come out and an example I'm going to have my 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.280
 complete then look how many options 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.140
 I get out that's because of all the sources 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.290
 that I have if you want you can 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 install of insein and that is free or 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.000
 You can buy it from Syria too if 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.970
 really like me in this case what 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.250
 install game on my insensitive 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.440
 but I think I'm going to buy it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810
 because I really liked it costs 4 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.520
 dollars with 99 but I know that many do not 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.050
 we can buy it and that's what I 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 I can say what they need for free 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.770
 then here I am going to reinstall 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.800
 only to see the process that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.020
 it happens but here lasts a little bit there 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.960
 they are recharging the data see what it says 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.780
 He urged that is was installed without problem 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.910
 to see here excuse me is that I have some 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.500
 more evil lenses that know that my mind 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.170
 they're not working it's going to be like a 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.600
 crystal soon and this gives us that gives us 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.430
 three different options to connect 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.440
 our device or our 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.330
 computer to our device and there 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.820
 get on the internet this serves to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.679
 many people who have unlimited internet 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.940
 I do not recommend them if you do not have 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.920
 you have to pay finally 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 I do not only recommend then I'm going to 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.480
 demonstrate here I can connect with 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.970
 wifi but since I'm connected to the end in 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.979
 my house in see if I can I just 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.500
 disconnect the wifi from my house so that 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.690
 the signal dies and you will see here 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.220
 must turn off and on and as there is no 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.080
 no available signal is going to 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.450
 connect people and there I am connected to 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.580
 he then have here from here says 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.800
 share internet very simple once 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.630
 we enter here we are going to configure our 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.460
 password I did not know I put I'm 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.200
 Martian from the internet of the demo 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.420
 then here tells us to connect by 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.550
 wifi and gives you the instructions then 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.890
 here as I have the cable connected to the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.780
 computer I can connect 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.790
 directly to the computer only 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.950
 with the cable connected and if I give 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.230
 turn on and automatically it's going to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.450
 connect to the computer without me doing 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.520
 more nothing look at it here and there it is 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.980
 sharing you say blue here 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.110
 above that if it works then in the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.060
 computer if we can see that we are 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.340
 connected input here so that 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.830
 you see here I will enter 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.019
 the page here and I'm not connected to 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.209
 wifi I am not connected to any wifi 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.590
 while network refresh so that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.209
 you see that I am connected to 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.760
 iphone you only saw me 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.290
 connect the iphone to the computer and 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.110
 ready then let's say I'm 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.900
 disconnected I can connect to my 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.510
 wifi connection ok here that said 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.610

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.720

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.640

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.959
 telephone signal is the signal that has 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.370
 up here that indicates that I'm 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.500
 connected to the phone and on the phone 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.230
