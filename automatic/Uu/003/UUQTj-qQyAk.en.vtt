00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello, welcome, I'm a teacher 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.990
 manoel viana I'm here for today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.059
 comment with you on another issue of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.590
 math test of the public tender 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.519
 Military Police of the state are 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.049
 Paulo 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.480
 this is a test that was performed in the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.060
 the year 2013 for the post of soldier of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 2nd class and was applied by the foundation 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.180
 vunesp 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.279
 including this issue number issue 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 3 was aborted due to an error in 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.279
 statement 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.199
 but assuming that in the next issue of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 The next test fell a similar question 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.140
 with this and that has no error in the statement 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.059
 we will see how to proceed in solving the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 Next day question the following chart 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.450
 shows the number of stolen cars in the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 state of são paulo in the first 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.440
 quarter of 2012 and 2013, taking as a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 reference the total number of cars 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.829
 stolen in the first semester and that such 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 error 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 should be the first quarter of the year 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.070
 from 2011 to 2013 it is correct to say that 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.750
 number of stolen cars in the first 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 t quarter 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 and here it presents 2011 2012 2013 each 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.950
 a one percent 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.710
 So what are we going to do first? 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.320
 make the sum of all the cars were 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.479
 stolen in the first quarter of 2013 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 2012 2011 and calculate the percentage 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.810
 mainly with this only with these 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.659
 alternatives here I just forgot 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 to put the total calculation here 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.880
 but here there is only one and 23 thousand plus 22 thousand 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.240
 plus 18,500 giving 63,500 a then total 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.700
 It's 63,500 forget to put here more 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.409
 It's easy to see that, right? 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.850
 we will calculate the percentage in 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.780
 above this value 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.880
 we'll see how much is 27% of 63,500 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.939
 there are 27% of 63,500 I can do it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.299
 20 up with 100 down here will stay 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:03.810
 yes 27 times 635 27 times 635 so you 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.950
 does this multiplication find 17,175 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.720
 so in the year 2012 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.860
 were stolen 17,175 vegetable is not so 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.520
 do not hit is not 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.200
 the native we found 17,175 here 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.990
 there are 22 thousand so it's not a value 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.250
 approximate is not not even close 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.830
 of this value 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.110
 we will now see 39% to 1 39% of 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.200
 63,500 again cancel 20 leaves above 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.430
 with 20 here to apologize is not 39 years 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.300
 gets in here 22% 22% ok then 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.950
 check the letter b 22% rope 20 side of 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.170
 Up with two down here. 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:53.459
 I'll stay with 22 times 635 is equal to 13 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.350
 1970 notes that in 2011 the number of 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.400
 of stolen cars in the first quarter 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.790
 approximately 22% that it would 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.230
 3970 2011 and 18,500 at a distance so it is not 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.080
 also the alternative b 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.550
 alternatives now and said that the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 number of stolen cars in the first 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:16.080
 quarter of 2012 is approximately 39% 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.330
 see how much it gives 39% 63,500 cancel 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:26.790
 20 from top with two from bottom and make 39 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:30.209
 times 635 of 24 1765 24,165 alternatives 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.580
 and 39 percent in 2012 does not give 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.739
 So it's been a long time so it's not 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.630
 correct alternative is not so let's 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.000
 see of said the number of cars 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.610
 stolen in the first quarter of 2011 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.350
 approximately 29% 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.120
 then we will calculate 29% of 63,500 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.239
 gazelle 20 from above with two from below and 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.720
 multiplies 29 times 635 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.760
 meeting 18.415 now we have arrived a lot 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.930
 next 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:04.260
 18,500 18,415 I will see if there is an alternative 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.799
 and did not come closer told me that 2013 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:12.450
 approximately 50% we will calculate 50% 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:18.840
 of 63,500 cancels 20 from above with 2 of 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:23.099
 March 50 times 635 31,750 for 2013 no 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.810
 it's been a long way, so you can say 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.400
 that the right alternative to alternative 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.280
 d was the one that most approached the chicão 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:37.500
 18,415 and in 2001 in the first quarter 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.259
 2011 were stolen is 18,500 to 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.150
 alternative d is the one that comes closest 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.340
 of truth can mark as being the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.500
 correct alternative this alternative 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.090
 Who is this then I hope you 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.849
 have tanned and promise to come back soon 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.710
 other issues resolved and commented 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.710
 A hug for you and see you there.
