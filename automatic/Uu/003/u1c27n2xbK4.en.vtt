the UV radiation it is worthwhile to

the UV radiation it is worthwhile to
mention<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> number<00:00:39.329> of

mention here that the number of

melanocytes do not differ between
different<00:00:41.520> ethnic<00:00:41.760> races<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
different ethnic races but it is the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.889 
different ethnic races but it is the
amount<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.469> melanin<00:00:43.920> produced<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.489> differs

amount of melanin produced that differs

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.750 
amount of melanin produced that differs
therefore<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:46.620> skinned<00:00:46.950> individual<00:00:47.520> skin
