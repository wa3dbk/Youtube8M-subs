00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 it is 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.320
 1 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.900
 it was good for him to snatch some 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:19.630
 good thing big downs judge chico there 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 a little no I used nesquik and 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 big kim to sk and bangui minimum 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 more and boils water 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.290
 I put at the polar temperature at 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.290
 maximum is still the highest 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.510
 then I put too much you missed because 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.370
 that it's still a big one 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:01:01.450
 usually for middle dances 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:01:04.300
 would be rather 2 teaspoons by a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:14.850
 comment not that we tied the water 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:18.700
 belgian back porridge I am a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.420
 polishing and of course I blame myself on 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:29.770
 facebook because who would not do that 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:33.810
 huh we actually created the boil and there I 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.369
 go out between two-thirds of the cup 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.180
 because we still have to leave 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.180
 the place for the levels 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.009
 and that's at your discretion the dungeon 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.530
 look for milk for it to be more - and 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.560
 hot little more or less hot then I 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.450
 the mix and the me I put a lot 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.250
 a lot a lot of marshmallow because 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.549
 again I really like this the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.549
 sugar 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 then I sprinkled not surprised 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.920
 many I put the skin of his 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.310
 chocolates from above for its phase 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.310
 soccer 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.560
 and here are our hot chocolates of the times 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.810
 failures 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.810
