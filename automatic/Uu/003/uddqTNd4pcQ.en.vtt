00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.059
 hello welcome again to tricks 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.700
 animal crossing today I'll show you a 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:13.000
 little how this shop works one of 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.630
 the handy sisters then when 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.640
 you enter lands here some designs that 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.420
 You can watch a video on my channel to see 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.240
 more or less how it works then 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 you have a hat here or a shadow 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.869
 sorry and there will always be one 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.490
 then he will tell you to buy it or 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.870
 leave it 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:41.640
 then there are always three suits 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.519
 a good hat and here are accessories 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.769
 let's say then the suits the 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.040
 accessories whenever you let us approve 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.030
 tells you to see how I'm left 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.030
 and the sr 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.980
 and let's see for example this 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.910
 you say to see how he tells me if you like or 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.910
 you do not have it, we buy it 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.549
 in this case, for example, I'm going to 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.549
 buy these glasses 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.659
 they fit like this and I'm going to tell 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:29.659
 for 160 is super well worth 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:36.130
 and well you know how they place the 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.130
 If you do not tell me and I'll show you 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.600
 it is done by dragging only your person 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.720
 good sometimes if you talk with ping 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.110
 it tells you I want to design that explains it to you 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.549
 in a video of mine I want to sell but that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.770
 it only lets you sell clothes and flowers do not you 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.270
 let sell the property in any fruit 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.259
 or anything and now you see design that good 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.259
 if you want to see it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.229
 she is with 1000 and I think her name is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.020
 milli 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.360
 and with a thousand and you can also talk 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.090
 you know that Tuesday is the day when 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.050
 the people the end of us less 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.840
 we have to stay focused 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.290
 if a dressmaker is going to undertake a network 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.570
 for sure it will be Tuesday mima 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.260
 Needless to say, to be confused and commit 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:39.330
 mistakes will be inelegant good and if 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.150
 you go the mini was weaving a suit and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.450
 I think that the one who is weaving here had 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.290
 next is exposed here but this is not what 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.100
 it makes sure there is so do not do it 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.280
 a lot of case 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.890
 it could be that maybe yes and good 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.800
 up to here the tutorial of how it works 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.820
 making stone and look I hope you 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.820
