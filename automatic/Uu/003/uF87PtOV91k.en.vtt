00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello people today we show you how 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.799
 her a small terrarium itself 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.400
 can tinker 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.400
 you need a hot air gun 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:22.760
 plexiglass is best five pieces so now 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.630
 let's start 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:32.460
 First, you take the hot air gun 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:36.860
 and it sticks to the ends of something 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.860
 but not too much 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.930
 so now we're done after that 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:55.530
 the other piece and stick it there 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 but it had to be done very quickly 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.730
 hurry up because if you glue that we will 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.920
 to dry very quickly so she has to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.920
 squeeze something so push it 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.939
 It must be here for a few seconds 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.939
 Keep it that dries up very quickly 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.580
 I do not know if you can see that exactly 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 is because of this plastic glass something very 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.430
 strong to be transparent 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 is transparent 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.730
 already dry 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:05.250
 now she is doing a bit on the edge 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:12.440
 but there is not much air pistol 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.440
 so that you taped it off 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.849
 so next the takes the now 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.459
 Next page and then stick again 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.599
 the fact we have just me 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.040
 otherwise just turned around 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.040
 glue on it 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.280
 after that the other side is doing it 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.580
 on top of it but leaving the corners flush 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.580
 are 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:18.019
 then you turn around and that something 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:22.400
 then take the next plexiglas here 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.400
 but because of razmak liver on it 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.080
 now he takes the plexiglas and does it 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.890
 on top of it and there on the corner it has to be 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.890
 be flush again 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:54.690
 so and in the end if you then the whole 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:59.290
 have finished pages and above something 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:04.210
 hope then if we can do that later 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.180
 still with silicone so on the sides all 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.430
 living in your own country 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.510
 and yes, that's what we'll become 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 still show so next you take 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.350
 the next plexiglas that we then the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.060
 be next page 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.570
 you do glue then on all three 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.570
 pages 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.350
 when you order you've finished the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.840
 plexiglas and does that on top of it and 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.200
 then it tries very flush again 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.200
 do 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:15.620
 so now you have your terrarium 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:18.339
 almost finished now we only had to 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.919
 glue the chilli con silicone and 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:24.770
 if you did that then 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:32.180
 Let's show you the same thing 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:36.409
 we'll pick it up right away so we'll take it 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:40.909
 Now silicone the best transparent 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:45.309
 silicone so you need one more 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.309
 you still need a background 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:52.960
 kitchen roll or newspaper 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:06:00.439
 something with you can lay under it 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:02.589
 so and then let's start doing it to him 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:06.050
 that on every page 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:08.169
 He has to be very careful with the silicone 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.169
 work 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:36.270
 so we go on and leave 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.700
 Do not wait with you guys right now 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:43.650
 Now you have your little terrarium 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:46.440
 ready now we'll do it with us 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.720
 sand and then you can get your animals too 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.600
 use and we also see the same 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.350
 how to do that so now she lets that happen 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.510
 best to a place where there is such a 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.360
 open window is where is very cool 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.810
 Leave it that way for about half an hour 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.810
 dry
