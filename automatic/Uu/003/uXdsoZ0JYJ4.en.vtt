I've<00:02:35.510> got<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.930> wedge<00:02:36.800> down<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.610> they

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
balanced this was built to capacity at

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400 
balanced this was built to capacity at
1,250<00:02:40.760> pounds<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.239> water<00:02:41.420> weight<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.900> another

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
1,250 pounds of water weight and another

1,250 pounds of water weight and another
1200<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.040> 1400<00:02:43.430> pounds<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:44.120> weight<00:02:44.510> as<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
1200 to 1400 pounds of weight as the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.160 
1200 to 1400 pounds of weight as the
wedge<00:02:45.890> creates<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.610> you'll<00:02:47.600> see<00:02:47.780> we<00:02:47.900> get<00:02:48.019> the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
wedge creates and you'll see we get the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.520 
wedge creates and you'll see we get the
speed<00:02:48.410> here<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:50.420> power<00:02:50.600> really<00:02:51.170> puts<00:02:51.470> a

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
speed here that that power really puts a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:00.119 
speed here that that power really puts a
heck<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.860> wake<00:02:52.040> up

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.800 

throughout<00:03:00.640> five<00:03:00.909> different<00:03:01.120> settings<00:03:01.659> with

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
throughout five different settings with

the power wedge that I can adjust the
way<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.030> you'll<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:04.389> as<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.629> adjusted<00:03:05.139> that

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
way to and you'll see as I adjusted that

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.059 
way to and you'll see as I adjusted that
he<00:03:06.810> knows<00:03:07.810> both<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.439> bow<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.739> boat<00:03:08.769> will
