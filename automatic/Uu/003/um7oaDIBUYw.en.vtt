 the corn and the beans the chile has 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.650
 closely accompanied the development of 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.400
 our gastronomy for several centuries 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 today with more than 40 varieties of chile 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.350
 produced in the national territory 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.620
 annual demand from national and other countries 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.990
 in this framework sinaloa occupies a place 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.570
 highlighted in the national production of 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.339
 Chile with a record crop that year 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.539

 tons in more than 15 thousand hectares 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.409

 the many crops that in sinaloa 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.780
 take place in two annual cycles with 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.879
 an important contribution to the chain 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.240
 national food and product 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.790
 gross domestic country for this item 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.910
 however the activity goes much more 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.340
 there the production of chili vegetables and 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.200
 grains in the state of sinaloa generates 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.840
 employment to thousands of agricultural day laborers 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.390
 coming from across the country 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 solve part of their problem 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.150
 economic activity in productive activities 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.250
 and it is enough to take a look at 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.530
 the production figures of past years 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.870
 to give an idea of ​​what it represents 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.760
 this crop so much in what concerns 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.760
 to culture as to the generation of 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.440
 jobs the chile plant requires 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.960
 for its development temperatures 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.479
 warm and warm so two of 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.100
 every three green chiles are produced in 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.479

 green chile recorded a recovery 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.660
 substantial this year although it still 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.640
 keeps below its best 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.890
 levels 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.310

 say an increase of 200 4% with respect 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.470
 to the same period in 2011 when it was 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.780
 of just 180 thousand 458 tons juan

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.380
 2011 were catastrophic for the region 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.850
 since it not only affected green chili 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.850
 but to other crops
