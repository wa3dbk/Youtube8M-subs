00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
start by just running up against that

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.610 
start by just running up against that
cog<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.820> pushing<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.300> up<00:00:09.450> against<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.170> bigger

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
cog and pushing it up against the bigger

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.709 
cog and pushing it up against the bigger
cog<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.639> it's<00:00:11.880> gonna<00:00:11.969> start<00:00:12.300> turning<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
cog and it's gonna start turning the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.359 
cog and it's gonna start turning the
entire<00:00:13.200> map<00:00:14.719> now<00:00:15.719> you're<00:00:16.650> gonna<00:00:16.800> want<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> wait

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
entire map now you're gonna want to wait

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.130 
entire map now you're gonna want to wait
this<00:00:17.580> platform<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.090> standing<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.840> actually

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
this platform on standing on is actually

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.010 
this platform on standing on is actually
going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> fall<00:00:19.560> back<00:00:19.800> towards<00:00:20.250> right<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:21.020> so

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
going to fall back towards right now so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.269 
going to fall back towards right now so
wait<00:00:22.170> towards<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> edge<00:00:22.650> if<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.890> lands<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.220> you

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
jump back on the box jump to the ladder
and<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.439> make<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> through<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.040> little

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and just make it through this little

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.300 
and just make it through this little
door<00:01:24.530> don't<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> set<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> end<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700 
door don't want to set the end of this
level<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:28.110> part<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> little

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
level now this part can be a little

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.730 
level now this part can be a little
tricky<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:30.000> press<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> lever<00:01:30.630> down

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
tricky you're gonna press the lever down

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.170 
tricky you're gonna press the lever down
and<00:01:32.010> then<00:01:32.280> wait<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.670> room<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:32.909> start

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and then wait for the room to start

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.219 
and then wait for the room to start
tipping<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.810> bit<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.080> then<00:01:34.170> you're

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
tipping a little bit and then you're

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.390
