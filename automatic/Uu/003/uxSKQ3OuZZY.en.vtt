00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
spying mission very easy to complete

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.099 
spying mission very easy to complete
although<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:29.939> recommend<00:00:30.330> finding<00:00:30.599> squads

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
although I do recommend finding squads

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.600 
although I do recommend finding squads
as<00:00:31.470> some<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.980> enemies<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> little

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
as some of the enemies can be a little

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
as some of the enemies can be a little
tougher<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.120> you're<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.450> higher<00:00:33.660> ranked<00:00:34.160> then

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
tougher if you're not higher ranked then

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.459 
tougher if you're not higher ranked then
you<00:00:35.280> will<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.750> do<00:00:36.750> three<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you will have to go do three of the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.340 
you will have to go do three of the
infested<00:00:38.040> hive<00:00:38.399> missions<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.719> just

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
infested hive missions which are just

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
infested hive missions which are just
redundant<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.219> opinion<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> little<00:00:41.879> boring

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
redundant in my opinion a little boring

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.630 
redundant in my opinion a little boring
but<00:00:42.480> once<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.379> those<00:00:43.559> bad<00:00:43.829> boys<00:00:44.040> done<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
but once you get those bad boys done you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
but once you get those bad boys done you
will<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.030> sent<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> alibies<00:00:46.140> cheri<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.430> destroy

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
will be sent to alibies cheri to destroy

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
will be sent to alibies cheri to destroy
it<00:00:48.000> once<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.930> destroy<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.260> however<00:00:49.590> you'll

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
it once you destroy it however you'll

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.619 
it once you destroy it however you'll
find<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.129> Aled<00:00:50.430> was<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> you'll

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
find that Aled was not there and you'll

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.100 
find that Aled was not there and you'll
be<00:00:51.809> sent<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> lab<00:00:52.920> these<00:00:53.149> laboratory<00:00:54.149> now

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110

be sent to a lab these laboratory now
once<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> could<00:00:55.530> tie<00:00:55.649> all<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> these

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
once you could tie all of these

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
once you could tie all of these
laboratory<00:00:56.370> may<00:00:56.520> seem<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> standard

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
laboratory may seem like a standard

laboratory may seem like a standard
mission<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.190> job<00:00:59.460> done

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
actually there and you'll have to fight

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
actually there and you'll have to fight
manifested<00:01:04.530> version<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> Mesa<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
manifested version of Mesa which is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.289 
manifested version of Mesa which is
really<00:01:05.610> cool<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.090> we've<00:01:06.180> ever

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
really cool I don't think we've ever

really cool I don't think we've ever
fought<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.810> actual<00:01:07.110> warframe<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> past

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
fought an actual warframe in the past

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.490 
fought an actual warframe in the past
but<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> fight<00:01:10.290> Mesa

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
but here it is so you have to fight Mesa

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800

will get a key blueprint which you would

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.789 
will get a key blueprint which you would
use<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.299> build<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> assassination

on this and the way to get these is to
go<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.060> infested<00:01:42.600> invasion<00:01:43.259> missions

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
go to the infested invasion missions

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139 
go to the infested invasion missions
where<00:01:43.770> they<00:01:43.860> infest<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> take<00:01:44.369> over<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> node

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
where they infest to take over a node

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.260 
where they infest to take over a node
and<00:01:45.530> sometimes<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> reward<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.729> muta

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and sometimes the reward will be in muta

and sometimes the reward will be in muta
lists<00:01:48.479> nav<00:01:48.659> coordinate<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
lists nav coordinate I know this is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.230 
lists nav coordinate I know this is
absolutely<00:01:50.700> ridiculous

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
absolutely ridiculous

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
in life and I think it's just gonna take

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.920 
in life and I think it's just gonna take
too<00:01:52.680> long<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.040> farm<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.549> him<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.659> don't<00:01:54.720> even

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
too long to farm for him as I don't even

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
too long to farm for him as I don't even

know if there have been three infested

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
know if there have been three infested

invasion missions with the nav

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560 
invasion missions with the nav
coordinates<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> reward<00:01:59.360> since<00:02:00.360> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
coordinates as a reward since that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.710
