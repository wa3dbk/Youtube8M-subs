00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.250 
sea water so I'm going to come back in
here<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.729> I'm<00:05:29.820> going<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:29.970> put<00:05:30.180> more<00:05:30.539> waves<00:05:30.900> in

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
here and I'm going to put more waves in

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.230 
here and I'm going to put more waves in
darker<00:05:31.740> right<00:05:31.950> here<00:05:32.250> but<00:05:32.460> I've<00:05:32.580> got<00:05:32.849> a<00:05:33.030> good

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
darker right here but I've got a good

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.320 
darker right here but I've got a good
base<00:05:33.539> of<00:05:33.570> color<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.860> work<00:05:35.039> with<00:05:38.210> notice<00:05:39.210> I'm

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
base of color to work with notice I'm

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.350 
base of color to work with notice I'm
making<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.690> wave<00:05:39.900> or<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:41.330> crashing<00:05:42.330> surf

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
making the wave or the crashing surf

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.730 
making the wave or the crashing surf
foam<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:44.150> little<00:05:45.150> smaller<00:05:45.750> as<00:05:46.020> we<00:05:46.169> go<00:05:46.200> to<00:05:46.410> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
foam a little smaller as we go to the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.980 
foam a little smaller as we go to the
left<00:05:47.099> which<00:05:47.490> very<00:05:48.360> often<00:05:49.070> happens<00:05:50.660> like<00:05:51.660> that

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
left which very often happens like that

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.140 
left which very often happens like that
and<00:05:52.200> then<00:05:52.289> just<00:05:52.440> let<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.740> peter<00:05:53.099> out<00:05:53.370> make<00:05:53.940> sure

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
and then just let it peter out make sure

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.450 
and then just let it peter out make sure
I<00:05:54.180> got<00:05:54.450> it<00:05:54.570> in<00:05:54.690> here<00:05:54.720> good<00:05:55.110> like<00:05:55.289> that<00:05:55.460> so

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
I got it in here good like that so

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.200 
I got it in here good like that so
basically<00:05:57.740> that<00:05:58.740> is<00:05:59.039> going<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.340> be<00:05:59.520> my<00:05:59.940> initial

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
basically that is going to be my initial

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:10.140 
basically that is going to be my initial
wash<00:06:00.690> in<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:02.310> sea<00:06:02.639> area

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.570 

so<00:06:11.150> next<00:06:11.630> we<00:06:11.960> will<00:06:12.110> work<00:06:12.710> our<00:06:12.890> way<00:06:13.010> down<00:06:13.040> and

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
so next we will work our way down and

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.850 
so next we will work our way down and
get<00:06:13.820> this<00:06:14.000> area<00:06:14.390> here<00:06:14.600> where<00:06:14.750> there<00:06:14.930> is<00:06:15.170> a<00:06:15.590> lot

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
get this area here where there is a lot

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.180 
get this area here where there is a lot
of<00:06:15.980> white<00:06:16.190> water<00:06:16.750> foam<00:06:17.750> sea<00:06:18.230> foam<00:06:18.500> and<00:06:18.860> in

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
of white water foam sea foam and in

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.140 
of white water foam sea foam and in
holes<00:06:19.880> in<00:06:20.300> it<00:06:20.510> to<00:06:21.490> form<00:06:22.490> this<00:06:22.820> other<00:06:23.530> area<00:06:24.530> of

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
holes in it to form this other area of

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.570 
holes in it to form this other area of
surf<00:06:26.680> so<00:06:27.940> basically<00:06:28.940> this<00:06:29.270> is<00:06:29.330> silo<00:06:30.230> green<00:06:30.580> let

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
surf so basically this is silo green let

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.970 
surf so basically this is silo green let
me<00:06:31.640> see<00:06:31.820> what<00:06:31.970> time<00:06:32.150> we<00:06:32.420> got<00:06:32.600> it<00:06:33.410> looks<00:06:33.590> like<00:06:33.680> it

me see what time we got it looks like it
looking<00:06:34.520> good<00:06:34.700> yeah<00:06:35.290> this<00:06:36.290> is<00:06:36.530> silo<00:06:36.950> green<00:06:37.190> in

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
looking good yeah this is silo green in

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.430 
looking good yeah this is silo green in
here<00:06:37.670> added<00:06:38.210> in<00:06:38.860> along<00:06:39.860> with<00:06:40.130> silo<00:06:40.850> blue<00:06:41.440> mixed

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
here added in along with silo blue mixed

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.900 
here added in along with silo blue mixed
with<00:06:42.530> a<00:06:42.560> little<00:06:42.770> of<00:06:43.070> marine<00:06:43.310> blue<00:06:43.490> and<00:06:43.880> a

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
with a little of marine blue and a

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.970 
with a little of marine blue and a
little<00:06:44.210> burnt<00:06:44.600> sienna<00:06:45.080> to<00:06:45.320> dull<00:06:45.650> it<00:06:45.800> down<00:06:45.830> a

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
little burnt sienna to dull it down a

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.500 
little burnt sienna to dull it down a
little<00:06:46.190> bit<00:06:46.370> so<00:06:46.670> it<00:06:46.760> is<00:06:46.820> a<00:06:46.880> 2<00:06:47.440> candy-coated<00:06:48.470> and

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
little bit so it is a 2 candy-coated and

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.980 
little bit so it is a 2 candy-coated and
forming<00:06:50.510> a<00:06:50.720> basic<00:06:51.170> wash<00:06:52.010> to<00:06:52.730> build<00:06:53.180> up<00:06:53.360> my<00:06:53.540> seat

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
forming a basic wash to build up my seat

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.540 
forming a basic wash to build up my seat
and<00:06:54.380> then<00:06:54.470> we'll<00:06:54.650> have<00:06:54.770> some<00:06:54.800> darker<00:06:55.310> waves

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
and then we'll have some darker waves

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.100 
and then we'll have some darker waves
and<00:06:55.970> what<00:06:57.370> God<00:06:58.370> willing<00:06:58.670> rather<00:06:59.330> nice<00:06:59.690> when<00:07:00.020> I

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
and what God willing rather nice when I

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.800 
and what God willing rather nice when I
get<00:07:00.290> done<00:07:00.530> so<00:07:01.340> that's<00:07:01.970> clip<00:07:02.450> number<00:07:02.810> 5<00:07:03.260> and

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
get done so that's clip number 5 and

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.540 
get done so that's clip number 5 and
after<00:07:05.810> and<00:07:06.590> the<00:07:06.680> next<00:07:06.920> one<00:07:07.070> will<00:07:07.220> keep

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
after and the next one will keep

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.700 
after and the next one will keep
developing<00:07:07.820> the<00:07:08.180> sea<00:07:08.390> moving<00:07:08.810> down<00:07:08.990> here<00:07:09.020> and

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
developing the sea moving down here and

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.590 
developing the sea moving down here and
go<00:07:09.830> back<00:07:09.860> and<00:07:10.280> probably<00:07:10.970> finish<00:07:11.240> this<00:07:11.390> up

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:11.600 
go back and probably finish this up

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.650 
go back and probably finish this up
pretty<00:07:11.750> much<00:07:11.870> and<00:07:12.230> then<00:07:12.680> after<00:07:13.160> that<00:07:13.310> the<00:07:14.090> pine

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:14.660 
pretty much and then after that the pine

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.430 
pretty much and then after that the pine
trees<00:07:14.990> and<00:07:15.550> distant<00:07:16.870> rocks<00:07:17.870> on<00:07:18.110> the<00:07:18.230> right

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
trees and distant rocks on the right

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.760 
trees and distant rocks on the right
hand<00:07:18.680> side<00:07:19.270> with<00:07:20.270> there<00:07:20.480> a<00:07:20.750> few<00:07:21.170> pine<00:07:21.410> trees<00:07:21.620> on

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
hand side with there a few pine trees on

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.130 
hand side with there a few pine trees on
them<00:07:21.920> and<00:07:22.070> then<00:07:22.190> that'll<00:07:22.580> be<00:07:22.610> it<00:07:22.700> so<00:07:23.210> that's<00:07:23.960> it

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 
them and then that'll be it so that's it

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.850 
them and then that'll be it so that's it
for<00:07:24.410> clip<00:07:25.070> number<00:07:25.310> five<00:07:25.640> bye<00:07:26.330> bye<00:07:26.510> for<00:07:26.780> now<00:07:26.860> be
