00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.860 
which is pretty cool
the<00:03:48.130> next<00:03:48.370> net<00:03:48.549> we<00:03:48.640> have<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:49.090> your<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.540> don't

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
the next net we have is your I don't

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.180 
the next net we have is your I don't
even<00:03:49.959> know<00:03:50.200> what<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.470> your<00:03:50.769> model<00:03:51.160> number

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
even know what it is your model number

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.330 
even know what it is your model number
and<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.420> believe<00:03:52.660> that's<00:03:52.750> about<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.560> some

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
and I believe that's about it in some

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.660 
and I believe that's about it in some
manuals<00:03:55.000> as<00:03:55.269> well<00:03:55.720> but<00:03:56.680> um<00:03:56.860> that's<00:03:57.070> basically

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.490
