JX<00:00:09.150> did<00:00:09.450> update<00:00:09.690> some<00:00:10.530> DG<00:00:10.950> rewards<00:00:11.400> honestly

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
JX did update some DG rewards honestly

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.910 
JX did update some DG rewards honestly
most<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.690> them<00:00:12.840> didn't<00:00:13.139> pertain<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.769> me

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
most of them didn't pertain to me

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.880 
most of them didn't pertain to me
because<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.580> am<00:00:14.700> 200<00:00:15.210> mil<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.929> most<00:00:16.650> of

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
because I am 200 mil and like most of

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.980 
because I am 200 mil and like most of
the<00:00:16.980> stuff<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.430> copy<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.420> his<00:00:18.539> attention<00:00:18.960> was

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the stuff that copy of his attention was

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.970 
the stuff that copy of his attention was
like<00:00:19.430> pets<00:00:20.430> which<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.779> um<00:00:22.109> I'm

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
like pets which I'm not really um I'm

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.500 
like pets which I'm not really um I'm
not<00:00:23.100> opposed<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.550> them<00:00:23.699> obviously<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.300> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
not opposed to them obviously but you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420 
not opposed to them obviously but you
know<00:00:24.630> these<00:00:24.990> don't<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.769> bother<00:00:25.920> me<00:00:26.070> it's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
know these don't really bother me it's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.609 
know these don't really bother me it's
not<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.789> would<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> tokens<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:28.470> get

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
not like it would have the tokens to get

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
not like it would have the tokens to get
those<00:00:28.740> anyways<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.490> um<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:30.449> did<00:00:30.689> really

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
those anyways but um what did really

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.229 
those anyways but um what did really
catch<00:00:31.170> my<00:00:31.349> attention<00:00:31.380> were<00:00:31.920> these<00:00:32.099> two<00:00:32.520> new

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
catch my attention were these two new

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.080 
catch my attention were these two new
Scrolls<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.960> basically<00:00:34.730> we've<00:00:35.730> already<00:00:35.880> had

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
Scrolls so basically we've already had

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
Scrolls so basically we've already had
the<00:00:36.239> squall<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.630> efficiency<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.320> smithing

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the squall of efficiency for smithing

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.190 
the squall of efficiency for smithing
and<00:00:38.270> scroll<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.390> cleansing<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:39.899> herb<00:00:40.020> lore

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and scroll of cleansing for herb lore

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
and scroll of cleansing for herb lore
which<00:00:40.440> basically<00:00:40.710> saved<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.910> ten

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
which basically saved you like ten

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.479 
which basically saved you like ten
percent<00:00:42.829> if<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.010> were<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> train<00:00:44.460> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
percent if you were to train that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.360 
percent if you were to train that
towards<00:00:45.360> 200<00:00:45.690> mil<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.050> whatever<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
towards 200 mil or whatever and so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.090 
towards 200 mil or whatever and so
basically<00:00:47.550> yep<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.180> there's<00:00:48.420> 24<00:00:48.960> there's<00:00:49.950> one

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
basically yep now there's 24 there's one

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.319 
basically yep now there's 24 there's one
for<00:00:50.190> crafting<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.700> one<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:50.940> construction

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
for crafting and one for construction

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
for crafting and one for construction
now<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.350> obviously<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.399> cost

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
now so obviously this up my cost

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660 
now so obviously this up my cost
efficiency<00:00:54.449> guide<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.809> crafting<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
efficiency guide for crafting but in a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
efficiency guide for crafting but in a
good<00:00:56.820> way<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.059> suppose<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.469> even

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
good way I suppose because now it's even

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.270 
good way I suppose because now it's even
cheaper<00:00:59.149> which<00:01:00.149> means<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
cheaper which means that you know the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
cheaper which means that you know the
better<00:01:02.489> XP<00:01:03.390> per<00:01:03.510> hour<00:01:03.629> methods<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.140> even<00:01:04.439> more

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
better XP per hour methods are even more

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.920 
better XP per hour methods are even more
worth<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.790> than<00:01:05.909> ever<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
worth it to do so now than ever so I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.280 
worth it to do so now than ever so I
actually<00:01:07.200> haven't<00:01:07.500> bought<00:01:07.680> these<00:01:07.799> yet<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.310> um

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
actually haven't bought these yet so um

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
actually haven't bought these yet so um
let's<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.650> those<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.010> guess<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.520> pretty

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
let's just get those I guess I pretty

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.620 
let's just get those I guess I pretty
much<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.049> enough<00:01:13.229> tokens<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.890> did<00:01:14.220> um

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
much have just enough tokens I did um

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
much have just enough tokens I did um
use<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> rest<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.049> tokens<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.890> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
use the rest of my tokens when I was you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.230 
use the rest of my tokens when I was you
know<00:01:17.490> getting<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.060> 200<00:01:18.360> mil<00:01:18.479> DG<00:01:18.890> but<00:01:19.970> there<00:01:20.970> are

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
know getting my 200 mil DG but there are

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.859 
know getting my 200 mil DG but there are
those<00:01:21.600> too<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:23.150> yeah<00:01:24.150> make<00:01:24.420> sure<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.720> get

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
those too and yeah make sure to get

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
those too and yeah make sure to get
those<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.680> pretty<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:26.040> ten

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
those because it's pretty much ten

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
those because it's pretty much ten
percent<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> considering<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.470> would

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
percent and considering that it would

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.870 
percent and considering that it would
probably<00:01:28.740> cost<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:30.290> unlike<00:01:31.490> more<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.670> 10

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
probably cost like unlike more than 10

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.450 
probably cost like unlike more than 10
bill<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.460> 200<00:01:35.850> mil<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.180> both

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
bill to to get 200 mil in both

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.649 
bill to to get 200 mil in both
respectively<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.729> both<00:01:38.909> construction<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
respectively in both construction and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.140 
respectively in both construction and
crafting<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.470> probably<00:01:40.909> worth<00:01:41.909> your

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
crafting then it's probably worth your

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230 
crafting then it's probably worth your
money<00:01:42.920> or<00:01:43.920> work<00:01:44.220> through<00:01:44.250> DG<00:01:44.670> tokens<00:01:45.000> rather

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
money or work through DG tokens rather

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
money or work through DG tokens rather
to<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.920> nothing<00:01:46.920> else<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.159> caught<00:01:47.430> my

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to do it nothing else really caught my

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.359 
to do it nothing else really caught my
attention<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.360> saw<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.380> heard<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.159> chaotic

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
attention I saw like I heard of chaotic

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
attention I saw like I heard of chaotic

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
spear money collector honestly i don't i

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.920 
spear money collector honestly i don't i
don't<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.149> worth<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.659> i<00:01:54.720> mean

20 k DG tokens for 1 million coins i
mean<00:01:59.790> i<00:01:59.820> guess<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> don't<00:02:00.869> want<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> use<00:02:01.170> it
