yeah<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.570> definitely<00:02:49.690> think<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:51.160> ones<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.520> we

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
yeah I definitely think the ones that we

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.450 
yeah I definitely think the ones that we
did<00:02:51.850> thin<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.810> get<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> cooler<00:02:53.500> flow<00:02:53.920> out<00:02:54.250> of

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
did thin you get a cooler flow out of

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.450 
did thin you get a cooler flow out of
there<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:56.170> white<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.770> think<00:02:57.070> yeah<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.340> think

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
there and for white I think yeah I think

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.640 
there and for white I think yeah I think
yeah<00:02:57.670> that's<00:02:57.910> mostly<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.510> size<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.110> your<00:02:59.260> piece

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
yeah that's mostly a size of your piece

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.600 
yeah that's mostly a size of your piece
of<00:02:59.680> work<00:03:00.040> here<00:03:00.310> oh<00:03:02.190> let's<00:03:03.190> not<00:03:03.250> on<00:03:03.430> your

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
of work here oh let's not on your

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.970 
of work here oh let's not on your
corners<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:05.110> corners<00:03:05.500> dad's<00:03:05.710> finally

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
corners on your corners dad's finally

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.890 
corners on your corners dad's finally
washing<00:03:06.580> over<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.940> corners<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.510> here<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
washing over the corners in here just a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.390 
washing over the corners in here just a
little<00:03:08.110> bit<00:03:08.550> each<00:03:09.550> corner<00:03:09.910> exposed<00:03:10.480> right<00:03:11.400> dad

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
little bit each corner exposed right dad

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.040 
little bit each corner exposed right dad
that<00:03:12.640> again<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.030> think<00:03:13.090> you're<00:03:13.330> right<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.600> going

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
that again I think you're right is going

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.160 
that again I think you're right is going
to<00:03:14.110> be<00:03:14.170> size<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.250> project<00:03:15.930> that's<00:03:16.930> why<00:03:17.110> I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
to be size of the project that's why I

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.380 
to be size of the project that's why I
think<00:03:17.260> they<00:03:17.530> having<00:03:17.980> bigger<00:03:18.310> broader<00:03:18.790> squares

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
think they having bigger broader squares

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.490 
think they having bigger broader squares
so<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.470> separation<00:03:20.920> yeah<00:03:22.470> okay

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
so that you get the separation yeah okay

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.890 
so that you get the separation yeah okay
at<00:03:23.830> first<00:03:24.070> or<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.910> second<00:03:25.240> color<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.600> put<00:03:25.750> on

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
at first or the second color you put on

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.170 
at first or the second color you put on
where<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.440> squared<00:03:26.800> off<00:03:27.010> okay<00:03:27.460> so<00:03:27.970> cool

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
where that just squared off okay so cool

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.900 
where that just squared off okay so cool
you're<00:03:28.720> gonna<00:03:28.780> gonna<00:03:29.350> stop<00:03:29.710> anytime<00:03:29.950> soon

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.230 

that's<00:03:33.910> what<00:03:34.090> I'm<00:03:34.180> having<00:03:34.330> fun<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.940> looks

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
that's what I'm having fun that looks

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.570 
that's what I'm having fun that looks
really<00:03:37.420> yeah<00:03:38.020> that<00:03:38.290> looks<00:03:38.890> good<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.370> then<00:03:39.520> I

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
really yeah that looks good and then I

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.400 
really yeah that looks good and then I
was<00:03:39.820> at<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.150> reason<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.450> was<00:03:40.570> asking<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.990> was

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
was at the reason I was asking I was

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.870 
was at the reason I was asking I was
thinking<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:41.890> should<00:03:41.920> probably<00:03:42.430> stop

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
thinking that you should probably stop

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.560 
thinking that you should probably stop
with<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.540> orange<00:03:43.930> but<00:03:44.800> it<00:03:45.090> probably<00:03:46.090> cooled

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
with the orange but it probably cooled

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
with the orange but it probably cooled
now<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:47.140> just<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:48.420> real<00:03:49.420> small<00:03:49.810> amount<00:03:50.320> that

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
now to do just a real small amount that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.140 
now to do just a real small amount that
really<00:03:50.860> doesn't<00:03:51.040> flow<00:03:51.400> very<00:03:51.430> much<00:03:51.910> off<00:03:52.120> of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
really doesn't flow very much off of

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.510 
really doesn't flow very much off of
that<00:03:52.480> top<00:03:52.810> breakfast<00:03:53.560> which<00:03:53.920> contrary<00:03:54.400> to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
that top breakfast which contrary to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
are trying to try pouring so little that

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.350 
are trying to try pouring so little that
it<00:04:05.740> doesn't<00:04:06.190> you<00:04:06.430> know<00:04:06.550> necessarily<00:04:06.820> float

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
it doesn't you know necessarily float

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.420 
it doesn't you know necessarily float
too<00:04:07.840> much<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.320> change<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.740> but<00:04:08.890> just<00:04:09.130> gives<00:04:09.340> you

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
too much to change it but just gives you

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.040 
too much to change it but just gives you
a<00:04:09.490> little<00:04:09.640> bit<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:09.910> color<00:04:10.300> right<00:04:10.360> on<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.810> tile

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
that's going to get close to the edge

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.200 
that's going to get close to the edge
but<00:04:26.160> not<00:04:27.919> nice<00:04:28.919> sweet<00:04:29.310> patootie<00:04:29.669> another

example<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.780> brown<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.259> top<00:04:31.319> that's<00:04:32.009> the<00:04:32.130> hard

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
example of brown on top that's the hard

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.279 
example of brown on top that's the hard
part<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.729> figuring<00:04:32.940> out<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.569> know<00:04:33.599> okay<00:04:34.139> where

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
part is figuring out you know okay where

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.589 
part is figuring out you know okay where
do<00:04:34.349> you<00:04:34.380> stop<00:04:37.729> yeah<00:04:38.729> that's<00:04:38.910> what<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.090> was<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.479> was

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
thinking stop at the blue so slow down

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.379 
thinking stop at the blue so slow down
yeah<00:04:43.770> okay<00:04:44.250> nice<00:04:44.639> done<00:04:46.220> it's<00:04:47.220> done<00:04:47.400> you

yeah okay nice done it's done you
signing<00:04:48.720> off<00:04:48.870> looks<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:49.650> four-leaf

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
signing off looks like a four-leaf

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.610 
signing off looks like a four-leaf
clover<00:04:50.580> flow<00:04:51.389> dizzle<00:04:51.780> gives<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.110> thumbs<00:04:52.410> up

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
clover flow dizzle gives it a thumbs up

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:06.140 
clover flow dizzle gives it a thumbs up
now<00:04:55.610> it's<00:04:56.610> close<00:04:57.599> enough<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:58.169> will<00:04:58.530> say<00:05:05.150> okay

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
now it's close enough to will say okay

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.110 
now it's close enough to will say okay
we'll<00:05:06.360> come<00:05:06.479> back<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.750> visit<00:05:06.840> later
