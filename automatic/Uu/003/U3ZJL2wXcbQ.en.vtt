00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
always be like how I think because I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.090 
always be like how I think because I
keep<00:01:35.520> smiling<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.150> time<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:37.350> make

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
keep smiling all the time and I'm make

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.800 
keep smiling all the time and I'm make
make<00:01:38.700> make<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.509> point<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.790> I'm<00:01:41.790> happy<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.780> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
guess that makes a difference that's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149
