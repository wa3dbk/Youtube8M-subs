number of difficulties as well from
casual<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.939> figure<00:01:36.390> out<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> most

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
casual to I figure out the most

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.560 
casual to I figure out the most
difficult<00:01:37.140> category<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.070> called<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> from

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
difficult category is called and from

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780 
difficult category is called and from
what<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.869> tell<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.470> doesn't<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.400> alter

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
what I can tell it doesn't really alter

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.780 
what I can tell it doesn't really alter
too<00:01:41.970> much<00:01:42.150> outside<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:43.340> secondary<00:01:44.340> jump

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
too much outside of your secondary jump

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090 
too much outside of your secondary jump
height<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.149> believe<00:01:45.680> everything<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.950> just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
height I believe everything is just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.710 
height I believe everything is just
basically<00:01:47.520> against<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> clock<00:01:48.240> there's<00:01:48.600> no

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
basically against the clock there's no

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.450 
basically against the clock there's no
countdown<00:01:49.350> time<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:49.770> anything<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.280> not

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

this video a couple times it's just

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
this video a couple times it's just
basically<00:01:59.790> about<00:02:00.119> speed<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.320> fast

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
basically about speed and going as fast

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.080 
basically about speed and going as fast
as<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.040> through<00:02:02.280> level<00:02:02.520> especially<00:02:02.640> time

global leaderboards which is pretty cool

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.070 
global leaderboards which is pretty cool
you<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.610> see<00:02:11.730> how<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.879> stack<00:02:12.510> up<00:02:12.540> against

over<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> world<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.250> didn't<00:02:14.549> see<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> way<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
over the world I didn't see a way to

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.880 
over the world I didn't see a way to
filter<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.870> your<00:02:15.989> friends<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.650> might

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
filter it for just your friends it might

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.339 
filter it for just your friends it might
be<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.190> there<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:18.120> might<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.629> very<00:02:18.840> well<00:02:19.080> hidden

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
be on there it might be very well hidden

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.930 
be on there it might be very well hidden
because<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:20.069> not<00:02:20.220> been<00:02:20.370> able<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
because I have not been able to see it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.210 
because I have not been able to see it
but<00:02:21.900> each<00:02:22.230> level<00:02:22.650> raises<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.610> different<00:02:24.599> I

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
but each level raises a different I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.180 
but each level raises a different I
guess<00:02:26.220> challenge<00:02:26.879> or<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:28.560> definitely<00:02:29.010> they

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
guess challenge or it definitely they

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.710

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
the further up in the list you go you'll

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.809 
the further up in the list you go you'll
see<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.780> beginning<00:02:34.140> level<00:02:34.409> here<00:02:34.680> very<00:02:35.280> basic

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
see the beginning level here very basic

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.930 
see the beginning level here very basic
stuff<00:02:36.120> not<00:02:36.629> too<00:02:37.140> many<00:02:37.349> trick<00:02:38.220> jumps<00:02:38.549> required

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
stuff not too many trick jumps required

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.729 
stuff not too many trick jumps required
and<00:02:39.209> then<00:02:39.599> you'll<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:39.930> another<00:02:40.200> level<00:02:40.620> which

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
and then you'll see another level which

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.289 
and then you'll see another level which
is<00:02:40.890> i<00:02:40.980> believe<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.459> second<00:02:41.909> level<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
is i believe the second level in the

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.539 
is i believe the second level in the
game<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.840> play<00:02:43.019> all<00:02:43.980> levels<00:02:44.459> i

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
game that you can play all levels i

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.860 
game that you can play all levels i
believe<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:44.909> unlocked<00:02:45.239> from<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> start<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
believe are unlocked from the start so

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.030 
believe are unlocked from the start so
any<00:02:46.049> more<00:02:46.170> worried<00:02:46.260> about<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
any more worried about that this is the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.400 
any more worried about that this is the
second<00:02:47.370> level<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.819> actually<00:02:48.750> gives<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
second level that actually gives you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.479 
second level that actually gives you
more<00:02:50.120> vertical<00:02:51.120> running<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.170> space<00:02:52.890> here<00:02:53.190> there

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
more vertical running a space here there

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.910 
more vertical running a space here there
is<00:02:53.609> wall<00:02:53.849> jumping<00:02:54.390> secondary<00:02:55.260> jumping<00:02:55.769> you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
is wall jumping secondary jumping you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.729 
is wall jumping secondary jumping you
can<00:02:56.069> slow<00:02:56.489> down<00:02:56.700> time<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.660> fall<00:02:58.109> faster

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
can slow down time you can fall faster

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.140 
can slow down time you can fall faster
if<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:58.950> need<00:02:59.129> to<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.430> land<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.760> need<00:03:00.090> to

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
if you need to if you land that need to

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.210 
if you need to if you land that need to
land<00:03:00.359> on<00:03:00.510> something<00:03:00.720> precisely<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.620> quickly

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
land on something precisely and quickly

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.990 
land on something precisely and quickly
and<00:03:03.440> you're<00:03:04.440> basically<00:03:04.890> especially<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.819> time

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
and you're basically especially the time

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.369 
and you're basically especially the time
trial<00:03:06.269> mode<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.629> just<00:03:06.780> want<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:06.989> go<00:03:07.049> as<00:03:07.140> fast

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
trial mode you just want to go as fast

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.920 
trial mode you just want to go as fast
as<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.370> fall<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.090> might<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.840> well

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
as you can if you fall you might as well

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.119 
as you can if you fall you might as well
just<00:03:10.079> start<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.379> entire<00:03:10.560> thing<00:03:10.650> ever<00:03:11.010> because

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
just start the entire thing ever because

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.380 
just start the entire thing ever because
you're<00:03:11.370> not<00:03:11.519> going<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.819> at<00:03:11.909> anybody<00:03:12.180> slow

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
you're not going to be at anybody slow

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.630 
you're not going to be at anybody slow
time<00:03:12.599> then<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.859> sphere<00:03:13.920> hunter<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.549> a

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
time then in the sphere hunter it's a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.099 
time then in the sphere hunter it's a
bit<00:03:14.849> different<00:03:15.180> because<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> later

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
bit different because in the later

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.780 
bit different because in the later
levels<00:03:16.379> of<00:03:16.650> spheres<00:03:16.890> are<00:03:17.010> very<00:03:17.310> well<00:03:17.549> hidden

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
levels of spheres are very well hidden

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.849 
levels of spheres are very well hidden
in<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> earlier<00:03:18.540> levels<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.139> very<00:03:19.560> much<00:03:19.799> in

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
in the earlier levels so very much in

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.979 
in the earlier levels so very much in
the<00:03:20.010> open<00:03:20.459> just<00:03:21.090> go<00:03:21.209> through<00:03:21.419> it<00:03:21.450> as<00:03:21.540> quick<00:03:21.870> as

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
the open just go through it as quick as

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.530 
the open just go through it as quick as
you<00:03:22.109> can<00:03:22.340> like<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.459> said<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:23.849> a<00:03:23.970> simplistic

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
you can like I said it's a simplistic

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.990 
you can like I said it's a simplistic
game<00:03:25.370> even<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.430> description<00:03:26.849> says

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
game even the description says
