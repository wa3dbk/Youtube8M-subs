00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 cheers, cheerfulness, really great 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.690
 Nevertheless, day is not no, even if 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.950
 today in many regions 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.750
 carnival begins or rather the the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.389
 carnival of the carnival starts 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 that is certainly not ours 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.420
 attached over carnival 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.359
 philosophies and july cheeriness 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.769
 to define but we do not go to any 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 fall for carnival to munich though 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.189
 is indeed so does and monastic not 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.289
 would have to do that definitely 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.580
 not so i believe in if you are 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 with such an attitude with such 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 thoughts in the least parts goes 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.010
 then you should do better in the act 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.930
 do not think about going there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.969
 You will be your first game as a coach 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.290
 against bavaria munich experience and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.670
 get a hiobsbotschaft after the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.899
 Another rhine is served klaas jan 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.559
 huntelaar can not play in any case 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.730
 Christian Fuchs locked in any case 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.440
 How do you deal with that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.329
 but they take the situation to it 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 does not bring anything to complain we have in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 katar where you look at people in the square 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 get and also eleven good people and so 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.550
 we will accept that and we will bring 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.379
 That's nothing about players now 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.449
 talk or now get upset or or 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.640
 say my god we have a bad luck like that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.229
 the situation at the moment is not working 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.270
 but we just have to do it all 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.340
 accept and have since the maximum 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 getting out in all this is also always 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.690
 a chance and also we are not allowed to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.060
 get infected and say hello 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.009
 I want to play football now 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 but you have to accept that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.840
 must see that the players really 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.100
 come back quickly 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.200
 for a severe flu like julia 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.560
 For example , nobody can do anything there 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.390
 or over class the injury 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.920
 Munich wants then from the whole records 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.440
 in this season placed on 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.520
 Enumerate the day after tomorrow here 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.100
 how can the team go about it 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.350
 ours with an absolute readiness 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.899
 we have to be there tomorrow everyone has to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.830
 its limits go without saying 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.660
 we will deal with the difficulty of 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.060
 task 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.860
 we meet a team that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.369
 currently certainly the best in 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.170
 Europe belongs to the league and dominated by 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.759
 therefore the task is of course enormous 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.970
 tremendous does not include that one 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.560
 already satisfied with that in advance 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.470
 gives that one loses but we 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.179
 have to try everything 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.890
 do their good results to 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.720
 achieve and that is also the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.030
 Commitment The task everyone must 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.060
 a willingness to run the absolute 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.310
 yes, yes, every fight too 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.170
 win to be aggressive the mistakes 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.410
 minimize the personal or 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.690
 individual mistakes and so we will 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.220
 a winemaker after trying to pass 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.050
 other teams already in the season 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.080
 demonstrated that it works 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.700
 However, as I said it needs it 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.599
 a perfect interplay of each 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.680
 individual and faith and the will 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.180
 because also something to take with you 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.330
 which lessons do you draw from the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.370
 training game in Qatar at the time yes that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.200
 is true that a preparation b was 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.790
 the squad then decimated so 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.879
 so now it's from here 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.750
 This game is in preparation 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.550
 pulled out a lot more 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.220
 what you have to change but as I said 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.930
 it was a squad a team that way 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.490
 never play I have many young 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.770
 many players play that very much 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.700
 did not play for a long time 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.400
 nevertheless, it was still one 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.110
 test game and we could not do that either 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.280
 act like bavaria munich the one more 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.380
 Halftime number eight or nine 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.520
 have brought national player and 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.260
 That's why we have the lessons 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.550
 but how was that for me 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.490
 I have a preparation game 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.220
 always said that counts for preparation 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.110
 it requires a high concentration 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.120
 a perfect intense cohesion 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.459
 you have to go with man and mouse 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.709
 Defending will have no chance 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.120
 if we only 90 minutes already only 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.370
 defend but we have to stop too 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.650
 Stop the flight ahead and see 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.230
 Accident also earn opportunities because 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.700
 otherwise it's just then of course 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.459
 very very difficult against such a strong one 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.140
 only to defend the team yes us 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.100
 will hopefully be the healthy mix 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.080
 Find 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.640
 with defensive driving and still always 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.020
 again our chance in the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.610
 to seek forward movement 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.290
 you do not get against Bayern Munich 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.810
 too many possibilities and the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.770
 few we need to get 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.350
 we of course benefit 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.610
 but it is indeed so that it 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.410
 of course he is heavy against bavaria 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.000
 munich to go forward on it when the 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.070
 Rooms get too big for their speed 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.360
 and individual top-class players 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.360
 then would play
