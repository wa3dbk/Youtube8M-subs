double<00:00:18.790> moms<00:00:18.970> triple<00:00:19.390> mobs<00:00:19.660> I<00:00:19.900> just<00:00:20.380> think

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
double moms triple mobs I just think

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.440 
double moms triple mobs I just think
it's<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.800> best<00:00:20.950> to<00:00:21.250> use<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.730> best<00:00:22.000> weapon<00:00:22.360> it

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
it's the best to use the best weapon it

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.090 
it's the best to use the best weapon it
just<00:00:22.630> makes<00:00:22.810> a<00:00:22.900> lot<00:00:23.110> less<00:00:23.290> frustrating<00:00:23.890> and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
just makes a lot less frustrating and

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100 
just makes a lot less frustrating and
easier<00:00:24.790> on<00:00:24.880> myself<00:00:25.030> so<00:00:25.390> that's<00:00:25.810> just<00:00:25.870> what<00:00:26.080> I

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
easier on myself so that's just what I

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.440 
easier on myself so that's just what I
like<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.440> do<00:00:26.590> and<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.490> mp7<00:00:27.789> it's<00:00:28.180> pretty<00:00:28.360> much

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
like to do and the mp7 it's pretty much

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.970 
like to do and the mp7 it's pretty much
the<00:00:28.510> full<00:00:28.810> package<00:00:28.990> when<00:00:29.320> it<00:00:29.410> comes<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.650> that<00:00:29.800> I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
the full package when it comes to that I

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.410 
the full package when it comes to that I
think<00:00:30.010> it's<00:00:30.340> in<00:00:30.460> my<00:00:30.580> opinion<00:00:30.850> the<00:00:31.060> best<00:00:31.180> gun<00:00:31.390> in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
think it's in my opinion the best gun in

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.779 
think it's in my opinion the best gun in
the<00:00:31.539> game<00:00:31.690> because<00:00:32.200> it's<00:00:32.770> got<00:00:33.249> it<00:00:33.399> all<00:00:33.489> I<00:00:33.550> mean

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789

the game because it's got it all I mean
it's<00:00:33.940> got<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.089> really<00:00:34.329> good<00:00:34.420> rate<00:00:34.690> of<00:00:34.780> fire

that's<00:00:51.819> pretty<00:00:52.210> much<00:00:52.269> it<00:00:52.329> for<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.719> game<00:00:52.839> point

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
that's pretty much it for the game point

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.079 
that's pretty much it for the game point
the<00:00:53.199> first<00:00:53.379> blow<00:00:53.589> up<00:00:53.710> streak<00:00:53.949> was<00:00:54.100> like<00:00:54.249> 105

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
the first blow up streak was like 105

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.969 
the first blow up streak was like 105
seconds<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:55.899> was<00:00:56.199> pretty<00:00:56.319> fast<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:56.889> then

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
seconds so that was pretty fast and then

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.829 
seconds so that was pretty fast and then
the<00:00:57.069> second<00:00:57.399> one<00:00:57.429> was<00:00:57.519> like<00:00:57.789> two<00:00:58.329> minutes<00:00:58.539> and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
the second one was like two minutes and

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.930 
the second one was like two minutes and
20<00:00:59.559> seconds<00:00:59.859> i<00:00:59.979> believe<00:01:00.249> so<00:01:00.519> they<00:01:00.670> were<00:01:00.729> both

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
20 seconds i believe so they were both

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.430 
20 seconds i believe so they were both
pretty<00:01:01.179> fast<00:01:01.479> mob<00:01:01.780> streaks<00:01:02.049> and<00:01:02.229> that's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
pretty fast mob streaks and that's

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.710 
pretty fast mob streaks and that's
without<00:01:02.710> editing<00:01:03.159> now<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.909> cut<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.299> first<00:01:04.510> warp

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
without editing now I cut the first warp

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.300 
without editing now I cut the first warp
streak<00:01:04.960> down<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.230> like<00:01:05.379> 90<00:01:05.680> seconds<00:01:06.040> i<00:01:06.100> cut<00:01:06.280> out

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
streak down to like 90 seconds i cut out

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.100 
streak down to like 90 seconds i cut out
like<00:01:06.520> 15<00:01:06.910> seconds<00:01:07.270> with<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.450> little<00:01:07.660> transition

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
like 15 seconds with a little transition

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.290 
like 15 seconds with a little transition
because<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:09.010> spawns<00:01:09.280> flipped<00:01:09.610> in<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:10.210> know

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
because the spawns flipped in you know

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.520 
because the spawns flipped in you know
what<00:01:10.420> i<00:01:10.450> do<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.630> i<00:01:10.810> just<00:01:10.930> try<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.260> keep<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
gameplay as fast paced and action packed

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
most and it also cuts down on the video

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.990 
most and it also cuts down on the video
times<00:01:17.140> as<00:01:17.320> well<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:17.800> that's<00:01:18.490> just<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.760> reason

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
times as well so that's just the reason

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.820 
times as well so that's just the reason

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
somebody come out and they were pretty

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.909 
somebody come out and they were pretty
much<00:02:58.239> just<00:02:58.419> saw<00:02:58.629> it<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.799> know<00:02:59.889> I

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.050 
much just saw it in there so you know I

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
used them all up the clear mouth which

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.149 
used them all up the clear mouth which
is<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.389> technique<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.989> use<00:03:02.019> well<00:03:02.769> back<00:03:03.010> to

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
is one technique that I use well back to

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.949 
is one technique that I use well back to
the<00:03:03.189> fishing<00:03:03.579> I<00:03:03.760> really<00:03:04.389> like<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.659> catch<00:03:04.810> the

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
the fishing I really like to catch the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.119 
the fishing I really like to catch the
wall<00:03:05.139> I<00:03:05.169> because<00:03:05.590> those<00:03:05.799> are<00:03:05.919> the<00:03:06.040> best

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
wall I because those are the best

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.559 
wall I because those are the best
fighters<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.700> they<00:03:06.790> also<00:03:06.909> taste<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.450> best

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
fighters and they also taste the best

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.599 
fighters and they also taste the best
and<00:03:07.810> then<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:08.349> also<00:03:08.500> go<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:08.709> bass<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.430> perch

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
and then we also go for bass and perch

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.190 
and then we also go for bass and perch
the<00:03:09.849> best<00:03:10.030> are<00:03:10.239> pretty<00:03:10.480> good<00:03:10.629> fighters<00:03:10.959> but

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
the best are pretty good fighters but

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.080 
the best are pretty good fighters but
the<00:03:11.409> porcino<00:03:11.919> they're<00:03:12.069> not<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.430> big<00:03:12.970> of

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the porcino they're not that big of

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.819 
the porcino they're not that big of
Fighters<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.379> know<00:03:14.470> they're<00:03:14.620> really

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
Fighters because you know they're really

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.949 
Fighters because you know they're really
tiny<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.669> that's<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.180> definitely<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.720> lot<00:03:16.840> of
