00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.230 

yeah<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:04.920> mean<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.339> know<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.609> result<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.210> think

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
yeah I mean you know the result I think

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.220 
yeah I mean you know the result I think
is<00:00:06.629> uh<00:00:07.490> probably<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.700> little<00:00:09.090> unfair<00:00:09.630> in

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
is uh probably a little unfair in

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.709 
is uh probably a little unfair in
relation<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.700> performance<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.599> don't

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
relation to to the performance I don't

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.470 
relation to to the performance I don't
think<00:00:12.870> either<00:00:12.990> team<00:00:13.380> played<00:00:14.000> play<00:00:15.000> drop<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.450> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
think either team played play drop up to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960 
think either team played play drop up to
their<00:00:15.780> potential<00:00:16.139> um<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:17.130> look<00:00:17.250> at<00:00:17.400> shots<00:00:17.670> it

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
their potential um you look at shots it

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.370 
their potential um you look at shots it
was<00:00:18.060> ten<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.449> seven<00:00:18.630> our<00:00:18.960> favor<00:00:20.180> but<00:00:21.230> was<00:00:22.230> not

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
was ten to seven our favor but was not

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
was ten to seven our favor but was not
one<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.619> our<00:00:22.830> better<00:00:23.039> performances<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.970> don't

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
one of our better performances I don't

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.589 
one of our better performances I don't
think<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.630> deserve<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:24.990> win<00:00:28.039> you<00:00:29.039> know<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.279> had

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
think we deserve to win you know we had

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.700 
think we deserve to win you know we had
inconsistency<00:00:32.840> personnel-wise<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.380> don't

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
inconsistency personnel-wise I don't

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
inconsistency personnel-wise I don't
think<00:00:34.920> anybody<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.579> consistent<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.450> 90

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
think anybody was consistent for 90

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.590 
think anybody was consistent for 90
minutes<00:00:36.980> in<00:00:37.980> their<00:00:38.520> role<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.210> expect

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
minutes in their role and what we expect

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
minutes in their role and what we expect
out<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.280> thought<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.700> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
out of them and I thought there was a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.139 
out of them and I thought there was a
lot<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.910> inconsistency<00:00:43.550> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.879> attacking

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
lot of inconsistency on the attacking

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.229 
lot of inconsistency on the attacking
side<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.100> on<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> defensive<00:00:47.700> side<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.180> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
side and on the defensive side so you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.490 
side and on the defensive side so you
know<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.719> me<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:50.149> disappointing

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
know for me it was a disappointing

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.420 
know for me it was a disappointing
performance<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> lot<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.860> started<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> game

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
performance a lot we started the game

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.939 
performance a lot we started the game
slow<00:00:53.820> dug<00:00:54.480> ourselves<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.899> hole<00:00:54.930> made<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> couple

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
slow dug ourselves a hole made a couple

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.810 
slow dug ourselves a hole made a couple
bad<00:00:56.100> mistakes<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.969> led<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> goals<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.809> them

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
bad mistakes that led to goals for them

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.660 
bad mistakes that led to goals for them
they<00:00:59.820> didn't<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> lot<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.390> great<00:01:00.629> chances

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
they didn't get a lot of great chances

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
they didn't get a lot of great chances
but<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.820> made<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.210> critical<00:01:03.600> mistakes<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
but we made some critical mistakes that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.850 
but we made some critical mistakes that
led<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.080> go<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> zero<00:01:07.619> down

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
led to go and if you go to zero down

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.390 
led to go and if you go to zero down
it's<00:01:08.130> hard<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> recover<00:01:09.180> from<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.250> thought<00:01:11.250> we

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's hard to recover from and thought we

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.560 
it's hard to recover from and thought we
responded<00:01:11.549> better<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> second<00:01:12.659> half

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
responded better in the second half

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.700 
responded better in the second half
but<00:01:15.470> then<00:01:15.620> we<00:01:15.710> gave<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.890> third<00:01:16.280> goal<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:16.820> and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
but then we gave a third goal and and

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.930 
but then we gave a third goal and and
you<00:01:18.710> know<00:01:18.740> we<00:01:19.340> weren't<00:01:19.490> able<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.790> get

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
you know we weren't able to get

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.600 
you know we weren't able to get
ourselves<00:01:20.060> out<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.320> funk<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.400> lot<00:01:25.580> of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
ourselves out of the funk and a lot of

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.280 
ourselves out of the funk and a lot of
lot<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.000> things<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.540> improve<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.020> lot<00:01:27.170> of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
lot of things to improve in a lot of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.200 
lot of things to improve in a lot of
areas<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.830> you<00:01:28.400> know<00:01:28.490> first<00:01:28.790> one<00:01:28.910> is<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:29.119> got

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
areas and you know first one is we got

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.960 
areas and you know first one is we got
to<00:01:29.330> show<00:01:29.479> up<00:01:29.600> with<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.780> better<00:01:29.900> mentality<00:01:30.170> I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
to show up with a better mentality I

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.830 
to show up with a better mentality I
think<00:01:31.970> for<00:01:32.119> most<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.420> guys<00:01:32.540> it's

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
think for most of the guys it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.440 
think for most of the guys it's
confidence<00:01:33.759> majority<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.820> guys<00:01:35.000> we<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:35.300> out

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
confidence majority the guys we have out

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.690 
confidence majority the guys we have out
there<00:01:35.690> haven't<00:01:36.500> played<00:01:36.740> consistent<00:01:37.430> minutes

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
there haven't played consistent minutes

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.980 
there haven't played consistent minutes
they've<00:01:38.540> been<00:01:39.400> resource<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:40.700> I<00:01:41.300> think<00:01:41.540> you

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
they've been resource and I think you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.660 
they've been resource and I think you
know<00:01:42.080> they're<00:01:42.259> settling<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.040> they're

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
know they're settling in and they're

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.609 
know they're settling in and they're
trying<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.030> overcome<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.820> fact<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.210> they

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
trying to overcome the fact that they

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.170 
trying to overcome the fact that they
they<00:01:48.619> were<00:01:48.800> reserves<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.550> they<00:01:49.880> need<00:01:50.090> to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
they were reserves and they need to

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.880 
they were reserves and they need to
start<00:01:50.420> thinking<00:01:50.450> more<00:01:50.930> like<00:01:50.990> first<00:01:51.440> team<00:01:51.680> guys

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
start thinking more like first team guys

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.779 
start thinking more like first team guys
and<00:01:52.250> less<00:01:53.210> like<00:01:53.390> reserves<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.200> second<00:01:54.789> second

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
and less like reserves and second second

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.670 
and less like reserves and second second
tier<00:01:56.330> guys<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.740> know<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.130> belief<00:01:59.680> comes

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
tier guys and you know the belief comes

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.130 
tier guys and you know the belief comes
with<00:02:00.920> experience<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.759> having<00:02:02.240> success<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:03.050> I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
with experience and having success and I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.370 
with experience and having success and I
can't<00:02:03.619> give<00:02:03.770> these<00:02:03.920> guys<00:02:04.100> belief<00:02:04.550> they<00:02:04.820> gotta

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
can't give these guys belief they gotta

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.300 
can't give these guys belief they gotta
they<00:02:06.380> got<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.649> get<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:06.860> right<00:02:07.100> themselves

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
they got to get that right themselves

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.820 
they got to get that right themselves
and<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.149> think<00:02:08.720> there's<00:02:09.050> more<00:02:09.350> talent<00:02:09.769> out

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
and I think there's more talent out

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.580 
and I think there's more talent out
there<00:02:09.890> than<00:02:10.250> then<00:02:10.550> showed<00:02:10.820> today<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:12.350> think

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
there than then showed today and I think

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.500 
there than then showed today and I think
you<00:02:13.519> know<00:02:13.610> if<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.820> look<00:02:13.940> at<00:02:14.120> again<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
you know if you look at again the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.710 
you know if you look at again the
performance<00:02:15.110> wasn't<00:02:15.980> great<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:16.790> still<00:02:17.120> 10<00:02:17.600> to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
performance wasn't great but still 10 to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.690 
performance wasn't great but still 10 to
seven<00:02:18.050> shots<00:02:18.320> we<00:02:18.620> probably<00:02:18.890> has<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.190> had<00:02:19.580> as

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
seven shots we probably has it had as

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.300 
seven shots we probably has it had as
many<00:02:19.850> good<00:02:20.150> chances<00:02:20.570> as<00:02:20.720> they<00:02:20.870> had<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:22.160> we

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
many good chances as they had but we

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.270 
many good chances as they had but we
made<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.820> thought<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.330> couple<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.920> couple<00:02:24.920> more

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
made I thought a couple a couple more

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.460 
made I thought a couple a couple more
critical<00:02:26.150> mistakes<00:02:26.540> than<00:02:26.840> they<00:02:26.959> did<00:02:27.019> and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
critical mistakes than they did and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.039 
critical mistakes than they did and
that's<00:02:27.680> what<00:02:27.950> that's<00:02:28.910> what<00:02:29.030> led<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.600> to

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
that's what that's what led to the to

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.069 
that's what that's what led to the to
the<00:02:30.079> result<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.209> wasn't<00:02:32.209> good<00:02:32.329> enough<00:02:32.360> back

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
the result so I wasn't good enough back

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.680 
the result so I wasn't good enough back

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.539 
don't know maybe it's a positive trend
but

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
but

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.880 
but
we<00:02:58.549> got<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.819> get<00:02:58.879> a<00:02:58.939> lot<00:02:59.120> better<00:02:59.560> but<00:03:00.560> we're<00:03:00.739> not

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
we got to get a lot better but we're not

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.739 
we got to get a lot better but we're not
we're<00:03:01.159> not<00:03:01.189> worried<00:03:01.700> yet<00:03:01.909> obviously<00:03:02.480> we<00:03:02.599> got

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:02.749 
we're not worried yet obviously we got

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.569 
we're not worried yet obviously we got
some<00:03:03.019> more<00:03:03.590> guys<00:03:03.769> coming<00:03:03.829> in<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.340> fall<00:03:04.549> and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
some more guys coming in the fall and

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.670 
some more guys coming in the fall and
and<00:03:04.999> I<00:03:05.389> think<00:03:05.689> there<00:03:06.139> are<00:03:06.170> guys<00:03:06.409> out<00:03:06.620> there

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
and I think there are guys out there

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.209 
and I think there are guys out there
that<00:03:07.069> need<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:08.599> just<00:03:08.840> settle<00:03:09.650> in<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.040> gain

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
that need to just settle in and gain

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.129 
that need to just settle in and gain
some<00:03:10.430> more<00:03:10.549> experience<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.329> once<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.659> do<00:03:11.719> I

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
some more experience and once they do I

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.229 
some more experience and once they do I
think<00:03:12.379> it'll<00:03:12.650> be<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.859> lot<00:03:13.010> better<00:03:13.219> once<00:03:13.849> we<00:03:14.030> put

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
think it'll be a lot better once we put

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:24.660 
think it'll be a lot better once we put
all<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:14.510> pieces<00:03:14.659> together

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.730
