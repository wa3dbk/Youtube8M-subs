take a photograph of this camera

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.890 
take a photograph of this camera
comparing<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.490> an<00:00:11.639> antique<00:00:11.940> camera<00:00:12.450> it's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
comparing it to an antique camera it's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.419 
comparing it to an antique camera it's
an<00:00:13.019> assignment<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> client<00:00:14.309> of

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
an assignment I got from a client of

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.540 
an assignment I got from a client of
mine<00:00:14.460> we're<00:00:15.179> going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.450> use<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:16.049> light<00:00:16.260> source

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
mine we're going to use one light source

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.130 
mine we're going to use one light source
it's<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> softbox<00:00:18.420> using<00:00:18.810> flash

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
it's going to be a softbox using flash

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.740 
it's going to be a softbox using flash
so<00:00:20.070> let's<00:00:20.279> get<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> set<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.630> how

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
so let's get to the set and see how

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.370 
so let's get to the set and see how
we're<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> here's<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> final

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
we're going to do it so here's the final

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040 
we're going to do it so here's the final
shot<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.000> black<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.480> black

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
shot you can see it's black on black

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.740 
shot you can see it's black on black
very<00:00:28.439> elegant<00:00:29.119> something<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.330> may<00:00:30.449> consider

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
very elegant something you may consider

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.170 
very elegant something you may consider
to<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.019> hard<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.439> light<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.340> let's<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.940> over<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
to be hard to light so let's get over to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850 
to be hard to light so let's get over to
the<00:00:33.360> set<00:00:33.600> we'll<00:00:33.930> show<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> setup<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the set we'll show you the setup and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.250 
the set we'll show you the setup and
then<00:00:35.430> show<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.270> did<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
then show you what we did to get this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.369 
then show you what we did to get this
effect<00:00:37.760> step-by-step

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.650 

so<00:00:42.379> here's<00:00:42.559> our<00:00:42.649> set<00:00:42.920> I've<00:00:43.850> got<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.270> cameras

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
so here's our set I've got the cameras

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.319 
so here's our set I've got the cameras
on<00:00:44.840> a<00:00:44.870> glass<00:00:45.230> background<00:00:45.949> with<00:00:46.730> black<00:00:46.940> paper

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
on a glass background with black paper

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.759 
on a glass background with black paper
under<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.809> make<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.170> black<00:00:48.379> shiny

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
under it to make it a black shiny

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.900 
under it to make it a black shiny
surface<00:00:49.340> we've<00:00:50.239> got<00:00:50.420> a<00:00:50.449> softbox<00:00:51.140> on<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.649> left

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
surface we've got a softbox on the left

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.520 
surface we've got a softbox on the left
we<00:00:52.910> have<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.089> black<00:00:53.390> card<00:00:53.719> for<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:53.989> background

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
we have a black card for the background

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.310 
we have a black card for the background
and<00:00:54.829> a<00:00:55.250> couple<00:00:55.460> of<00:00:55.610> black<00:00:55.850> metal<00:00:56.180> objects<00:00:56.809> for

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
and a couple of black metal objects for

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.290 
and a couple of black metal objects for
graphic<00:00:57.680> interest<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.309> feel<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.059> black

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
graphic interest I feel that the black

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.649 
graphic interest I feel that the black
on<00:00:59.479> black<00:00:59.510> makes<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.260> very<00:01:00.500> powerful<00:01:00.769> image

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
on black makes it a very powerful image

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.719 
on black makes it a very powerful image
so<00:01:02.659> let's<00:01:02.839> back<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.229> camera<00:01:03.620> up<00:01:03.769> a<00:01:04.040> little<00:01:04.580> bit

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
so let's back the camera up a little bit

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.190 
so let's back the camera up a little bit
and<00:01:04.909> show<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.330> how<00:01:05.600> we're<00:01:05.750> going<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.960> light

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
and show you how we're going to light

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.639 
and show you how we're going to light
this<00:01:06.790> now<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:07.850> see<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.240> entire<00:01:08.360> set<00:01:08.899> we<00:01:09.530> have

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
this now we see the entire set we have

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.760 
this now we see the entire set we have
our<00:01:09.830> camera<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.490> foreground<00:01:10.820> here<00:01:11.240> a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
our camera in the foreground here a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.279 
our camera in the foreground here a
softbox<00:01:12.770> on<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.130> left<00:01:13.340> our<00:01:14.020> cameras<00:01:15.020> on<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
softbox on the left our cameras on the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.219 
softbox on the left our cameras on the
surface<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.009> I'm<00:01:16.399> using<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.759> very<00:01:16.789> small

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
surface and I'm using a very small

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.350 
surface and I'm using a very small
little<00:01:18.229> table<00:01:18.679> and<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.460> reason<00:01:19.580> for<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:19.940> is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
little table and the reason for that is

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.940 
little table and the reason for that is
so<00:01:20.539> I<00:01:20.570> can<00:01:20.810> get<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:21.050> light<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.380> very<00:01:21.530> close

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
so I can get the light and very close

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.969 
so I can get the light and very close
and<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.880> little<00:01:23.090> bit<00:01:23.210> lower<00:01:23.420> than<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.750> table<00:01:23.979> to

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
and a little bit lower than the table to

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.399 
and a little bit lower than the table to
get<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.250> nice<00:01:25.399> side<00:01:25.670> light<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.210> also<00:01:26.899> it

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
get the nice side light and also it

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.649 
get the nice side light and also it
gives<00:01:27.619> me<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.770> lot<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.039> height<00:01:28.399> here<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.570> I

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
gives me a lot of height here so that I

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.719 
gives me a lot of height here so that I
get<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.840> lot<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.050> light<00:01:30.259> over<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.979> top<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.550> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
get a lot of light over the top of the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.740 
get a lot of light over the top of the
cameras<00:01:32.149> as<00:01:32.360> well<00:01:33.190> we're<00:01:34.190> shooting<00:01:34.490> at<00:01:34.750> f-14

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
cameras as well we're shooting at f-14

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.270 
cameras as well we're shooting at f-14
and<00:01:36.429> 80th<00:01:37.429> of<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.640> second<00:01:38.200> iso<00:01:39.200> 100<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.039> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
and 80th of a second iso 100 and the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.120 
and 80th of a second iso 100 and the
lenses<00:01:40.550> it's<00:01:40.759> 72<00:01:41.119> millimeters<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:42.800> we<00:01:42.920> work

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
lenses it's 72 millimeters so we work

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.880 
lenses it's 72 millimeters so we work
that<00:01:43.310> exposure<00:01:43.759> out<00:01:44.060> earlier<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.590> now<00:01:45.619> let's

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
that exposure out earlier so now let's

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.940 
that exposure out earlier so now let's
turn<00:01:46.069> on<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.899> flash<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:49.220> make<00:01:49.369> an<00:01:49.489> exposure

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
turn on a flash and make an exposure

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.020 
turn on a flash and make an exposure
well<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.069> looks<00:01:52.220> really<00:01:52.399> nice<00:01:52.670> looks<00:01:52.970> very

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
well that looks really nice looks very

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.619 
well that looks really nice looks very
dramatic<00:01:53.690> it's<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.739> little<00:01:54.979> bit<00:01:55.099> too<00:01:55.340> black<00:01:55.629> so

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:56.629 
dramatic it's a little bit too black so

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:01.330 
dramatic it's a little bit too black so
let's<00:01:56.840> go<00:01:57.229> on<00:01:57.319> to<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.560> next<00:01:57.770> step
