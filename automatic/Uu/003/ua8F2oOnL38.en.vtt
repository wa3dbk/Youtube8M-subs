00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.379 
okay so what we're doing here as I said
I'm<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> middle<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.250> moving<00:00:08.610> where<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.090> been

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
but it's going to be pretty much the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.100 
but it's going to be pretty much the
same<00:00:11.219> process<00:00:11.459> as<00:00:11.879> if<00:00:12.029> you're<00:00:12.180> setting<00:00:12.779> up<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
same process as if you're setting up a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.439 
same process as if you're setting up a
new<00:00:13.289> one<00:00:13.469> first<00:00:13.940> it's<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> matter<00:00:15.180> of<00:00:15.240> selecting

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
and then what I was going to do is make

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.810 
and then what I was going to do is make
a<00:01:00.050> nice<00:01:00.260> solid<00:01:00.590> platform<00:01:01.280> for<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.550> air<00:01:01.670> I've

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
a nice solid platform for the air I've

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.400 
a nice solid platform for the air I've
been<00:01:02.380> now<00:01:03.380> I've<00:01:03.440> had<00:01:03.620> these<00:01:03.770> old<00:01:03.950> sleepers

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
been now I've had these old sleepers

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.170 
been now I've had these old sleepers
I've<00:01:06.410> just<00:01:06.620> cut<00:01:06.830> them<00:01:07.040> up<00:01:10.000> just<00:01:11.000> going<00:01:11.120> to

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
I've just cut them up just going to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:28.050 
I've just cut them up just going to
place<00:01:11.390> them<00:01:11.600> straight<00:01:11.930> out<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.290> ground

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.700 

but<00:01:28.689> there<00:01:28.869> we<00:01:28.990> have<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.259> that's<00:01:29.380> going<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.649> be

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
but there we have it that's going to be

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.050 
but there we have it that's going to be
a<00:01:29.740> great<00:01:29.920> platform<00:01:30.130> for<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.759> year<00:01:30.909> I've<00:01:31.030> been

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
a great platform for the year I've been

00:01:31.060 --> 00:02:18.900 
a great platform for the year I've been
to<00:01:31.329> sit<00:01:31.540> on<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.270> we'll<00:01:34.270> bring<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.630> beam<00:01:34.780> over

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.030 

that<00:02:19.480> should<00:02:19.660> work<00:02:19.840> really<00:02:20.050> well<00:02:20.320> they're<00:02:23.040> got

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
that should work really well they're got

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.370 
that should work really well they're got
access<00:02:24.490> both<00:02:25.000> doors<00:02:25.330> are<00:02:25.540> opening<00:02:25.840> sideways

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
access both doors are opening sideways

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.260 
access both doors are opening sideways
I'll<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.860> doing<00:02:27.130> most<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.520> removal<00:02:28.240> from

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
I'll be doing most of the removal from

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.040 
I'll be doing most of the removal from
this<00:02:28.570> side<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.820> little<00:02:30.820> tap<00:02:31.120> still<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.750> bottom

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
this side a little tap still the bottom

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.900 
this side a little tap still the bottom
here<00:02:32.230> will<00:02:32.350> be<00:02:32.470> able<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.710> access<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.430> like

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.640 

so<00:02:36.910> now<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.420> matter<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.810> adding<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
so now it's just a matter of adding the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.250 
so now it's just a matter of adding the
material
