 hello good afternoon today we are going to decorate 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.150
 with egg shells is a soap for 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.590
 hands to decorate our bathroom 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.750
 I hope you like it and do it and the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.140
 materials that we will use will be a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 Those one-price soap paints 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.480
 acrylics the triple tick that is a gloss 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:31.560
 bright this which is a primary and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.270
 shells and a brush and well let's 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 start 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.750
 now let's apply this primary law 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.050
 on the label that says in fine letters 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.430
 little girl that says base for metal and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.760
 alive and that consists of a phase with 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.190
 resin is so that we will not fall 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.250
 the painting or whatever there is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.120
 to froyo and it's for all kinds of material 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.840
 also for plastic and now we will stick 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.390
 our shells of one you already know 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.259
 you apply glue and then with the help 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.300
 of your brush you're sticking it up 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.110
 fill it completely 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.650

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.970
 gladis liliana and for our group of 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.480
 crafts and tutorials my passion the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.480
 recycling 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.270
 already finished putting all our 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.840
 shell we're going to apply glue and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.670
 already after dry we started to apply the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.609
 colors of your preference 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.879
 I'm going to use four colors that I'm going 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:11.430
 to dilute in some moments with water 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.870
 so that it enters very well between 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.870
 shell and plastic 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.920
 or 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.270
 and I only applied small rays 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.590
 and the work is very nice because 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.240
 Now let's stain with a little bag 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.240
 and with the brown color 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.670
 and 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.079
 and here we start with our 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.950
 small patches milestones here is your 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:14.049
 I like where I liked how it looked and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.000
 I felt that I was missing because I applied 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.690
 a little more coffee and so I went 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.590
 until I liked the result 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.590
 Y 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.930
 I did not want to stain what is the stopper 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.299
 cited but in the end I found between 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.310
 curiosities of my husband a painting in 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:44.879
 spray I think feet like golden color but 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.980
 in matt ilex stopper and went out to paint and 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.079

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.580

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.440

 and this is the little triplet boat says 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.670
 which is a brilliant gloss and I have 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.180
 used for a jewelry that you make 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.750
 but here I have it and I need to finish it 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.150
 something and then it will serve me but 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.050
 you can also use a varnish 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.050
 sparkly 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.610
 If you have the oil, well, better 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.889

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.340
 I wait for it to dry and then applied 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.560
 in the other side 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.560
