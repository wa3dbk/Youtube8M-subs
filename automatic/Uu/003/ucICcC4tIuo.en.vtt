Champion<00:01:11.610> anyways<00:01:11.970> let's<00:01:12.270> say<00:01:12.390> when<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> give

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
Champion anyways let's say when I give

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.429 
Champion anyways let's say when I give
that<00:01:13.439> ton<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.799> someone<00:01:14.159> else<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.350> it's<00:01:16.350> not

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that ton of someone else but it's not

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
that ton of someone else but it's not
predictable<00:01:16.979> seeing<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
predictable seeing that one thing is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.230 
predictable seeing that one thing is
it's<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.420> once<00:01:18.659> Daniel<00:01:18.869> Bryan<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.770> know

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
it's like once Daniel Bryan you know

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
it's like once Daniel Bryan you know
that<00:01:21.240> eliminated<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.720> fans<00:01:22.350> probably<00:01:22.619> knew

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that eliminated the fans probably knew

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.960 
that eliminated the fans probably knew
what<00:01:23.189> was<00:01:23.250> gonna<00:01:23.400> happen<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:25.640> see<00:01:26.640> after<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
what was gonna happen and see after the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
what was gonna happen and see after the
title<00:01:27.210> match<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.799> mean<00:01:28.920> safe

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
title match it was kind of I mean safe

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
title match it was kind of I mean safe
Johnson<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> did<00:01:30.060> win<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
Johnson it did win you know the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990 
Johnson it did win you know the
championship<00:01:32.430> maybe<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:32.880> been<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
championship maybe it would have been a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.789 
championship maybe it would have been a
little<00:01:33.150> different<00:01:33.420> maybe<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.680> have

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
little different maybe they would have

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.910 
little different maybe they would have
thought<00:01:35.340> Daniel<00:01:35.759> Bryan<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.180> Roman<00:01:36.540> rantin

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
thought Daniel Bryan or Roman rantin

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.260 
thought Daniel Bryan or Roman rantin
well<00:01:37.920> well<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> mean<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.610> need<00:01:38.759> Roman<00:01:39.119> reigns

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
well well I mean they need Roman reigns

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
is going to win but maybe they would

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.510 
is going to win but maybe they would
have<00:01:40.500> thought<00:01:40.560> Daniel<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.189> gonna<00:01:41.340> win

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
have thought Daniel I was gonna win

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
have thought Daniel I was gonna win
Johnson<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> woman<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
Johnson a woman but but because of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.609 
Johnson a woman but but because of the
outcome<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.520> title<00:01:44.970> match<00:01:45.439> was<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
outcome of that title match was kind of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230

money in the bank is like six months I
think<00:03:31.470> five<00:03:32.130> six<00:03:32.400> months<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.000> next

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
think five six months so in the next

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.330 
think five six months so in the next
five<00:03:33.420> months<00:03:33.800> Seth<00:03:34.800> Rollins<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.160> going<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
five months Seth Rollins is going to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.310 
five months Seth Rollins is going to
become<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> champion<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.390> Roman<00:03:36.810> whoever<00:03:37.020> wins

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
become a champion so Roman whoever wins

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.900 
become a champion so Roman whoever wins
the<00:03:37.470> title<00:03:37.620> at<00:03:37.800> WrestleMania<00:03:38.340> 31<00:03:39.140> even<00:03:40.140> you

Lesnar<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:44.040> know<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.420> guess<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.630> maybe<00:03:46.290> he'll

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
Lesnar you know I guess that maybe he'll

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.259 
Lesnar you know I guess that maybe he'll
be<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.739> maybe<00:03:46.980> it'll<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.190> Seth<00:03:47.459> Rollins<00:03:47.670> vs

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
be so maybe it'll be Seth Rollins vs

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.940 
be so maybe it'll be Seth Rollins vs
