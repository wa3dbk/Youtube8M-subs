00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
off the card with a ribbon cable and I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.580 
off the card with a ribbon cable and I
have<00:00:46.260> chosen<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.920> enclose<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.590> pixel

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
have chosen to enclose it in pixel

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
have chosen to enclose it in pixel
blocks<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.370> these<00:00:50.520> pixel<00:00:50.940> blocks<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
blocks I have these pixel blocks for a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.770 
blocks I have these pixel blocks for a
couple<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.949> little<00:00:52.949> circuit<00:00:53.699> board<00:00:53.780> projects

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
couple of little circuit board projects

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.310 
couple of little circuit board projects
but<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:55.920> integrated<00:00:56.250> let's<00:00:56.399> take<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> look<00:00:56.850> so

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
but an integrated let's take a look so

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
but an integrated let's take a look so
basically<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> boot<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.770> Apple<00:00:59.690> this<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
basically you boot up your Apple this is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
basically you boot up your Apple this is
kind<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> crude<00:01:01.440> video<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.070> gonna

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
kind of a crude video I'm just gonna

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.420 
kind of a crude video I'm just gonna
hold<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> camera<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.420> while<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> we

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
hold the camera here while I do it so we

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.289 
hold the camera here while I do it so we
boot<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.049> press<00:01:07.229> em<00:01:07.700> press<00:01:08.700> em<00:01:08.909> soon

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
boot and then we press em press em soon

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.440 
boot and then we press em press em soon
after<00:01:09.720> booting<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.619> menu

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
after booting and you get this menu

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.600 
after booting and you get this menu
basically<00:01:12.619> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.799> set<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.220> few<00:01:14.340> different

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
basically you can set up a few different

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.850 
basically you can set up a few different
options<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:15.210> using<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> only<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> SD

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
options I'm using it only for the SD

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.120 
options I'm using it only for the SD
card<00:01:17.390> rather<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> disk<00:01:19.439> image<00:01:19.590> emulation

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
card rather for the disk image emulation

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
card rather for the disk image emulation
so<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.150> floppy<00:01:21.450> so

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so that I don't have to use floppy so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
so that I don't have to use floppy so
got<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.560> couple<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.100> disks<00:01:23.310> two<00:01:23.430> drives

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
got a couple of disks two drives

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.120 
got a couple of disks two drives
actually<00:01:24.479> also<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.409> disk<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
actually also have a do disk here as a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
actually also have a do disk here as a
monitor<00:01:26.549> stand<00:01:26.820> these<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.330> actually

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
monitor stand these are not actually

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.859 
monitor stand these are not actually
hooked<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:29.070> anyway<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.270> floppies<00:01:30.659> are

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
hooked up but anyway the floppies are

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
hooked up but anyway the floppies are
are<00:01:31.409> getting<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.009> bit<00:01:32.159> old<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.520> hard<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
are getting a little bit old and hard to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.719 
are getting a little bit old and hard to
deal<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.180> hard<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> source<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.310> just

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
deal with hard to source so I just

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.999 
deal with hard to source so I just
wanted<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> use<00:01:36.090> disk<00:01:36.299> images<00:01:36.740> instead<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
wanted to use disk images instead of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.310 
wanted to use disk images instead of
floppies<00:01:38.520> let<00:01:38.909> me<00:01:39.000> click<00:01:39.210> disk<00:01:39.450> fragments<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
floppies let me click disk fragments and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.969 
floppies let me click disk fragments and
it<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.250> show<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.079> disk<00:01:43.079> images<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.860> on

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it will show you disk images that are on

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
it will show you disk images that are on
the<00:01:44.070> SD<00:01:44.340> card<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.600> run<00:01:45.869> through<00:01:46.049> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the SD card and you can run through you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.340 
the SD card and you can run through you
can<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.369> some<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> images

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
can see there are some of the images

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.870 
can see there are some of the images
let's<00:01:49.350> pick<00:01:49.560> our<00:01:49.770> heart<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.610> pretty

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
let's pick our heart because it's pretty

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.050 
let's pick our heart because it's pretty
so<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.659> click<00:01:52.049> hit<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> 1<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:53.310> 2<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.850> indicate
