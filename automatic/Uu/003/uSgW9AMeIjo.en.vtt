00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
should see four wires exposed now we

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.830 
should see four wires exposed now we
only<00:00:39.120> need<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> these<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.440> red<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.040> black

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
only need two of these the red and black

to<00:01:15.150> use<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> processor<00:01:16.110> now<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.619> case<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.130> had

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to use a processor now in my case I had

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
to use a processor now in my case I had
a<00:01:17.520> broken<00:01:17.909> laptop<00:01:18.119> had<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> processor<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> so

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
a broken laptop had a processor in it so

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
a broken laptop had a processor in it so
I<00:01:20.070> figured<00:01:20.400> hey<00:01:20.580> pink<00:01:21.150> green<00:01:21.390> let's<00:01:21.900> make<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
I figured hey pink green let's make a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
I figured hey pink green let's make a
device<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.890> after<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> had<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> cable

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
device out of it after I had the cable

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850 
device out of it after I had the cable
run<00:01:24.299> through<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> base<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.960> went<00:01:25.560> ahead<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
run through the base I went ahead and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.910 
run through the base I went ahead and
added<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.250> metal<00:01:26.759> lid<00:01:27.150> now<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> seat

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
added a metal lid now I'm going to seat

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 
added a metal lid now I'm going to seat
the<00:01:29.189> processor<00:01:29.850> into<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.240> using<00:01:31.079> some<00:01:31.259> glue

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the processor into this using some glue

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.859 
the processor into this using some glue
now<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.250> using<00:01:32.549> glue<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.329> capable<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
now I'm using glue that is capable of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
now I'm using glue that is capable of
reaching<00:01:34.049> temperatures<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.729> 450<00:01:35.729> degrees

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
reaching temperatures of 450 degrees

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
reaching temperatures of 450 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.079> there's<00:01:37.259> no<00:01:37.470> worry<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
Fahrenheit so there's no worry that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
Fahrenheit so there's no worry that
it'll<00:01:38.220> melt<00:01:38.430> our<00:01:38.670> aim<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it'll melt our aim here is to have the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.440 
it'll melt our aim here is to have the
processor<00:01:40.890> dissipate<00:01:41.400> its<00:01:41.549> heat<00:01:41.790> through

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
processor dissipate its heat through

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.749 
processor dissipate its heat through
this<00:01:42.630> top<00:01:42.960> portion<00:01:43.259> we'll<00:01:43.950> call<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.579> hot

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
this top portion we'll call this the hot

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
this top portion we'll call this the hot
plate<00:01:45.119> after<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> went<00:01:46.229> ahead<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.740> sealed

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
plate after that I went ahead and sealed

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.859 
plate after that I went ahead and sealed
the<00:01:47.280> hot<00:01:47.460> plate<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> base<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.720> well
