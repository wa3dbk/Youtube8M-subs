fun and kind of like you learned a bunch
of<00:03:31.740> stuff<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.460> had<00:03:32.790> one<00:03:33.060> opener<00:03:33.450> networked

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
of stuff like I had one opener networked

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.380 
of stuff like I had one opener networked
perfectly<00:03:34.470> all<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.740> time<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.390> basically

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
perfectly all the time and basically

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.300 
perfectly all the time and basically
every<00:03:36.630> time<00:03:36.660> something<00:03:37.170> beat<00:03:37.380> me<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.770> adjusted

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
every time something beat me I adjusted

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.040 
every time something beat me I adjusted
the<00:03:38.430> opener<00:03:38.850> or<00:03:39.030> different<00:03:39.390> ways<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:39.960> can

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
the opener or different ways that it can

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750 
the opener or different ways that it can
turn<00:03:40.290> into<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.160> like<00:03:41.250> got<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.730> a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
turn into you and it's like got to a

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.160 
turn into you and it's like got to a
point<00:03:42.090> where<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:42.360> knew<00:03:42.600> every<00:03:42.990> single

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
point where I knew every single

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.470 
point where I knew every single
combination<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:44.250> can<00:03:44.580> be<00:03:44.730> used<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.300> move

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
combination that can be used in the move

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.260 
combination that can be used in the move
to<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:46.290> kind<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.590> counter<00:03:47.040> every<00:03:47.520> everything

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
to to kind of counter every everything

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.810 
to to kind of counter every everything
my<00:03:48.570> opponent<00:03:49.050> could<00:03:49.140> possibly<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.160> was

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
my opponent could possibly do and it was

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.699 
my opponent could possibly do and it was
really<00:03:50.970> fun<00:03:51.270> sometimes<00:03:51.720> I'm<00:03:51.959> going<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.530> watch

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
really fun sometimes I'm going to watch

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.350 
really fun sometimes I'm going to watch
people<00:03:53.040> he<00:03:53.280> kept<00:03:53.550> himself<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.270> was

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
people he kept himself like that it was

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.590 
people he kept himself like that it was
great<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.840> remember<00:03:55.650> things<00:03:55.890> like<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.600> would

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
great I remember things like this would

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.650 
great I remember things like this would
yeah<00:03:57.900> there<00:03:58.500> feels<00:03:59.070> like<00:03:59.250> lots<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.790> room<00:04:00.630> for

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
yeah there feels like lots of room for

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.540 
yeah there feels like lots of room for
practice<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.590> Mike<00:04:01.770> brought<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.190> know<00:04:02.280> stuff

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
and win it when I eventually moved on to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.699 
and win it when I eventually moved on to
Aikido<00:04:05.750> basically<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:06.780> had<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.080> open<00:04:07.260> her<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.650> I

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
like on a losing streak I start changing

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.200 
like on a losing streak I start changing
my<00:04:21.170> openers<00:04:21.500> like<00:04:21.650> waiting<00:04:22.340> tilt<00:04:22.550> tilt<00:04:22.970> one

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
my openers like waiting tilt tilt one

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.900 
my openers like waiting tilt tilt one
that<00:04:23.420> actually<00:04:23.600> works<00:04:24.080> pretty<00:04:24.260> good<00:04:25.010> yes

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
that actually works pretty good yes

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.940 
that actually works pretty good yes
generally<00:04:26.630> I<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:26.780> stuck<00:04:27.170> with<00:04:27.200> one<00:04:27.500> opener

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
generally I just stuck with one opener

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.370 
generally I just stuck with one opener
and<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.940> they<00:04:29.030> just<00:04:29.060> work<00:04:29.420> on<00:04:29.660> everything

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
and and and they just work on everything

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.170 
and and and they just work on everything
that<00:04:30.560> happens<00:04:31.070> after<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.580> opener<00:04:32.030> because

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
that happens after that opener because

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.360 
that happens after that opener because
then<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.750> can<00:04:32.930> start<00:04:33.290> predicting<00:04:33.620> okay

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
then you can start predicting okay

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.640 
then you can start predicting okay
you're<00:04:34.520> polish<00:04:34.820> doing<00:04:35.120> this<00:04:35.300> usually<00:04:36.230> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
you're polish doing this usually the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.410 
you're polish doing this usually the
last<00:04:36.920> ten<00:04:37.310> fights<00:04:37.640> where<00:04:37.910> someone<00:04:38.240> did<00:04:38.390> that

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
last ten fights where someone did that

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.230 
last ten fights where someone did that
that<00:04:39.230> happened<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:40.100> I'm<00:04:40.430> gonna<00:04:40.610> try<00:04:40.850> counter

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
that happened so I'm gonna try counter

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.570 
that happened so I'm gonna try counter
that<00:04:41.390> by<00:04:41.720> doing<00:04:41.900> this<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:43.130> learn<00:04:43.370> how

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
that by doing this and and you learn how

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.430 
that by doing this and and you learn how
to<00:04:43.610> counter<00:04:44.060> your<00:04:44.150> opponents<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.720> do<00:04:44.840> then<00:04:45.320> do

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
to counter your opponents and do then do

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.060 
to counter your opponents and do then do
stuff<00:04:45.650> like<00:04:45.710> that

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
stuff like that

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.760 
stuff like that
so<00:04:46.310> making<00:04:46.580> actual<00:04:47.120> random<00:04:47.600> moves<00:04:47.810> can<00:04:48.290> be<00:04:48.320> bad

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
so making actual random moves can be bad

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.040 
so making actual random moves can be bad
sometimes<00:04:49.190> unless<00:04:49.910> you're<00:04:50.390> just<00:04:50.870> like

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
sometimes unless you're just like

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.410 
sometimes unless you're just like
playing<00:04:51.320> around<00:04:51.620> for<00:04:51.980> like<00:04:52.130> really<00:04:52.640> fun<00:04:53.060> sake

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
playing around for like really fun sake

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.660 
playing around for like really fun sake
if<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:53.750> want<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:53.990> learn<00:04:54.140> just<00:04:54.440> make<00:04:55.040> it<00:04:55.220> opener

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
if you want to learn just make it opener

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.550 
if you want to learn just make it opener
and<00:04:55.820> just<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.540> know<00:04:56.570> just<00:04:56.900> stick<00:04:57.170> with<00:04:57.380> it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
and just you know just stick with it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.220 
and just you know just stick with it
toll<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:59.090> like<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.450> don't<00:04:59.510> know<00:04:59.660> black<00:04:59.960> belt

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230
