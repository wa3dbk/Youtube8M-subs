00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
create a method that i'm going to call

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750 
create a method that i'm going to call
that's<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> initialize<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.609> my

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
crafting recipes like that um you don't

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
crafting recipes like that um you don't
have<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.050> could<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.350> put<00:00:52.590> all

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
have to do this you could just put all

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
have to do this you could just put all
of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> code<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> goes<00:00:53.969> inside<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.539> method

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
of the code that goes inside this method

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.450 
of the code that goes inside this method
inside<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.500> load<00:00:55.680> method<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.280> would

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
inside your load method and it would

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.590 
inside your load method and it would
work<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.699> fine<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:59.030> because<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
work just fine I like to because I like

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920 
work just fine I like to because I like
to<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.260> organized<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.969> easily<00:01:03.480> able<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to be organized and to be easily able to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.880 
to be organized and to be easily able to
find<00:01:04.110> stuff<00:01:04.320> um<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:07.049> let's<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.590> add

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
find stuff um but now let's actually add

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
find stuff um but now let's actually add
the<00:01:08.070> code<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> creates<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.060> crafting<00:01:09.420> recipe

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the code that creates a crafting recipe

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.280 
the code that creates a crafting recipe
and<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.220> game<00:01:12.290> registry

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and the way you do this is game registry

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.480 
and the way you do this is game registry
dot<00:01:14.070> add<00:01:15.170> recipe<00:01:17.090> new<00:01:18.140> itemstack<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.770> then

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
dot add recipe new itemstack and then

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
dot add recipe new itemstack and then
here<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.939> want<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.869> item<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.950> block

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
here you want to put the item or block

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.800 
here you want to put the item or block
that<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> creating<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.689> in

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that you're going to be creating so in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
that you're going to be creating so in
this<00:01:24.960> case<00:01:25.170> it'll<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.770> block<00:01:27.110> dot<00:01:28.110> diamond<00:01:29.070> dot

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
this case it'll be block dot diamond dot

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.999 
this case it'll be block dot diamond dot
block<00:01:30.409> diamond<00:01:31.409> um<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> could<00:01:34.500> put<00:01:34.680> item

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
block diamond um but you could put item

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
block diamond um but you could put item
got<00:01:35.250> anything<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:36.060> anything<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.750> you've

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
got anything or anything that you've

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.310 
got anything or anything that you've
declared<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.659> um<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:43.079> can

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
declared in here um so then if I can

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.039 
declared in here um so then if I can
select<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.220> correctly<00:01:44.640> after<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.840> just

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
select this correctly after that we just

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.210 
select this correctly after that we just
say<00:01:46.170> comma<00:01:46.470> new<00:01:47.240> object<00:01:48.290> brackets<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> then

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
say comma new object brackets and then

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.179 
say comma new object brackets and then
curly<00:01:51.030> parenthesis<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:52.799> those

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
curly parenthesis if you know what those

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
curly parenthesis if you know what those
are<00:01:53.220> called<00:01:53.399> please<00:01:54.240> let<00:01:54.570> me<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.840> the

just going to send these down online and
we're<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> add<00:02:01.560> some<00:02:01.590> code<00:02:02.100> inside<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
we're going to add some code inside of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
we're going to add some code inside of
this<00:02:04.009> now<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.430> way<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.700> actually<00:02:06.119> set<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
this now the way we actually set up a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100 
this now the way we actually set up a
recipe<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.890> we're<00:02:08.879> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> add<00:02:09.330> three

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
recipe is we're going to add three

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.790 
recipe is we're going to add three
little<00:02:12.110> strings

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
little strings

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
little strings
and<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.340> are<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.850> represent<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and these are going to represent the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.130 
and these are going to represent the
three<00:02:15.840> rows<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:17.010> crafting<00:02:17.370> table<00:02:18.140> now

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
three rows of the crafting table now

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.540 
three rows of the crafting table now
inside<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> string<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.790> are<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.960> can<00:02:22.290> put

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
inside the string there are we can put

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.290 
inside the string there are we can put
say<00:02:23.550> if<00:02:23.730> i<00:02:23.850> put<00:02:24.090> t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t<00:02:27.740> tea<00:02:28.740> and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
say if i put t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t tea and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
say if i put t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t tea and
tea<00:02:30.300> tea<00:02:30.480> tea<00:02:31.370> then<00:02:32.390> these<00:02:33.390> represent<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
tea tea tea then these represent the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.430 
tea tea tea then these represent the
three<00:02:35.280> columns<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.270> we<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.690> three<00:02:37.020> rows<00:02:37.230> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
three columns so we have three rows and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.180 
three columns so we have three rows and
three<00:02:37.680> columns<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:40.230> how<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.590> were

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
three columns and that's how you were

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.860 
three columns and that's how you were
you<00:02:42.000> would<00:02:42.180> declare<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.570> recipe<00:02:44.360> but<00:02:45.360> we've

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you would declare a recipe but we've

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.380 
you would declare a recipe but we've
declared<00:02:46.230> our<00:02:46.500> recipe<00:02:46.920> but<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.700> haven't<00:02:47.970> told

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
declared our recipe but we haven't told

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.710 
declared our recipe but we haven't told
minecraft<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.290> each<00:02:50.300> character<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.540> this

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
minecraft what each character in this

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.470 
minecraft what each character in this
recipe<00:02:52.140> represents<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.030> need<00:02:54.450> to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
recipe represents so now we need to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.680 
recipe represents so now we need to
underneath<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.290> line<00:02:55.560> create<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.690> character

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
underneath this line create a character

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
ingot and then you had a comma after

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.780 
ingot and then you had a comma after
that<00:03:14.870> now<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:16.080> we<00:03:16.230> wanted<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.830> say<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:18.560> our

you only need to say have one row that
has<00:03:49.160> cold<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.930> tutorial<00:03:51.930> ingots<00:03:52.350> then<00:03:53.300> you

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
has cold and tutorial ingots then you

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.449 
has cold and tutorial ingots then you
can<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.770> no<00:03:56.310> matter

what row we put it in it'll um create a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.380 
what row we put it in it'll um create a
diamond<00:04:01.770> block<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.640> I'm<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:02.910> going<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.180> run

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
diamond block so I'm just going to run

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.000 
diamond block so I'm just going to run
this<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.750> show<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.380> actually<00:04:04.530> works

like this no matter where i put the row
so<00:04:23.669> long<00:04:23.850> as<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.419> row<00:04:24.660> it'll<00:04:25.440> give<00:04:25.590> us<00:04:25.620> a

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
so long as it is a row it'll give us a

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.940 
so long as it is a row it'll give us a
diamond<00:04:26.310> block

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
diamond block

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.030 
diamond block
so<00:04:27.700> that's<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.120> for<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.480> tutorial<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:29.620> the
