00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
what the product is all about and then

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.669 
what the product is all about and then
from<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.000> make<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> decision<00:00:31.320> whether<00:00:31.560> you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
from that make a decision whether you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.889 
from that make a decision whether you
want<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> buy<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> box<00:00:33.540> does

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
want to buy it or not now this box does

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.620 
want to buy it or not now this box does
not<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.350> any<00:00:34.620> security<00:00:35.370> seals<00:00:35.820> which<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
not have any security seals which is a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
not have any security seals which is a
little<00:00:37.079> odd<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.500> most<00:00:37.980> products<00:00:38.489> these

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
little odd because most products these

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.670 
little odd because most products these
days<00:00:38.940> come<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.660> some<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.410> security

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
days come with some kind of security

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.000 
days come with some kind of security
seal<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.410> has<00:00:43.680> not

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
seal on it so you know that it has not

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.580 
seal on it so you know that it has not
been<00:00:44.070> opened<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:45.180> box<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:45.809> includes<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
been opened this box also includes a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.889 
been opened this box also includes a
very<00:00:46.829> convenient<00:00:47.370> handle<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.420> let's<00:00:48.570> open

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
very convenient handle now let's open

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.950 
very convenient handle now let's open
the<00:00:48.989> box<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.500> what's<00:00:49.890> inside<00:00:56.960> user's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the box and see what's inside user's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
the box and see what's inside user's
manual<00:00:58.410> and<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:01.350> looks<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> more

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
manual and this looks like a more

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.170 
manual and this looks like a more
detailed<00:01:03.210> user's<00:01:04.140> manual<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.909> what

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
detailed user's manual to just see what

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.830 
detailed user's manual to just see what
this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:06.659> about<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:08.180> think<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.390> more

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
about specs than really a manual and I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.359 
about specs than really a manual and I
believe<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.700> yes<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.659> actual<00:01:22.369> users

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and these are the modular leads now

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.360 
and these are the modular leads now
remember<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.570> one<00:02:12.930> hundred<00:02:13.260> percent

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
remember this is a one hundred percent

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
remember this is a one hundred percent
modular<00:02:14.370> power<00:02:14.640> supply<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.420> every<00:02:15.930> single

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
modular power supply so every single

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
modular power supply so every single
lead<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.130> modular<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> power<00:02:18.630> supply

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
lead is modular but the power supply

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.250 
lead is modular but the power supply
comes<00:02:19.470> shipped<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.570> these<00:02:21.780> leads

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
