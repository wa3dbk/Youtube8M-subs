00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.799
 since in the youtube friends 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.539
 welcome to this new video I am 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.759
 lisney brick and good in this video les 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.789
 I bring you how to turn your pc into a router 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:22.699
 we need a pc with wifi either 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.300
 laptop or described oriented you have web 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.099
 country also and ok what does this mean them 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.550
 I'm going to put an example you have 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.110
 a computer that has a lot of power 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.329
 of wifi signal then it reaches you 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.300
 the whole signal does not but we have a cell phone 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.730
 to which the signal only reaches him so 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.890
 minus a hairline or in our console 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.079
 videogames what he does is when when 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.359
 We turn our PC into a router in 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.010
 this case receives for example all the 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.460
 signal lines and what it does is 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.230
 place to stay the internet and use it 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.749
 receives the internet with a strong signal 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.979
 and that internet shares it then if 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.300
 your cell phone is next to you 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.790
 computer is going to have all the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.699
 east signal 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.550
 and well just like that, a router 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.320
 who shares the wifi signal and more 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.160
 powerful for example before I could not play 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.630
 on the internet with my console but with this 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.520
 because the signal did not arrive but when 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.860
 I made a router on my pc because the signal 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.810
 it came and it really works is and they 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.280
 I highly recommend it because it served me ok 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.660
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.640
 download this file that reached them 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.380
 the description of the video are going to this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.180
 link and then they put you here is to say 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.729
 Do you already know I got it? 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.830
 virus nothing heavy 3.81 megabytes no 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.210
 is nothing and they are going to download a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.009
 file an error like this one of insurance already 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.300
 most know it and if you do not know it 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.250
 in the destruction of life sees you a video 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.810
 how to install very rare then 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.570
 when the writer file like this 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.300
 we are going to click right and we give in 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.630
 where it says extract here then it's going to 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.640
 stay of these two files 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.180
 this is the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.540
 the program because we are going to open it now 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.840
 You know, we're going to 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.860
 execute and everything and once you already 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.690
 have installed they put it is once 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.009
 benny for cereals once you have 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.720
 installed the program what they have to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.010
 do is restart the pc in this case I 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.830
 I already have it installed and organize it 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.790
 because otherwise I will not be able to record ok 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.800
 when I roy once they have 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.560
 installed when you restart your computer 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.480
 the program will appear here or if 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.830
 you do not start it but normally 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.900
 it appears here in the start bar 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.700
 that since there is in using the program and 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.050
 everything restarts the pc because if not, 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.530
 the options are going to come out so they can 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.300
 share well is ok then once 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.610
 that the salad is restarted and everything already 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.230
 correctly let's open it and it's going to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.820
 believe in a window like this if you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.760
 ask update do not give him where he says the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.430
 you bend it where it says ignore ok 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.080
 so now here he goes where he says 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.620
 hotspots name goes the name of our 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.940
 network in this case I'm going to put you 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.940
 and here in this password 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.060
 in off 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.810
 here we go to passwords for internet and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.660
 our network now the most important thing here 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.240
 is where they say internet yesterday we give where 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.610
 says wifi to share the wifi ok 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.040
 now if you have this little arrow 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.660
 so where adbusters says in tings the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.140
 go down like this 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.540
 then here where is it if we select 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.220
 where uy faltista says if you are 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.680
 connected through gualeguay are 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.340
 connected in internet cable but 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.470
 they have WIFI 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.330
 you have to select this but if not 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.110
 leave it without wifi 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.110
 mod 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.249
 I recommend that you put the 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:40.340
 web encryption because it is the one that 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:42.319
 computers support but really 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.200
 which is much better is what the 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.969
 first one that says in type 2 grip the 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.670
 we select because it is very difficult to 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.870
 get our password 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.990
 we select these two popcorn and 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.080
 we give here where it says to be host 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.330
 ok and we are waiting for him to load all this 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.430
 here this circuit that was recharging 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.180
 the internet is creating a new challenge 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.180
 leaving huelva 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.549
 and ready as 26 encourage diff and here they 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.780
 appears where it says with the best text 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.479
 spot this the devices that are 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.040
 connected to our internet that is 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.419
 what are we just creating in 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.360
 this case I have to connected to my 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.889
 cellular and then I have all the signal to 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.479
 then I'm going to pass a video of 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.479
 how it really works 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.620
 well, let's see 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.780
 ok friends as you see here is connected 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.610
 my cell phone and it has all the signal that 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.490
 is connected through the wifi is 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.230
 connected to the network that we just created 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.600
 that is called raptan that as it says 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.190
 connected and then I have all the signal 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.890
 as a window 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.220
 already strength here is my cell appears 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.570
 connected and good seriously works 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.920
 I hope you have served them 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.110
 liked it would help me a lot if I 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.450
 They give share to be really like them 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.970
 liked and then subscribe if you want more 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.270
 videos like these a greeting and luck we 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.270
 we see
