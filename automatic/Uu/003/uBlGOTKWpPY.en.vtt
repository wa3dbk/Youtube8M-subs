00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
down and going in so a little bit bummed

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.340 
down and going in so a little bit bummed
that<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.180> didn't<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.750> Frankie<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.200> in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that we didn't get to have Frankie go in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.200 
that we didn't get to have Frankie go in
but<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> guess<00:00:46.739> there's<00:00:46.950> also<00:00:47.129> other<00:00:47.460> plans

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.060 
but I guess there's also other plans
that<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.469> achieve<00:00:49.829> on

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that they have to you know achieve on

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.410

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
bit more these characters that was

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.970 
bit more these characters that was

if<00:04:48.990> Frankie<00:04:49.440> would<00:04:49.590> have<00:04:49.680> been<00:04:49.770> in<00:04:49.890> there<00:04:50.010> but

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
if Frankie would have been in there but

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.410 
if Frankie would have been in there but
I<00:04:50.220> guess<00:04:50.400> at<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.820> other<00:04:50.970> day<00:04:51.090> frankie

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
I guess at the other day frankie

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.640 
I guess at the other day frankie
wouldn't<00:04:51.540> want<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.870> have<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.110> fight<00:04:52.200> mufi

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.380 
wouldn't want to have to fight mufi
anyway<00:04:53.070> cuz<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.550> know<00:04:53.640> at<00:04:53.730> some<00:04:53.880> given<00:04:54.030> point

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
anyway cuz you know at some given point

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.910 
anyway cuz you know at some given point
they<00:04:54.480> probably<00:04:54.720> would<00:04:54.960> have<00:04:55.110> two<00:04:55.260> fought<00:04:55.560> for

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
they probably would have two fought for

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.680 
they probably would have two fought for
the<00:04:55.980> final<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.490> maybe<00:04:56.670> that's<00:04:56.880> why<00:04:57.090> Frankie

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
the final so maybe that's why Frankie

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.210 
the final so maybe that's why Frankie
didn't<00:04:57.960> want<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.200> get<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.650> another<00:04:59.010> good
