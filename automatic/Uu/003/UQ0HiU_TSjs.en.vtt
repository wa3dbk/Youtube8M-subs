we're here with banks power I'm standing

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.880 
we're here with banks power I'm standing
next<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.779> Gale<00:00:18.990> banks<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.560> some<00:00:19.740> big

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
next to Gale banks and we have some big

news today they are expanding their
lineup<00:00:22.769> into<00:00:23.100> full<00:00:23.369> powertrain<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.480> very

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
lineup into full powertrain it's very

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.779 
lineup into full powertrain it's very
cool<00:00:25.019> tell<00:00:25.439> me<00:00:25.529> more<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.920> yeah<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> lot<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
cool tell me more about it yeah a lot of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.179 
cool tell me more about it yeah a lot of
people<00:00:27.029> don't<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:29.810> since<00:00:30.890> 1976<00:00:31.890> we've

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
people don't know that since 1976 we've

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.100 
people don't know that since 1976 we've
been<00:00:32.340> supplying<00:00:32.850> engines<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> military

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
been supplying engines to the military

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.049 
been supplying engines to the military
both<00:00:34.350> marine<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.399> land<00:00:36.290> but<00:00:37.290> never<00:00:37.590> any

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
both marine and on land but never any

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.069 
both marine and on land but never any
transmissions<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:40.230> we've<00:00:41.070> decided<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
transmissions so we've decided to

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.650 
transmissions so we've decided to
properly<00:00:43.079> match<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.390> push-push<00:00:45.420> our

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
properly match and push-push our

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.690 
properly match and push-push our
technology<00:00:46.440> into<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> future<00:00:47.129> we're
