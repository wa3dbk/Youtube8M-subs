first<00:01:46.070> of<00:01:46.220> all<00:01:46.370> it's<00:01:46.520> easier<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.150> fit<00:01:47.330> your

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
first of all it's easier to fit your

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.140 
first of all it's easier to fit your
fingers<00:01:47.900> on<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.530> strings<00:01:48.860> because<00:01:49.220> there's

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
fingers on the strings because there's

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.180 
fingers on the strings because there's
more<00:01:50.330> room<00:01:50.500> when<00:01:51.500> you're<00:01:51.650> doing<00:01:51.830> every<00:01:52.070> other

more room when you're doing every other
string<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.730> then<00:01:52.850> slipping<00:01:53.660> in<00:01:53.750> from<00:01:53.990> behind

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
string and then slipping in from behind

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.040 
string and then slipping in from behind
with<00:01:54.560> your<00:01:54.680> first<00:01:54.920> finger<00:01:55.630> can<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.720> see<00:01:56.900> what

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
with your first finger can you see what

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.010 
with your first finger can you see what
I'm<00:01:57.170> doing<00:01:57.440> I've<00:01:57.560> got<00:01:58.040> my<00:01:58.190> ring<00:01:58.850> finger<00:01:59.300> on<00:01:59.479> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
I'm doing I've got my ring finger on the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.200 
I'm doing I've got my ring finger on the
second<00:02:00.410> string<00:02:00.440> 2nd<00:02:01.040> fret<00:02:01.070> I've<00:02:01.790> got<00:02:02.060> my

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
second string 2nd fret I've got my

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.570 
second string 2nd fret I've got my
middle<00:02:02.450> finger<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.020> 4th<00:02:03.530> string<00:02:03.890> 2nd<00:02:04.550> fret

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
middle finger on the 4th string 2nd fret

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.060 
middle finger on the 4th string 2nd fret
and<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.479> by<00:02:05.810> itself<00:02:06.110> would<00:02:06.290> be<00:02:06.440> an<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.650> 7th

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
and that by itself would be an a 7th

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.449 
and that by itself would be an a 7th
chord<00:02:07.660> sounds<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:09.010> then<00:02:10.010> my<00:02:10.220> first

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
chord sounds like that then my first

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.699 
chord sounds like that then my first
finger<00:02:10.760> comes<00:02:11.150> behind<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.959> holds<00:02:12.500> down<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
finger comes behind and holds down the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.199 
finger comes behind and holds down the
3rd<00:02:13.310> string<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.270> 2nd<00:02:14.600> fret<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.940> big

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
3rd string on the 2nd fret and the big

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.420 
3rd string on the 2nd fret and the big
advantage<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.750> why<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.230> works<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:18.950> well<00:02:19.070> is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
advantage to why this works so well is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.490 
advantage to why this works so well is
if<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.880> want<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.240> change<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.840> D<00:02:21.110> chord

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
if I want to change to a D chord

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.650 
if I want to change to a D chord
I<00:02:21.620> leave<00:02:22.250> my<00:02:22.490> first<00:02:22.790> finger<00:02:22.970> where<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.480> and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I leave my first finger where it is and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.280 
I leave my first finger where it is and
I<00:02:23.720> only<00:02:23.930> move<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.470> other<00:02:24.560> fingers<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:27.080> my

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
I only move the other fingers and so my

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.000 
I only move the other fingers and so my
first<00:02:27.620> finger<00:02:27.890> gives<00:02:28.250> me<00:02:28.430> like<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.330> pivot<00:02:29.810> point

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
first finger gives me like a pivot point

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.949 
first finger gives me like a pivot point
it's<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.220> way<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.400> know<00:02:31.940> where<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.360> am<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:32.870> I

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
it's a way to know where I am and so I

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.170 
it's a way to know where I am and so I
can<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:34.040> switch<00:02:34.340> back<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.610> forth<00:02:34.790> really

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
can I can switch back and forth really

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.100 
can I can switch back and forth really
fast<00:02:35.300> now<00:02:36.459> because<00:02:37.459> I'm<00:02:37.580> still<00:02:37.910> holding<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:38.959> to

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
fast now because I'm still holding on to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.920 
fast now because I'm still holding on to
the<00:02:39.320> neck<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.680> whole<00:02:39.830> time<00:02:40.600> when<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.720> go<00:02:41.870> to

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
the neck the whole time when we go to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.770 
the neck the whole time when we go to
the<00:02:42.110> e<00:02:42.350> chord<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.940> only<00:02:44.239> time<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.750> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
the e chord I the only time I have to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.780 
the e chord I the only time I have to
move<00:02:45.019> my<00:02:45.080> first<00:02:45.410> finger<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.860> slide<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.580> one

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
move my first finger is to slide it one

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.060 
move my first finger is to slide it one
fret<00:02:47.120> back<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:47.989> it's<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.530> pivot<00:02:48.860> point

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
fret back and then it's the pivot point

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.470 
fret back and then it's the pivot point
for<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.340> important<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:52.150> all<00:02:53.150> those

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
for the important so that all those

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.360 
for the important so that all those
changes<00:02:53.959> are<00:02:54.080> really<00:02:54.230> easy<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.680> make<00:02:54.800> them

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.260 

I'm<00:03:01.790> gonna<00:03:01.910> try<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.380> at<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.880> then<00:03:04.880> when<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.150> go

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
I'm gonna try that at a then when you go

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.360 
I'm gonna try that at a then when you go

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
courtroom I almost can't do it because

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.940
