00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.279 
see now the problem with higher level
items<00:00:45.700> is<00:00:46.090> that<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.480> amount<00:00:46.719> of<00:00:46.840> coins<00:00:47.110> that

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
items is that the amount of coins that

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.630 
items is that the amount of coins that
you're<00:00:47.559> going<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.770> need<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:47.950> upgrade<00:00:48.250> is

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640

you're going to need to upgrade is
exorbitantly<00:00:49.390> high<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:50.170> make<00:00:50.379> sure<00:00:50.410> you<00:00:50.620> have

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
exorbitantly high so make sure you have

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.650 
exorbitantly high so make sure you have
enough<00:00:50.949> coins<00:00:51.219> before<00:00:51.430> doing<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.239> all

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
enough coins before doing this and all

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.080 
enough coins before doing this and all
have<00:00:53.050> enough<00:00:53.620> hammers<00:00:54.129> at<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.820> end<00:00:54.940> you're

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
have enough hammers at the end you're

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.760 
have enough hammers at the end you're
gonna<00:00:55.149> need<00:00:55.359> to<00:00:55.570> use<00:00:55.719> diamond<00:00:56.050> hammers<00:00:56.590> no

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
gonna need to use diamond hammers no

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.770 
gonna need to use diamond hammers no
matter<00:00:56.980> how<00:00:57.250> lucky<00:00:57.609> you<00:00:57.730> are<00:00:57.910> because<00:00:58.359> on<00:00:58.539> the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
matter how lucky you are because on the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.459 
matter how lucky you are because on the
right<00:00:58.930> hand<00:00:59.109> side<00:00:59.230> I've<00:00:59.620> taken<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.160> time<00:01:00.370> to

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
right hand side I've taken the time to

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.560 
right hand side I've taken the time to
organize<00:01:02.469> a<00:01:02.800> chart<00:01:03.340> which<00:01:03.730> shows<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:04.420> the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
organize a chart which shows you the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.010 
organize a chart which shows you the
amount<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:05.520> success<00:01:06.520> rate<00:01:07.000> each<00:01:07.240> hammer<00:01:07.660> has

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
amount of success rate each hammer has

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.450 
amount of success rate each hammer has
so<00:01:08.259> if<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.500> have<00:01:08.649> four<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:08.920> these<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.369> can

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
so if you have four of these you can

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.969 
so if you have four of these you can
multiply<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.119> by<00:01:10.179> four<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.590> will<00:01:11.740> show

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
multiply that by four and it will show

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.880 
multiply that by four and it will show
you<00:01:12.039> how<00:01:12.460> many<00:01:13.149> you<00:01:13.420> need<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:14.200> upgrade<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.740> now

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
you how many you need to upgrade it now

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.190 
you how many you need to upgrade it now
I<00:01:15.130> don't<00:01:15.580> know<00:01:16.090> if<00:01:16.119> you're<00:01:16.360> going<00:01:16.540> for<00:01:16.720> luck<00:01:16.930> or

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
if you're going for statistics now I

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.260 
if you're going for statistics now I
don't<00:01:19.630> usually<00:01:19.930> tend<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.619> get<00:01:21.040> lucky<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.729> fact

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
don't usually tend to get lucky in fact

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.999 
don't usually tend to get lucky in fact
and<00:01:22.479> probably<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.960> most<00:01:23.200> luckiest<00:01:23.770> guy<00:01:23.979> in

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
and probably the most luckiest guy in

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.350 
and probably the most luckiest guy in
the<00:01:24.159> world<00:01:24.280> when<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.759> comes<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.090> stuff<00:01:25.299> like

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
the world when it comes to stuff like

now<00:02:12.670> I'm<00:02:12.850> gonna<00:02:12.970> go<00:02:13.120> ahead<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.660> fast-forward

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
now I'm gonna go ahead and fast-forward

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.270 
now I'm gonna go ahead and fast-forward
these<00:02:14.829> parts<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> bit<00:02:15.489> and

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
these parts a bit and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.360 
these parts a bit and
because<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.450> did<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.319> slowly<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:18.920> could<00:02:19.160> see

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
because I did it slowly so I could see

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
because I did it slowly so I could see
all<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.790> rates<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.690> make<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.990> chart<00:02:21.230> now

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440
