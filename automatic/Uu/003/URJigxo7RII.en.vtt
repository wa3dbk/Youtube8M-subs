00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:13.520
 Do not be surprised you just do yourselves 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:19.030

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.170

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.090
 then maybe I still have 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.090
 Although I only win four 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.870
 why is still there comes a couple 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.640
 seconds

 dÃ¼lmen 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260

 Cabaret I have not for a long time 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.340
 spellbound 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.730
 OK 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.220
 Hello 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.050
 Euro 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.920
 you have the bomb again in any case 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.580
 or not because it does not hear you 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.580
 your desired product 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.480
 or was even stood a 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.459
 for composite 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.030
 OK 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.050
 I hope this was 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.960
 yes, what are you looking at ? 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.470
 OK 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.900
 Villages 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.350
 then you look again my main 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.850
 process is actually stupid if I 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.210
 sometime against not playing on this 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:29.310
 map i always go b then i go there 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.920
 look down and no one is waiting 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.220
 now entropia Jacob once here 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.420
 past 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:41.370
 then I usually go over here again 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.820
 the bridge to the middle and usually 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.740
 but then I meet here already opponents 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.630
 Century does not seem to come too 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.020
 Now a bit of a few people 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.450
 the following effect will come in 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.180
 but not for good if we 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.850
 now won here 7 0 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:07.550
 won won 7 0 won 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:10.110
 but they all wash, after all 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.350
 even that's just shit again 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.350
 here 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.580
 that's just bad because I'm now 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.210
 Also, not the only one there may have 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.560
 it's the best from the left but here 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.600
 better people come in 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:31.270
 what does the five-star guy want with us? 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:42.190
 Yours will pass if here now 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:44.350
 For example, see a kind of live 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.340
 not my opponent because i'm just ok 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.440
 I did not see that 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.120
 yes that's true but okay I have 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.270
 but seen too late 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.950
 I was just great then I am 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:59.680
 of course contributes so what are here for 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.310
 miss bridge again becomes 2 fps 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.310
 such with it 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:16.300
 I had in this other recording 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:16.300
 which sometimes understands living next to it 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.780
 maybe hit you here 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.210
 with the apa red but dollar killed if 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.980
 I would have met him like this by now 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.900
 Now it's okay with you again 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.480
 but I do not know what that frame 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.700
 burglaries are and I do not know 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.000
 if I lost these so first 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.950
 Lost consequence with the thereby the 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.610
 bad kg has wanted yesterday 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.850
 Upload 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.740
 but it did not work because of me 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.990
 I have the four files I wanted 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.880
 to prune and its edges though 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:04.620
 it is not against any file 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.620
 it was broken again 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:12.010
 show yourself 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.570
 the imperator people and there is the 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.310
 Adopted I know now 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.650
 not exactly how long the episode went 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.730
 whether there is something else going on there now 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.900
 or I do not know yet 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.980
 Anyway I think I'm still in the 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.290
 made war and then already 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.190
 end of it either until the same or 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.190
 Until next time
