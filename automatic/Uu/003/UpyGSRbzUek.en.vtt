00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 hola.com this is a video for 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.660
 present you in a new online course and it's 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.390
 one that can find in meaning 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 dotcom online courses and it is a course 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.770
 online and a little different what I have 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 done so far because if it comes in 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.910
 a photo session but there will not be 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.240
 making of neither those things but rather 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.350
 see the result of the session and what I'm going 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.690
 to do with the photos the sessions with 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 susana that you will see that greets us at the end 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.930
 but let's see the I'm going to put the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.810
 your place when you download the card 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.450
 Download the photo from your camera card 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.270
 What does he do with the photo? 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.680
 are you going to process what are the steps to 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.650
 follow but I'll tell you what I 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 I do because everyone has their way of 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.280
 do things but let's see so much 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.100
 frame improve lighting improve 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.409
 the shadows but especially starting from 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.659
 a raw format that is one thing that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.270
 more worried the people who worked in jp 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.040
 is to jump into rap and I want you to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 realize that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.620
 Of course, it's not complicated or anything, I'm not going 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.690
 to teach the super advanced but what 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.820
 basic so you can take the leap 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.950
 then I leave you with an extract of 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.340
 video so you get an idea of is a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.120
 idea of ​​how the course is and now I go back 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.610
 and I say goodbye then I will continue here not 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.000
 I really like the expression, as you see 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.729
 I already have a photo of the staircase is worth and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.120
 here he looks me in front here more than 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.340
 up and I'm going to work the degree in 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.890
 this case I will pass here but before 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.800
 work the tail I will work what 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.260
 is the frame 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.400
 I'm going to cut straight that is like me 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.300
 I like ok ok friend here is worth here 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.000
 could raise the shadows a bit for a 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.100
 little bit worth it if I see that that's very 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.920
 called or the leg a little bit burned 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.630
 recovered a little the Andalusians alt yo 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.540
 I think lightroom has a lot in it 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.130
 advantage over the kart Uruguay at the time 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.740
 that has a lot of present 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.520
 established if you want to put the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.700
 colors the exhibition 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.470
 carmelo contrast change what are the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.510
 waves I want more shadows look at the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 ladder how is changing here the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.520
 right of the photo is changing who 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.040
 the lighting that I had listed 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.160
 in leaving and then what I do is that he used the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.110
 rubber and embroidered all the parts wherever 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.790
 that those black and white options the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.050
 that I like the one that I do not like what 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.880
 be not there I will use that the theme or the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.090
 50% and I already have a saturated if I 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.090
 I want 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.650
 quick also had clear 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.220
 and fast we've done quite a few photos and 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.170
 with many changes of clothes many loads 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.790
 of clothes that woman in a little bag of 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.430
 site a lot of clothes 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.140
 Well, nothing for Asia to watch the video and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.760
 thank your children good I'm 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.010
 convinced that this course can 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.200
 interesting because it is one of the question 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.260
 I 'm more good at the workshops that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.300
 I impart when and comfortable and the jump to 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.400
 rap stayed with those photos that I've 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.680
 downloaded from my card as I 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.810
 I organize to my computer that the filter 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.970
 that the defendant can do it with 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.540
 this video I'll explain and how to 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.280
 easy way you can jump into a 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.410
 much more professional look of your 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.170
 photos and especially of your organization and 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.780
 attitude that is at the end professional not 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.550
 is necessarily the one who lives from this 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.220
 but the one that has the attitude that 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.330
 corresponds to this is not a legal matter 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.040
