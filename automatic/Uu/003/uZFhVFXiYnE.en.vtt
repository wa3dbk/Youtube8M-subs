00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
everyone once that line has been crossed

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
everyone once that line has been crossed
that<00:01:21.720> puts<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> entire<00:01:22.049> world<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.070> risk<00:01:23.250> as

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that puts the entire world at risk as

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
that puts the entire world at risk as
far<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> threat<00:01:24.060> rolling<00:01:24.479> cross<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
far as a threat rolling cross and I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
far as a threat rolling cross and I
think<00:01:25.530> severe<00:01:25.799> action<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.340> taken<00:01:26.400> but

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
think severe action has to be taken but

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.219 
think severe action has to be taken but
more<00:01:26.939> than<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
more than that is this what so

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
more than that is this what so
strengthen<00:01:28.710> Iran<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.759> almost<00:01:30.030> as

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
strengthen Iran you will have almost as

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.359 
strengthen Iran you will have almost as
access<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> Iran<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> Syria<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.829> you'll

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
access of Iran and Syria and you'll

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
access of Iran and Syria and you'll
which<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.570> puts<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> entire<00:01:33.930> Middle<00:01:34.560> East

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
which really puts the entire Middle East

which really puts the entire Middle East
in<00:01:34.979> peril<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> rock<00:01:36.869> in

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
in peril because then you have a rock in

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.450 
in peril because then you have a rock in
there<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> rocket<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.100> given<00:01:38.369> at

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
there and a rocket I was given at

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.990

airspace<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.900> Iran<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.520> stop

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000

from<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.080> beginning<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.530> right<00:02:55.740> now<00:02:55.950> my

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
from the beginning and right now my

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.070 
from the beginning and right now my
concern<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:57.180> he<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.420> going<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.720> use<00:02:57.810> cruise

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
concern is if he is going to use cruise

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.020 
concern is if he is going to use cruise
missiles<00:02:58.590> he<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.220> doesn't<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> few<00:02:59.880> days

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
missiles he just doesn't for a few days

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.270 
missiles he just doesn't for a few days
and<00:03:00.390> walks<00:03:00.930> away<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.650> he's<00:03:01.830> going<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> take

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
and walks away if he's going to take

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.710 
and walks away if he's going to take
action<00:03:02.700> or<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.000> saying<00:03:03.240> he's<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.450> right<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
action or I'm saying he's the right to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360 
action or I'm saying he's the right to
do<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.080> he<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.290> going<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.560> take<00:03:04.740> action<00:03:05.220> I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
do it if he is going to take action I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.520 
do it if he is going to take action I
think<00:03:05.850> it's<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.510> staying<00:03:06.780> cruise<00:03:07.170> missile

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
think it's a staying cruise missile

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.840 
think it's a staying cruise missile
attack<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:07.950> yet<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.340> know<00:03:08.430> what<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.640> endgame

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
attack and yet to know what the endgame

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.700 
attack and yet to know what the endgame
is<00:03:09.120> what<00:03:09.510> does<00:03:09.630> he<00:03:09.750> want<00:03:09.930> from<00:03:09.990> all<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.590> it

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
is what does he want from all this is it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.950 
is what does he want from all this is it
just<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.070> knock<00:03:11.580> out<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.790> few<00:03:11.880> command<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
just to knock out a few command and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.020 
just to knock out a few command and
control<00:03:13.020> systems<00:03:13.380> or<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.610> get<00:03:14.700> us<00:03:14.880> a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
control systems or is it to get us a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.910 
control systems or is it to get us a
negotiating<00:03:15.630> table<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:15.990> we<00:03:16.110> can<00:03:16.290> control<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
negotiating table but we can control the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.220 
negotiating table but we can control the
rebel<00:03:17.400> force<00:03:17.610> because<00:03:17.940> as<00:03:18.240> much<00:03:18.300> as<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.690> respect

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
rebel force because as much as I respect

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.080 
rebel force because as much as I respect
John<00:03:19.470> McCain<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.070> do<00:03:20.340> believe<00:03:20.670> there's<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
John McCain I do believe there's a

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.660 
John McCain I do believe there's a
radical<00:03:21.600> Islamist<00:03:22.200> element<00:03:22.680> which<00:03:23.010> may<00:03:23.220> he<00:03:23.400> is

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
radical Islamist element which may he is

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.340 
radical Islamist element which may he is
close<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.090> dominating<00:03:24.570> those<00:03:24.780> rebel<00:03:25.080> forces

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
close to dominating those rebel forces

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.840 
close to dominating those rebel forces
so<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.800> don't<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.160> not<00:03:26.280> have<00:03:26.460> a<00:03:26.490> sod

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
so I don't want to not have a sod

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.430 
so I don't want to not have a sod
knocked<00:03:27.090> out<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:27.660> I've<00:03:27.840> al-qaeda<00:03:28.200> come

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
knocked out and then I've al-qaeda come

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.100 
knocked out and then I've al-qaeda come
in<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> think<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.700> we<00:03:29.850> can<00:03:30.000> neutralize<00:03:30.450> or

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
in so I think if we can neutralize or

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.050 
in so I think if we can neutralize or
weekend<00:03:31.500> Assad<00:03:31.800> force<00:03:32.520> him<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.850> table

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
weekend Assad force him to the table

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.180 
weekend Assad force him to the table
that<00:03:33.450> gives<00:03:33.960> us<00:03:34.110> leverage<00:03:34.350> as<00:03:34.860> far<00:03:35.070> as

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
that gives us leverage as far as

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.530 
that gives us leverage as far as
controlling<00:03:35.550> with<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> rebels<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.180> would

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
controlling with the rebels so you would

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.710 
controlling with the rebels so you would
be<00:03:36.690> satisfied<00:03:37.410> with<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.800> one<00:03:38.220> day<00:03:38.430> campaign<00:03:39.060> on

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
be satisfied with a one day campaign on

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.770 
be satisfied with a one day campaign on
are<00:03:39.990> we<00:03:40.230> even<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.710> one<00:03:40.920> hour<00:03:41.130> campaign<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:42.450> send

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
are we even a one hour campaign to send

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.990 
are we even a one hour campaign to send
the<00:03:42.930> message<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.350> Assad<00:03:43.710> without<00:03:44.460> removing

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
the message to Assad without removing

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.760 
the message to Assad without removing
him<00:03:45.150> from<00:03:45.180> power<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.900> don't<00:03:46.410> believe<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.710> should

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
him from power I don't believe we should

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.170 
him from power I don't believe we should
be<00:03:46.980> necessarily<00:03:47.550> attempting<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.030> remove

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
be necessarily attempting to remove

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.490 
be necessarily attempting to remove
Assad<00:03:48.480> from<00:03:48.600> power<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.990> think<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.350> going

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
Assad from power I think this is going

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.570 
Assad from power I think this is going
to<00:03:49.590> take<00:03:49.650> more<00:03:49.830> than<00:03:49.950> one<00:03:50.100> day<00:03:50.280> there's<00:03:50.520> going

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
to take more than one day there's going

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.220 
to take more than one day there's going
to<00:03:50.760> take<00:03:50.850> many<00:03:51.060> many<00:03:51.270> days<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.870> sustained

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
to take many many days of sustained

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
to take many many days of sustained
cruise<00:03:52.560> missile<00:03:52.950> attacks<00:03:53.220> before<00:03:53.760> we've

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
cruise missile attacks before we've

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.240 
cruise missile attacks before we've
sufficiently<00:03:54.720> degraded<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.800> Syrian

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
sufficiently degraded the Syrian

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.620 
sufficiently degraded the Syrian
military<00:03:56.460> and<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> command<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.570> control

centers<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.130> extent<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.490> they<00:03:59.730> will

centers to the extent that they will

realize that they have to negotiate and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.890 
realize that they have to negotiate and
at<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:01.950> stage<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.820> real<00:04:03.000> negotiations<00:04:03.690> can

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
at that stage then real negotiations can

at that stage then real negotiations can
start<00:04:04.260> again<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.830> it's<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.310> large<00:04:05.580> thing

if you if you damage Assad to the point

are flowing in from all over that part
of<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.130> world<00:04:14.160> then<00:04:14.640> what<00:04:14.850> have<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.060> done

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
of the world then what have you done

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.870 
of the world then what have you done
well<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:16.080> we<00:04:16.290> we<00:04:16.710> come<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.400> if<00:04:17.609> we're<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.850> ones

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
well if we we come in if we're the ones

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.340 
well if we we come in if we're the ones
who<00:04:18.090> bring<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.450> about<00:04:18.630> then<00:04:18.930> we<00:04:19.080> would<00:04:19.260> have

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
who bring this about then we would have

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.259 
who bring this about then we would have
leverage<00:04:19.859> at<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.250> table<00:04:20.700> too

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
leverage at the table too

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.360 
leverage at the table too
control<00:04:21.629> those<00:04:22.259> rebel<00:04:22.889> fighters<00:04:23.190> now<00:04:23.310> we

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
control those rebel fighters now we

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.350 
control those rebel fighters now we
should've<00:04:23.669> been<00:04:23.759> doing<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.060> for<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.270> last

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
should've been doing this for the last

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.939 
should've been doing this for the last
two<00:04:24.569> years<00:04:24.599> controlling<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.379> rebel<00:04:25.650> fighters

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
two years controlling the rebel fighters

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.589 
two years controlling the rebel fighters
we<00:04:26.280> should<00:04:26.430> have<00:04:26.580> much<00:04:26.759> more<00:04:26.940> importance<00:04:27.449> and

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
we should have much more importance and

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.290 
we should have much more importance and
then<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:27.870> have<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.590> Obama<00:04:29.340> it's<00:04:29.639> very<00:04:29.879> hard<00:04:30.210> to

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
then we have so Obama it's very hard to

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.850 
then we have so Obama it's very hard to
defend<00:04:30.690> his<00:04:30.900> policies<00:04:31.319> i'm<00:04:31.470> really<00:04:31.740> not

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
defend his policies i'm really not

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.559 
defend his policies i'm really not
defending<00:04:32.250> its<00:04:32.370> policy<00:04:32.759> i'm<00:04:33.090> saying<00:04:33.389> is<00:04:33.509> the

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
defending its policy i'm saying is the

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:34.939 
defending its policy i'm saying is the
right<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.840> carry<00:04:34.050> out<00:04:34.199> the<00:04:34.319> attack<00:04:34.409> I<00:04:34.740> think

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
right to carry out the attack I think

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.740 
right to carry out the attack I think
attacks<00:04:35.520> have<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.819> be<00:04:35.879> carried<00:04:36.180> out<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:36.629> there

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
attacks have to be carried out but there

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.119 
attacks have to be carried out but there
has<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:36.990> an<00:04:37.110> endgame<00:04:37.319> it<00:04:37.620> can't<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:37.949> just

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
has to be an endgame it can't be just

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.219 
has to be an endgame it can't be just
one<00:04:38.400> or<00:04:38.520> two<00:04:38.550> or<00:04:38.789> three-day<00:04:39.150> feel<00:04:39.780> good<00:04:39.990> things

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
one or two or three-day feel good things

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.729 
one or two or three-day feel good things
so<00:04:40.379> he<00:04:40.470> can<00:04:40.620> sue<00:04:40.770> this<00:04:40.919> conscience<00:04:41.400> well
