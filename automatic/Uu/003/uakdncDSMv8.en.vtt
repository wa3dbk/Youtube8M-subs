the<00:01:04.229> hips<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.739> natural<00:01:05.700> thing<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> happen<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the hips the natural thing to happen it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.090 
the hips the natural thing to happen it
is<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.140> heel<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.530> contact<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> ground

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
is for that heel to contact the ground

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.330 
is for that heel to contact the ground
first<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.689> here<00:01:10.110> we've<00:01:11.040> got<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the first thing that hits the ground is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.380 
the first thing that hits the ground is
that<00:01:16.020> heel<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.250> you'll<00:01:17.400> ever<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.790> its<00:01:17.970> contact

with the heel or it's really flat

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.190 
with the heel or it's really flat

forwards<00:01:24.660> so<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.680> thing<00:01:25.920> that's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
forwards so that's one thing that's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.370 
forwards so that's one thing that's
happened<00:01:26.400> over<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> last<00:01:26.730> four<00:01:26.970> years

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
happened over the last four years

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.080 
happened over the last four years
another<00:01:28.380> thing<00:01:28.620> is<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.490> started<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.940> wear

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
another thing is as we started to wear

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.710 
another thing is as we started to wear
thicker

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
thicker

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.200 
thicker
cushion<00:01:31.290> shoes<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.310> first<00:01:32.340> real<00:01:32.820> cushion

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
cushion shoes the first real cushion

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.270 
cushion shoes the first real cushion
shoe<00:01:33.420> being<00:01:33.630> brought<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.159> 1971<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
shoe being brought out in 1971 to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.430 
shoe being brought out in 1971 to
promote<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.880> longer<00:01:36.270> stride<00:01:36.570> what<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
promote that longer stride what it's

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.040 
promote that longer stride what it's
also<00:01:37.620> done<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.070> we've<00:01:38.250> tended<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.720> rely

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
also done is we've tended to really rely

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.230 
also done is we've tended to really rely
on<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.380> shoe<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.800> absorb<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.190> pressure<00:01:41.550> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
on the shoe to absorb that pressure so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.360 
on the shoe to absorb that pressure so
we<00:01:42.360> stopped<00:01:42.810> being<00:01:43.260> conscious<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.159> how

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
we stopped being conscious about how

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.880 
we stopped being conscious about how
we're<00:01:44.550> landing<00:01:44.940> it<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.090> our<00:01:45.450> feet<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.990> because

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
we're landing it on our feet a because

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
we're landing it on our feet a because
we<00:01:47.520> rely<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> shoe<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.750> us<00:01:48.900> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
we rely on the shoe to do it for us and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.480 
we rely on the shoe to do it for us and
second<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.650> all<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.460> that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
second of all we do not get that

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
second of all we do not get that
proprioception<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.690> that's<00:01:52.140> sensory

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
proprioception and that's sensory

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
proprioception and that's sensory
feedback<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.670> we're<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:53.850> reliant<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.630> just

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
feedback so we're very reliant on just

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
feedback so we're very reliant on just
allowing<00:01:55.290> our<00:01:55.560> shoes<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.490> us<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
allowing our shoes to do that for us and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.050 
allowing our shoes to do that for us and
and<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:58.170> don't<00:01:58.470> really<00:01:59.190> respond<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.940> way

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and we don't really respond in a way

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.210 
and we don't really respond in a way
that<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.330> should<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.290> what<00:02:01.440> you'll<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.950> at

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
that we should so what you'll see is at

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.130 
that we should so what you'll see is at
the<00:02:02.430> start<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> runner<00:02:02.970> is<00:02:03.299> very<00:02:03.630> upright<00:02:03.870> for

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the start the runner is very upright for

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.050 
the start the runner is very upright for
you<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.320> upper<00:02:04.530> body<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.370> up<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
you that upper body so they up all of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.460 
you that upper body so they up all of
that<00:02:06.210> movement<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.720> created<00:02:06.870> from<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> waist

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
that movement is created from the waist

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.760 
that movement is created from the waist
down

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
down

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.999 
down
from<00:02:08.670> throwing<00:02:08.909> the<00:02:09.000> leg<00:02:09.179> forwards<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.009> then

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
from throwing the leg forwards and then

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.820 
from throwing the leg forwards and then
pushing<00:02:11.790> away<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.090> using<00:02:12.360> power<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.349> because

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
pushing away and using power so because

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.699 
pushing away and using power so because
she's<00:02:14.069> an<00:02:14.360> upright<00:02:15.360> she's<00:02:15.870> having<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.500> throw

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
she's an upright she's having to throw

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.380 
she's an upright she's having to throw
her<00:02:16.860> leg<00:02:17.040> forward<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.519> create<00:02:17.760> movement<00:02:18.209> and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
her leg forward to create movement and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.180 
her leg forward to create movement and
like<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.900> just<00:02:19.110> mentioned<00:02:19.290> before<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.950> first

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
like we just mentioned before the first

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.069 
like we just mentioned before the first
thing<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.370> hits<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> ground<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
thing that hits the ground here is the

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.140 
thing that hits the ground here is the
heel<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.499> that's<00:02:22.739> generally<00:02:23.249> how<00:02:23.279> it<00:02:23.579> happens

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
heel and that's generally how it happens

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.009 
heel and that's generally how it happens
in<00:02:24.900> terms<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.529> what<00:02:26.159> happens

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
in terms of that what happens

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.869 
in terms of that what happens
any<00:02:27.200> contact<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:27.890> front<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.340> ground<00:02:28.609> and

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
any contact in front of the ground and

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.000 
any contact in front of the ground and
particularly<00:02:29.840> being<00:02:30.200> made<00:02:30.409> through<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.799> heel

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
particularly being made through the heel

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.520 
particularly being made through the heel
because<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.549> is<00:02:31.670> purely<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.629> lump<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.319> bone

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
because it is purely just a lump of bone

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.009 
because it is purely just a lump of bone
and<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.640> doesn't<00:02:34.909> absorb<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.359> pressure<00:02:35.659> so

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
and it doesn't absorb that pressure so

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.199 
and it doesn't absorb that pressure so
it<00:02:36.560> sends<00:02:37.099> shockwaves<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.760> force<00:02:38.000> right

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
it sends shockwaves of force right

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.039 
it sends shockwaves of force right
through<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.629> body

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
through the body

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.170 
through the body
things<00:02:39.439> like<00:02:39.620> shin<00:02:39.950> splints<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.430> really<00:02:40.849> highly

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
things like shin splints a really highly

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.179 
things like shin splints a really highly
permanent<00:02:41.659> prominent<00:02:42.079> when<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.950> heel

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.849 
permanent prominent when with heel
striking<00:02:43.519> as<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:44.329> is<00:02:44.480> ITB<00:02:45.170> friction<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
striking as it is ITB friction on the

as<00:02:51.680> well<00:02:51.920> another<00:02:52.639> thing<00:02:52.939> is<00:02:53.090> as<00:02:53.239> well<00:02:53.389> as

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
as well another thing is as well as

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.500 
as well another thing is as well as
blending<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.620> front<00:02:55.180> we're<00:02:56.180> hitting<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
ground first with the heel then you'll

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.039 
ground first with the heel then you'll
see<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.549> runner<00:02:58.730> rolls<00:02:59.180> right<00:02:59.480> through<00:02:59.870> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
see the runner rolls right through the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.879 
see the runner rolls right through the
foot<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.530> then<00:03:01.099> pushes<00:03:01.609> off<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.909> toes<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.200> as

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
foot and then pushes off the toes so as

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.619 
foot and then pushes off the toes so as
well<00:03:04.129> as<00:03:04.159> that<00:03:04.370> harsh<00:03:04.639> contact<00:03:05.269> in<00:03:05.510> that

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
well as that harsh contact in that

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.569 
well as that harsh contact in that
immediate<00:03:05.900> point<00:03:06.349> of<00:03:06.500> contact<00:03:06.980> we're<00:03:07.489> also

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
immediate point of contact we're also

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.789 
immediate point of contact we're also
really<00:03:08.000> rolling<00:03:08.389> through<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.840> foot<00:03:09.169> and<00:03:09.349> that

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
really rolling through the foot and that

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.699 
really rolling through the foot and that
promotes<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.340> lot<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.579> other<00:03:10.760> things<00:03:11.329> such<00:03:11.629> as

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
promotes a lot of other things such as

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.039 
promotes a lot of other things such as
plantar<00:03:12.709> fasciitis<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.609> tight<00:03:14.599> hamstrings

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
plantar fasciitis and tight hamstrings

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.740 
plantar fasciitis and tight hamstrings
type<00:03:15.409> soleus<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.219> a<00:03:16.579> real<00:03:16.790> buildup<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.359> stress

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
type soleus and a real buildup of stress

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.869 
type soleus and a real buildup of stress
in<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.079> lower<00:03:18.319> limb<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.370> that's<00:03:19.579> one<00:03:19.730> thing

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
in that lower limb so that's one thing

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.330 
in that lower limb so that's one thing
that<00:03:20.030> we<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.329> here<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:21.439> way<00:03:21.590> we've<00:03:21.799> combatted

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
that we see here the way we've combatted

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.099 
that we see here the way we've combatted
that<00:03:22.459> during<00:03:22.669> the<00:03:22.760> session<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.389> we've<00:03:23.900> really

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
that during the session is we've really

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.259 
that during the session is we've really
looked<00:03:24.439> at<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.340> angle<00:03:25.790> between<00:03:25.969> the

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
looked at this the angle between the

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.929 
looked at this the angle between the
ground<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.109> body<00:03:27.319> so<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.129> angle<00:03:28.819> between

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
ground and the body so the angle between

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.550

below the hips so where as this runner
at<00:03:53.659> the<00:03:53.689> start<00:03:53.959> was<00:03:54.079> throwing<00:03:54.290> her<00:03:54.470> load

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
at the start was throwing her load

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.379 
at the start was throwing her load
forwards<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.159> planting<00:03:55.639> way<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:55.939> front<00:03:56.209> of

forwards and planting way in front of
the<00:03:56.479> hips<00:03:57.040> what<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.159> can<00:03:58.310> see<00:03:58.489> she's<00:03:58.729> really

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
the hips what you can see she's really

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.569 
the hips what you can see she's really
focused<00:03:59.629> on<00:03:59.870> planting<00:04:00.739> below<00:04:01.009> the<00:04:01.159> hips<00:04:01.370> and

forward<00:04:03.590> lean<00:04:03.769> means<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.519> when<00:04:04.639> she<00:04:04.759> hits

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
forward lean means that when she hits

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.659 
forward lean means that when she hits
the<00:04:05.060> ground<00:04:05.530> there's<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.620> very<00:04:06.919> faint<00:04:07.280> shadow

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
the ground there's a very faint shadow

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.659 
the ground there's a very faint shadow
that's<00:04:08.359> appearing<00:04:08.780> below<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.229> heel<00:04:09.439> and<00:04:09.739> that

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
that's appearing below the heel and that

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.309 
that's appearing below the heel and that
means<00:04:10.879> that<00:04:11.030> she's<00:04:11.239> contacting<00:04:11.810> nicely<00:04:12.199> in

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
means that she's contacting nicely in

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.710 
means that she's contacting nicely in
the<00:04:12.409> mid<00:04:12.560> form<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.669> people<00:04:14.060> think<00:04:14.299> it's<00:04:14.509> always

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
the mid form so people think it's always

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.930 
the mid form so people think it's always
just<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.109> conscious<00:04:15.560> effort<00:04:15.739> oh<00:04:16.039> I<00:04:16.370> just<00:04:16.430> want

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
just a conscious effort oh I just want

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.610 
just a conscious effort oh I just want
to<00:04:17.060> land<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.509> a<00:04:17.599> certain<00:04:17.810> part<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.199> my<00:04:18.289> foot<00:04:18.470> and

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
to land on a certain part of my foot and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.560 
to land on a certain part of my foot and
that's<00:04:18.889> all<00:04:19.039> you<00:04:19.159> need<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.430> do<00:04:19.609> it's<00:04:20.389> actually

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
that's all you need to do it's actually

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.839 
that's all you need to do it's actually
something<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.500> can't<00:04:21.739> achieve<00:04:22.159> unless<00:04:22.669> you

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
something you can't achieve unless you

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.089 
something you can't achieve unless you
change<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.360> angle<00:04:23.389> between<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.530> ground<00:04:24.800> and

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
change the angle between the ground and

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.370 
change the angle between the ground and
your<00:04:25.460> body<00:04:25.870> learning<00:04:26.870> in<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.020> mid<00:04:27.169> for

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
your body learning in the mid for

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.960 
your body learning in the mid for
obviously<00:04:27.770> if<00:04:28.159> you<00:04:28.250> look<00:04:28.400> at<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.580> structure

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
obviously if you look at the structure

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.730 
obviously if you look at the structure
of<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.210> foot<00:04:29.449> it's<00:04:29.840> built<00:04:30.139> just<00:04:30.320> like<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.680> would

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
of a foot it's built just like it would

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.980 
of a foot it's built just like it would
be<00:04:30.889> with<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.070> kangaroo<00:04:31.310> or<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.789> horse<00:04:32.060> or<00:04:32.360> or<00:04:32.810> any

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
be with a kangaroo or a horse or or any

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.850 
be with a kangaroo or a horse or or any
other<00:04:33.289> sort<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:34.960> foot<00:04:35.960> really<00:04:36.260> it's<00:04:36.469> designed

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
other sort of foot really it's designed

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.279 
other sort of foot really it's designed
to<00:04:37.010> absorb<00:04:37.400> pressure

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
to absorb pressure

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.889 
to absorb pressure
and<00:04:38.490> but<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.819> thing<00:04:39.849> is<00:04:40.029> over<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.360> last<00:04:40.539> 40

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:40.899 
and but the thing is over the last 40

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.799 
and but the thing is over the last 40
years<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.139> stopped<00:04:41.409> using<00:04:41.619> it<00:04:41.830> as<00:04:42.009> well<00:04:42.249> so<00:04:42.809> you

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:43.809 
years we stopped using it as well so you

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.109 
years we stopped using it as well so you
can<00:04:44.020> maximize<00:04:44.259> that<00:04:44.710> absorption<00:04:45.460> at<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.879> feet

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:46.119 
can maximize that absorption at the feet

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.790 
can maximize that absorption at the feet
and<00:04:46.360> prevent<00:04:46.689> that<00:04:46.869> force<00:04:47.229> riding<00:04:47.619> through

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
and prevent that force riding through

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.010 
and prevent that force riding through
the<00:04:47.919> body<00:04:48.129> by<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.879> maintaining<00:04:49.599> that<00:04:49.719> forward

prevention against injuries as well so
there's<00:05:08.409> a<00:05:08.469> few<00:05:08.589> of<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.860> things<00:05:09.009> just<00:05:09.309> to<00:05:09.399> go

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
there's a few of the things just to go

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.399 
there's a few of the things just to go
with<00:05:09.550> that<00:05:09.939> as<00:05:10.180> well<00:05:10.629> as<00:05:10.749> maintaining<00:05:11.199> a

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
with that as well as maintaining a

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.049 
with that as well as maintaining a
natural<00:05:11.589> forward<00:05:12.099> leaning<00:05:12.249> position<00:05:12.399> the

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:13.059 
natural forward leaning position the

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.129 
natural forward leaning position the
other<00:05:13.209> thing<00:05:13.360> is<00:05:13.449> to<00:05:13.569> ensure<00:05:13.719> you're<00:05:13.959> nice<00:05:14.110> and

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
other thing is to ensure you're nice and

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.659 
other thing is to ensure you're nice and
straight<00:05:14.619> for<00:05:14.770> you<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.919> hips<00:05:15.099> at<00:05:15.309> this<00:05:15.430> point

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
straight for you the hips at this point

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.519 
straight for you the hips at this point
as<00:05:15.849> well<00:05:16.029> because<00:05:16.839> you'll<00:05:17.020> see<00:05:17.229> here<00:05:17.409> the

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
as well because you'll see here the

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.309 
as well because you'll see here the
runner<00:05:17.709> at<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:17.889> start<00:05:18.219> is<00:05:18.520> it<00:05:19.149> has<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.020> high

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
runner at the start is it has a high

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.100 
runner at the start is it has a high
amount<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.889> hip<00:05:21.219> flexion<00:05:21.490> occur<00:05:21.969> and<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.930> what

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
amount of hip flexion occur and so what

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.589 
amount of hip flexion occur and so what
that<00:05:23.229> means<00:05:23.529> is<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.099> makes<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.819> harder<00:05:25.240> because

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
that means is it makes it harder because

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.239 
that means is it makes it harder because
she's<00:05:26.139> not<00:05:26.289> bringing<00:05:26.529> her<00:05:26.770> body<00:05:27.039> off<00:05:27.219> the

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:27.249 
she's not bringing her body off the

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.369 
she's not bringing her body off the
ground<00:05:27.399> and<00:05:27.909> it<00:05:28.479> makes<00:05:28.689> it<00:05:28.869> harder<00:05:29.199> for<00:05:29.229> that

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
ground and it makes it harder for that

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.859 
ground and it makes it harder for that
foot<00:05:30.309> to<00:05:30.459> contact<00:05:30.909> directly<00:05:31.059> below<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.689> hip

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:31.869 
foot to contact directly below the hip

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:33.749 
foot to contact directly below the hip
so<00:05:32.050> that's<00:05:32.229> why<00:05:32.379> as<00:05:32.559> well<00:05:32.770> she's<00:05:33.309> hitting<00:05:33.490> the

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
so that's why as well she's hitting the

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.869 
so that's why as well she's hitting the
body<00:05:34.029> hitting<00:05:34.839> her<00:05:35.080> foot<00:05:35.319> in<00:05:36.309> front<00:05:36.610> of<00:05:36.789> her

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
body hitting her foot in front of her

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.089 
body hitting her foot in front of her
hips<00:05:37.149> and<00:05:37.479> that<00:05:37.899> increases<00:05:38.439> that<00:05:38.559> pressure<00:05:38.860> as

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
hips and that increases that pressure as

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:40.619 
hips and that increases that pressure as
well<00:05:39.309> so<00:05:39.819> it's<00:05:39.939> really<00:05:40.089> important<00:05:40.539> to<00:05:40.599> think

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:40.629 
well so it's really important to think

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.149 
well so it's really important to think
about<00:05:40.869> keeping<00:05:41.319> those<00:05:41.409> hips<00:05:41.619> nice<00:05:41.830> and

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
about keeping those hips nice and

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.059 
about keeping those hips nice and
straight<00:05:42.659> and<00:05:43.659> that<00:05:43.689> forward<00:05:44.139> lean<00:05:44.319> is<00:05:44.800> from

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
straight and that forward lean is from

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.429 
straight and that forward lean is from
the<00:05:45.189> ankles<00:05:45.669> it<00:05:46.419> isn't<00:05:46.749> through<00:05:46.899> the<00:05:47.050> hips<00:05:47.259> and

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
the ankles it isn't through the hips and

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.290 
the ankles it isn't through the hips and
it<00:05:47.589> isn't<00:05:47.740> through<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.279> chest<00:05:48.550> so<00:05:49.149> it's

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
it isn't through the chest so it's

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.939 
it isn't through the chest so it's
really<00:05:49.479> important<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:49.959> stay<00:05:50.259> really<00:05:50.499> straight

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
really important to stay really straight

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.739 
really important to stay really straight
through<00:05:51.129> the<00:05:51.249> hips<00:05:51.459> and<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:51.789> chest<00:05:51.819> pull<00:05:52.629> that

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:52.749 
through the hips and the chest pull that

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.659 
through the hips and the chest pull that
head<00:05:52.959> towards<00:05:53.349> the<00:05:53.439> sky<00:05:53.709> and<00:05:53.979> keep<00:05:54.430> that

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
head towards the sky and keep that

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.779 
head towards the sky and keep that
length<00:05:54.969> so<00:05:55.959> as<00:05:56.080> I<00:05:56.169> say<00:05:56.349> runners<00:05:57.159> it's<00:05:57.430> really

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
length so as I say runners it's really

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.879 
length so as I say runners it's really
important<00:05:58.330> guys<00:05:58.539> to<00:05:58.870> think<00:05:59.469> about<00:05:59.680> keeping

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
important guys to think about keeping

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.309 
important guys to think about keeping
that<00:06:00.189> length<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.729> by<00:06:01.389> combining<00:06:01.749> that<00:06:02.259> with

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
that length and by combining that with

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.619 
that length and by combining that with
maintaining<00:06:02.860> that<00:06:03.159> small<00:06:03.430> forward<00:06:03.759> lean<00:06:03.969> you

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
maintaining that small forward lean you

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.629 
maintaining that small forward lean you
can<00:06:04.809> start<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.169> really<00:06:05.409> relax<00:06:05.830> that<00:06:06.399> lower

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
can start to really relax that lower

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.449 
can start to really relax that lower
body<00:06:06.909> and<00:06:07.379> and<00:06:08.379> really<00:06:08.830> start<00:06:09.129> to<00:06:09.309> learn

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:09.459 
body and and really start to learn

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:11.549 
body and and really start to learn
naturally<00:06:09.729> on<00:06:10.119> the<00:06:10.240> mid-foot<00:06:10.599> without<00:06:11.229> having

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:11.559 
naturally on the mid-foot without having

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:13.579 
naturally on the mid-foot without having
to<00:06:11.680> use<00:06:11.889> much<00:06:12.099> conscious<00:06:12.639> effort<00:06:12.969> at<00:06:13.089> all

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589 
to use much conscious effort at all

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:15.540 
to use much conscious effort at all
landing<00:06:14.589> on<00:06:14.649> a<00:06:14.709> certain<00:06:15.009> part<00:06:15.189> of<00:06:15.219> a<00:06:15.339> foot

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
landing on a certain part of a foot

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.429 
landing on a certain part of a foot
should<00:06:15.699> be<00:06:15.789> very<00:06:16.059> very<00:06:16.330> natural<00:06:16.599> and<00:06:17.019> it

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:17.439 
should be very very natural and it

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.779 
should be very very natural and it
shouldn't<00:06:17.740> be<00:06:17.800> something<00:06:18.039> you<00:06:18.249> have<00:06:18.279> to<00:06:18.399> think

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
shouldn't be something you have to think

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.029 
shouldn't be something you have to think
about<00:06:19.059> as<00:06:19.269> you<00:06:19.419> run<00:06:19.629> as<00:06:20.199> long<00:06:20.409> as<00:06:20.529> you're<00:06:20.680> doing

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
about as you run as long as you're doing

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.790 
about as you run as long as you're doing
those<00:06:21.249> those<00:06:21.759> certain<00:06:22.599> positions<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.769> will

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
those those certain positions you will

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.679 
those those certain positions you will
land<00:06:24.159> in<00:06:24.369> that<00:06:24.399> way<00:06:24.699> and<00:06:24.939> that<00:06:25.300> will<00:06:25.419> help

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
land in that way and that will help

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.239 
land in that way and that will help
prevent<00:06:26.080> against<00:06:26.409> those<00:06:26.559> injuries<00:06:26.919> so<00:06:27.099> this

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:27.249 
prevent against those injuries so this

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:28.499 
prevent against those injuries so this
is<00:06:27.399> will<00:06:27.550> from<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.819> ring<00:06:27.969> injury<00:06:28.269> free

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509
