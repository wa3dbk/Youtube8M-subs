hello<00:00:07.950> everybody<00:00:08.870> we<00:00:09.870> are<00:00:09.900> back<00:00:10.019> with<00:00:10.410> our<00:00:10.530> how

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
hello everybody we are back with our how

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.340 
hello everybody we are back with our how
to<00:00:10.830> solve<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.160> Rubik's<00:00:11.460> Cube<00:00:11.519> series<00:00:15.049> as<00:00:16.049> you

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
to solve a Rubik's Cube series as you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.269 
to solve a Rubik's Cube series as you
can<00:00:16.470> see<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> saw<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.010> top<00:00:17.250> two<00:00:17.400> rows<00:00:17.430> already

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
can see I saw the top two rows already

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.090 
can see I saw the top two rows already
but<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.730> ran<00:00:21.000> into<00:00:21.150> another<00:00:21.300> problem

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
but I ran into another problem

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.420 
but I ran into another problem
headlights<00:00:24.080> now<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.710> talked<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> friend

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
headlights now I talked to a friend

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.740 
headlights now I talked to a friend
today<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.820> he<00:00:27.449> told<00:00:27.599> me<00:00:27.900> how<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.439> fix<00:00:29.099> this

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
today and he told me how just fix this

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.490 
today and he told me how just fix this
what<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.880> bring<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:34.050> corners

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
what you want to do is bring the corners

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.090 
what you want to do is bring the corners
back<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.160> alignment<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.410> taught<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> guys

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
back to alignment so I taught you guys

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.670 
back to alignment so I taught you guys
an<00:00:38.280> algorithm<00:00:38.700> last<00:00:38.910> time<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.440> might<00:00:40.590> have

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
an algorithm last time you might have

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.100 
an algorithm last time you might have
remembered<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.190> might<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.520> oh<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
remembered it might not oh so if you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.910 
remembered it might not oh so if you
guys<00:00:43.230> didn't<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:45.920> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
guys didn't this is what it is are you

you<00:01:08.010> want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:09.020> fix<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> corners<00:01:10.740> so

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
you want to do is fix all the corners so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.410 
you want to do is fix all the corners so
this<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.049> supposed<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.740> here

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
this one is supposed to be way over here

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.399 
this one is supposed to be way over here
this<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.689> supposed<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.290> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
is supposed to be over here so you want

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
is supposed to be over here so you want
to<00:01:19.650> find<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> corner<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.189> matches<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:23.689> do

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to find the corner that matches and do

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.880 
to find the corner that matches and do
the<00:01:24.840> other<00:01:24.869> algorithms<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.530> taught<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the other algorithms that I taught you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.550 
the other algorithms that I taught you
so<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so have that one right here on the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.630 
so have that one right here on the
bottom<00:01:28.710> left<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.270> then<00:01:30.950> spin<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:31.979> away<00:01:32.490> from

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
bottom left and then spin it away from

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.890 
bottom left and then spin it away from
you<00:01:32.850> 360<00:01:33.780> degrees<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.829> 360<00:01:35.540> 90<00:01:36.540> degrees<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you 360 degrees or not 360 90 degrees I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:49.480 
you 360 degrees or not 360 90 degrees I
think<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:39.079> R<00:01:40.079> prime<00:01:40.670> u<00:01:42.409> R<00:01:43.409> prime<00:01:46.040> u<00:01:47.040> -

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
think and then go R prime u R prime u -

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:00.139 
think and then go R prime u R prime u -
R<00:01:51.890> u<00:01:52.890> prime<00:01:53.540> R<00:01:54.540> prime<00:01:54.950> u<00:01:55.950> -<00:01:56.310> R<00:01:57.020> -<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.759> they

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
R u prime R prime u - R - and now they

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.200 
R u prime R prime u - R - and now they
should<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.899> right<00:02:01.049> spots<00:02:02.000> as<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
should all be in the right spots as you

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.190 
should all be in the right spots as you
can<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.780> are

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
can see they all are

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.679 
can see they all are
so<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> want<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.659> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
so now what you want to do is have it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.490 
so now what you want to do is have it
facing<00:02:06.960> towards<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.580> go<00:02:08.580> R<00:02:09.060> Prime

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
facing towards you go R Prime

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.490 
facing towards you go R Prime
d<00:02:11.600> are<00:02:13.940> deeper<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.930> keep<00:02:16.080> on<00:02:16.200> doing<00:02:16.320> that

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
d are deeper in so I keep on doing that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:29.440 
d are deeper in so I keep on doing that
till<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:23.190> fixed<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:27.140> R<00:02:28.140> prime<00:02:28.470> D<00:02:29.040> prime

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
till this is fixed the R prime D prime

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.390 
till this is fixed the R prime D prime
then<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.630> do<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.780> over<00:02:31.020> time

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
then just do it over time

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.730 
then just do it over time
G<00:02:32.630> no<00:02:33.630> deeper<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.250> then<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.550> spit<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.620> do

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
G no deeper and then you spit it and do

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.610 
G no deeper and then you spit it and do
the<00:02:37.860> same<00:02:38.040> thing

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the same thing

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.400 
the same thing
d<00:02:41.540> alright<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.459> our<00:02:44.730> deeper<00:02:45.330> just<00:02:45.990> keep<00:02:46.140> doing

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
d alright and our deeper just keep doing

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.800 
d alright and our deeper just keep doing
that<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:50.720> boom<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:52.560> solved

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
that and boom it's solved

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.030 
that and boom it's solved
just<00:02:54.810> give<00:02:54.900> me<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.020> short<00:02:55.200> video<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.690> still

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
just give me a short video but still

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.750 
just give me a short video but still
that's<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.970> problem<00:03:00.300> with<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> headlights

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
that's the problem with the headlights

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.460 
that's the problem with the headlights
solved<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:07.430> yeah<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:10.050> guys<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.350> any

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
solved so yeah so you guys have any

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.250 
solved so yeah so you guys have any
questions<00:03:11.570> comment<00:03:12.570> ask<00:03:14.239> for<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.269> specific<00:03:16.080> one

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
questions comment ask for a specific one

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.420 
questions comment ask for a specific one
and<00:03:16.320> I'll<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.680> solve<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> top<00:03:17.130> she<00:03:17.280> rose

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
and I'll just solve the top she rose

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.460 
and I'll just solve the top she rose
again<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.850> just<00:03:18.239> keep<00:03:18.360> doing<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:19.019> till<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.230> find

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
again and just keep doing it till I find

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.620 
again and just keep doing it till I find
the<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.860> want<00:03:20.070> me<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.220> solve<00:03:20.630> so

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the one that you want me to solve so

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.759 
the one that you want me to solve so
yeah
