post<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.739> fun<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.039> tried<00:01:56.340> plugging<00:01:56.580> the

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
post just for fun I tried plugging the

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.120 
post just for fun I tried plugging the
mic<00:01:57.000> straight<00:01:57.450> into<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.840> es<00:01:57.989> 5d<00:01:58.440> mark<00:01:58.709> ii<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
mic straight into the es 5d mark ii and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.609 
mic straight into the es 5d mark ii and
surprisingly<00:01:59.940> it<00:02:00.149> worked<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:00.959> if<00:02:01.289> you<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.560> to

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
surprisingly it worked so if you want to

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.710 
surprisingly it worked so if you want to
keep<00:02:01.800> your<00:02:01.950> audio<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.459> camera<00:02:02.880> instead<00:02:03.630> of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
keep your audio in camera instead of

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.359 
keep your audio in camera instead of
having<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.050> separate<00:02:04.319> recorder<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.250> need

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
having a separate recorder all you need

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.520 
having a separate recorder all you need
is<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.729> microphone<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.390> mic<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.810> two<00:02:07.050> connector

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
is the microphone a mic on two connector

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.820

you're<00:02:10.950> hearing<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.640> road<00:02:11.849> laugh

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you're hearing now is the road laugh
