00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.859
 I say 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.859
 is an earlier one 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.909
 beginning of this century 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.269
 in an exciting competition 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
 that says 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.520
 there are its limits 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.930
 don't make the reactions too long 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.930
 it's that simple 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.640
 for that matter 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 as a warm-up for the host country 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 sit well 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.790
 as a board member 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.790
 the first quarter 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.680
 manson 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 The season 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 it is 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.190
 on the beach 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.520
 the German Chancellor 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.500
 the water is standing 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 it is a shame 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.009
 do not fuss
