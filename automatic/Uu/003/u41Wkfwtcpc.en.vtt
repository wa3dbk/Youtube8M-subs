 creates on the side of pulling that is 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.020
 quite unique have the pressure special 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.020
 for designed 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.469
 Every chain pull there is built to 300 to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.750
 to be able to pull 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.130
 eight times 300 is 2400 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.600
 safety for example at the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.819
 pulling a chain he is a safe one 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.799
 workload of 300 tons 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.580
 while the breach is swimming off the chain 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.179
 itself of 600 tons, this is 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.530
 grandparents 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.629
 we are anchor points for the track 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 machines these are the course 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.530
 meanwhile the pound carriers are sitting 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.239
 these six have pinned on this 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.980
 moment in use for the fore ship 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.980
 positioning and pulling in that 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.330
 from building the twinklerz in 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.040
 schiedam we got in through five 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.040

 smart solutions take you to the experience 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.210
 the chain paulus and the power packs everything 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.620
 around the faucets 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.410
 k that is simply provided by man 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.630
 must and then you have the people of mammoth 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.850
 he himself is specialized in this again 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.990
 are those that we use 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.670
 take 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.690

 salt and the poop was that 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.620
 now runs really well so that planned 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.670
 and have light growers 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.570
 l'epÃ©e to we have him under control 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.570
 of the policy 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.260
 to have already achieved the goal of 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:29.110
 all charged in advance
