too much nitrogen can kill them so we

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.910 
too much nitrogen can kill them so we

meal<00:00:56.420> now<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.540> we<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.780> ready<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.110> fertilize

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
meal now when we get ready to fertilize

meal now when we get ready to fertilize
the<00:00:58.830> first<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.820> rake<00:01:00.150> back<00:01:00.450> all

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
the first thing I do is rake back all

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.600 
the first thing I do is rake back all
the<00:01:00.870> mulch<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.380> I've<00:01:01.530> already<00:01:01.710> done<00:01:02.040> this<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
the mulch and I've already done this and

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.189 
the mulch and I've already done this and
you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.880> see<00:01:03.090> I've<00:01:03.210> done<00:01:03.240> it<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> fairly

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you can see I've done it for a fairly

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.399 
you can see I've done it for a fairly
large<00:01:04.530> area<00:01:04.890> around<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> plant<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
large area around the plant and then I

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
large area around the plant and then I
just<00:01:07.770> gently<00:01:08.310> loosen<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> soil<00:01:10.490> with<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> rake

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
just gently loosen the soil with a rake

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.360 
just gently loosen the soil with a rake
and<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:13.230> just<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> loosen<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:14.010> souks<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
and that's just to loosen the souks I

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.180 
and that's just to loosen the souks I
want<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.610> work<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> fertilizer<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.870> here<00:01:16.290> now

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
want to work the fertilizer in here now

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.390 
want to work the fertilizer in here now
we<00:01:17.250> apply<00:01:17.490> our<00:01:17.970> fertilizer<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:19.230> three<00:01:20.040> parts

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
we apply our fertilizer in three parts

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.110 
we apply our fertilizer in three parts
during<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.120> season<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.970> we're<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
during the season and so we're going to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.820 
during the season and so we're going to
actually<00:01:24.330> put<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> fairly<00:01:25.140> small<00:01:25.500> amount

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
actually put on a fairly small amount

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520 
actually put on a fairly small amount
this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.400> enough<00:01:26.700> fertilizer<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:28.080> treat<00:01:28.350> my

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
this is enough fertilizer to treat my

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.120 
this is enough fertilizer to treat my
whole<00:01:29.159> row<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.580> blueberries<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:31.440> three

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
whole row of blueberries here at three

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.500 
whole row of blueberries here at three
different<00:01:32.460> times<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> year<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
different times in the year I'm going to

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.420 
different times in the year I'm going to
break<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:33.840> into<00:01:34.080> three<00:01:34.320> applications<00:01:35.010> once

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
break this into three applications once

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
break this into three applications once
made<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:36.120> at<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.510> start<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> growing

season

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.490 
season
that's<00:01:38.580> another<00:01:39.299> third<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.049> fertilizer

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that's another third of that fertilizer

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's another third of that fertilizer
will<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.890> applied<00:01:41.220> after<00:01:41.549> fruit<00:01:42.420> set<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> then

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
will be applied after fruit set and then

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.620 
will be applied after fruit set and then
the<00:01:43.409> final<00:01:43.830> third<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> fall<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.510> we

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the final third in the fall and when we

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810 
the final third in the fall and when we
apply<00:01:45.750> our<00:01:46.140> fertilizer<00:01:46.610> we're<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.760> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
apply our fertilizer we're going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.930 
apply our fertilizer we're going to
gently<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:49.350> spread<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.830> around<00:01:50.010> what's

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
gently just spread it around what's

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.730 
gently just spread it around what's
called<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> drip<00:01:51.690> line<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.260> tree<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
called the drip line of the tree and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.620 
called the drip line of the tree and
that's<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.670> drip<00:01:53.850> line<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.240> plant<00:01:54.479> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that's the drip line on the plant is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090 
that's the drip line on the plant is
where<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.900> branching<00:01:55.500> ends<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:55.979> going

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
where the branching ends and we're going

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.460 
where the branching ends and we're going
to<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.330> foot<00:01:57.780> outward<00:01:58.260> so

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
to go there and then a foot outward so

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.830 
to go there and then a foot outward so
you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.799> how<00:01:58.950> far<00:01:59.280> away<00:01:59.540> we're<00:02:00.540> going

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you can see how far away we're going

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.719 
different watering needs our lawns tend
to<00:04:12.930> be<00:04:13.079> much<00:04:13.620> heavier<00:04:13.889> feeders<00:04:14.400> than<00:04:14.609> our

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729

to be much heavier feeders than our
fruit<00:04:15.060> trees<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.629> in<00:04:16.259> fact<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:17.039> tend<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.400> be

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
fruit trees and in fact they tend to be

fruit trees and in fact they tend to be
over<00:04:18.000> fertilized<00:04:18.570> more<00:04:19.199> than<00:04:19.409> they<00:04:19.530> are<00:04:19.560> under

over fertilized more than they are under

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.279 
over fertilized more than they are under
fertilized<00:04:20.519> because<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.389> treat<00:04:21.630> our<00:04:21.750> lawn<00:04:21.930> so
