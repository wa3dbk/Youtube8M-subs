00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 if you are falling behind your shoulders and top 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.189
 part of the chest and you want with this something 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:18.119
 do and handle then this video tutorial 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:21.720
 look carefully for you very often 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.090
 I notice the athletes losing their shoulders 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 lag behind upper chest why 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.800
 This happens when an athlete is trained. 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.180
 chest muscles and doing such exercises 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.090
 as bench press lying layout with dumbbells 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.629
 push-ups from the bars basically everything 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.079
 exercises they are aimed at training 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 the middle part of the chest and the bottom is admissible 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.469
 lim bench press on horizontal 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.649
 bench this whole chest works but 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.480
 mainly central part 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.469
 push-up from bars this is the lower part 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.650
 dumbbell bench layout 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.460
 this is also our middle part 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.470
 and side how to train the top 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 part well I noticed of course we do 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.780
 exercise such as bench press lying under 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.820
 corner or dumbbells 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.680
 five approaches made sort of in 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.570
 probros and continue to train the pectoral muscles 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.020
 Naturally this area is very strong 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.759
 behind me to fix it all 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.880
 I suggest you do so as not 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.790
 prompted once upon a time in our 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.060
 the city of Tolyatti came Yuri Vlasov 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.340
 I was lucky to see him 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.950
 of course asked me this was the most 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.229
 sore subject he says barbell press 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.630
 it is desirable to do at an angle that is in 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.950
 the moment I train I don't 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.590
 doing bench press lying on a horizontal 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.000
 bowls i only do barbell press 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.869
 go to the corner, that is, I always 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.750
 I work for this area 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.120
 also in this exercise trains 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.590
 anterior bundle deltoid muscle well and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.050
 Of course the top 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:27.280
 upper pectoral muscles 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.010
