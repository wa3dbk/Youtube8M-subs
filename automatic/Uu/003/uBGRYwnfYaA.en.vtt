necessarily a bad thing I prefer the
practical<00:05:09.810> aspects<00:05:10.200> of<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.560> as<00:05:10.740> do<00:05:11.010> most

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
practical aspects of it as do most

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.150 
practical aspects of it as do most
people<00:05:11.610> but<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:12.810> makes<00:05:13.110> me<00:05:13.290> enjoy<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.890> theory

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
people but it makes me enjoy the theory

00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:49.119 
I feel like this is where should be I

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:50.790 
I feel like this is where should be I
mean<00:05:49.509> I<00:05:49.599> was<00:05:49.749> I<00:05:49.930> wasn't<00:05:50.199> a<00:05:50.229> tedious<00:05:50.499> or

much like heaps leaps and bounds better

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.929 
much like heaps leaps and bounds better
it's<00:05:59.379> not<00:05:59.529> what<00:05:59.680> I<00:05:59.710> expected<00:05:59.770> it's<00:06:00.610> better

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:00.939 
it's not what I expected it's better

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.930 
it's not what I expected it's better
than<00:06:01.029> I<00:06:01.149> expected

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940
