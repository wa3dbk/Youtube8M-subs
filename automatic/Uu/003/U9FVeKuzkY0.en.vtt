whole outfit we decided to keep the hair

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.160 
whole outfit we decided to keep the hair
flowy<00:00:58.100> because<00:00:59.090> we<00:00:59.510> thought<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.810> outfit<00:01:00.140> was

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
flowy because we thought the outfit was

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.560 
flowy because we thought the outfit was
quite<00:01:00.530> simple<00:01:01.070> we<00:01:04.180> paired<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.269> with<00:01:05.329> this

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
quite simple we paired it with this

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.770 
quite simple we paired it with this
purple<00:01:06.079> bag<00:01:06.520> because<00:01:07.520> there<00:01:07.970> was<00:01:08.119> purple<00:01:08.570> in

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
purple bag because there was purple in

purple bag because there was purple in
the<00:01:08.960> belt<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.409> we<00:01:09.560> thought<00:01:09.770> we<00:01:09.950> could<00:01:09.979> just

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
the belt and we thought we could just

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.270 
the belt and we thought we could just
add<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.850> nice<00:01:11.090> pop<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.390> color<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:15.040> then<00:01:16.040> we

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
add a nice pop of color and then we

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.530 
add a nice pop of color and then we
decided<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:17.000> add<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.210> print<00:01:17.689> in<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.110> shoes

adding<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.630> print<00:01:20.870> in<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.110> shoes<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.590> always<00:01:21.860> a

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
adding a print in the shoes is always a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.480 
adding a print in the shoes is always a
simple<00:01:22.370> way<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.550> give<00:01:22.909> your<00:01:22.940> outfit<00:01:23.510> an<00:01:23.690> extra

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
detail kind of quite unexpected this

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.730 
detail kind of quite unexpected this
first<00:01:32.570> look<00:01:32.780> would<00:01:32.990> be<00:01:33.110> for<00:01:33.350> somebody<00:01:33.530> that

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
first look would be for somebody that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.100 
first look would be for somebody that
isn't<00:01:34.100> quite<00:01:34.430> sure<00:01:34.850> if<00:01:34.880> they<00:01:35.330> want<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.720> play

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.070 
isn't quite sure if they want to play
with<00:01:36.350> patterns<00:01:37.299> but<00:01:38.299> it's<00:01:38.540> still<00:01:38.780> something

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
with patterns but it's still something

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:52.940 
with patterns but it's still something
that<00:01:39.260> anybody<00:01:39.590> can<00:01:39.950> do

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.700 

tip<00:01:53.549> number<00:01:53.789> two<00:01:53.969> use<00:01:54.659> patterns<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.439> won't

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
tip number two use patterns that won't

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.050 
tip number two use patterns that won't
compete<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.280> another<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.939> our

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
compete with one another so for our

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.240 
compete with one another so for our
second<00:02:00.450> look<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.049> decided<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:01.799> two

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
second look we decided to use two

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.779 
second look we decided to use two
completely<00:02:02.850> different<00:02:03.420> patterns<00:02:04.670> for<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
completely different patterns for the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.080 
completely different patterns for the
shirt<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.110> nice<00:02:07.469> brown<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.580> black

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
shirt we have this nice brown and black

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.160 
shirt we have this nice brown and black
kind<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.610> splotchy<00:02:11.610> pattern<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.599> for<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
kind of splotchy pattern and for the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.610 
kind of splotchy pattern and for the
jacket<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.739> use<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.160> nice<00:02:14.510> big<00:02:15.510> floral<00:02:16.080> print

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.930 

these<00:02:19.620> patterns<00:02:19.950> won't<00:02:20.400> compete<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:20.910> each

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
these patterns won't compete with each

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.830 
these patterns won't compete with each
other<00:02:21.180> because<00:02:21.480> they're<00:02:21.900> complete<00:02:22.440> opposites

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.509 

we<00:02:27.840> tied<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.080> together<00:02:28.349> with<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.830> nice<00:02:29.099> green

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:39.620 
we tied it together with a nice green
pair<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:29.970> shorts<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:37.700> then<00:02:38.700> for<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> bag<00:02:39.329> we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
pair of shorts and then for the bag we

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.699 
pair of shorts and then for the bag we
just<00:02:39.870> use<00:02:40.079> this<00:02:40.670> quilted<00:02:42.049> side<00:02:43.049> bag<00:02:43.410> which<00:02:43.680> is

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
in the same color family and then we

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
in the same color family and then we
decided<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.920> pair<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.670> nice<00:02:54.000> pair<00:02:54.329> of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510

wedges<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.019> were<00:02:55.290> Brown<00:02:56.150> because<00:02:57.150> there's

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
wedges that were Brown because there's

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.160 
wedges that were Brown because there's
brown<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.019> top<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.760> subtle<00:03:00.049> hints<00:03:01.049> of

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.270 

because<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.260> thought<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.740> prince<00:03:13.010> or<00:03:13.190> a

little bit louder in this outfit we

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.110
