00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:11.110
 Yes Hello everyone courted is to go in only affect the roundabout when turning a curve 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:14.139
 I will talk to you to stop 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.039
 I tried to write a curve left course 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:23.810
 It's like a car coming and it's coming 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:29.930
 Do not let lawmakers enter when you turn left when you turn at the school 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.740
 But I think I learned in that but please not enter in as much as possible Thus curve to the left 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.590
 Well 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.579
 Even if you say that you do this again to driving beginners, it is quite difficult in reality 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.860
 There 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:49.300
 It is why and say when I vehicle sense is why the curve is tight enough're According to the inside 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:54.160
 It means that you will not be able to turn if you do not hold firmly 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.760
 I think that he does not intend to do so, but by all means go outside 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.450
 End up 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:04.780
 I would like to get 8 substitute cars for the course from the middle 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.780
 It is there I can say further from there 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.080
 As Yes er There are aircraft line and want to run through the version of the course 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:21.360
 Even though I have an image like that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 The timing to cut out The straight line to the straight line if you can not have confidence very much 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.170
 After all, even though I should I cut out the handle over a period of a little insurance if there is no self-confidence 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.909
 To say that you want 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.909
 It's not straight, yes 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:47.760
 Nevertheless if you shake a lot below before reaching here 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.810
 There are a lot of people running around the city with people who get bent with guns 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.530
 Then it is only devilitt 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.530
 Why ? 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.970
 Yes but what it is not facing the outside at this point 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.130
 You bother yourself 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.130
 90 degree curve 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:17.640
 If you have more calf 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:22.110
 Multiplied by the insurance will it further does not itself say that have interest extra tight curve 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.340
 I think you are going around there 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.720
 Why are you not confident 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.720
 At this point 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 This line is not self-confident 5 timing 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:41.819
 Whether it is 5 for good beginning to turn the steering wheel do not know people 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.220
 I want to put the car on the side 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:52.390
 It is a bother at this point 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:59.210
 Say whether the line of the timing of the order to match the beating tightly to quite right is reading 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:05.069
 It says because that is more difficult the selection of this line 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:08.159
 So you are the one who has done this roundabout 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.849
 If it was about to go with suction from here 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:16.530
 It turns out a little different from the teachings of the driving school 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:20.150
 It is fine during or jealous outside even Well 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.720
 A line that enters from there 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.270
 Until 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:36.090
 We are in immediately proceed 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:36.090
 Even at this time, it is better to put in the middle with the direction changed a little . 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:46.050
 But please be aware of the dangers well 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.819
 winger is I guess as soon as possible their own there is a place here 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.960
 Around 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:04:00.750
 I will inform you and I will win the brakes well 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:04.730
 At the same time , the direction is gradually changed to the moon slowly entering the curve gradually 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.150
 I of course from the driver's seat 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:18.049
 Although I have eyes where I am looking at the many faces over here get by perfectly well anymore skewer 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:23.000
 by Puga went in because whether or not come is that before from before reaching here Gane 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:26.510
 Also to reduce the rate of tension in the curve 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.310
 Since I am here, I have already given my fellow bikers 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:37.440
 Have a look and use the side mirror to look around with a mirror etc. 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.620
 When asked to concentrate on the curve 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.290
 To say 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.919
 It entered to lick suddenly on the inside who that is difficult than Tteyuu carbon bend row 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:53.150
 Ne 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:55.770
 If I open it for a while, I will open it, and I will not go to the outside from the outset 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.490
 About to change 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:06.030
 Is it better to go in while cutting it ? 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:07.680
 Please remember one as a way to be turned safely without making a big turn 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.020
 I would like 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.020
