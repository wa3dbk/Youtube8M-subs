00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
working on my technique this could be

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.400 
working on my technique this could be
weird<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:41.700> finding<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.149> how<00:00:42.930> best<00:00:43.200> works

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
weird just finding out how best works

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
weird just finding out how best works
for<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.210> let's<00:00:45.210> watch<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.750> some

so<00:02:12.630> technique-wise<00:02:13.380> swing<00:02:14.040> wise<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:15.000> is

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
so technique-wise swing wise this is

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.990 
so technique-wise swing wise this is
what<00:02:15.209> I'm<00:02:15.300> looking<00:02:15.450> at<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.930> measure<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.380> out<00:02:17.000> so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
what I'm looking at I measure it out so

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.759 
what I'm looking at I measure it out so
that<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.180> know<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.690> my<00:02:18.720> swing<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.080> gonna<00:02:19.320> be<00:02:19.530> I

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
that I know what my swing is gonna be I

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.479 
that I know what my swing is gonna be I
aim<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:20.700> coming<00:02:21.120> up<00:02:21.290> for<00:02:22.290> 12<00:02:22.530> o'clock<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
bringing it down the other way to do it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.930 
bringing it down the other way to do it
like<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> find<00:02:30.800> no<00:02:31.800> matter<00:02:32.519> how<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> do

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
like this but I find no matter how I do

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.710 
like this but I find no matter how I do
it<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.360> pause<00:02:34.040> right<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.510> prefer

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
it I pause right here so I prefer

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.570

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
bringing it so I figure if I'm gonna

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.949 
bringing it so I figure if I'm gonna
pause<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> might<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> little<00:02:39.269> start<00:02:39.750> they're
