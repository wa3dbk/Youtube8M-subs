00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello people I hope you are fine 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.850
 I have something extraordinary today 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.649
 for you in my scene tips and indeed 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
 Let's have a look at a homepage 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.740
 I am often asked how best 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 find out when and where a public 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.180
 event starts and we'll see 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.180
 Now, yes, there is a small one for that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 but more practical homepage and that shows 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.890
 exactly on which planet in 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 which region when an event starts 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.040
 maybe we should first briefly 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.809
 look what the benefits or what you guys 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.010
 the public 7 public events at all 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.309
 bring that here it is also quite 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.239
 Well listed and one 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.940
 public event always gives you a reputation 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.850
 and public wenz guarantee you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.789
 also every time marks for the vanguard and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.390
 though when you reach gold in the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.660
 public event, there are four brands for 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.789
 silver 3 and 4 bronze two marks and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.920
 the first partial wins her 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.280
 a day will make you 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.670
 Postmaster on the tower a packet 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.500
 send 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.729
 and there are either essentials 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 wind energy or strange points so 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.250
 Ate the fragments of energy or 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.310
 even a coin and yes you can 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.110
 level your equipment and 6 o'clock if he does 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.079
 because on Fridays there are a few 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 buy nice things 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.590
 besides, you still might have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.610
 a pension opportunity at the conclusion of a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.750
 public events too that I too off 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.060
 talents break pieces and let the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 energy is coming, we let it look 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.820
 Now this time completely this here 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:53.850
 very briefly the side and indeed 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.170
 it works like this you look 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.000
 janz because of snowy on the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.439
 earth then you see a listing that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.170
 is unfortunately in English but you 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.399
 Yes, I think the English terms 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.480
 and at us church about one card 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.160
 orientate 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.630
 for example here now in a minute 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 starts a paper wins in the far 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.000
 So in the gap and here are also what 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.520
 you are expected there in the fall will be in 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.230
 to defeat a minute of the devil walker 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.450
 his 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.270
 the public events listed here 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.350
 are based on the thumb 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.180
 high thumb down because she changes more often 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.910
 times the algorithm with the public 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.350
 events start and thus the relative 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.350
 It just always stays the same 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.610
 If you have made a public event 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.040
 and that was right at the moment 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.450
 at the place where it was great here 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.370
 Best thumbs up 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.290
 then this homepage knows that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.660
 the algorithm is right and so on 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.200
 The times will be more exact on this 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.590
 homepage 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 So if you have the times indicated 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.280
 in my opinion but mine 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.660
 experience after that differ 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.170
 they divide themselves from what they do 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.090
 indicated is about three to four 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.250
 minutes later really in the game instead 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.940
 So are a window of three to 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.630
 four minutes 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.930
 that is now called up here on the stairs 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.400
 The stairs will not be in the event 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.560
 exactly one minute in the rule 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.820
 take place but in about three to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 four minutes so have enough time 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.910
 to go only in theory there to 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.020
 start to make the event and the 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.470
 to collect flowers for that was yes 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.250
 my short a short presentation 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.720
 please write me the comments 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.489
 whether for you, we work that 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.350
 we have always handled that or 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.000
 is eliminated and above all things 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.200
 If I have several pages in the future 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.790
 there are still some to be imagined 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.890
 other nice if you have a little bit 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.630
 what you want to see outside of the game then 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.400
 she writes again in the comments and 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.850
 we see you at the next video again 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.850
 take care
