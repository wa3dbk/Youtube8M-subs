then<00:02:52.070> they<00:02:52.250> remove<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.910> yolk<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.420> see<00:02:53.840> here

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
then they remove this yolk you see here

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.680 
then they remove this yolk you see here
which<00:02:54.770> is<00:02:54.920> primarily<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.820> lot<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.240> copper

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
which is primarily a lot of copper

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.510 
which is primarily a lot of copper
something<00:02:57.380> look<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.800> container<00:02:58.280> that's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
something look this container that's

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.610 
something look this container that's
filled<00:02:58.760> with<00:02:58.850> these<00:02:59.120> yolks<00:02:59.480> here's<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.500> good

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
filled with these yolks here's a good

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.070 
filled with these yolks here's a good
one<00:03:00.830> look<00:03:01.459> at<00:03:01.610> all<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.940> wire<00:03:02.360> that's<00:03:02.870> in

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
one look at all that wire that's in

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.870 
one look at all that wire that's in
there<00:03:03.320> all<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.830> copper<00:03:04.250> wire<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.700> there

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
there all that copper wire in there

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.550 
there all that copper wire in there
that's<00:03:05.120> really<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> great<00:03:05.780> natural<00:03:05.990> resource

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
that's really a great natural resource

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.650 
that's really a great natural resource
what<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.160> shame<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.490> would<00:03:07.760> be<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.150> lace<00:03:08.390> that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
what a shame it would be to lace that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.210 
what a shame it would be to lace that
natural<00:03:09.080> work<00:03:09.290> by<00:03:09.470> pulling<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.920> into<00:03:10.040> a

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
natural work by pulling it into a

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.699 
natural work by pulling it into a
landfill<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.300> we<00:03:11.420> removed<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.020> yolk<00:03:12.230> that's

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
landfill so we removed the yolk that's

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.620 
landfill so we removed the yolk that's
all<00:03:12.980> gone<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.550> you're<00:03:14.030> left<00:03:14.239> with<00:03:14.510> the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
all gone and you're left with the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.170 
all gone and you're left with the
cathode<00:03:15.050> ray<00:03:15.320> tube<00:03:15.620> itself<00:03:16.100> now<00:03:16.670> it's<00:03:16.790> really

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
cathode ray tube itself now it's really

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
cathode ray tube itself now it's really
really<00:03:17.570> heavy

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
really heavy

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.350 
really heavy
mainly<00:03:18.800> because<00:03:18.920> there's<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.430> lot<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.640> lead<00:03:20.090> and

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
mainly because there's a lot of lead and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.199 
mainly because there's a lot of lead and
glass<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.350> tube<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:22.370> they<00:03:22.550> are<00:03:22.790> going<00:03:23.090> to

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
glass in this tube so they are going to

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.449 
glass in this tube so they are going to
send<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> company<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.770> will<00:03:24.920> separate

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
send this to a company it will separate

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.690 
send this to a company it will separate
the<00:03:25.640> two<00:03:25.820> materials<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.720> recycle<00:03:27.560> both<00:03:27.830> now

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
the two materials and recycle both now

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.650 
the two materials and recycle both now
that<00:03:28.940> means<00:03:29.270> us<00:03:29.540> with<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:32.209> interesting

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
that means us with all this interesting

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.160 
that means us with all this interesting
stuff<00:03:33.410> here<00:03:33.739> which<00:03:34.430> goes<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.790> into<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.959> rest

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
stuff here which goes on into the rest

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.080 
stuff here which goes on into the rest
of<00:03:36.350> our<00:03:36.440> process<00:03:36.950> here<00:03:37.220> at<00:03:37.340> peace<00:03:37.580> here<00:03:37.970> in

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
of our process here at peace here in

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.729 
of our process here at peace here in
Edmonton<00:03:38.270> for<00:03:38.750> further<00:03:38.959> recycling<00:03:39.590> and

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
Edmonton for further recycling and

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.640 
Edmonton for further recycling and
separation

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.430 

ok<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:46.090> now<00:03:46.269> we've<00:03:46.480> got<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.870> guts<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.319> these

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
ok so now we've got the guts of these

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.500 
ok so now we've got the guts of these
machines<00:03:47.920> things<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.580> circuit<00:03:49.090> boards

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
machines things like circuit boards

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.140 
machines things like circuit boards
switches<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.349> wires<00:03:50.409> and<00:03:50.830> stuff<00:03:51.159> we<00:03:52.000> need<00:03:52.090> to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
switches and wires and stuff we need to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.149 
switches and wires and stuff we need to
break<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.599> kind<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.930> stuff<00:03:53.140> apart<00:03:53.470> even<00:03:53.920> more

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
break this kind of stuff apart even more

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.699 
break this kind of stuff apart even more
and<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.940> way<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:55.239> do<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.720> you've<00:03:56.440> got<00:03:56.590> this

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
and the way we do that you've got this

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.220 
and the way we do that you've got this
straight<00:03:57.069> big<00:03:57.370> heavy<00:03:57.670> chain<00:03:58.120> it's<00:03:59.019> even

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
straight big heavy chain it's even

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.229 
straight big heavy chain it's even
longer<00:03:59.530> it's<00:03:59.920> inside<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.519> building<00:04:01.060> behind

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
longer it's inside this building behind

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.970 
longer it's inside this building behind
me<00:04:01.599> they're<00:04:01.810> called<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.230> chains<00:04:02.530> shredder

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
me they're called the chains shredder

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.220 
me they're called the chains shredder
and<00:04:03.250> big<00:04:03.849> long<00:04:04.120> length<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.720> chain<00:04:04.750> like<00:04:05.200> this

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
and big long length of chain like this

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.759 
and big long length of chain like this
rotate<00:04:06.239> really<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:07.659> fast<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.260> high<00:04:08.500> high

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
rotate really really fast and high high

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.119 
rotate really really fast and high high
speed<00:04:09.659> smash<00:04:10.659> this<00:04:10.959> material<00:04:11.530> apart

speed smash this material apart
smash<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.940> apart<00:04:13.269> so<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:14.049> they<00:04:14.230> can<00:04:14.379> break<00:04:14.530> it

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
smash it apart so that they can break it

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.770 
smash it apart so that they can break it
apart<00:04:14.769> for<00:04:15.519> further<00:04:15.760> recycling<00:04:16.419> down<00:04:16.600> the

apart for further recycling down the
road

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.970 

let's<00:04:22.420> go<00:04:22.540> beat<00:04:22.750> up<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.110> piece<00:04:23.350> of<00:04:23.530> metal<00:04:23.650> is

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
let's go beat up that piece of metal is

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.130 
let's go beat up that piece of metal is
the<00:04:24.910> first<00:04:25.150> thing<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.360> happens<00:04:25.750> after<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
the first thing that happens after it

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.230 
the first thing that happens after it
comes<00:04:26.320> out<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.800> change<00:04:27.100> shredder<00:04:27.490> is<00:04:27.790> an

comes out of a change shredder is an

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.600 
comes out of a change shredder is an
electromagnet<00:04:29.140> removes<00:04:29.830> all<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.250> ferrous

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
electromagnet removes all the ferrous

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.700 
electromagnet removes all the ferrous
material<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.450> stuff<00:04:31.690> that's<00:04:31.930> magnetic<00:04:32.560> and

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
material the stuff that's magnetic and

material the stuff that's magnetic and
removed<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.220> way<00:04:33.540> it<00:04:34.540> goes<00:04:34.840> up<00:04:35.140> this

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
removed that way it goes up this

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.620 
removed that way it goes up this

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.650 

once<00:04:49.620> we<00:04:49.770> remove<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.250> ferrous<00:04:50.580> material<00:04:51.180> we

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
once we remove the ferrous material we

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.140 
once we remove the ferrous material we
also<00:04:51.840> remove<00:04:52.490> aluminum<00:04:53.490> through<00:04:53.730> something
