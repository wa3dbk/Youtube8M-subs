water decals and I'm I use a white
design<00:01:12.619> there<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.780> help<00:01:16.729> here<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
design there is that my help here it is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.999 
design there is that my help here it is
a<00:01:18.390> film<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:20.100> aside<00:01:20.630> now<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.680> black

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
a film I put aside now you can see black

a film I put aside now you can see black
as<00:01:23.610> wells<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.610> half<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.770> little

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
as wells on this half of the little

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.460 
as wells on this half of the little
sheet<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.400> actually<00:01:31.729> same<00:01:32.729> designs<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:34.200> in

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
sheet it's actually same designs but in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.460 
sheet it's actually same designs but in
white<00:01:35.689> so<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:37.409> I'll<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:38.420> I'll<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.450> cut<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
white so what I'll do I'll just cut a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.910 
white so what I'll do I'll just cut a
piece<00:01:41.210> with<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.450> water<00:01:42.750> decals<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.710> don't

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
piece with these water decals you don't

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.780 
piece with these water decals you don't
have<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.460> cut<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.560> piece<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.619> very<00:01:47.220> very<00:01:47.430> close

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
have to cut a piece that very very close

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.010 
have to cut a piece that very very close
to<00:01:48.060> design<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> quite<00:01:49.950> roughly

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
to design you can do it quite roughly

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.920 
to design you can do it quite roughly
because<00:01:52.020> design<00:01:52.740> actually<00:01:54.890> exactly<00:01:56.600> shape<00:01:57.600> of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
because design actually exactly shape of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.750 
because design actually exactly shape of
the<00:01:59.299> swirls

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
the swirls

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.600 
the swirls
we'll<00:02:02.510> drop<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.200> water<00:02:03.400> which<00:02:04.400> is

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
we'll drop it in the water which is

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.920 
we'll drop it in the water which is
somewhere<00:02:05.000> there<00:02:06.820> for<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.850> few<00:02:08.060> seconds<00:02:08.540> my

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
somewhere there for a few seconds my

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.290 
somewhere there for a few seconds my
water<00:02:09.200> probably<00:02:09.620> cooled<00:02:10.010> down<00:02:10.190> by<00:02:10.520> now<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.970> like

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
water probably cooled down by now I like

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.740 
water probably cooled down by now I like
to<00:02:11.540> use<00:02:11.780> pretty<00:02:12.770> warm<00:02:13.070> not<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.970> whole<00:02:14.300> but<00:02:14.540> very

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
to use pretty warm not a whole but very

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.180 
to use pretty warm not a whole but very
warm<00:02:14.990> water<00:02:15.170> because<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.980> speeds<00:02:16.340> up<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:18.190> decal

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
warm water because it speeds up of decal

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.490 
warm water because it speeds up of decal
to<00:02:19.240> separate<00:02:22.180> or<00:02:23.180> maybe<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.890> use<00:02:26.500> white

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
to separate or maybe I can use white

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.470 
to separate or maybe I can use white
design<00:02:28.210> we<00:02:29.210> can<00:02:29.420> put<00:02:29.690> our<00:02:29.960> two<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.590> them<00:02:31.480> same

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
design we can put our two of them same

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.400 
design we can put our two of them same
thing

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.790 

cut<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.560> roughly<00:02:40.070> around<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.030> edges<00:02:41.620> drop<00:02:42.620> in

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
cut it roughly around the edges drop in

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.240 
cut it roughly around the edges drop in
the<00:02:42.890> water<00:02:43.420> by<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.480> stage<00:02:45.050> first<00:02:45.680> probably

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the water by this stage first probably

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.190 
the water by this stage first probably
would<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.820> ready<00:02:48.400> hope<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.550> can<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.200> on

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
would be ready hope you can see it on

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.360 
would be ready hope you can see it on
the<00:02:51.890> bottom

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.240 

I<00:03:01.670> will<00:03:02.670> hold<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:03.120> by<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.330> edge<00:03:04.040> with<00:03:05.040> my

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
I will hold it by the edge with my

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.320 
I will hold it by the edge with my
fingers<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.959> my<00:03:07.170> sharp<00:03:07.500> tweezers<00:03:08.330> I'll

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
fingers and with my sharp tweezers I'll

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.520 
fingers and with my sharp tweezers I'll
just<00:03:09.780> slide<00:03:10.170> actual<00:03:10.860> design<00:03:11.310> off<00:03:12.379> there<00:03:13.379> you

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
just slide actual design off there you

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.399 
just slide actual design off there you
go<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:15.829> was<00:03:17.120> smartly<00:03:18.120> tap<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.629> with<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> paper

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
go I was smartly tap it with a paper

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.920 
go I was smartly tap it with a paper
towel<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:21.680> it's<00:03:22.680> ready<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.239> now<00:03:24.239> remember

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
towel and it's ready to go now remember

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.740 
towel and it's ready to go now remember
with<00:03:25.530> gel<00:03:25.829> polishes<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.579> still<00:03:26.909> has<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.450> tacky

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
with gel polishes it still has a tacky

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.920 
with gel polishes it still has a tacky
layer<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.470> majority<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.610> times<00:03:29.940> it's

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
layer and majority of the times it's

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.849 
layer and majority of the times it's
very<00:03:31.319> hard<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:32.720> reposition<00:03:33.720> your<00:03:34.109> design<00:03:34.500> once

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
very hard to reposition your design once
