00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello this is our world of 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.849
 Inspiration is first of all happy 2014 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.500
 I wanted to tell you that sorry for having 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.879
 I uploaded videos before but it was a 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.339
 little bundled because between Christmas 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.919
 that comes out is one day that you get another one this 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.960
 it's a little and then the depression 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.350
 post-holiday because he could not sign 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:39.170
 and good that we come back and start another 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:42.140
 Once we start what we are going to need 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.910
 is going to be a corrector of our own 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.489
 skin tone or even a little more 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 clear a lip gloss that if you can 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.810
 be transparent much better if not with 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.820
 let it be a perfect clear tone then 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.520
 a cloth that I used so much 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.309
 in my tutorials that I in this case have 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.989
 caught a led villero because it has the 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.450
 same way as the jar and it comes 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.119
 very well already take advantage and then a 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.170
 cream that is the least fat possible 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.670
 OK 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.670
 and do not forget about patience 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.920
 I explain we take it let's start and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.890
 we take the jar what we are going to do 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.820
 is to remove the concealer and cut a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.740
 small portion that is more or less a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.990
 taquito like this 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.600
 if we see that we need more we arrive 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.689
 then introducing it but good of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.689
 moment a thing like that 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.479
 seriously we are going to apply the cream 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.040
 with your daily cream not the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.770
 problem that we are going to always apply 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.770
 less than the product even if it's like that 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.900
 and then finally on the brightness of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.190
 lips that what you are going to do is fix the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.430
 dough 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.100
 that nothing too very little appreciate 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.490
 that little bit simply 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.340
 it's perfect 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.280
 it's worth the patience I said it because now 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.650
 It is the time to go running around on 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.940
 everything to the concealer so that a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.650
 fairly homogeneous and well mixed 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.650
 so, let's go 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.069
 and so after mixing we have 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.730
 more or less is mass 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.499
 that would be our approval is easy to 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.019
 do and although it seems to you that it is not going to 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.939
 work believe tell me the effect is 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.129
 great that works with a test it 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.889
 normal since in reality what they carry 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.989
 the evidence is usually that corrector 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.459
 that foundation of makeup and then a 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.819
 fixator which is what we have replaced 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.040
 for the brightness and nothing as you know the 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.439
 test 6 to apply it below in the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.499
 eyelid and then apply the shadow to 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.879
 that is fixed and is much thicker and 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.469
 much prettier 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.180
 before finishing I want to show you 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.760
 some examples of how it could be 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.099
 what to find on the net in the first place 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.189
 this would be the result with the test 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.500
 be applied and secondly this 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.780
 would be the result with the base already 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.750
 applied as you see that gives a more tone 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.639
 deep much stronger and it shows more 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.919
 even I from my experience can 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.900
 say that they last a lot longer and not 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.549
 we have to be retouching all day and 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.670
 nothing we had finished this simple 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.620
 video-tutorial 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.390
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.330
 forget to put new suggestions 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.290
 and give it a like to call jobal 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.010
 thank you very much and see you in the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.010
 next video
