00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
obviously the point is make sure you go

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.330 
obviously the point is make sure you go
to<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.030> way<00:01:36.210> around

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.670 

now<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.550> fits<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.540> it's<00:01:46.720> no<00:01:46.870> accident<00:01:47.140> it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
now that fits and it's no accident it

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.950 
now that fits and it's no accident it
fits<00:01:48.010> because<00:01:48.250> when<00:01:48.970> I've<00:01:49.150> measured<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.690> then

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
fits because when I've measured it then

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.440 
fits because when I've measured it then
I'll<00:01:50.080> think<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.500> measuring<00:01:50.890> twice<00:01:51.160> cut<00:01:52.000> once

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
I'll think of measuring twice cut once

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.960 
I'll think of measuring twice cut once
I<00:01:52.570> actually<00:01:52.930> measured<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.590> three<00:01:53.830> times<00:01:54.160> don't

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
I actually measured it three times don't

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.730 
I actually measured it three times don't
have<00:01:55.060> any<00:01:55.210> measurement<00:01:55.810> at<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:55.990> bottom<00:01:56.350> but

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
have any measurement at the bottom but

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.010 
have any measurement at the bottom but
also<00:01:56.950> measurement<00:01:57.790> in<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.000> middle<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.570> at

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
also measurement in the middle and at

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.950

sure<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.110> got<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.830> window<00:02:06.100> size<00:02:06.400> so<00:02:06.760> the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
sure that I got the window size so the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.359 
sure that I got the window size so the
smallest<00:02:07.540> point<00:02:07.870> then<00:02:08.200> we<00:02:08.590> put<00:02:08.830> 5<00:02:09.130> millimeters

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
smallest point then we put 5 millimeters

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.760 
smallest point then we put 5 millimeters
clearance<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.270> or<00:02:10.390> 8<00:02:10.479> either<00:02:10.630> side<00:02:10.840> put<00:02:11.740> a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
clearance in or 8 either side put a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.130 

and<00:02:18.280> now<00:02:18.790> we<00:02:18.850> come<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.180> fixing<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> window

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
and now we come to fixing the window

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.170 
and now we come to fixing the window
there's<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.680> few<00:02:20.920> options<00:02:21.070> here<00:02:21.490> because<00:02:21.970> this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
there's a few options here because this

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.240 
there's a few options here because this
is<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.420> cellar<00:02:22.930> there's<00:02:23.230> no<00:02:23.290> place<00:02:23.470> that's<00:02:23.770> just

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
is a cellar there's no place that's just

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.340 
is a cellar there's no place that's just
there<00:02:24.520> brick<00:02:24.760> walls<00:02:25.030> we're<00:02:25.570> not<00:02:25.720> too<00:02:25.990> worried

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
there brick walls we're not too worried

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.590 
there brick walls we're not too worried
about<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.590> cosmetics<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.210> were<00:02:28.330> fixing

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
about the cosmetics if you were fixing

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.740 
about the cosmetics if you were fixing
into<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.560> plaster<00:02:30.130> wall<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.330> want<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.630> do<00:02:31.720> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
into a plaster wall and you want to do a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.260 
into a plaster wall and you want to do a
safe<00:02:32.080> not<00:02:32.890> having<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.370> check<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.760> plaster

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
safe not having to check the plaster

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.030 
safe not having to check the plaster
around<00:02:34.390> you'd<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.470> try<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.770> get<00:02:35.860> some

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
around you'd have to try and get some

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.620 
around you'd have to try and get some
fixing<00:02:36.430> definitely<00:02:36.820> into<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.060> window<00:02:37.330> itself

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
fixing definitely into the window itself

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.120 
fixing definitely into the window itself
and<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.990> can't<00:02:38.320> drill<00:02:38.740> through<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
and then you can't drill through the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.590 
and then you can't drill through the
sides<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.700> you've<00:02:39.970> got<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.209> spring

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
sides because you've got the spring

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.080 
sides because you've got the spring
balances<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> only<00:02:42.280> way<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.490> do<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.000> to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
balances so the only way to do it is to

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.000 
balances so the only way to do it is to
put<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> plate<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.080> side<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.680> window

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
put a plate on the side of the window

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.280 
put a plate on the side of the window
and<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.700> bring<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:46.330> past<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.020> window

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
and just bring that out past the window

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.620 
and just bring that out past the window
and<00:02:47.500> drive<00:02:48.250> over<00:02:48.310> screw<00:02:49.030> through<00:02:49.300> into<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
and drive over screw through into the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.240 
and drive over screw through into the
wall<00:02:49.840> there<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.920> fill

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
wall there and you just have to fill

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.560 
wall there and you just have to fill
that<00:02:51.280> over<00:02:51.610> with<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.850> little<00:02:52.120> bit<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.330> filler

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
that over with a little bit of filler

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.780 
that over with a little bit of filler
afterwards<00:02:53.140> that's<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.709> fairly<00:02:53.950> common<00:02:54.430> way<00:02:54.670> of

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
afterwards that's a fairly common way of

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.000 
afterwards that's a fairly common way of
doing<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.600> other<00:02:55.750> way<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.290> people<00:02:56.830> like

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
doing it the other way that people like

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.430 
doing it the other way that people like
to<00:02:57.220> do<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.970> with<00:02:58.300> fixify<00:02:59.110> now<00:03:00.090> quick<00:03:01.090> sight

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
specifically advise against using foam

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.630 
specifically advise against using foam
and<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.660> reason<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.590> people<00:03:09.190> go<00:03:09.340> nuts

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
with this fun it's a great stuff expands

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.310 
with this fun it's a great stuff expands
like<00:03:12.220> mad<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.269> whole<00:03:13.450> thing<00:03:13.690> will<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:13.900> in

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
like mad and the whole thing will be in

like mad and the whole thing will be in
there<00:03:14.739> pretty<00:03:15.160> solid<00:03:15.610> when<00:03:15.760> you've<00:03:15.880> done<00:03:16.060> it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
there pretty solid when you've done it

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.600 
there pretty solid when you've done it
but<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.080> trouble<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.530> when<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:18.010> expands

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
but the trouble is that when it expands

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.210 
but the trouble is that when it expands
it<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.330> push<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> window<00:03:20.230> out<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.980> when<00:03:21.130> you

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
it can push the window out so when you

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.770 
it can push the window out so when you
go<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.400> slide<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:21.970> there<00:03:22.269> if<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.420> find<00:03:22.600> that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
go to slide it up there if you find that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.660 
go to slide it up there if you find that
your<00:03:22.930> beautifully<00:03:23.380> sliding<00:03:23.890> window<00:03:24.220> no

on the frame but if you are going to use
foam<00:03:51.620> make<00:03:52.400> sure<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:53.000> brace<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:53.569> frame<00:03:53.870> out<00:03:54.110> so

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
foam make sure to brace the frame out so

joints<00:04:10.310> for<00:04:10.490> the<00:04:10.580> draft<00:04:10.850> might<00:04:11.090> be<00:04:11.270> getting<00:04:11.510> it
