00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.660
 today wanted to talk about the next 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.780
 strategy of such a company as gameplay 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.890
 the game is called Assad we will take 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.949
 a certain amount of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.619
 five warriors who will attack 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.109
 various locks 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.760
 will destroy them game in Russian 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.630
 language requires access to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.439
 the Internet 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.469
 so here we have our team we are in addition to this 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.210
 we can besides these warriors themselves we can 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.430
 use a variety of magical 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.500
 properties let's down below us throwers 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.530
 paper cobblestones at one dragon 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.059
 let's attack we can zoom in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 from the camera we can look at everyone here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.250
 our warriors are our main drag 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.649
 chief commander well, let's attack 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.140
 they are sent to attack like this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.010
 way we can destroy various 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.020
 the buildings of our enemies are attacking 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.719
 destroy so let's using 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.719
 special magic for attention and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 use the dragon to give and shied that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.030
 eat urine and will destroy appears 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.340
 dragon and everyone is waiting in the game as I understand it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 that is, also donat so have it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 in mind and here we come to the main castle 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.840
 Now we will destroy it all 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 at the same time synchronic giving birth 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 the main drag here is the castle and we won 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.530
 The first fight was successful 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.650
 stem various clues and narrative 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.100
 things will tell us beautifully done 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.229
 me 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.600
 I liked the first part of the graphics very much 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.729
 so all qualitatively implemented take away 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.799
 loading screen is also very nicely made 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.140
 so often true there show 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.299
 explain how we build 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.430
 various facilities and more 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.340
 let's see what we have a polygraph 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.860
 will offer ok we can build a gate 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.600
 so they all lined us up what are we 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.990
 what does he run with you here 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.800
 guys so click on the end point 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.690
 to add walls let's add this 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.660
 which one we will build a wall 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.180
 around our this castle which is here 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.100
 so we can rotate not rotate we don't 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.870
 can we rotate so built and so 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.270
 gradually we will equip our 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.960
 dwelling here let's say archers who 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.020
 archers 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.090
 archer towers archers who will be on 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.760
 protect but they have certain levels 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.190
 there is a higher level than the case they are 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 become so gradually we can 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.370
 equip your castle to buy various 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.150
 these are the military camps here 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.340
 attend and what a lag 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.800
 similarly some knights who too 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.600
 will help us here is cool 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.700
 interesting game she somehow reminds on 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.550
 boom bitch if you played this game and 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.440
 like clash of clans i have something in myself 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.989
 clans never played well how did 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.940
 review never fan cage but I know 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.550
 that they are very very popular and think 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.950
 the game will be very popular too 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.680
 let's see what we and the game 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.660
 will offer in the answer various hints 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.459
 appear look at the mission on here 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.550
 it was again attacking someone and 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.070
 someone to destroy well, I think the problems here 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.050
 will not arise just average for the fight and 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.830
 destroy all so here is the food and to 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.330
 the presence that we can with you 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.390
 collect yes we destroy them various 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.160
 supplies and this food adds alkey to us 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.410
 also mom and by the way new squads 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.959
 which we have ahead and rush in 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.610
 fight destroy let's break a plus 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.650
 The advantage is the graphics do not seem 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.409
 Russian language well 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.079
 risk is our strategy strategy strategy 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.909
 about him here of course donat well someone to play 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.920
 may not like it because gameplay 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.620
 and very often releases very similar 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.780
 the game is no different and pumping is given 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.879
 what is pumping money using donat 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.590
 that's such a cool strategy for which 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.540
 Today I want to tell you was 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.459
 android android put this mushroom 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.150
