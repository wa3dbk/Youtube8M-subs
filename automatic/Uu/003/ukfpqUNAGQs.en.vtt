00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
the screen I can understand that because

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.680 
the screen I can understand that because
now<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.910> have<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.120> click<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.420> screen

deposit<00:02:41.349> but<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:41.830> don't<00:02:42.040> really<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.519> it's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
deposit but I don't really think it's

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.030 
deposit but I don't really think it's
necessary<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.599> be<00:02:43.989> showing<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.470> pause<00:02:44.650> play

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
necessary to be showing the pause play

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.370 
necessary to be showing the pause play
button<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.549> my<00:02:45.760> opinion<00:02:46.090> because<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.080> kind<00:02:47.260> of

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380
