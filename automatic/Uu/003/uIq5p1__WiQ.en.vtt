00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.350 
really good for then I mean that's the
best<00:04:38.979> part<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.310> plan<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.760> bulb<00:04:39.970> really

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
best part of the plan is the bulb really

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.180 
best part of the plan is the bulb really
if<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.930> eat<00:04:41.050> them<00:04:41.169> raw<00:04:41.349> this<00:04:41.830> here<00:04:42.160> is

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
if you eat them raw this here is

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.219 
if you eat them raw this here is
obviously<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.789> leaves<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:43.930> how<00:04:44.050> would<00:04:44.110> you

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
obviously the leaves so how would you

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.620 
obviously the leaves so how would you
use<00:04:44.349> the<00:04:44.770> lows<00:04:44.979> obviously<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.180> cut<00:04:46.389> them<00:04:46.510> up

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
use the lows obviously to cut them up

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.469 
use the lows obviously to cut them up
and<00:04:46.690> I<00:04:47.169> mean<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:47.979> can<00:04:48.370> use<00:04:48.550> them<00:04:48.729> just<00:04:48.940> when

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
and I mean you can use them just when

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.930 
and I mean you can use them just when
dad<00:04:49.810> likes<00:04:50.050> us<00:04:50.260> off<00:04:50.440> their<00:04:51.190> cap<00:04:51.400> mother<00:04:51.610> pair

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
dad likes us off their cap mother pair

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.850 
dad likes us off their cap mother pair
scissors<00:04:52.210> or<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.720> knife<00:04:52.810> or<00:04:53.020> whatever<00:04:53.590> sort

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
scissors or a knife or whatever sort

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.760 
scissors or a knife or whatever sort
think<00:04:54.070> uh<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:55.870> can<00:04:55.990> either<00:04:56.110> dry<00:04:56.410> them<00:04:56.620> out

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
think uh you can either dry them out

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.100 
think uh you can either dry them out
which<00:04:57.669> is<00:04:57.849> why<00:04:58.210> I'm<00:04:58.270> going<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.539> explain<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.020> you

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
which is why I'm going to explain to you

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.390 
which is why I'm going to explain to you
anyway<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.560> mean<00:04:59.889> if<00:04:59.949> you're<00:05:00.070> hanging<00:05:00.160> upside

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
anyway I mean if you're hanging upside

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.120 
anyway I mean if you're hanging upside
down<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.210> keep<00:05:01.389> it<00:05:01.570> indoors<00:05:01.919> it's<00:05:02.919> going

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
down and you keep it indoors it's going

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.740 
down and you keep it indoors it's going
to<00:05:03.190> dry<00:05:03.340> up<00:05:03.370> pretty<00:05:03.760> quick<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:04.419> know<00:05:04.630> it'd

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
to dry up pretty quick so you know it'd

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.719 
to dry up pretty quick so you know it'd
be<00:05:04.870> hanging<00:05:05.139> out<00:05:05.229> right<00:05:05.409> there<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.860> so<00:05:06.580> then

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
be hanging out right there and so then

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.899 
be hanging out right there and so then
the<00:05:06.940> SAP<00:05:07.289> it's<00:05:08.289> not<00:05:08.500> going<00:05:08.710> down<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.159> its<00:05:09.789> not

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
the SAP it's not going down to its not

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.339 
the SAP it's not going down to its not
going<00:05:10.120> up<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.360> way<00:05:10.599> we<00:05:10.780> just<00:05:10.930> watch<00:05:11.110> them

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
going up that way we just watch them

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.420 
going up that way we just watch them
makes<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.370> plants<00:05:12.729> toca<00:05:13.030> start<00:05:13.419> going<00:05:13.599> molded

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
makes the plants toca start going molded

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.279 
makes the plants toca start going molded
so<00:05:15.430> yeah<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.880> mean<00:05:16.449> that's<00:05:16.750> what<00:05:16.930> basically

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
so yeah I mean that's what basically

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.980 
so yeah I mean that's what basically
I've<00:05:17.409> got<00:05:17.620> so<00:05:17.830> I've<00:05:17.889> got<00:05:18.039> already<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.810> I'm<00:05:19.810> just

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
I've got so I've got already it I'm just

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
going to get some twine wrap it up like

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.219 
going to get some twine wrap it up like
that<00:05:22.500> hang<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.620> up<00:05:23.740> somewhere<00:05:23.949> nice<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.280> dry

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
couldn't even stick these outside if

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.100 
couldn't even stick these outside if
you're<00:05:30.880> not<00:05:30.969> a<00:05:31.030> main<00:05:31.210> just<00:05:31.539> like<00:05:31.719> leave<00:05:31.900> your

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
wait where it can get a lie mean if you

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.980 
wait where it can get a lie mean if you
could<00:05:35.500> put<00:05:35.650> like<00:05:35.800> couple<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.340> house<00:05:36.520> bricks

the<00:05:42.910> cover<00:05:43.150> over<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.980> egg<00:05:45.100> is<00:05:45.280> under<00:05:45.640> it

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
the cover over it so the egg is under it

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.690 
the cover over it so the egg is under it
drives<00:05:46.090> them<00:05:46.210> out<00:05:46.390> nice<00:05:46.600> and<00:05:46.630> quick<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.320> then

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700
