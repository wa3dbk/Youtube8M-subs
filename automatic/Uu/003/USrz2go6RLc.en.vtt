at<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:11.450> I'm<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.600> lot<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> them<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.860> polyps

less and less polyps are coming out even
the<00:01:23.910> ones<00:01:24.149> that<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.800> coming<00:01:25.800> out<00:01:26.160> they're

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the ones that are coming out they're

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.730 
the ones that are coming out they're
just<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:27.060> near<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.690> full<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.349> once<00:01:28.590> were

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
just not near as full as they once were

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.999 
just not near as full as they once were
the<00:01:29.280> color<00:01:29.550> is<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.119> same<00:01:31.009> pretty

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the color is not the same pretty

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.469 
the color is not the same pretty
discouraging<00:01:35.420> I've<00:01:36.420> been<00:01:36.899> I<00:01:37.229> tested<00:01:37.830> my<00:01:37.860> water

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
discouraging I've been I tested my water

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.290 
discouraging I've been I tested my water
everything<00:01:39.479> checked<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.970> temperatures<00:01:41.970> fine

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
everything checked out temperatures fine

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.339 
everything checked out temperatures fine
the<00:01:42.690> Saline<00:01:43.080> levels<00:01:43.440> pretty<00:01:43.619> much<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.069> same

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
the Saline levels pretty much the same

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.050 
the Saline levels pretty much the same
so<00:01:46.349> I<00:01:46.410> was<00:01:46.560> racking<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:46.979> brain<00:01:47.340> quite<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.910> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so I was racking my brain quite a bit to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.609 
so I was racking my brain quite a bit to
figure<00:01:48.300> out<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.599> went<00:01:48.780> wrong<00:01:48.929> here<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.470> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
figure out what went wrong here and I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.180 
figure out what went wrong here and I
have<00:01:49.800> a<00:01:49.830> couple<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.369> theories<00:01:51.560> one<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.800> on<00:01:53.069> my

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
have a couple of theories one is on my

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.520 
have a couple of theories one is on my
last<00:01:53.399> update<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.209> 90<00:01:54.569> gallon<00:01:54.929> I<00:01:55.050> explained

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
last update on my 90 gallon I explained

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.180 
last update on my 90 gallon I explained
I<00:01:55.709> lost<00:01:56.160> a<00:01:56.340> couple<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.729> SPS<00:01:57.149> corals<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.860> had

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
I lost a couple of SPS corals and I had

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.150 
I lost a couple of SPS corals and I had
to<00:01:59.369> increase<00:01:59.880> my<00:02:00.149> dosing<00:02:00.770> two-part<00:02:01.770> buffer

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
to increase my dosing two-part buffer

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.790 
to increase my dosing two-part buffer
system<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.789> my<00:02:03.539> 90<00:02:03.899> gallon<00:02:04.259> I've<00:02:04.410> been<00:02:04.560> dosing

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
system on my 90 gallon I've been dosing

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.070 
system on my 90 gallon I've been dosing
it<00:02:05.099> almost<00:02:05.340> every<00:02:05.729> day

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
it almost every day

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.050 
it almost every day
so<00:02:07.080> once<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.709> started<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> about<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> month<00:02:08.849> ago

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
so once I started that about a month ago

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.190 
so once I started that about a month ago
I<00:02:10.039> just<00:02:11.039> decided<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> come<00:02:11.880> down<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.870> dose

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
I just decided to come down here in dose

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.280 
I just decided to come down here in dose
my<00:02:13.530> 24<00:02:14.160> gallon<00:02:14.430> nano<00:02:14.610> cube<00:02:14.970> which<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.420> hadn't

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
my 24 gallon nano cube which I hadn't

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.640 
my 24 gallon nano cube which I hadn't
done<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.770> very<00:02:17.069> long<00:02:17.340> time<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:18.000> system

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
done in a very long time this system

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.860 
done in a very long time this system
just<00:02:19.650> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.219> cruises<00:02:20.909> along<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.689> very

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
just kind of cruises along and is very

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.730 
just kind of cruises along and is very
stable

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
stable

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.350 
stable
but<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.040> thought<00:02:23.310> maybe<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.730> could<00:02:23.790> benefit

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
but I thought maybe it could benefit

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.880 
but I thought maybe it could benefit
Micro<00:02:25.050> say<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> clam<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:27.380> other<00:02:28.380> than<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
Micro say a clam and other than that I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.240 
Micro say a clam and other than that I
mean<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.220> just<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:30.770> stylophora<00:02:31.770> there

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
mean I just have that stylophora there

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
mean I just have that stylophora there
but<00:02:32.520> that's<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.850> really<00:02:33.030> Hardy<00:02:33.480> SPS<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.110> I

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
but that's a really Hardy SPS and I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.350 
but that's a really Hardy SPS and I
don't<00:02:36.270> think<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.660> would<00:02:36.810> really<00:02:37.140> need<00:02:37.470> dosing

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
don't think it would really need dosing

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.450 
don't think it would really need dosing
and<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.660> only<00:02:39.840> dosed<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.410> once<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.830> week<00:02:40.860> for

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
and I only dosed it once a week for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.970 
and I only dosed it once a week for
three<00:02:41.730> weeks<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:43.110> I'm<00:02:43.260> not<00:02:43.410> sure<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:43.770> that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
three weeks but I'm not sure if that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.020 
three weeks but I'm not sure if that
slight<00:02:44.310> change<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.090> water<00:02:45.360> chemistry

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
slight change in the water chemistry

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.280 
slight change in the water chemistry
affected<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.780> colony<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.410> GSP<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:51.290> that's

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
affected this colony of GSP so that's

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.830 
affected this colony of GSP so that's
one<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.890> theories<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.790> other<00:02:54.240> one<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.660> is

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
one of the theories the other one is is

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.050 
one of the theories the other one is is
I<00:02:54.960> did<00:02:55.140> some<00:02:55.320> research<00:02:55.740> online<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.730> kind

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
I did some research online and just kind

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.830 
I did some research online and just kind
of<00:02:57.150> read<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:58.640> some<00:02:59.640> different<00:03:00.150> varieties<00:03:00.810> of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
of read that some different varieties of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.910 
of read that some different varieties of
clove<00:03:01.320> polyps<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.070> zinnia<00:03:03.350> will<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.620> really

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
clove polyps and zinnia will do really

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.070 
clove polyps and zinnia will do really
well<00:03:05.070> four<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.120> three<00:03:06.330> years<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> system

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
well four to three years in the system

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.230 
well four to three years in the system
and<00:03:07.530> then<00:03:07.710> just<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.610> no<00:03:08.760> reason<00:03:09.120> at

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
and then just kind of for no reason at

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.090 
and then just kind of for no reason at
all<00:03:09.330> just<00:03:09.630> start<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.960> melt<00:03:10.140> away<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.650> die<00:03:10.890> off

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
all just start to melt away and die off

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.790 
all just start to melt away and die off
they<00:03:11.520> just<00:03:11.760> kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.030> run<00:03:12.090> their<00:03:12.390> course<00:03:12.800> so

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
they just kind of run their course so

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.240 
they just kind of run their course so
I'm<00:03:14.610> not<00:03:14.790> sure<00:03:14.850> if<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.150> happened<00:03:15.690> here<00:03:19.250> but

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
I'm not sure if that happened here but

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.190 
I'm not sure if that happened here but
kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.820> bummer<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.480> such<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> healthy

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
kind of a bummer it's such a healthy

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.990 
kind of a bummer it's such a healthy
system<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.010> hate<00:03:23.220> when<00:03:23.430> all<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.700> sudden

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
system I hate when all of a sudden

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.630 
system I hate when all of a sudden
something's<00:03:24.450> not<00:03:24.600> looking<00:03:24.990> too<00:03:25.170> good<00:03:25.640> there's

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
something's not looking too good there's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.670 
something's not looking too good there's
this<00:03:26.850> there's<00:03:27.360> two<00:03:27.630> rocks<00:03:27.930> here<00:03:28.200> there's<00:03:28.500> this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
this there's two rocks here there's this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.670 
this there's two rocks here there's this
rock<00:03:28.950> which<00:03:29.220> obviously<00:03:29.820> I'd<00:03:30.060> keep<00:03:30.500> it's<00:03:31.500> got

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
rock which obviously I'd keep it's got

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.250 
rock which obviously I'd keep it's got
the<00:03:31.950> anemones<00:03:32.670> mounted<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.690> base<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.080> it

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the anemones mounted to the base of it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.230 
the anemones mounted to the base of it
some<00:03:34.680> human<00:03:35.010> record<00:03:35.340> eeeh<00:03:35.550> everything<00:03:36.120> is

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
some human record eeeh everything is

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.420 
some human record eeeh everything is
doing<00:03:36.510> fine<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:37.800> there's<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.160> rock

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
doing fine but then there's this rock

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.520 
doing fine but then there's this rock
resting<00:03:38.940> on<00:03:39.030> top<00:03:39.270> which<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:40.020> completely

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
resting on top which is just completely

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.330 
resting on top which is just completely
covered<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:42.600> GSP<00:03:42.960> and<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:44.010> keeps<00:03:44.160> going

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
covered in the GSP and if it keeps going

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.720 
covered in the GSP and if it keeps going
south<00:03:44.910> I'm<00:03:45.210> going<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.450> remove<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.870> rock<00:03:46.730> and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
south I'm going to remove that rock and

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.060 
south I'm going to remove that rock and
then<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.940> go<00:03:48.150> get<00:03:48.330> another<00:03:48.600> piece<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.530> live<00:03:49.740> rock

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
then I go get another piece of live rock

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.010 
then I go get another piece of live rock
and<00:03:50.430> put<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.850> its<00:03:50.940> place<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.720> then<00:03:51.810> have

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
and put it in its place and then have

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.010 
and put it in its place and then have
some<00:03:52.260> room<00:03:52.470> there<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:52.740> some<00:03:53.130> new<00:03:53.250> corals<00:03:54.020> so

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
some room there for some new corals so

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.360 
some room there for some new corals so
I'm<00:03:55.140> going<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.350> keep<00:03:55.500> an<00:03:55.650> eye<00:03:55.740> on<00:03:55.770> this<00:03:56.100> for<00:03:56.340> a

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
I'm going to keep an eye on this for a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.670 
I'm going to keep an eye on this for a
little<00:03:56.520> bit<00:03:56.730> longer<00:03:56.940> if<00:03:57.300> it<00:03:58.460> keeps<00:04:00.680> fading

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
little bit longer if it keeps fading

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.880 
little bit longer if it keeps fading
away<00:04:01.800> that's<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:02.490> I'm<00:04:02.580> going<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.790> do<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:04.620> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
away that's what I'm going to do on to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.340 
away that's what I'm going to do on to

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
the the other issue I'm about a week ago

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.700 
the the other issue I'm about a week ago
I<00:04:08.270> came<00:04:09.270> downstairs<00:04:09.480> one<00:04:10.020> morning<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.620> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
found that my tail spot blenny the other

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.290 
found that my tail spot blenny the other
fish<00:04:13.140> in<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.470> tank<00:04:13.530> had<00:04:14.070> jumped<00:04:14.460> from<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
fish in this tank had jumped from the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.860 
fish in this tank had jumped from the
display<00:04:16.460> up<00:04:17.460> into<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.880> first<00:04:18.150> chamber<00:04:18.480> right

here<00:04:20.180> yeah<00:04:21.180> he<00:04:21.510> was<00:04:21.660> dead<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:23.630> add<00:04:24.630> our<00:04:25.080> Oh<00:04:25.110> water

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
here yeah he was dead I add our Oh water

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.350 
here yeah he was dead I add our Oh water
to<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:25.830> tank<00:04:26.100> about<00:04:26.340> every<00:04:26.580> two<00:04:26.790> days<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.240> at

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
to this tank about every two days and at

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.900 
to this tank about every two days and at
the<00:04:27.480> time<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.870> water<00:04:28.110> level<00:04:28.530> in<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.730> back

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
the time the water level in the back

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.760 
the time the water level in the back
chambers<00:04:30.390> here<00:04:30.570> was<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.780> little<00:04:31.080> low<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:31.290> that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
chambers here was a little low so that

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.920 
chambers here was a little low so that
blue<00:04:32.010> sponge<00:04:32.310> was<00:04:32.640> totally<00:04:33.030> exposed

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
blue sponge was totally exposed

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.310 
blue sponge was totally exposed
and<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:35.280> found<00:04:35.580> them<00:04:35.850> right<00:04:36.540> on<00:04:36.690> top<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:36.990> that

like<00:04:49.710> most<00:04:50.430> other<00:04:50.669> clownfish<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.570> own<00:04:53.180> it's

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
like most other clownfish I own it's

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.240 
like most other clownfish I own it's
pretty<00:04:54.479> aggressive<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.789> never<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:58.919> know<00:04:59.009> all

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
pretty aggressive and never you know all

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.879 
pretty aggressive and never you know all
allowed<00:04:59.490> attacked<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.389> tail<00:05:00.960> spot<00:05:01.259> Lenny<00:05:01.560> but

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
allowed attacked the tail spot Lenny but

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.950 
allowed attacked the tail spot Lenny but
definitely<00:05:02.550> was<00:05:02.940> very<00:05:03.210> aggressive<00:05:03.750> towards

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
definitely was very aggressive towards

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.740 
definitely was very aggressive towards
it<00:05:04.199> especially<00:05:04.500> during<00:05:04.770> feeding<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.750> the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
it especially during feeding and the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.540 
it especially during feeding and the
number<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.199> times<00:05:07.380> recently<00:05:07.740> when<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.310> would

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
number of times recently when I would

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.150 
number of times recently when I would
feed<00:05:08.820> these<00:05:09.030> fish<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.870> saddleback<00:05:10.650> clown

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
feed these fish the saddleback clown

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.029 
feed these fish the saddleback clown
would<00:05:11.400> quickly<00:05:11.789> chase<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:13.590> tail<00:05:13.770> spot

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
would quickly chase the tail spot

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.400 
would quickly chase the tail spot
blending<00:05:14.430> up<00:05:14.520> into<00:05:14.760> this<00:05:14.850> corner<00:05:15.229> be<00:05:16.229> like<00:05:16.380> a

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
blending up into this corner be like a

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.870 
blending up into this corner be like a
really<00:05:16.770> quick<00:05:17.039> movement<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.669> they<00:05:17.729> would

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
really quick movement and they would

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.490 
really quick movement and they would
both<00:05:18.060> shoot<00:05:18.419> up<00:05:18.539> into<00:05:18.780> this<00:05:18.870> corner<00:05:19.229> I<00:05:19.289> think

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
both shoot up into this corner I think

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.310 
both shoot up into this corner I think
maybe<00:05:19.949> he<00:05:20.850> did<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.900> tail<00:05:22.080> spot

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
maybe he did that and the tail spot

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.370 
maybe he did that and the tail spot
blunt<00:05:22.560> even<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:23.010> jumped<00:05:23.370> over<00:05:23.900> so<00:05:24.900> I

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.680 

obviously<00:05:28.380> keep<00:05:28.860> this<00:05:29.099> tank<00:05:29.430> mostly<00:05:29.970> open<00:05:30.240> I

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
obviously keep this tank mostly open I

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.390 
obviously keep this tank mostly open I
only<00:05:31.169> have<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:31.560> single<00:05:31.860> pane<00:05:32.220> of<00:05:32.370> glass

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
only have that single pane of glass

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.650 
only have that single pane of glass
holding<00:05:33.090> my<00:05:33.270> LED<00:05:33.780> light<00:05:34.050> fixture<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:35.509> used<00:05:36.509> to

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
holding my LED light fixture I used to

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.719 
holding my LED light fixture I used to
have<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:36.960> completely<00:05:37.410> covered<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.340> if<00:05:38.520> that

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
have it completely covered so if that

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.060 
have it completely covered so if that
was<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.030> case<00:05:39.210> um<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.900> wouldn't<00:05:40.800> have<00:05:40.949> lost

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
was the case um I wouldn't have lost

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.969 
was the case um I wouldn't have lost
that<00:05:41.340> fish<00:05:41.699> but<00:05:42.150> I<00:05:42.419> have<00:05:43.289> to<00:05:43.440> keep<00:05:43.590> this<00:05:43.740> open

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
that fish but I have to keep this open

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.140 
that fish but I have to keep this open
mainly<00:05:44.520> because<00:05:44.820> of<00:05:45.000> heat<00:05:45.210> issues<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:47.400> do<00:05:47.729> own<00:05:48.120> a

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
mainly because of heat issues I do own a

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.570 
mainly because of heat issues I do own a
JBJ<00:05:48.840> chiller<00:05:49.199> that<00:05:49.650> for<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.010> first<00:05:50.220> year<00:05:50.550> I

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
JBJ chiller that for the first year I

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.640 
JBJ chiller that for the first year I
ran<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.389> this<00:05:52.139> system

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
ran on this system

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.930 
ran on this system
I<00:05:52.860> had<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:53.789> hqi<00:05:54.360> metal<00:05:55.080> halide<00:05:55.530> lid<00:05:55.949> so<00:05:56.550> the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
I had the hqi metal halide lid so the

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.060 
I had the hqi metal halide lid so the
tank<00:05:57.539> ran<00:05:57.720> a<00:05:57.750> lot<00:05:58.020> hotter<00:05:58.289> back<00:05:58.560> then<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.010> I

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
tank ran a lot hotter back then and I

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.890 
tank ran a lot hotter back then and I
had<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.520> run<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.030> chiller<00:06:00.270> for<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.630> first

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
had to run the chiller for the first

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.040 
had to run the chiller for the first
year<00:06:01.460> but<00:06:02.460> now<00:06:02.669> with<00:06:02.909> my<00:06:02.940> filtration<00:06:03.750> I<00:06:03.870> have

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
year but now with my filtration I have

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.710 
year but now with my filtration I have

refugium in the middle chamber I just

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.490 
refugium in the middle chamber I just
don't<00:06:09.180> have<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.449> real<00:06:09.630> estate<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:10.169> run<00:06:10.349> the

don't have the real estate to run the
chiller<00:06:10.770> anymore

chiller anymore

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.029 
chiller anymore
with<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.539> pump<00:06:12.780> and<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.199> hoses<00:06:13.409> that<00:06:13.919> it

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.000 
with the pump and the hoses that it
requires<00:06:14.430> so<00:06:15.000> I<00:06:15.240> don't<00:06:16.110> run<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.440> chiller<00:06:16.680> and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
requires so I don't run the chiller and

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.830 
requires so I don't run the chiller and
honestly<00:06:17.370> I<00:06:17.460> don't<00:06:17.580> miss<00:06:17.909> it<00:06:18.120> at<00:06:18.210> all<00:06:18.330> it<00:06:18.599> kind

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
honestly I don't miss it at all it kind

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.719 
honestly I don't miss it at all it kind
of<00:06:18.900> made<00:06:19.620> quite<00:06:19.860> a<00:06:19.919> bit<00:06:20.099> of<00:06:20.190> noise<00:06:20.370> in<00:06:20.699> my

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
of made quite a bit of noise in my

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.189 
of made quite a bit of noise in my
living<00:06:21.060> room<00:06:21.180> kicking<00:06:21.780> on<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.169> off<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:24.199> you

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
living room kicking on and off and you

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.870 
living room kicking on and off and you
know<00:06:25.289> I<00:06:25.320> really<00:06:25.650> like<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:25.949> way<00:06:26.070> my<00:06:26.099> filtration

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
know I really like the way my filtration

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.180 
know I really like the way my filtration
is<00:06:27.000> set<00:06:27.240> up<00:06:27.360> on<00:06:27.539> this<00:06:27.690> system<00:06:28.169> so<00:06:28.560> no<00:06:29.039> more

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
is set up on this system so no more

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.000 
is set up on this system so no more
chiller<00:06:29.520> here<00:06:29.940> but<00:06:30.720> that's<00:06:31.440> kind<00:06:31.770> of<00:06:31.860> the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
chiller here but that's kind of the

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.939 
chiller here but that's kind of the
disadvantage<00:06:32.669> I<00:06:32.820> have<00:06:33.060> lost<00:06:33.419> a<00:06:33.919> handful<00:06:34.919> of

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
disadvantage I have lost a handful of

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.860 
disadvantage I have lost a handful of
fish<00:06:35.280> out<00:06:35.550> of<00:06:35.580> this<00:06:35.820> tank<00:06:36.150> in<00:06:36.360> the<00:06:36.449> last<00:06:36.659> few

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
fish out of this tank in the last few

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.010 
fish out of this tank in the last few
years<00:06:36.930> that<00:06:37.380> have<00:06:37.560> jumped<00:06:37.889> out<00:06:38.280> so

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
years that have jumped out so

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.170 
years that have jumped out so
those<00:06:41.650> are<00:06:41.860> the<00:06:42.009> two<00:06:42.550> setbacks<00:06:43.300> recently<00:06:43.479> and

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
those are the two setbacks recently and

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.370 
those are the two setbacks recently and
other<00:06:46.180> than<00:06:46.330> that<00:06:46.449> I<00:06:46.539> mean<00:06:46.870> the<00:06:46.960> system<00:06:47.169> is

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
other than that I mean the system is

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.930 
other than that I mean the system is
fine<00:06:47.710> I<00:06:47.740> think<00:06:48.039> I'm<00:06:48.310> going<00:06:48.430> to<00:06:48.520> get<00:06:48.639> through

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
fine I think I'm going to get through

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.570 
fine I think I'm going to get through
this<00:06:49.470> everything<00:06:50.470> else<00:06:50.620> is<00:06:50.830> doing<00:06:51.130> well<00:06:51.340> I'll

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
this everything else is doing well I'll

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.460 
this everything else is doing well I'll
probably<00:06:51.849> get<00:06:52.090> another<00:06:52.210> fish<00:06:52.720> here<00:06:53.080> at<00:06:53.229> some

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
probably get another fish here at some

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.140 
probably get another fish here at some
point<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.979> system<00:06:54.190> can<00:06:54.550> definitely<00:06:55.000> support

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
point the system can definitely support

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.290 
point the system can definitely support
a<00:06:55.539> second<00:06:55.930> fish<00:06:56.199> and<00:06:56.979> I'll<00:06:57.400> probably<00:06:57.729> start

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
a second fish and I'll probably start

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.150 
a second fish and I'll probably start
looking<00:06:58.660> into<00:06:58.810> that<00:06:59.050> maybe<00:06:59.500> look<00:07:00.130> for

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
looking into that maybe look for

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.040 
looking into that maybe look for
something<00:07:00.639> a<00:07:00.759> little<00:07:00.910> more<00:07:01.060> aggressive<00:07:01.750> that

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
something a little more aggressive that

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.830 
something a little more aggressive that
can<00:07:02.919> hold<00:07:03.130> its<00:07:03.310> own<00:07:03.460> against<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.120> saddleback

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
can hold its own against the saddleback

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.969 
can hold its own against the saddleback
