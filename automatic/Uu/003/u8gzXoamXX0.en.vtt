 I say two are racing and two are 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.579
 ordinary cars would be 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.950
 very nice that they will add something as a type 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.319
 santaclós sled or yes I know it is 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.239
 a lot of asking and is very pulled just that 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.189
 it would be father to see him this is the first 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.620
 adding that car is a car 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.930
 very father racing the original color is 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.810
 orange and if they are fixed has as many 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.489
 pictures with corporate logos 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.519
 up there is no fruit that is like 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.010
 cheap copy of the brand apple is 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.319
 very loaded are parents and they run very 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.659
 fast this is one the other is very 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.519
 seemed like what I really liked about 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.859
 this white right now he showed them back 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.079
 and in a motor that looks very dog ​​there 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.840
 is this engine looks very good very 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.760
 cute as I do not know if I like it 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.379
 add pictures or not like he got me 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.689
 makes it look small but at the same time it's 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.790
 as very strange because a car with 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.739
 stamp does not look so good those are the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.349
 two racing cars that they added and 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.569
 the others are vans like Christmas 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.549
 one already use it in a past gameplay 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.170
 they want to see and I think the other time that 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.629
 white that is in the background if I do not 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.609
 wrong let's go once to check this 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.130
 car to see how it runs so they see 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.959
 that if it's very good it's very fast and it's 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.239
 What I like most about these cars 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.180
 races that are very fast that's why 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.509
 they are racing 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.919

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.840
 bank robberies to direct me to the 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.310
 word

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.979
 players when you go very fast the 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.410
