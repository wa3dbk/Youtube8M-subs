each hand when you're practicing and
doing<00:01:52.069> your<00:01:52.129> exercises<00:01:52.599> so<00:01:53.599> what<00:01:53.750> we'll<00:01:53.869> do<00:01:54.020> is

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
doing your exercises so what we'll do is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.979 
doing your exercises so what we'll do is
it'll<00:01:54.530> start<00:01:54.860> right<00:01:55.420> left<00:01:56.420> right<00:01:56.509> left<00:01:56.660> right

it'll start right left right left right
left<00:01:57.140> right<00:01:57.410> left<00:01:57.560> we're<00:01:57.860> going<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.039> play<00:01:58.220> an

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
left right left we're going to play an

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.029 
left right left we're going to play an
unaccented<00:01:58.700> measure<00:01:59.330> so<00:02:00.259> one-e-and-a

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
unaccented measure so one-e-and-a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.760 
unaccented measure so one-e-and-a
two-e-and-a<00:02:01.700> three<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.209> four<00:02:02.629> Enda<00:02:03.110> then

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
two-e-and-a three and four Enda then

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.010 
two-e-and-a three and four Enda then
we're<00:02:03.950> going<00:02:04.069> to<00:02:04.129> put<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:04.940> on<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.720> quarter

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
we're going to put in on the quarter

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.830 
we're going to put in on the quarter
notes<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.530> accent<00:02:07.520> with<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.149> right<00:02:08.360> hand<00:02:08.660> as

notes and accent with the right hand as

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.010 
notes and accent with the right hand as
it<00:02:09.530> down<00:02:09.709> beats<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> quarter<00:02:10.550> note<00:02:10.700> and

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
it down beats on the quarter note and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.970 
it down beats on the quarter note and
every<00:02:12.020> other<00:02:12.140> measure<00:02:12.440> will<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.800> an

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
every other measure will be an

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.190 
every other measure will be an
unaccented<00:02:13.280> measure<00:02:13.819> just<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.629> can<00:02:14.930> hear

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
unaccented measure just so you can hear

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.270 
unaccented measure just so you can hear
and<00:02:15.349> get<00:02:15.440> your<00:02:15.560> bearings<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.980> where<00:02:16.129> you're<00:02:16.250> at

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and get your bearings of where you're at

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.400 
and get your bearings of where you're at
then<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.269> measure<00:02:17.480> after<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.080> we'll<00:02:18.379> move

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
then the measure after that we'll move

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.830 
then the measure after that we'll move
the<00:02:18.739> sixteenth<00:02:19.160> note<00:02:19.370> over<00:02:19.580> one<00:02:20.209> sixteenth

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
the sixteenth note over one sixteenth

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.390 
the sixteenth note over one sixteenth
note<00:02:21.050> until<00:02:21.680> we<00:02:21.800> get<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.220> UH

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
note until we get to the UH

of the sixteenth note pattern one E and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.640 
of the sixteenth note pattern one E and
uh<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:25.970> finishes<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.390> now<00:02:26.690> let's<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.560> it

here we go one two three four so there
kick<00:03:43.370> drum<00:03:43.669> moved<00:03:44.450> with<00:03:44.690> every<00:03:44.989> accent<00:03:45.500> that's

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
kick drum moved with every accent that's

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.920 
kick drum moved with every accent that's
a<00:03:46.280> really<00:03:46.609> useful<00:03:46.760> thing<00:03:46.940> just<00:03:47.419> not<00:03:47.599> even<00:03:47.840> in

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
a really useful thing just not even in

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.390 
a really useful thing just not even in
developing<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.500> unisons<00:03:48.950> between<00:03:49.280> your

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
developing the unisons between your

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.250 
developing the unisons between your
hands<00:03:49.790> but<00:03:50.299> actually<00:03:50.599> being<00:03:50.750> able<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.019> really

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
hands but actually being able to really

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.440 
hands but actually being able to really
really<00:03:51.799> be<00:03:51.950> precise<00:03:52.370> with<00:03:53.150> where<00:03:53.329> you're

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
really be precise with where you're

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.860 
really be precise with where you're
placing<00:03:53.690> your<00:03:53.870> kick<00:03:54.079> drum<00:03:54.519> on<00:03:55.690> sixteenth<00:03:56.690> note

placing your kick drum on sixteenth note

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.330 
placing your kick drum on sixteenth note
patterns<00:03:57.230> especially<00:03:57.349> funk<00:03:57.829> beats<00:03:58.069> where

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
patterns especially funk beats where

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.759 
patterns especially funk beats where
there's<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.549> lot<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.880> E<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.419> type<00:03:59.959> stuff<00:04:00.230> that's

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
there's a lot of E and type stuff that's

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.949 
there's a lot of E and type stuff that's
a<00:04:00.859> great<00:04:01.069> exercise<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.549> as<00:04:01.819> it<00:04:02.150> speeds<00:04:02.450> up<00:04:02.690> it

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
a great exercise and as it speeds up it

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.720 
a great exercise and as it speeds up it
becomes<00:04:03.200> even<00:04:03.319> better<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:04.459> thing<00:04:04.639> we're

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
becomes even better and one thing we're

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.250 
becomes even better and one thing we're
going<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:04.880> work<00:04:05.030> on<00:04:05.239> now<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.660> just<00:04:06.049> take<00:04:06.169> the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
going to work on now is just take the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.530 
going to work on now is just take the
hands<00:04:06.500> away<00:04:06.620> let's<00:04:07.579> put<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.910> hi-hat<00:04:08.299> on<00:04:08.329> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
hands away let's put the hi-hat on the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.780 
hands away let's put the hi-hat on the
quarter<00:04:08.840> notes<00:04:09.069> so<00:04:10.069> we've<00:04:10.280> got<00:04:10.459> our<00:04:10.579> pulse

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
quarter notes so we've got our pulse

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.960 
quarter notes so we've got our pulse
going<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:13.129> course<00:04:13.340> these<00:04:13.549> things<00:04:13.760> help

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
going and of course these things help

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.190 
going and of course these things help
when<00:04:14.090> you're<00:04:14.209> practicing<00:04:14.359> with<00:04:14.599> a<00:04:14.720> clip<00:04:15.019> in

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
when you're practicing with a clip in

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.229 
when you're practicing with a clip in
the<00:04:15.799> video<00:04:16.070> training<00:04:16.430> system<00:04:16.760> we'll<00:04:16.940> do<00:04:17.090> that

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
the video training system we'll do that

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.490 
the video training system we'll do that
so<00:04:17.450> that<00:04:17.570> you've<00:04:17.690> got<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.959> metronome<00:04:18.349> but

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
so that you've got the metronome but

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.839 
so that you've got the metronome but
this<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.739> just<00:04:18.950> some<00:04:19.070> content<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.579> get<00:04:19.729> you

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849

without the snare being there it's a

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.650 
without the snare being there it's a
cool<00:05:10.040> thing<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.280> do<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.760> it's<00:05:11.090> developing

some<00:05:11.900> balance<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.500> dynamic<00:05:13.040> control<00:05:13.400> between

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
some balance and dynamic control between

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.920 
some balance and dynamic control between
your<00:05:13.850> feet<00:05:14.060> because<00:05:14.210> you<00:05:14.360> can<00:05:14.480> play<00:05:14.660> each<00:05:14.810> of

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
your feet because you can play each of

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
the hands back in at the slower tempo

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.400 
the hands back in at the slower tempo
and<00:05:22.160> then<00:05:22.790> I'm<00:05:23.600> going<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.900> show<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.110> just<00:05:24.200> a

and then I'm going to show you just a

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.690 
and then I'm going to show you just a
kind<00:05:24.560> of<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.680> way<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.860> maybe<00:05:25.130> apply<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.490> little

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
kind of a way to maybe apply a little

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.930 
kind of a way to maybe apply a little
bit<00:05:25.820> of<00:05:25.970> that<00:05:26.090> into<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:27.080> groove<00:05:27.560> okay<00:05:27.860> hands<00:05:28.669> in

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
bit of that into a groove okay hands in

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.830 
bit of that into a groove okay hands in
I'm<00:05:29.090> a<00:05:29.150> count<00:05:29.390> you<00:05:29.540> in<00:05:29.570> will<00:05:29.930> do<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.140> slow<00:05:30.500> and

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
I'm a count you in will do it slow and

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.870 
I'm a count you in will do it slow and
we'll<00:05:32.840> see<00:05:33.020> where<00:05:33.169> we<00:05:33.260> get<00:05:33.410> with<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:33.710> okay<00:05:34.070> one

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
we'll see where we get with it okay one

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:57.100 
we'll see where we get with it okay one
two<00:05:35.810> three<00:05:36.790> four<00:05:54.880> so<00:05:55.880> that's<00:05:56.630> kind<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:56.870> a<00:05:56.960> basic

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
two three four so that's kind of a basic

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.080 
two three four so that's kind of a basic
way<00:05:57.590> to<00:05:57.620> do<00:05:57.890> it<00:05:58.010> it<00:05:58.160> is<00:05:58.190> harder<00:05:58.669> with<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:58.820> feet

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
way to do it it is harder with the feet

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.760 
way to do it it is harder with the feet
but<00:05:59.780> that<00:05:59.930> makes<00:06:00.110> you<00:06:00.260> better<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.680> that

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
but that makes you better and that

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.530 
but that makes you better and that
actually<00:06:01.100> allows<00:06:01.340> you<00:06:01.490> to<00:06:01.669> kind<00:06:01.820> of<00:06:01.940> focus<00:06:02.210> on

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
actually allows you to kind of focus on

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.080 
actually allows you to kind of focus on
where<00:06:03.290> the<00:06:03.440> mechanical<00:06:03.979> aspect<00:06:04.850> of<00:06:04.970> things

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
where the mechanical aspect of things

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.370 
where the mechanical aspect of things
might<00:06:05.330> be<00:06:05.360> breaking<00:06:05.780> down<00:06:05.810> if<00:06:06.080> it's<00:06:06.200> not

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
might be breaking down if it's not

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.350 
might be breaking down if it's not
happening<00:06:06.860> plus<00:06:07.310> it's<00:06:07.520> slower<00:06:07.850> it<00:06:08.000> is<00:06:08.120> the

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
happening plus it's slower it is the

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.210 
happening plus it's slower it is the
more<00:06:08.600> you<00:06:08.690> can<00:06:08.810> hear<00:06:09.140> and<00:06:09.320> kind<00:06:09.890> of<00:06:09.979> think

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
more you can hear and kind of think

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.580 
more you can hear and kind of think
through<00:06:10.430> everything<00:06:10.669> that's<00:06:10.910> happening

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
through everything that's happening

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.870 
through everything that's happening
we're<00:06:12.590> going<00:06:12.710> to<00:06:12.770> go<00:06:12.890> into<00:06:13.160> a<00:06:13.190> lot<00:06:13.370> of<00:06:13.400> depth<00:06:13.760> in

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
we're going to go into a lot of depth in

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.120 
we're going to go into a lot of depth in
