class from what I found for the pw

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.769 
class from what I found for the pw
submachine<00:00:15.480> gun<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.929> black<00:00:16.560> ops<00:00:16.890> 2<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.779> i've

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
submachine gun in black ops 2 and i've

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.939 
submachine gun in black ops 2 and i've
tried<00:00:18.960> out<00:00:19.109> pretty<00:00:19.380> much<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
tried out pretty much all the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.519 
tried out pretty much all the
attachments<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.359> bunch<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.020> different<00:00:22.320> /

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
attachments and a bunch of different /

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.730 
attachments and a bunch of different /
combos<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.060> i<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.560> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
combos all that and i think that this is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.279 
combos all that and i think that this is
the<00:00:26.369> best<00:00:26.580> from<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> found<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.630> rushing

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the best from what I found for rushing

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
the best from what I found for rushing
and<00:00:28.529> getting<00:00:28.890> kills<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> kill

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and getting kills like this is a kill

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.110 
and getting kills like this is a kill
based<00:00:30.599> rushing<00:00:31.170> class<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.430> necessarily

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
based rushing class it's not necessarily

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.360 
based rushing class it's not necessarily
for<00:00:33.450> objective<00:00:34.230> based<00:00:34.410> domination<00:00:35.190> or

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
for objective based domination or

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.160 
for objective based domination or
anything<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.940> even<00:00:36.630> though<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.050> have

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
don't know everybody uses a presser it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
don't know everybody uses a presser it
just<00:01:19.259> makes<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> gun<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> whole<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.610> better<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
just makes the gun a whole lot better it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.899 
just makes the gun a whole lot better it
makes<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> gun<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.890> shake<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.400> much<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.850> my

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
makes the gun not shake as much in my

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.570 
makes the gun not shake as much in my
opinion<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.259> makes<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.430> on

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
opinion and it just makes you not see on

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
opinion and it just makes you not see on
the<00:01:26.700> radar<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.689> helpful<00:01:27.960> for

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the radar which is really helpful for

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
the radar which is really helpful for
rushing<00:01:28.680> obviously<00:01:29.159> since<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.579> won't<00:01:29.759> know

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
rushing obviously since they won't know

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.210 
rushing obviously since they won't know
where<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.810> their<00:01:31.380> spawn<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:32.100> if

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
where you are in their spawn or if

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.350 
where you are in their spawn or if
you're<00:01:32.310> flunking<00:01:32.579> them<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.060> anything<00:01:33.210> like

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you're flunking them or anything like

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.440 
you're flunking them or anything like
that<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:34.500> quick<00:01:34.710> draw<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.909> said<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.270> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that for quick draw like I said this is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
that for quick draw like I said this is
a<00:01:36.600> russian<00:01:36.960> class<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.820> gonna<00:01:39.000> make

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
a russian class and that's gonna make

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.030 
a russian class and that's gonna make
you<00:01:39.390> aim<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> lot<00:01:39.960> faster<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.920> all

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you aim a lot faster so you can get all

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.429 
you aim a lot faster so you can get all
those<00:01:41.220> quick-draw<00:01:42.060> kills<00:01:42.509> from<00:01:42.930> close<00:01:43.320> range

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
those quick-draw kills from close range

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
those quick-draw kills from close range
and<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.159> win<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:45.000> gunfights

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and you can win all the little gunfights

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.770 
and you can win all the little gunfights
and<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.549> need<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> secondary<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and you don't need a secondary this is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
and you don't need a secondary this is
forgetting<00:01:49.140> kills<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> PDW<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
forgetting kills with the PDW so that is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.210 
forgetting kills with the PDW so that is
why<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> don't<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.020> secondary<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.070> it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
why I don't have a secondary on and it's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.639 
why I don't have a secondary on and it's
because<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:54.210> replaced<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> with<00:01:55.049> purple<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
because of I replaced it with purple and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.590 
because of I replaced it with purple and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.539 
in perkone have on lightweight which is
for<00:02:03.780> running<00:02:04.110> faster<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.009> getting<00:02:05.189> hurt

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
for running faster and not getting hurt

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.910
