00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.149
 why not 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.330
 and I think that for miles like this I hope 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.369
 that there is a million I am secret and 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.110
 welcome to a biomass and well then 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.550
 We're seeing 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.680
 the change of gamertag and I removed the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.140
 name that had bastard and I'm already 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.690
 putting the new clan that I'm going to make 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.570
 I alone 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.600
 Well, I hope it will succeed, not as you can 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.080
 see the clan is going to call h1n1 and it's going to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.840
 be the first Mexican clearing in which 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:48.710
 this is going to be dedicated to let's say the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.660
 99 percent to play will do 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.710
 story in this game of vattenfall 4 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.050
 that is already coming and then sure 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.030
 they will ask, he hears like you alone and that's good 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.860
 Well, I'm not going to be alone 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.680
 in fact I'm going to start recruiting people 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.010
 and good as now the clan is new is 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.590
 new the clan is called h1n1 is worth this 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.409
 if you wonder why h1n1 good this 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.409
 name came from a friend and a friend of mine 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.690
 and me that we are very good friends 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.900
 friends in real life not in the xbox 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.870
 and we put him like that because then 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.290
 something something that would represent mexico a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.180
 Mexican clan had they had to say or 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 this clan is from mexico no and good has 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 made a 91 good as we all know 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.140
 h1n1 is from the influenza that was here in 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.340
 mexico not according to the influenza that what 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 sick people and killed her and I do not know 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.640
 what in itself the virus the virus 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.560
 called ah1n1 but as the two in the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.750
 tags of the games where they leave you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.100
 put them where they let put this the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.290
 name the name of your clan or the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.360
 acronyms, most of them only allow you 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.130
 four characters then then 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.700
 We decided to cut him off and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.940
 leave it on h1n1 and well I'll start to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.800
 recruit people and the first thing that nothing 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.950
 first people you recruit 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.780
 probably let's say that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.490
 Clan administrators or generals 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.130
 whatever I want to say for example I'm going 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.530
 to start the clan because I am the leader 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.709
 not so to speak and the next one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.420
 recruit is going to be the sub sub leader who 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.010
 will help me recruit to keep the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.080
 order and all that and so on 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.240
 until forming a 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.150
 a stable plan in baru 4 now I'm going 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.700
 to start looking for serious people the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.840
 let's start with age I say the truth is 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.540

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.069
 I will start recruiting people over 17 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.470
 16 years since if recruited 14 people 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.140
 and 15 years since obviously they do not always go 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.209
 to have the disposition or the mind or 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.540
 things like that for seriousness to 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.220
 dedicate a time to this clan or because 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.170
 this clan I want to do something serious 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.230
 not just a plan to be playing 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.269
