00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.140 

this<00:00:02.560> is<00:00:02.679> a<00:00:02.710> new<00:00:02.920> method<00:00:03.280> that<00:00:03.310> has<00:00:03.670> now<00:00:03.880> come

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.150 
this is a new method that has now come

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.880 
this is a new method that has now come
about<00:00:04.390> which<00:00:04.630> is<00:00:04.810> transfer<00:00:05.319> sheets<00:00:05.560> onto

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:05.890 
about which is transfer sheets onto

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.650 
about which is transfer sheets onto
sugar<00:00:06.670> paste<00:00:06.940> and<00:00:07.180> I'm<00:00:07.240> going<00:00:07.420> to<00:00:07.510> show<00:00:07.630> you

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
sugar paste and I'm going to show you

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.779 
sugar paste and I'm going to show you
now<00:00:07.840> how<00:00:07.870> to<00:00:08.050> do<00:00:08.349> that<00:00:08.590> this<00:00:09.309> is<00:00:09.370> a<00:00:09.490> piece<00:00:09.669> of

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:09.789 
now how to do that this is a piece of

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.119 
now how to do that this is a piece of
sugar<00:00:09.879> paste<00:00:10.150> that<00:00:10.330> I've<00:00:10.450> just<00:00:10.599> rolled<00:00:10.839> out

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129 
sugar paste that I've just rolled out

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.470 
sugar paste that I've just rolled out
I'm<00:00:12.129> going<00:00:12.370> to<00:00:12.429> add<00:00:12.549> a<00:00:12.579> bit<00:00:12.820> more<00:00:12.969> icing<00:00:13.299> sugar

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
I'm going to add a bit more icing sugar

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.230 
I'm going to add a bit more icing sugar
just<00:00:13.839> underneath<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:15.429> sugar<00:00:15.669> paper<00:00:15.879> because

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
just underneath this sugar paper because

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.390 
just underneath this sugar paper because
as<00:00:16.720> we<00:00:16.990> go<00:00:17.110> through<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.410> process<00:00:17.830> of<00:00:17.920> transfer

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
as we go through the process of transfer

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.910 
as we go through the process of transfer
it<00:00:18.730> does<00:00:18.910> make<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:19.360> sugar<00:00:19.900> paste<00:00:20.140> softer<00:00:20.680> and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
it does make the sugar paste softer and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.680 
it does make the sugar paste softer and
therefore<00:00:21.400> might<00:00:21.580> more<00:00:21.910> likely<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.330> stick<00:00:22.570> to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
therefore might more likely to stick to

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.600 
therefore might more likely to stick to
the<00:00:22.780> board<00:00:22.930> so<00:00:23.770> I've<00:00:23.890> got<00:00:24.010> our<00:00:24.100> piece<00:00:24.280> of<00:00:24.310> sugar

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
the board so I've got our piece of sugar

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.950 
the board so I've got our piece of sugar
paste<00:00:24.730> here<00:00:25.000> if<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:25.150> wanted<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.510> do<00:00:25.630> a<00:00:25.660> drape

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
paste here if you wanted to do a drape

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.620 
paste here if you wanted to do a drape
you<00:00:26.230> could<00:00:26.470> put<00:00:26.680> in<00:00:26.830> some<00:00:27.100> gum<00:00:27.310> trials<00:00:27.850> and<00:00:28.030> CMC

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
you could put in some gum trials and CMC

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.420 
you could put in some gum trials and CMC
that<00:00:28.990> it's<00:00:29.140> easier<00:00:29.470> to<00:00:29.500> pick<00:00:29.740> up<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.100> hang<00:00:30.250> as

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
that it's easier to pick up and hang as

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.760 
that it's easier to pick up and hang as
a<00:00:30.460> drape<00:00:30.789> otherwise<00:00:31.660> it's<00:00:31.990> just<00:00:32.050> as<00:00:32.379> fine<00:00:32.590> to

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
a drape otherwise it's just as fine to

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.790 
a drape otherwise it's just as fine to
do<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.160> took<00:00:33.640> place<00:00:33.850> as<00:00:34.060> it<00:00:34.210> stands<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:35.320> for

face<00:00:42.280> down<00:00:42.610> onto<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.150> sugar<00:00:43.390> paste<00:00:43.570> like<00:00:44.470> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
face down onto the sugar paste like that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.150 
face down onto the sugar paste like that
now<00:00:45.730> we're<00:00:46.270> going<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.480> transfer<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.320> print

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
now we're going to transfer the print

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.940 
now we're going to transfer the print
using<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.940> hairdryer<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.290> thing<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:50.680> with

it goes over the top of the transfer

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.160 
it goes over the top of the transfer
sheet<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.120> make<00:01:10.150> sure<00:01:10.299> that<00:01:10.570> we<00:01:10.720> actually<00:01:10.840> get

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
sheet to make sure that we actually get

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.830 
sheet to make sure that we actually get
all<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.740> print<00:01:12.010> off<00:01:12.280> not<00:01:12.940> patches<00:01:13.540> if<00:01:13.720> we

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
all of the print off not patches if we

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.810 
all of the print off not patches if we
were<00:01:14.170> doing<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:14.710> we<00:01:15.190> could<00:01:15.400> end<00:01:15.580> up<00:01:15.670> with

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
were doing this we could end up with

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.870 

okay<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:29.079> stage<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.560> can<00:01:29.590> stop<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.490> have<00:01:30.850> a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
okay this stage you can stop and have a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.959 
okay this stage you can stop and have a
little<00:01:31.090> look<00:01:31.359> to<00:01:31.390> see<00:01:31.780> if<00:01:31.929> it's<00:01:32.079> transferring

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
little look to see if it's transferring

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.550 
little look to see if it's transferring
you<00:01:33.969> can<00:01:34.179> see<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.659> it's<00:01:34.780> just<00:01:35.049> starting<00:01:35.530> to

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
you can see that it's just starting to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.770 
you can see that it's just starting to
to<00:01:36.159> come<00:01:36.340> off<00:01:36.490> here<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:37.390> can<00:01:37.539> put<00:01:37.659> it<00:01:37.750> back

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
to come off here you can put it back

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.359 
to come off here you can put it back
down<00:01:38.079> again<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.409> just<00:01:38.770> go<00:01:39.009> over<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.310> again

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
down again and just go over it again

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.440 
down again and just go over it again
just<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:39.939> be<00:01:39.969> sure

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
just to be sure

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.450 
just to be sure
because<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.350> heat<00:01:41.530> now<00:01:41.740> we're<00:01:42.189> not<00:01:42.250> using

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
because of the heat now we're not using

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.919 
because of the heat now we're not using
the<00:01:42.640> smoother<00:01:42.939> as<00:01:43.060> much<00:01:43.240> now<00:01:43.479> because<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
the smoother as much now because the

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.109 
the smoother as much now because the

Payne but the hair dry down to one side
I'll<00:02:01.100> have<00:02:01.280> another<00:02:01.520> look

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
I'll have another look

could pick this up and use it as a great
to<00:02:17.090> go<00:02:17.180> across<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.569> cake

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
to go across the cake

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.479 
to go across the cake
or<00:02:18.290> if<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.470> wanted<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.769> do<00:02:18.890> some<00:02:19.040> cupcake
