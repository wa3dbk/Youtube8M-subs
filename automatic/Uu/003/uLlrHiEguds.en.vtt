that<00:00:22.509> around<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.960> sure<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:27.250> kept<00:00:27.880> on<00:00:27.970> trying

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:28.239 
that around not sure I kept on trying

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.999 
that around not sure I kept on trying
the<00:00:28.449> whole<00:00:28.539> second<00:00:28.989> set<00:00:29.199> and<00:00:29.410> thought<00:00:29.619> up<00:00:29.739> a

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
the whole second set and thought up a

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.549 
the whole second set and thought up a
few<00:00:30.669> more<00:00:30.849> chances<00:00:31.119> than<00:00:31.329> he<00:00:31.570> did<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:32.020> i

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
few more chances than he did and i

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.319 
few more chances than he did and i
thought<00:00:32.800> this<00:00:33.070> tie<00:00:33.550> bleep<00:00:33.760> was<00:00:34.000> going<00:00:34.120> to<00:00:34.180> go

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
thought this tie bleep was going to go

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.990 
thought this tie bleep was going to go
his<00:00:34.629> way<00:00:34.660> just<00:00:35.350> because<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.829> set<00:00:36.040> played<00:00:36.850> out

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
his way just because the set played out

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.420 
his way just because the set played out
the<00:00:37.149> way<00:00:37.180> did<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.750> we<00:00:38.620> just<00:00:38.829> got<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:39.039> try<00:00:39.219> on

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
the way did and we just got to try on

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.580 
the way did and we just got to try on
believing<00:00:40.420> i<00:00:40.510> think<00:00:40.809> we<00:00:40.930> well<00:00:41.260> we<00:00:41.289> switched

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
believing i think we well we switched

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.439 
believing i think we well we switched
out<00:00:41.770> of<00:00:41.890> 42<00:00:42.100> when<00:00:42.460> he<00:00:42.520> challenged<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.969> call<00:00:43.180> and

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
out of 42 when he challenged a call and

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.779 
out of 42 when he challenged a call and
then<00:00:44.170> i<00:00:44.199> was<00:00:44.440> on<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.620> side<00:00:44.890> with<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.399> wind

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
then i was on the side with the wind

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.540 
then i was on the side with the wind
which<00:00:46.090> also<00:00:46.300> helped<00:00:46.750> i<00:00:46.840> think<00:00:47.079> so<00:00:47.320> as<00:00:47.470> i<00:00:47.890> was<00:00:48.340> a

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
which also helped i think so as i was a

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.280 
which also helped i think so as i was a
crucial<00:00:48.790> breaker<00:00:49.180> maybe<00:00:49.570> key<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.110> match

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
crucial breaker maybe key to the match

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.990 
crucial breaker maybe key to the match
but<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.890> think<00:00:51.130> overall<00:00:51.370> we<00:00:51.430> both<00:00:51.700> played<00:00:51.970> a

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
but I think overall we both played a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.850 
but I think overall we both played a
great<00:00:52.180> match<00:00:52.270> for<00:00:52.899> burnin<00:00:53.440> always<00:00:53.710> had<00:00:53.829> a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
great match for burnin always had a

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.460 
great match for burnin always had a
great<00:00:54.640> run<00:00:54.820> now<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.329> he<00:00:55.899> really<00:00:55.930> got<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.320> best

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
great run now and he really got the best

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.139 
great run now and he really got the best
out<00:00:56.649> of<00:00:56.710> me<00:00:56.800> tonight<00:00:57.130> so<00:00:57.160> I<00:00:57.610> hope<00:00:57.790> we<00:00:57.940> can<00:00:58.060> keep

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
out of me tonight so I hope we can keep

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
out of me tonight so I hope we can keep
it<00:00:58.300> up<00:00:58.360> I<00:00:58.570> really<00:00:58.930> wish<00:00:59.050> him<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.200> best

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.480 

were<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.700> surprised<00:01:06.330> by<00:01:06.960> his<00:01:07.740> overt

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
were you surprised by his overt

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
were you surprised by his overt
aggression<00:01:08.760> he<00:01:09.630> played<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:10.680> very

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
aggression he played very very

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
aggression he played very very
aggressively<00:01:11.520> towards<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> whole<00:01:12.390> match

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
aggressively towards you the whole match

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
aggressively towards you the whole match
that<00:01:12.870> was<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.440> something<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.040> were

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that was that something you were

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.420 
that was that something you were
expecting<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:15.380> mean<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.770> got<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> expect<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
expecting I mean you got to expect the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
expecting I mean you got to expect the
unexpected<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> Bernards<00:01:19.020> got

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
unexpected right and the Bernards got

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
unexpected right and the Bernards got
the<00:01:19.320> tools<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.000> chord

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the tools to do that I think the chord

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.730 
the tools to do that I think the chord
plays<00:01:21.420> maybe<00:01:21.660> a<00:01:21.750> touch<00:01:21.990> faster<00:01:22.470> than<00:01:22.590> last

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
plays maybe a touch faster than last

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
plays maybe a touch faster than last
year<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.850> allows<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> play<00:01:24.660> a<00:01:24.690> bit<00:01:24.900> more

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
year so it allows you to play a bit more

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.920 
year so it allows you to play a bit more
aggressive<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.090> big<00:01:27.090> guy<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> lot

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
aggressive and big guy so it's got a lot

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
aggressive and big guy so it's got a lot
of<00:01:27.960> powers<00:01:28.320> could<00:01:28.590> serve<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.159> he<00:01:29.700> uses<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
of powers could serve and he uses it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.990 
of powers could serve and he uses it
well<00:01:30.330> but<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.690> nice<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.080> see<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.290> he<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
well but it's nice to see that he can I

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.460 
well but it's nice to see that he can I
mean<00:01:33.000> move<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> ball<00:01:33.750> around<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.320> also

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
mean move the ball around but then also

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.749 
mean move the ball around but then also
you<00:01:34.619> need<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> power<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.340> day<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:35.580> age

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you need the power in this day and age

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
you need the power in this day and age
and<00:01:35.970> he<00:01:36.030> did<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> great<00:01:36.360> job<00:01:36.479> tonight<00:01:36.950> obviously

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and he did a great job tonight obviously

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
and he did a great job tonight obviously
something<00:01:38.759> he<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.180> used<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
something he has to get used to but I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.130 
something he has to get used to but I
thought<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.500> did<00:01:40.590> an<00:01:40.680> excellent<00:01:41.039> tonight<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
thought it did an excellent tonight and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.090 
thought it did an excellent tonight and
well<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.410> be<00:01:43.440> tough<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.830> beat<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.039> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
well it would be tough to beat in the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.469 
well it would be tough to beat in the
future<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.729> sure<00:01:44.850> well<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
future and that's for sure well you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
future and that's for sure well you
played<00:01:45.660> him<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:45.930> last<00:01:46.170> year<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.740> you're

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
played him here last year so you're

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.889 
played him here last year so you're
pretty<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> pretty<00:01:48.119> good<00:01:48.210> spot<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.570> see

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
pretty in a pretty good spot to see

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
pretty in a pretty good spot to see
where<00:01:49.200> he's<00:01:49.440> improved<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.190> what<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
where he's improved but what would you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
where he's improved but what would you
say<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.720> jump<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.170> last<00:01:52.350> year<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
say that the jump from last year to this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.400 
say that the jump from last year to this
year<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.280> anything<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.940> think<00:01:54.840> another<00:01:55.140> year

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
year is if anything I think another year

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.130 
year is if anything I think another year
of<00:01:55.440> experience<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.700> years<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.780> tour<00:01:57.960> go

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
of experience you know years on tour go

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.510 
of experience you know years on tour go
go<00:01:58.860> by<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.220> quickly<00:01:59.580> so<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:01.310> also<00:02:02.310> proved

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
go by really quickly so you also proved

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
go by really quickly so you also proved
extremely<00:02:02.670> fast<00:02:03.240> when<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:03.630> his<00:02:03.840> age<00:02:04.020> or

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
extremely fast when you're his age or

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.520 
extremely fast when you're his age or
any<00:02:04.590> junior<00:02:05.280> coming<00:02:05.580> through<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
any junior coming through so it's a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.749 
any junior coming through so it's a
third<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.649> fourth<00:02:07.860> year<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.130> tour<00:02:08.310> ready<00:02:08.550> so

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
third or fourth year on tour ready so

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.639 
third or fourth year on tour ready so
he's<00:02:08.850> learned<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> lot<00:02:09.329> and<00:02:09.600> at<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:10.410> point

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
he's learned a lot and at this point

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.100 
he's learned a lot and at this point
it's<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> details<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.209> because<00:02:12.959> it's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's the details really but because it's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.509 
it's the details really but because it's
still<00:02:13.260> very<00:02:13.380> young<00:02:13.500> he's<00:02:13.739> improving<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.370> it's

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
still very young he's improving so it's

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.550 
still very young he's improving so it's
important<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.850> take<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.329> right<00:02:16.230> things<00:02:16.440> out

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
important to take the right things out

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.020 
important to take the right things out
of<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.739> loss<00:02:16.890> because<00:02:17.100> usually<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.610> learn<00:02:17.760> more

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
of a loss because usually you learn more

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.850 
of a loss because usually you learn more
when<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.299> lose<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.870> when<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> win<00:02:19.739> you've

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
when you lose and when you win you've

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.039 
when you lose and when you win you've
got<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.100> take<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> confidence<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.870> been

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
got to take the confidence and it's been

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.270 
got to take the confidence and it's been
obviously<00:02:22.320> extremely<00:02:22.500> confident<00:02:23.160> because

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
obviously extremely confident because

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
obviously extremely confident because
it's<00:02:23.519> been<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> good<00:02:23.940> run<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.299> overall<00:02:24.570> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
it's been on a good run but overall I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.060 
it's been on a good run but overall I
just<00:02:24.989> think<00:02:25.140> he's<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> better<00:02:25.470> player<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.950> know

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
just think he's a better player you know

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.640 
just think he's a better player you know
more<00:02:26.430> mature<00:02:27.079> potentially<00:02:28.079> may<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.380> bit

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
more mature potentially may be a bit

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.819 
more mature potentially may be a bit
more<00:02:28.829> power<00:02:29.070> at<00:02:29.250> times<00:02:29.579> but<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:31.650> hard

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
more power at times but it's it's hard

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.319 
more power at times but it's it's hard
to<00:02:31.950> explain<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.880> whole<00:02:33.000> package

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
to explain it's just the whole package

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.470 
to explain it's just the whole package
is<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.350> bit<00:02:34.560> bit<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.739> bit<00:02:35.040> better<00:02:35.190> your<00:02:36.120> record

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
is a bit bit a bit better your record

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.569 
is a bit bit a bit better your record
against<00:02:37.019> players<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.799> their<00:02:37.920> home<00:02:38.100> country

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
against players in their home country

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.400

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
and Grand Slams incredible I think only

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.280 
and Grand Slams incredible I think only
twice<00:02:40.980> you've<00:02:41.310> lost<00:02:41.930> why<00:02:42.930> do<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.110> keep

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
twice you've lost why do you keep

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.990 
twice you've lost why do you keep

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
I'll try my best I think we've played

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.840 
I'll try my best I think we've played
three<00:03:28.080> times<00:03:28.110> maybe<00:03:28.530> maybe<00:03:29.040> 4<00:03:29.370> i'm<00:03:29.400> not<00:03:29.700> sure

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
three times maybe maybe 4 i'm not sure

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.280 
three times maybe maybe 4 i'm not sure
anymore<00:03:30.090> i<00:03:30.240> start<00:03:30.510> forgetting<00:03:30.720> matters<00:03:31.140> these

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
anymore i start forgetting matters these

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.970 
anymore i start forgetting matters these
days<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.840> every<00:03:33.840> one<00:03:34.020> of<00:03:34.050> them<00:03:34.200> was<00:03:34.590> extremely

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
days and every one of them was extremely

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.090 
days and every one of them was extremely
close<00:03:35.220> i<00:03:35.550> think<00:03:35.730> three<00:03:36.660> sets<00:03:36.960> or<00:03:37.290> 976<00:03:37.890> into

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
close i think three sets or 976 into

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.590 
close i think three sets or 976 into
third<00:03:38.280> even<00:03:38.460> so<00:03:38.820> i'm<00:03:38.970> looking<00:03:39.150> forward<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.540> a
