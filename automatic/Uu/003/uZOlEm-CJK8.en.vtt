let's see if any way no count you can
bounce<00:01:50.720> picking<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.810> stuff<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.960> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bounce picking up stuff and this is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.389 
bounce picking up stuff and this is

anyway<00:02:14.970> as<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.780> see<00:02:15.870> I'm<00:02:15.930> picking<00:02:16.200> up

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
anyway as you can see I'm picking up

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.170 
anyway as you can see I'm picking up
trees<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.130> pick<00:02:17.310> up<00:02:17.400> anything<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.820> roll<00:02:18.000> over

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
trees you pick up anything you roll over

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.650 
trees you pick up anything you roll over
and<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.280> that's<00:02:20.520> what<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:20.940> mod<00:02:21.150> asks

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
and that is it that's what this mod asks

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.980 
and that is it that's what this mod asks
how<00:02:22.350> cool<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:24.150> said<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.450> guess<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.840> is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
how cool is this like said I guess it is

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.990 
how cool is this like said I guess it is
I<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.860> says<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.190> mod<00:02:26.370> page<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
I think if it says on the mod page that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.350 
I think if it says on the mod page that
look<00:02:27.600> there<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.930> go<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.230> win

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
look there we go I win

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.860 
look there we go I win
merit<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.910> yet<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.120> says<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> my<00:02:33.630> paper

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
merit and yet it says on the my paper

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.800 
merit and yet it says on the my paper
that<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.710> fairly<00:02:34.950> CPU<00:02:35.640> intensive<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
that it is fairly CPU intensive so you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.570 
that it is fairly CPU intensive so you
want<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.110> reasonably<00:02:37.920> school<00:02:38.160> computer<00:02:38.490> to

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
want a reasonably school computer to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.190 
want a reasonably school computer to
