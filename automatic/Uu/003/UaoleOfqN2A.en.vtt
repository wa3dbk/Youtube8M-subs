 kitchen channel with me what experience 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.450
 they know it is not true and today we are going to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 make some rich egg loaves I do not know 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.530
 if you know him in your country if you 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.780
 they know with another name the chile that is 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.730
 my country I know it as egg 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.949
 and is a very traditional recipe that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.780
 ago from a lifetime for 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.820
 we make this type of bread cited 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.590
 sweets to accompany tea time 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.440
 summer 11 here I am going to leave you this 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.600
 recipe that is very easy and very rich we go 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.780
 to start with the ingredients in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.030
 beginning are of eggs carries eggs 6 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.660
 eggs we are going to occupy six games 6 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.110
 Yolks and five whites are worth 6 yolks and 5 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.770
 clear we are going to occupy a cup of sugar 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.320
 impalpable powdered sugar or powdered sugar 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.570
 as you know her in your country 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.250
 if they did not have this sugar if not 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.380
 they could buy the wave they almost only have 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.880
 granulated sugar is very easy to put one 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.789
 cup of this sugar inside the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.490
 blender toys as you know it and the 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.090
 they put at full speed and the sugar gets 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.920
 will transform immediately 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.550
 well then let's occupy flour 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.100
 normal flour without good dust I say 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.900
 dust because here in Spain the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.990
 Flour sells the film dust and dust 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.680
 of baking or chemical yeast as the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.020
 know 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.860
 it will sell part voucher then we will 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.230
 occupy 800 grams of flour and we are going to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.960
 occupy three quarters of dust envelopes 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.030
 to bake, it 's like this 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.790
 You acquired yeast powder because of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 royal for the dust that you have to 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.500
 hand to raise the dough worth 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.780
 I always always recommend them when 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.640
 prepare all kinds of cookies things with 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.550
 flours always have a place of inah 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.350
 extractor anything because always 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.270
 it can always be that the dough asks for a 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.850
 little bit more than flour worth 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.280
 let's occupy margarine margarine not 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.290
 occupy 150 grams of this margarine 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.150
 it can be from this as airlines but 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.730
 margarine vale 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.400
 and we're also going to occupy a little bit of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.739
 milk if the dough needs it I'm not going 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.780
 to say whether half and three quarters and 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.640
 will execute do not have a little milk to 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.739
 hand if you see that the mass asks you 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.540
 They should put a little milk better 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.359
 and we will also add half 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.549
 teaspoon of salt then now we 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.319
 let's go prepare these rich 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.349
 little plates of good good I here already 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.720
 I have the clear five clear and the 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.549
 I'm going to beat and I'm going to beat them almost to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.010
 snow point is worth if they want great 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.150
 snow point well but it is not necessary 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.150
 but if you have to beat the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.250
 once we have the keys already beaten 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.440
 how to continue beating the six themes the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.440
 margarine and sugar is worth 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.430
 m 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.040
 this well beaten that looks pretty 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.790
 plant we are going to add the average 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.790
 teaspoon of salt 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.590
 I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.870
 lemon zest 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.690
 this is optional that he likes is the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.000
 Lemon can put a little lemon 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.370
 if it is not necessary 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.670
 and I'm going to put half a teaspoon of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.670
 cinnamon 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.680
 good once they have fought well the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.689
 cinnamon and what they had applied to 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.430
 put them the whites that are already beaten 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.079
 ok in this world also should 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.840
 Get on the furnace to 180 grades 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.120
 approximately so that it is warm 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.099
 when we enter the field now we are going to 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.549
 add the whites and we will continue 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.549
 beating 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.470
 now let's add the flour that already 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.550
 is mixed with other powders and 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.010
 We will continue stirring until we get 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.010
 that a more compact mass is formed 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.479
 well once we see that it starts 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.490
 to put more compact obviously for the 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.229
 blender can not let go 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.750
 follow with a wooden spoon until 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.080
 we can start a little bit with the 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.080
 hands 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.160
 well now I'm with my hand 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:06.600
 finishing mixing the flour well 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:09.810
 It is loose on the sides and I will take it out 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.400
 I will not finish joining well and we will start 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.400
 to make the parasites 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.590
 we put it on the table with a little 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.860
 Of flour 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.009
 and we are going to pass it a little 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.520
 and we're going to start making our 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.520
 little steps 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.390
 to make this little step, let's go 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:38.200
 removing pelotitas already of the cut depends 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:42.169
 of finally they are not very big and we are going 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.200
 to make a kind of bread like that 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.020
 Y 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.190
 let's go leaving on the table that 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.190
 have in flour 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.700
 and 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.390
 and now that we have ready the 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.580
 transits then I did not go out 13 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.960
 steps to eat less calculate a 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.320
 little bit bigger can go less 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:32.340
 well what I'm going to do is make a 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.340
 cross here 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:39.479
 and I'm going to paint them with yolk with 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.479
 a little water 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.379
 good once you have everything 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:47.499
 ready to pass the oven tin that the 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:49.419

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:51.249
 we do not put paper or part of it 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.830
 butter like that and they'll put it in 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:56.289
 oven at approximately 280 degrees 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.020
 depending on where you since the 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:00.610
 180 degrees of 25 or 30 minutes worth 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.050
 when they are golden brown 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.419
