of pliers and go ahead and separate the
two<00:00:33.600> pieces<00:00:34.790> before<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> remove<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> exhaust

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
two pieces before I remove the exhaust

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
two pieces before I remove the exhaust
off<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> its<00:00:37.020> third<00:00:37.410> hanger<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.100> want<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
off of its third hanger we do want to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
off of its third hanger we do want to
put<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> support<00:00:38.790> strap<00:00:38.879> across<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> main

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410 
put a support strap across the main
exhaust<00:00:40.860> tube<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.760> reason<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.239> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
exhaust tube here the reason for this is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
exhaust tube here the reason for this is
once<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:42.989> remove<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> exhaust<00:00:44.160> off<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> its

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
once we remove the exhaust off of its

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
once we remove the exhaust off of its
third<00:00:44.789> hanger<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.510> system<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:46.350> want<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
third hanger the system will want to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
third hanger the system will want to
come<00:00:46.739> down<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> falls<00:00:48.030> too<00:00:48.270> far<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
come down and if it falls too far it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.670 
come down and if it falls too far it
will<00:00:48.629> damage<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.899> next<00:00:55.260> step<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
will damage it the next step with the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.900 
will damage it the next step with the
exhaust<00:00:55.980> lowered<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.579> ahead<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
exhaust lowered is to go ahead and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.430 
exhaust lowered is to go ahead and
remove<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> heat<00:00:57.449> shield<00:00:57.690> from<00:00:57.899> both<00:00:58.199> sides

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
remove the heat shield from both sides

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.090 
remove the heat shield from both sides
of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> vehicle

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
there are three bolts holding each heat

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
there are three bolts holding each heat
shield<00:01:01.949> into<00:01:02.129> place<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.969> also<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
shield into place and also on the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
shield into place and also on the

slide it on to the bolt leader followed
by<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> carriage<00:02:15.840> bolt<00:02:16.049> which<00:02:16.530> we're<00:02:16.650> going

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
by the carriage bolt which we're going

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.140 
by the carriage bolt which we're going
to<00:02:16.830> take<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> wrap<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.549> threads<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.090> bolt

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
to take and wrap the threads of the bolt

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.520 
to take and wrap the threads of the bolt
leader<00:02:18.450> around<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.170> threads<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.500> the

the other end of the bolt leader here to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.860 
the other end of the bolt leader here to
use<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.280> pull<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:24.000> clock<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.540> carriage

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
use that to pull the clock and carriage

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
use that to pull the clock and carriage
bolt<00:02:25.079> inside<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.500> frame<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.190> down<00:02:26.489> into

those<00:02:46.630> bolts<00:02:47.080> on<00:02:47.200> each<00:02:47.320> side<00:02:47.350> loose<00:02:48.040> for<00:02:48.250> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
those bolts on each side loose for the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.100 
those bolts on each side loose for the
time<00:02:48.490> being<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.330> next<00:02:49.570> step<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.990> go<00:02:50.080> ahead

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
time being the next step is to go ahead

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.450 
time being the next step is to go ahead
and<00:02:50.290> put<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.440> heat<00:02:50.590> shield<00:02:50.830> back<00:02:51.010> into<00:02:51.250> place

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
and put the heat shield back into place

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.950

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
with the heat shield is basically pinch

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.410 
with the heat shield is basically pinch
it<00:03:01.300> in<00:03:01.510> between<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:02.590> hitch<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:02.980> frame
