with some bits and pieces I still got

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.440 
with some bits and pieces I still got
lots<00:00:08.770> from<00:00:09.219> my<00:00:09.400> last<00:00:09.610> news<00:00:09.910> blog<00:00:10.240> that<00:00:10.389> I

lots from my last news blog that I

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.820 
lots from my last news blog that I
haven't<00:00:10.630> got<00:00:10.780> around<00:00:10.960> to<00:00:11.170> doing<00:00:11.469> that

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
haven't got around to doing that

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.830 
haven't got around to doing that
shouldn't<00:00:12.190> finally<00:00:12.580> be<00:00:12.730> up<00:00:12.879> next<00:00:13.330> week<00:00:13.660> but

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
shouldn't finally be up next week but

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.570 
shouldn't finally be up next week but
the<00:00:13.930> first<00:00:14.080> thing<00:00:14.289> revealed<00:00:14.619> yesterday<00:00:14.799> was<00:00:15.549> a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
the first thing revealed yesterday was a

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.880 
the first thing revealed yesterday was a
new<00:00:15.789> thrustmaster<00:00:16.570> Adam<00:00:16.900> will<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.260> 458

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
new thrustmaster Adam will the 458

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.359 
new thrustmaster Adam will the 458
challenge<00:00:18.400> which<00:00:18.970> you<00:00:19.150> can<00:00:19.330> see<00:00:19.360> here<00:00:19.599> so<00:00:20.500> it's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
challenge which you can see here so it's

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.220 
challenge which you can see here so it's
an<00:00:21.519> add-on<00:00:21.670> which<00:00:22.119> basically<00:00:22.539> brings<00:00:22.990> the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
an add-on which basically brings the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.460 
an add-on which basically brings the
option<00:00:23.589> of<00:00:24.539> gear<00:00:25.539> paddles<00:00:25.929> actually<00:00:26.199> attached

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
option of gear paddles actually attached

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.800 
option of gear paddles actually attached
to<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.800> wheel<00:00:26.949> which<00:00:27.310> which<00:00:27.939> is<00:00:28.179> essential

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
to the wheel which which is essential

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.509 
to the wheel which which is essential
basically<00:00:29.439> I<00:00:29.470> always<00:00:29.830> thought<00:00:30.009> that<00:00:30.070> was<00:00:30.310> on

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
basically I always thought that was on

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.829 
basically I always thought that was on
the<00:00:30.609> biggest<00:00:30.820> failings<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.509> when<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.689> play

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
the biggest failings and when you play

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.960 
the biggest failings and when you play
something<00:00:31.990> like<00:00:32.080> a<00:00:32.169> rally<00:00:32.470> game<00:00:32.800> it's<00:00:33.730> it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
something like a rally game it's it's

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.010 
something like a rally game it's it's
impossible<00:00:34.600> because<00:00:34.780> you're<00:00:34.930> constantly

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
impossible because you're constantly

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.570 
impossible because you're constantly
telling<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.740> wheel<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.100> you're<00:00:36.220> constantly

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
telling the wheel and you're constantly

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.760 
telling the wheel and you're constantly
changing<00:00:37.060> gear<00:00:37.270> it's<00:00:37.810> just<00:00:37.990> a<00:00:38.080> nightmare<00:00:38.290> its

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
changing gear it's just a nightmare its

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.470 
changing gear it's just a nightmare its
hands<00:00:39.070> all<00:00:39.160> over<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.490> place<00:00:39.730> one<00:00:40.300> thing<00:00:40.420> is

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
hands all over the place one thing is

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.520 
hands all over the place one thing is
you<00:00:40.600> shouldn't<00:00:40.780> be<00:00:40.960> really<00:00:41.140> need<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.410> be

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
you shouldn't be really need to be

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.900 
you shouldn't be really need to be
moving<00:00:41.740> your<00:00:41.950> hands<00:00:42.130> around<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.490> wheel<00:00:42.670> when

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
moving your hands around the wheel when

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.550 
moving your hands around the wheel when
you<00:00:43.030> always<00:00:43.450> did<00:00:43.660> on<00:00:43.810> that<00:00:43.840> so<00:00:44.170> I<00:00:44.200> know<00:00:44.320> she<00:00:44.380> had

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
you always did on that so I know she had

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.860 
you always did on that so I know she had
a<00:00:44.590> car<00:00:44.770> very<00:00:45.100> few<00:00:45.460> gears<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:46.330> was<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:46.570> bit<00:00:46.750> of<00:00:46.840> a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
a car very few gears it was a bit of a

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.570 
a car very few gears it was a bit of a
nightmare<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.470> this<00:00:47.680> is<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.860> very<00:00:48.040> welcome

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
nightmare so this is a very welcome

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.390 
nightmare so this is a very welcome
addition<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:50.320> look<00:00:50.440> at<00:00:50.560> the<00:00:50.620> wheel<00:00:50.770> next<00:00:51.280> to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
addition you look at the wheel next to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.520 
addition you look at the wheel next to
the<00:00:51.490> rear<00:00:51.700> wheel<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.180> it<00:00:53.050> doesn't<00:00:53.320> have<00:00:53.440> those

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
the rear wheel and it doesn't have those

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.080 
the rear wheel and it doesn't have those
two<00:00:53.770> yellow<00:00:54.100> buttons<00:00:54.490> and<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.730> doesn't<00:00:54.970> have

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
two yellow buttons and it doesn't have

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.580 
two yellow buttons and it doesn't have
the<00:00:55.120> material<00:00:55.720> around<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.080> wheel<00:00:56.260> so

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
the material around the wheel so

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.320 
the material around the wheel so
immediately<00:00:57.100> it's<00:00:57.220> not<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.610> perfect<00:00:57.910> replica

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
immediately it's not a perfect replica

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.270 
immediately it's not a perfect replica
then<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.020> I<00:00:59.320> think<00:00:59.500> that's<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.740> bit<00:00:59.890> of<00:00:59.980> a<00:01:00.040> shame

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
then and I think that's a bit of a shame

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.740 
then and I think that's a bit of a shame
I<00:01:00.310> think<00:01:00.670> they<00:01:00.760> had<00:01:00.880> a<00:01:00.910> real<00:01:01.090> opportunity<00:01:01.330> here

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
I think they had a real opportunity here

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.360 
I think they had a real opportunity here
how<00:01:02.290> much<00:01:02.440> would<00:01:02.590> it<00:01:02.620> cost<00:01:02.860> for<00:01:02.980> those<00:01:03.160> two

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
how much would it cost for those two

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.460 
how much would it cost for those two
extra<00:01:03.640> yellow<00:01:03.910> buttons<00:01:04.269> and<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> material

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
extra yellow buttons and the material

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.749 
extra yellow buttons and the material
that<00:01:05.619> goes<00:01:05.740> round<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.070> wheel<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.490> make<00:01:06.640> it

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
that goes round the wheel to make it

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.240 
that goes round the wheel to make it
look<00:01:06.880> absolutely<00:01:07.540> authentic<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:08.590> don't<00:01:09.100> know<00:01:09.220> I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
look absolutely authentic I don't know I

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.040 
look absolutely authentic I don't know I
suppose<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.760> always<00:01:09.940> comes<00:01:10.120> down<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.330> cost<00:01:10.720> but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
suppose it always comes down to cost but

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.750 
suppose it always comes down to cost but
in<00:01:11.380> actual<00:01:11.740> fact<00:01:11.800> it<00:01:12.160> does<00:01:12.310> just<00:01:12.550> look<00:01:12.730> like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
in actual fact it does just look like

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.580 
in actual fact it does just look like
the<00:01:13.000> current<00:01:13.210> wheel<00:01:13.480> that<00:01:13.930> just<00:01:14.170> had<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> couple

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
the current wheel that just had a couple

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.370 
the current wheel that just had a couple
of<00:01:14.770> extra<00:01:15.700> bits<00:01:15.880> put<00:01:16.120> onto<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:17.050> extra

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
of extra bits put onto it and the extra

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.100 
of extra bits put onto it and the extra
sort<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.770> gear<00:01:18.370> paddles<00:01:18.730> as<00:01:18.909> well<00:01:19.150> not<00:01:19.810> quite

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
sort of gear paddles as well not quite

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.350 
sort of gear paddles as well not quite
what<00:01:20.409> we<00:01:20.440> were<00:01:20.680> hoping<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:21.190> but<00:01:21.580> either<00:01:21.880> way<00:01:22.120> a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
what we were hoping for but either way a

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.360 
what we were hoping for but either way a
welcome<00:01:22.810> addition<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.500> apparently<00:01:23.860> there<00:01:24.250> is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
welcome addition and apparently there is

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.830 
welcome addition and apparently there is
a<00:01:24.400> way<00:01:24.610> that<00:01:24.820> you<00:01:24.850> can<00:01:25.030> quickly<00:01:25.270> remove<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
a way that you can quickly remove the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.540 
a way that you can quickly remove the
pedals<00:01:26.680> are<00:01:26.740> actually<00:01:27.010> attached<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
pedals are actually attached to the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.920 
pedals are actually attached to the
wheel<00:01:27.700> as<00:01:27.909> well<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.300> we<00:01:28.420> look<00:01:28.540> forward<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.840> that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
wheel as well so we look forward to that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
it's a very impressive upgrade for the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.620 
it's a very impressive upgrade for the
wheel<00:01:52.390> because<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.320> can<00:01:53.500> see<00:01:53.650> mine<00:01:53.920> here

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
wheel because you can see mine here

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.910 
wheel because you can see mine here
which<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.780> mainly<00:01:55.960> more<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.290> an<00:01:56.380> ornament<00:01:56.710> at

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
which is mainly more of an ornament at

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.160 
which is mainly more of an ornament at
the<00:01:57.010> moment<00:01:57.310> these<00:01:57.430> days<00:01:57.729> mainly<00:01:58.720> because<00:01:58.960> on

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
the moment these days mainly because on

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.350 
the moment these days mainly because on
console<00:01:59.590> at<00:01:59.740> least<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.700> wheel<00:02:00.820> didn't<00:02:01.119> handle

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
console at least the wheel didn't handle

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.719 
console at least the wheel didn't handle
as<00:02:01.479> well<00:02:01.510> for<00:02:01.930> me<00:02:01.960> with<00:02:02.409> their<00:02:02.590> f1<00:02:02.799> say

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.910 
as well for me with their f1 say
something<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.240> g25<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.320> it's<00:02:05.710> very

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
something like the g25 so it's very

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.249 
something like the g25 so it's very
different<00:02:06.159> when<00:02:06.670> using<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.119> on<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.330> pc<00:02:07.540> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
different when using it on the pc the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.440 
different when using it on the pc the
addon<00:02:08.530> looks<00:02:08.769> pretty<00:02:09.489> remarkable<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.209> has<00:02:10.330> to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
addon looks pretty remarkable it has to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
weighing up the cost in terms of value

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.750 
weighing up the cost in terms of value
something<00:02:17.440> good<00:02:17.620> enough<00:02:17.890> well<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.160> always<00:02:18.550> say

something good enough well I always say
it<00:02:19.570> depends<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.020> how<00:02:20.170> much<00:02:20.320> you're<00:02:20.500> going<00:02:20.680> to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
it depends on how much you're going to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.260 
it depends on how much you're going to
use<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:21.370> you're<00:02:21.520> going<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> value

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
use it if you're going to get the value

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.180 
use it if you're going to get the value
from<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.200> don't<00:02:23.320> live<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.130> you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
from it if you don't live one and you

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.740 
from it if you don't live one and you
love<00:02:24.340> open-wheel<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.090> that's<00:02:25.210> all<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.480> play

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
love open-wheel and that's all you play

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.570 
love open-wheel and that's all you play
then<00:02:26.380> you'll<00:02:26.710> get<00:02:26.860> your<00:02:26.980> value<00:02:27.310> because

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
then you'll get your value because

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.220 
then you'll get your value because
you'll<00:02:27.730> be<00:02:27.820> using<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.210> day<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.630> day<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:28.810> and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
you'll be using that day in day out and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.930 
you'll be using that day in day out and
it's<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.500> best<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.830> were<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.220> get<00:02:30.430> even

going to play it all the time and it's
going<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.520> make<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.730> part<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.360> your<00:02:37.450> collection

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
going to make a part of your collection

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.200 
going to make a part of your collection
I<00:02:38.110> think<00:02:38.680> if<00:02:38.830> if<00:02:39.010> you're<00:02:39.220> kind<00:02:39.460> of<00:02:39.520> like<00:02:39.670> yeah

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
I think if if you're kind of like yeah

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.520 
I think if if you're kind of like yeah
but<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.450> play<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> bit<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.960> this<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.320> play<00:02:41.500> a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
but I play a bit of this and I play a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.350 
but I play a bit of this and I play a
bit<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:41.920> well<00:02:42.700> then<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:42.970> have<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.210> weigh

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
bit of that well then you have to weigh

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.700 
bit of that well then you have to weigh
up<00:02:43.510> what<00:02:43.840> else<00:02:43.990> that<00:02:44.050> money<00:02:44.380> could<00:02:44.560> actually

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
up what else that money could actually

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.310 
up what else that money could actually
buy<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.720> probably<00:02:46.720> several<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.140> lot<00:02:47.230> of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
buy you I probably several a lot of

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.350 
buy you I probably several a lot of
steering<00:02:47.650> wheels<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.820> certainly

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
steering wheels so it's certainly

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
steering wheels so it's certainly
something<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.690> people<00:02:50.020> are<00:02:50.080> going<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.290> have

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
something that people are going to have

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.200 
something that people are going to have
to<00:02:50.530> weigh<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.070> either<00:02:51.190> way<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.090> see

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
to weigh up but either way you can see

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.970 
to weigh up but either way you can see
the<00:02:52.330> videos<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.690> they've<00:02:53.050> been<00:02:53.080> showing<00:02:53.770> on

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.050 
say I think it shows you know both sides
where<00:03:05.410> they're<00:03:05.530> trying<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.800> decide<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.910> it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
where they're trying to decide is it

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970 
where they're trying to decide is it
could<00:03:07.330> wheel<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.810> worth<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.230> money<00:03:08.380> you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
could wheel is it worth the money you

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.800 
could wheel is it worth the money you
know<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.640> can<00:03:09.790> tell<00:03:09.910> they<00:03:10.030> really<00:03:10.060> like<00:03:10.600> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
know you can tell they really like the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.380 
know you can tell they really like the
wheel<00:03:10.990> so<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:11.980> it's<00:03:12.280> again<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.270> say

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
wheel so I think it's again as I say

wheel so I think it's again as I say
it's<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:13.630> down<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.430> see<00:03:15.670> as<00:03:15.790> value

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
it's all down to what you see as value

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.290 
it's all down to what you see as value

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
for the developers as well so i think

get that out there i think games all
games<00:03:43.270> really<00:03:43.959> should<00:03:44.230> have<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.410> demo<00:03:44.680> because
