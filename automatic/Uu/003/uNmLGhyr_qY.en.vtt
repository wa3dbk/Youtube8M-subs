other base in this example since we're

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.270 
other base in this example since we're
asked<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.610> find<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.149> length<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.840> base<00:00:34.280> let's

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
asked to find the length of a base let's

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.580 
asked to find the length of a base let's
use<00:00:35.550> our<00:00:35.730> formula<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> area<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
use our formula for the area of a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.000 
use our formula for the area of a
trapezoid<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.579> involves<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> bases<00:00:40.170> which

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
trapezoid that involves the bases which

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.500 
trapezoid that involves the bases which
is<00:00:41.250> area<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.629> trapezoid<00:00:43.670> equals<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:45.210> half

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
is area of a trapezoid equals one half

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.700 
is area of a trapezoid equals one half
height<00:00:46.050> times<00:00:47.030> parentheses<00:00:48.030> base<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.379> plus

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
height times parentheses base one plus

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.389 
height times parentheses base one plus
base<00:00:50.219> two<00:00:52.160> we<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> area<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.510> 91<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
base two we know that the area is 91 the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.490 
base two we know that the area is 91 the
height<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.969> 14<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> bases<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.879> 10

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
height is 14 and one of the bases is 10

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.230 
height is 14 and one of the bases is 10
so<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.829> set<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> equation<00:01:03.350> 91<00:01:05.240> equals

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so we can set up the equation 91 equals

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.350 
so we can set up the equation 91 equals
one<00:01:06.720> half<00:01:07.100> times<00:01:08.119> 14<00:01:09.119> times<00:01:10.250> parentheses<00:01:11.360> 10

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
one half times 14 times parentheses 10

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
one half times 14 times parentheses 10
plus<00:01:12.930> base<00:01:13.650> two<00:01:15.409> now<00:01:16.409> simplifying<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
plus base two now simplifying on the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.630 
plus base two now simplifying on the
right<00:01:18.060> side<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:19.320> half<00:01:19.619> times<00:01:20.070> 14<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.090> 7<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> we

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
right side one half times 14 is 7 so we

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.240 
right side one half times 14 is 7 so we
have<00:01:23.820> 91<00:01:25.250> equals<00:01:26.250> seven<00:01:26.850> times<00:01:27.180> parentheses

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
have 91 equals seven times parentheses

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.999 
have 91 equals seven times parentheses
10<00:01:29.250> plus<00:01:29.790> b2<00:01:32.479> next<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.750> distribute<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.530> seven

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
10 plus b2 next we distribute the seven

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
10 plus b2 next we distribute the seven
through<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> parentheses<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> right

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
through the parentheses on the right

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.389 
through the parentheses on the right
side<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.869> 91<00:01:40.340> equals<00:01:41.360> seventy<00:01:42.380> plus<00:01:43.399> seven

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
side to get 91 equals seventy plus seven

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.550 
side to get 91 equals seventy plus seven
times<00:01:44.759> b2<00:01:46.729> now<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> b2<00:01:48.869> term<00:01:49.229> by

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
times b2 now to get the b2 term by

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
times b2 now to get the b2 term by
itself<00:01:49.939> we<00:01:50.939> subtract<00:01:51.479> 70<00:01:52.170> from<00:01:52.439> both<00:01:52.649> sides

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.540 

and<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.800> have<00:01:59.010> 21<00:02:00.290> equals<00:02:01.640> 7<00:02:02.640> B<00:02:03.090> 2<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.550> dividing

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
and we have 21 equals 7 B 2 and dividing

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.590 
and we have 21 equals 7 B 2 and dividing
both<00:02:05.730> sides<00:02:05.790> by<00:02:06.360> 7<00:02:08.690> we<00:02:09.690> find<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.200> 3<00:02:11.270> equals<00:02:12.270> B

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
both sides by 7 we find that 3 equals B

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.900 
both sides by 7 we find that 3 equals B
2<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.150> length<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.600> base<00:02:18.900> 2<00:02:19.410> or<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.730> other

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
2 so the length of base 2 or the other

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.700 
2 so the length of base 2 or the other
base<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> trapezoid<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.770> 3
