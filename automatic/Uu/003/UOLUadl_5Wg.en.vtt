you

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.920 

I<00:00:30.529> wasn't<00:00:31.460> thinking<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:31.939> could<00:00:32.119> rotate<00:00:32.300> that

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
I wasn't thinking I could rotate that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.819 
I wasn't thinking I could rotate that
far<00:00:33.260> but<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.670> had<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:35.840> much<00:00:35.989> speed<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.800> uh

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
far but I had so much speed and and uh

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.240 
far but I had so much speed and and uh
and<00:00:37.790> height<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:38.840> then<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.230> wind<00:00:39.500> was<00:00:39.770> you

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
and height and then the wind was you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.130 
and height and then the wind was you
know<00:00:40.370> really<00:00:40.640> pinning<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.059> board<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:41.510> my<00:00:41.660> feet

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
know really pinning the board on my feet

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.979 
know really pinning the board on my feet
so<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:42.670> was<00:00:43.670> able<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.940> get<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.300> tail<00:00:44.540> back

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
so I was able to get the tail back

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.799 
so I was able to get the tail back
towards<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.379> beach<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:47.570> then<00:00:47.690> when<00:00:47.780> I

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
towards the beach and and then when I

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.569 
towards the beach and and then when I
landed<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.320> was<00:00:48.440> surprised<00:00:48.800> I<00:00:48.920> was<00:00:49.040> so<00:00:49.280> stable

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
landed I was surprised I was so stable

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.890 
landed I was surprised I was so stable
on<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.030> board<00:00:50.239> I'm<00:00:50.360> Michael<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:50.659> think<00:00:50.780> I'm

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
on the board I'm Michael I think I'm

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.899 
on the board I'm Michael I think I'm
gonna<00:00:50.989> make<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.409> so<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.589> just<00:00:51.800> rolled<00:00:52.519> out<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.699> it

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
gonna make it so I just rolled out of it

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.610 
gonna make it so I just rolled out of it
just<00:00:53.360> rotated<00:00:53.839> back<00:00:53.989> out<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.430> was<00:00:56.089> it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
just rotated back out and that was it

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.619 
just rotated back out and that was it
before<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.680> thought<00:00:57.829> about<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.309> was<00:00:58.400> done

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
before I thought about it it was done

for errors you know like coming into the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.340 
for errors you know like coming into the
right<00:01:07.700> it's<00:01:08.090> really<00:01:08.390> good<00:01:08.540> for<00:01:08.689> for<00:01:09.140> trying

right it's really good for for trying
big<00:01:09.530> rotations<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.299> Kolo<00:01:11.299> he<00:01:11.450> kept<00:01:11.630> saying

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
big rotations and Kolo he kept saying

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.810 
big rotations and Kolo he kept saying
that<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.010> then<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.220> caught<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.490> wave<00:01:13.670> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
that and then I caught that wave and

that and then I caught that wave and
then<00:01:13.939> I<00:01:14.240> guess<00:01:14.750> they<00:01:14.900> saw<00:01:15.110> me<00:01:15.259> go<00:01:15.380> up<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:15.650> they

an<00:01:44.540> early<00:01:44.870> to<00:01:45.110> real<00:01:45.440> sink<00:01:45.860> all<00:01:46.010> in<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:46.430> what

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
an early to real sink all in but what

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.100 
an early to real sink all in but what
would<00:01:46.820> what<00:01:47.300> your<00:01:47.420> thoughts<00:01:47.659> about<00:01:47.780> that

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
would what your thoughts about that

simply<00:01:48.740> wanted<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.280> accomplish<00:01:49.550> or<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.630> like

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
simply wanted to accomplish or it's like

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.040 
simply wanted to accomplish or it's like
ah<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.100> know<00:01:52.220> there's<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:53.210> surfing

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
ah and you know there's in surfing

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.719 
ah and you know there's in surfing
because<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.320> board<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:54.800> big<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.340> can't<00:01:55.550> use

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
because the board so big you can't use

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.280 
because the board so big you can't use
you<00:01:56.120> know<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.300> can't<00:01:56.600> spin<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.080> like<00:01:57.260> a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
you know you can't spin it like a

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.260 
you know you can't spin it like a
skateboard<00:01:57.920> or<00:01:58.070> whatever<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.520> it's<00:01:58.670> it's<00:01:58.970> rare

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
skateboard or whatever so it's it's rare

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.480 
skateboard or whatever so it's it's rare
to<00:01:59.299> get<00:01:59.510> new

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
to get new

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340 
to get new
maneuvers<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:01.210> know<00:02:01.299> it's<00:02:01.960> really<00:02:02.079> rare<00:02:02.320> to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
maneuvers you know it's really rare to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.060 
maneuvers you know it's really rare to
make<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.619> new<00:02:02.799> maneuver<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.619> know<00:02:05.740> only

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
make a new maneuver so you know only

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.710 
make a new maneuver so you know only
only<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> couple<00:02:06.759> times<00:02:06.939> my<00:02:07.090> life<00:02:07.270> I've<00:02:07.570> I've

only a couple times my life I've I've

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.210 
only a couple times my life I've I've
been<00:02:07.990> working<00:02:08.319> on<00:02:08.410> something<00:02:08.709> new<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.130> I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
been working on something new and I

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.140 
been working on something new and I
wasn't<00:02:09.520> really<00:02:09.700> been<00:02:09.789> working<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.420> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
wasn't really been working on that you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.640 
wasn't really been working on that you
know<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.180> guess<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.569> rodeo<00:02:13.900> clown<00:02:14.140> was<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> new

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
know I guess the rodeo clown was a new

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.830 
know I guess the rodeo clown was a new
one<00:02:14.860> air<00:02:15.099> reverses<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.910> early<00:02:16.390> day<00:02:16.540> you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
one air reverses in the early day you

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.990 
one air reverses in the early day you
know<00:02:16.959> in<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> late<00:02:17.349> 80s<00:02:17.800> early<00:02:18.370> 90s<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.880> was

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
know in the late 80s early 90s that was

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.580 
know in the late 80s early 90s that was
like<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.360> new<00:02:19.480> thing<00:02:19.720> we<00:02:19.840> were<00:02:19.930> trying<00:02:20.080> to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
like the new thing we were trying to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.780 
like the new thing we were trying to
actually<00:02:20.769> get<00:02:21.160> in<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> air

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
actually get in the air

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.350 
actually get in the air
off<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.690> lip<00:02:22.920> instead<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> nollie<00:02:24.910> all

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
off the lip instead of like a nollie all

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.630 
off the lip instead of like a nollie all
you<00:02:25.660> know<00:02:26.019> instead<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.580> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
you know instead of like a like just a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.220 
you know instead of like a like just a
hop<00:02:27.849> we<00:02:28.120> were<00:02:28.239> trying<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.810> proper

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
hop we were trying to do like a proper

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.229 
hop we were trying to do like a proper
air<00:02:29.440> with<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.769> reverse<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.940> was<00:02:31.090> like

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
air with the reverse and that was like

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.160 
air with the reverse and that was like
an<00:02:31.390> 89

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
an 89

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.580 
an 89
around<00:02:32.799> that<00:02:32.920> time<00:02:32.950> 90<00:02:34.290> when<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.380> first

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
around that time 90 when we first

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.880 
around that time 90 when we first
started<00:02:35.860> making<00:02:36.100> those<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.380> know<00:02:38.470> like

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
started making those and you know like

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.360 
started making those and you know like
doing<00:02:39.160> tail<00:02:39.370> slides<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:41.860> reverse

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
doing tail slides to to like reverse

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.820 
doing tail slides to to like reverse
slides<00:02:42.670> those<00:02:43.540> were<00:02:43.750> new<00:02:44.140> moves<00:02:44.380> back<00:02:44.620> then

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
slides those were new moves back then

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.350 
slides those were new moves back then
and<00:02:45.069> stuff<00:02:45.280> but

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.480 

yes<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.260> not<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:49.740> not<00:02:49.890> often<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
yes it's not it's not often you know the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.760 
yes it's not it's not often you know the
flip<00:02:50.760> was<00:02:50.970> probably<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.330> last<00:02:51.540> new<00:02:52.350> manoeuvre

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
flip was probably the last new manoeuvre

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.140 
flip was probably the last new manoeuvre
and<00:02:53.100> then<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.870> 720<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> loop<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:56.150> that

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and then the the 720 a loop that that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.090 
and then the the 720 a loop that that
Albee<00:02:57.450> did

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.560 

you<00:03:01.670> know<00:03:01.790> they<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:01.940> think<00:03:02.060> there's<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.390> few

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
you know they I think there's a few

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.510 
you know they I think there's a few
different<00:03:02.840> rotations<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.590> 720<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.250> you

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
different rotations of the 720 that you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.140 
different rotations of the 720 that you
can<00:03:04.670> do<00:03:04.790> more<00:03:05.120> inverted<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.870> railgrab<00:03:06.260> but

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
can do more inverted and railgrab but

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.610 
can do more inverted and railgrab but
you<00:03:08.629> know<00:03:08.750> I've<00:03:08.840> never<00:03:08.959> really<00:03:09.080> tried<00:03:09.440> him

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
you know I've never really tried him

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.009 
you know I've never really tried him
reverse<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.519> just<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.390> know<00:03:11.450> if<00:03:11.629> you<00:03:11.720> can<00:03:11.870> get

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
reverse I just you know if you can get

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.229 
reverse I just you know if you can get
high<00:03:12.200> enough<00:03:12.470> that's<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> problem<00:03:13.819> is<00:03:14.000> like

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
high enough that's the problem is like

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.780 
high enough that's the problem is like
getting<00:03:14.660> high<00:03:14.870> enough<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.440> then<00:03:16.129> being<00:03:16.670> able

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
getting high enough and then being able

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.490 
getting high enough and then being able
to<00:03:16.910> land<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.450> enough<00:03:17.720> stability<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.410> know

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
to land with enough stability you know

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.320 
to land with enough stability you know
enough<00:03:18.769> just<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.400> stick<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:19.970> thing<00:03:20.180> and

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
enough just like stick the thing and

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.630 
enough just like stick the thing and
then<00:03:20.450> be<00:03:21.140> fine<00:03:21.410> like<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:21.890> landed<00:03:22.099> that<00:03:22.340> couldn't

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
then be fine like I landed that couldn't

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.910 
then be fine like I landed that couldn't
believe<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:22.910> was<00:03:22.940> on<00:03:23.060> my<00:03:23.180> feet<00:03:23.360> now<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.379> simply

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
believe I was on my feet now so simply

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.009 
believe I was on my feet now so simply
have<00:03:25.160> now<00:03:25.340> yes<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:25.819> good<00:03:26.000> feeling<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.720> mean

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
have now yes this good feeling I mean

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.800 
have now yes this good feeling I mean
like<00:03:27.200> pk<00:03:27.650> was<00:03:27.830> saying<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.400> are<00:03:28.670> too<00:03:28.970> old<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.660> do

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
like pk was saying you are too old to do

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.630 
like pk was saying you are too old to do
