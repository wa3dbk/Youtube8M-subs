00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
one strand of cotton and that gives me a

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.380 
one strand of cotton and that gives me a
cord<00:02:55.650> that's<00:02:56.630> quite<00:02:57.630> it's<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.940> slender<00:02:59.940> but

strong cord now if I wanted a thicker

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.240 
strong cord now if I wanted a thicker
cord<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.959> could<00:03:06.959> use<00:03:07.110> two<00:03:07.560> strands<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.099> this

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
cord I could use two strands of this

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.270 
cord I could use two strands of this
court<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.849> this<00:03:09.120> yarn<00:03:09.420> held<00:03:09.599> together<00:03:09.780> or<00:03:10.560> I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
court of this yarn held together or I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.229 
court of this yarn held together or I
could<00:03:11.760> use<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.180> thicker<00:03:12.540> yarn<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.500> see<00:03:14.239> what's

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
could use a thicker yarn like see what's

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.690 
could use a thicker yarn like see what's
this<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.720> one<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.340> nature's<00:03:17.340> choice

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
this one this one is nature's choice

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.849 
this one this one is nature's choice
organic<00:03:18.480> cotton<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:21.120> use<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:22.620> a

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
organic cotton and you can use just a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
even a bigger cord use two strands of

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.960 
even a bigger cord use two strands of
that<00:03:27.150> held<00:03:27.420> together<00:03:27.600> if<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:29.069> use<00:03:29.400> two

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
that held together if you use two

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.840 
that held together if you use two
strands<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.870> very<00:03:31.680> fine<00:03:32.130> cord<00:03:32.720> yarn<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:34.109> me

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
strands of very fine cord yarn for me

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.080 
strands of very fine cord yarn for me
that<00:03:35.850> makes<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.359> slightly<00:03:37.019> thicker<00:03:37.819> cord<00:03:38.819> than

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that makes a slightly thicker cord than

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.539 
that makes a slightly thicker cord than
if<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.329> use<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.140> single<00:03:40.350> strand<00:03:40.799> the

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
if you use just a single strand the

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.360 
if you use just a single strand the
benefit<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.329> working<00:03:42.510> now<00:03:43.109> this<00:03:43.319> is<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:44.160> one

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
benefit of working now this is this one

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.170 
benefit of working now this is this one
is<00:03:44.780> vanna's<00:03:45.780> choice<00:03:45.980> glamour<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.609> so<00:03:48.060> it's

it's got the glitter the benefit of
working<00:03:54.239> with<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.750> two<00:03:54.959> pegs<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:56.220> you

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
working with just two pegs is that you

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.330 
working with just two pegs is that you
will<00:03:57.239> get<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:58.319> cord<00:03:58.889> that<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:01.350> much<00:04:01.889> denser

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
will get a cord that is a much denser

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.539 
will get a cord that is a much denser
cord<00:04:03.180> when<00:04:04.079> you're<00:04:04.200> working<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:04.560> fine<00:04:05.010> yarns

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
definitely work with just two pegs so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.700 
definitely work with just two pegs so
here's

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
here's

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.870 
here's
two<00:04:26.460> strands<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.180> yarn<00:04:27.389> held<00:04:27.930> together<00:04:28.880> so

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
two strands of yarn held together so

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.670 
two strands of yarn held together so
there<00:04:30.479> you<00:04:30.630> go<00:04:30.870> there's<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:34.020> two

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
there you go there's that that two

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.089 
there you go there's that that two
strands<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.370> five<00:04:35.900> see<00:04:36.900> it's<00:04:37.139> still<00:04:37.560> finer

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
strands of five see it's still finer

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:44.300 
strands of five see it's still finer
than<00:04:38.819> the<00:04:40.340> single<00:04:41.340> strand<00:04:41.729> of<00:04:42.979> what<00:04:43.979> we<00:04:44.099> call

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
than the single strand of what we call

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.839 
than the single strand of what we call
dish<00:04:44.639> cloth<00:04:44.849> cotton<00:04:45.060> commonly<00:04:46.050> now<00:04:46.860> what<00:04:47.639> if

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
dish cloth cotton commonly now what if

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.350 
dish cloth cotton commonly now what if
you<00:04:48.030> wanted<00:04:48.509> to<00:04:48.630> do<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:48.889> using<00:04:49.889> your<00:04:50.430> regular

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
you wanted to do that using your regular

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.689 
you wanted to do that using your regular
four<00:04:52.080> peg<00:04:52.380> spool<00:04:52.770> knitter<00:04:52.979> can<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.370> do<00:04:53.520> that

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
four peg spool knitter can you do that

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.900 
four peg spool knitter can you do that
of<00:04:54.000> course<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.389> can<00:04:55.130> you're<00:04:56.130> going<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.639> ignore

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
of course you can you're going to ignore

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.420 
of course you can you're going to ignore
the<00:04:57.630> pegs<00:04:57.900> on<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.229> back<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.860> spoon<00:04:59.099> header

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
the pegs on the back of the spoon header

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.460 
the pegs on the back of the spoon header
you're<00:05:00.090> just<00:05:00.389> going<00:05:00.599> to<00:05:00.660> use<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.960> two<00:05:01.169> front

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
you're just going to use the two front

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.529 
you're just going to use the two front
ones<00:05:01.710> now<00:05:02.370> in<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.849> technique<00:05:03.210> I'm<00:05:03.330> going<00:05:03.419> to

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
ones now in the technique I'm going to

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.180 
ones now in the technique I'm going to
show<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.750> right<00:05:03.960> now<00:05:04.020> you're<00:05:04.590> not<00:05:04.860> going<00:05:05.130> to
