I guess I got to buy a new gas tank that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.310 
I guess I got to buy a new gas tank that
is<00:03:35.670> really<00:03:36.390> really<00:03:36.900> really<00:03:37.770> weird<00:03:38.570> so<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.600> have

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320

no idea what would have caused that

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.180 
no idea what would have caused that
split<00:03:42.030> it's<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:43.050> physical<00:03:43.530> split<00:03:43.830> like<00:03:43.950> it's

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
split it's a physical split like it's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.030 
split it's a physical split like it's
huge<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:46.020> only<00:03:46.200> thing<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.500> can<00:03:46.650> really<00:03:46.770> think

huge the only thing I can really think

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.620 
huge the only thing I can really think
of<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.340> coulda<00:03:47.550> did<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.300> fact<00:03:48.510> that

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
of that coulda did that is the fact that

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.740 
of that coulda did that is the fact that
this<00:03:48.900> gas<00:03:49.170> tank<00:03:49.530> has<00:03:50.340> sat<00:03:50.640> with<00:03:50.880> no<00:03:51.090> gas<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.390> it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
this gas tank has sat with no gas in it

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.280 
this gas tank has sat with no gas in it
for<00:03:51.990> over<00:03:52.260> ten<00:03:52.650> years<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:54.480> old<00:03:54.660> owner<00:03:54.930> had<00:03:55.140> it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
for over ten years the old owner had it

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.330 
for over ten years the old owner had it
sitting<00:03:55.560> outside<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:58.170> gas<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.530> used<00:03:58.800> was<00:03:59.070> clean

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
sitting outside the gas I used was clean

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.550 
sitting outside the gas I used was clean
fresh<00:04:00.060> gas<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.660> never<00:04:00.900> used<00:04:01.110> any<00:04:01.260> harsh

happened

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.010 
happened
this<00:04:10.140> bike<00:04:10.320> has<00:04:10.350> done<00:04:10.710> it<00:04:10.830> twice<00:04:11.100> now<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:12.020> the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
this bike has done it twice now and the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.560 
this bike has done it twice now and the
first<00:04:13.230> time<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:14.460> same<00:04:14.820> thing<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.150> walk<00:04:15.330> up<00:04:15.540> to

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
first time like same thing I walk up to

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.110 
first time like same thing I walk up to
it<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.960> look<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.620> gas<00:04:16.770> cap<00:04:17.070> was<00:04:17.280> split<00:04:17.549> open<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
it I look the gas cap was split open and

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.030 
it I look the gas cap was split open and
I<00:04:18.239> was<00:04:18.330> thinking<00:04:18.510> somehow<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.230> got<00:04:19.410> pinched

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
I was thinking somehow this got pinched

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.430 
I was thinking somehow this got pinched
I<00:04:20.390> was<00:04:21.390> thinking<00:04:21.630> somehow<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.170> would<00:04:22.350> have

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
I was thinking somehow this would have

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.570 
I was thinking somehow this would have
got<00:04:22.560> pinched<00:04:24.440> but<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.680> case<00:04:25.890> no<00:04:26.190> it

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
got pinched but in this case no it

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.140 
got pinched but in this case no it
wasn't<00:04:26.970> pinched<00:04:27.300> cuz<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.660> had<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:27.990> loosely

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
wasn't pinched cuz I had it just loosely

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.990 
wasn't pinched cuz I had it just loosely
just<00:04:30.150> like<00:04:30.300> that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.430 

funny<00:04:34.000> thing<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.300> last<00:04:34.570> time<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:34.990> happened

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
took off the bike you see here hairline

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.480 
took off the bike you see here hairline
crack<00:05:08.500> right<00:05:08.800> here<00:05:09.180> all<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.450> way<00:05:10.540> across<00:05:11.490> this

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
crack right here all the way across this

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.020 
crack right here all the way across this
is<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.880> old<00:05:13.060> gas<00:05:13.330> cap<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:15.280> no<00:05:15.490> it's<00:05:15.700> not<00:05:15.880> the

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
is the old gas cap so no it's not the

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.840 
is the old gas cap so no it's not the
gas<00:05:16.180> cap<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.630> did<00:05:16.840> it<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:18.340> can<00:05:18.400> see<00:05:18.640> right

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
gas cap that did it you can see right

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.570 
gas cap that did it you can see right
here<00:05:19.470> it's<00:05:20.470> hard<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.680> say<00:05:20.860> but<00:05:21.070> you<00:05:21.280> can<00:05:21.430> see

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
here it's hard to say but you can see

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.610 
here it's hard to say but you can see
right<00:05:21.760> there<00:05:21.790> the<00:05:22.120> gas<00:05:22.240> cap<00:05:22.510> is<00:05:22.690> split<00:05:22.990> right

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
right there the gas cap is split right

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:32.880 
right there the gas cap is split right
here<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:25.300> yeah<00:05:26.670> gas<00:05:27.670> cap<00:05:27.970> split<00:05:31.350> it<00:05:32.350> was<00:05:32.440> also

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
here so yeah gas cap split it was also

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.200 
here so yeah gas cap split it was also
leaking<00:05:33.340> down<00:05:33.700> here<00:05:36.030> right<00:05:37.030> in<00:05:37.180> here

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
leaking down here right in here

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.540 
leaking down here right in here
somewhere<00:05:37.600> does<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:38.680> I<00:05:38.710> still<00:05:39.040> combed<00:05:39.340> it<00:05:39.430> up

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
somewhere does that I still combed it up

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.240 
somewhere does that I still combed it up
and<00:05:40.230> I<00:05:43.260> think<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.500> main<00:05:44.680> one<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:45.070> was

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
and I think the main one that was

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.720 
and I think the main one that was
leaking<00:05:45.580> is<00:05:45.700> rate<00:05:46.470> must<00:05:47.470> be<00:05:47.560> right<00:05:47.830> here<00:05:48.130> is

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
leaking is rate must be right here is

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.130 
leaking is rate must be right here is
the<00:05:48.970> main<00:05:49.120> one<00:05:49.300> that<00:05:49.330> was<00:05:49.600> leaking

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
the main one that was leaking

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.620 
the main one that was leaking

here<00:05:55.810> actually<00:05:55.930> went<00:05:56.290> for<00:05:56.680> about<00:05:56.820> like<00:05:57.820> I

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
here actually went for about like I

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.660 
here actually went for about like I
actually<00:05:58.150> drove<00:05:58.510> it<00:05:58.750> with<00:05:58.870> that<00:05:59.020> crack<00:05:59.640> so<00:06:00.640> I

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
actually drove it with that crack so I

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.080 
actually drove it with that crack so I
kept<00:06:01.000> on<00:06:01.120> driving<00:06:01.420> it<00:06:02.340> like<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.460> drove<00:06:03.790> it<00:06:03.970> like

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
once or twice with that crack and it was

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.320 
once or twice with that crack and it was
such<00:06:05.920> a<00:06:05.950> slow<00:06:06.340> seep<00:06:06.670> that<00:06:06.880> I<00:06:06.910> didn't<00:06:07.180> worry

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
such a slow seep that I didn't worry

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.490 
such a slow seep that I didn't worry
about<00:06:07.450> it<00:06:07.660> but<00:06:08.280> like<00:06:09.280> what<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.450> hell<00:06:10.870> is<00:06:10.900> doing
