00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 objects 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:19.369
 will I use a mirror with the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 flowers that already see a house to make 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:28.580
 tanks and you account here is the affection 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.580
 late boring 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.980
 here is a spatula 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.000
 with these three objects you will get 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.270
 You're going to actually paint, right? 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.840
 your fingernail of any color 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.840
 I passed a green water here - I think 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.149
 here it is written here and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:21.569
 the apothecary is 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:30.719
 I will also use black that is black 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:34.679
 of the color you use to make the 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:38.689
 drawing and then I have normal without 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.689
 secret as everyone does 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:49.289
 remembering that you always have to leave 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:53.610
 This glass is always the time you used 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.429
 if you make a button as with acetone 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.860
 that we use good ones here is what I think 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:05.030
 better, but you lack that 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.030
 goes with cotton 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.670
 You pass that is not even happening now. 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.129
 with its beautiful and in little stands for 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.209
 take away all the excess 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:28.099
 You'll get this one black enamel 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:36.000
 some of him looks very fast not to 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:43.340
 to check I'll choose a mec 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.080
 I think I wanted to pick this flower here. 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:54.019
 I xingo enamel here a way that 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.440
 comes all white with the inclined spatula 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.440
 down 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:08.410
 You make me take stamp and do not I fan 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.410
