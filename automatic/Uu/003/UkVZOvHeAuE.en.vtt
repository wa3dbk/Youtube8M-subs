00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello friends i am who am i gamer 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.920
 Welcome to the second chapter of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.480
 our battle series the first 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.710
 division in this video let's see if 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.880
 we can get the title of the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.280
 division 8 with our club 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.540
 joga bonito we have 16 thousand 400 coins 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.370
 in the bank thanks to the matches and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.289
 titles that we have won and the sale of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.300
 players we have 9 points and we need 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.980
 3 to ascend and 6 in total to win 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.660
 the title we have seven games left in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.070
 this division so we're doing very well 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.140
 record of clubs of 21 won 3 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
 tied 4 lost so we're going to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.830
 start to start I decided it was 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.599
 moment to get a midfielder from 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.309
 attacker that was better than he had 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.200
 better shot better pass and I decided on 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.090
 diamond who is very forceful and a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.710
 very good price without propensity of equal 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.090
 way the series lacked a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 there was no player 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.809
 with 5 stars of skillful movements 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 until the transfer period 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.390
 past where the Moroccan adel tara was 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 transferred to milan so he tells me of 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.289
 your services to put a touch of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.059
 more fantasy team and after 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.100
 accommodate them on the computer and check that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 there will be no shortage of contracts and the energy of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 everyone was ok we headed 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 towards our first party friends like this 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.570
 is how our club looks after 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 accommodate all the players our 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.960
 first rival is a team the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.490
 bundesliga with 100% chemistry and 80 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.049
 the right in general we have to man his 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.940
 raised kit that the front along with 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.320
 all his dangerous henchmen in the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.710
 minute 3 it's me who gets ahead 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.920
 with this klose headshot 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.570
 later 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.450
 It was Klose who was taking the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.350
 actions arriving on the left 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.479
 approaching from saleh to the girl to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.680
 send a center which mario g칩mez was going 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.780
 to top it off he would not forgive 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.130
 no way after winning by 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.600
 two goals I feel more confident 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.549
 to start trying to make some 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.289
 skills here and receive the ball and I was 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.000
 trying to start making my game 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.720
 with adel taarabt when suddenly it 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 mark this penalty 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.060
 which will obviously be a penalty 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.130
 because he was entering the small area and 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.220
 suddenly before I charge the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.440
 penalty I see this 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.630
 the circle and the connection has been lost 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.160
 it's not all our opponent abandons 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.960
 the game apparently already took you 2 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.970
 goals and he's going to be the third and he does not 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.950
 I was willing to endure and receive 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.170
 the 3 goals and what came not because 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.360
 it was very early in the game without 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.940
 However thanks to this to this abandonment 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.100
 I got the victory 2 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.140
 at 0 they gave me a few coins and 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.790
 we reached the 12 points friends so 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.900
 we go to the next game after 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.700
 I went to check the status of my 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.170
 players and I saw what palette was missing a 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.940
 contract I did not know what was going to be in the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.350
 star of this series however you 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.020
 I got his contract we went to the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.580
 next game the next team is 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.980
 a hybrid of various nationalities and 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.209
 several series several leagues with muriel al 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.950
 front so I did not expect anything from 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.330
 speed is my opponent who 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.400
 begins to generate danger with vidal 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.230
 sending this ball to the post forgiving 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 the opportunity he had to put himself 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.430
 front after me in the center of the shot 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.630
 corner received the ball with C치ceres 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.350
 and C치ceres shows us that 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.430
 can throw 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.980
 later nyan arrives by the band 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.080
 right fully discovered receives the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.880
 The ball directs him and sends the ball to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.110
 save to the left corner our 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.310
 opponent was a good player without 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.290
 However, it was one of those games where 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.730
 nothing had to go well with one in 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.140
 this case was the see how it reduces 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.240
 interpose that center that I was 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.220
 sure it was a goal to clear the 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.230
 ball after klose arrives sending him 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.180
 this pass to gomez or me volley tops 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.190
 I wanted to score a goal though 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.230
 it did not happen like that 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.670
 subsequently holk generates danger with 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.250
 this shot however of santis him 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.350
 denied the opportunity of new hulk what 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.270
 I stopped insisting but there I was 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.700
 santis showing him that they were not so 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.930
 only the ball in this game for this 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.640
 point my opponent was a bit 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.920
 desperate received the ball hernandez 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.330
 towards a dangerous shot from afar to 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.650
 close with diamond gold brooch 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.210
 sent this center and palette we 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.520
 he showed because he is the star of this 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.130
 chapter this is the first goal of palette 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.160
 this game we won 3 to 0 we received 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.660
 570 coins and we reached 15 points 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.000
 what we needed to win the title 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.830
 of the eighth division and receiving like this 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.240
 the 4000 coins for winning the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.100
 Fortunately, title 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.870
 immediately after this match 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.850
 its only review contracts and energy 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.980
 and we go to the next 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.690
 party friends this party was a 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.430
 very very difficult game let's see the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.230
 actions the next team is a 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.180
 English Premier League team with 100 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.740
 chemistry and 83 general is my opponent 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.690
 who starts to generate danger but 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.520
 C치ceres closes the opportunity here in 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.380
 areas a volley shot very dangerous 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.060
 Seeing this obviously I did not want 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.860
 stay behind so when he saw the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.690
 opportunity with my ante trying to finish 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.120
 also of volley passing very close to the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.620
 left post was split with many 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.959
 arrivals and although this was the clearest 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.940
 see this center klose receives it 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.830
 has an excellent pitch and still the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.270
 goalkeeper denied me the chance again 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.470
 here I have a clear one that used to 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.780
 roll the ball to take away the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.460
 opponents as soon as I make the shot I give myself 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.380
 mind that that was the weak foot of klose 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.270
 the left and this time it was me who 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.430
 nothing came out see nothing else you 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.540
 this auction where it happens and was 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.790
 sure it was going to be a goal without 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.410
 But once again we fail and when 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.700
 I was about to finish the game in 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.440
 a draw I was sure I was 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.970
 out of the place so it does not run and 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.190
 soon with de santis and 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.530
 unfortunately this makes an equal 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.940
 of victory and that way ends 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.900
 the third game of this chapter 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.780
 friends I lost 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.460
 10 and receive 390 coins for this 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.560
 defeat so good in the same way 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.910
 I went back to the headquarters to see that my 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.560
 players had energy and contracts 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.360
 this time it was Congo who did not have the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.889
 contract so after getting him 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.600
 his contract to see that everything was fine 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.460
 found energy we headed towards 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.780
 our next party friends our 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.000
 next opponent is a team 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.070
 dangerously fast friends with 100% of 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.810
 chemistry and 82 following a general the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.220
 series after the victories that 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.539
 we were accumulating I felt very much 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.850
 confidence to start doing my 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.139
 skills or dribbling with the draft and here 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.699
 it was he who generated the first 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.080
 opportunity sending a filtered step to 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.060
 class who does not happen enough 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.190
 quick to finish that pass here 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.229
 we see as the amazing palette the center 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.180
 defensive so it's palette starts with 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.660
 this dangerous action sends the pass 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.280
 receives the wall and ends with the play 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.400
 at the bottom of the networks this is our 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.870
 defensive center scoring a goal and in 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.610
 that moment he says to see come here 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.830
 I'm giving them class guys like that 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.270
 the goals are scored and good with more 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.220
 confidence then continued trying to do 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.040
 my dribbling with the trap here I do the 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.360
 little hat later I do the 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.160
 the elastic the hocus pocus and the receipt 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.350
 again here I make a tape for 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.840
 receive the ball then the elastic 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.090
 ronaldinho and exactly at this point 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.460
 I think my opponent said it's not 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.690
 too much I do not want anymore I do not want 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.060
 to see where this will end if only 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.430
 We were 14 minutes before 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.380
 decided to abandon the game so 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.560
 we won 1-0 with our palette goal 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.050
 defensive center we received 179 coins and 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.390
 we received the first 3 points of the 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.740
 division 7 friends this is going to be the 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.240
 last game of our second 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.530
 battle chapter to the first 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.660
 division I hope you liked it
