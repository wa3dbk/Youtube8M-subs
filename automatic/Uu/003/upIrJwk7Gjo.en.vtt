three<00:01:01.230> skis<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.710> rocker<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
three skis have rocker in them so that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.810 
three skis have rocker in them so that
means<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.110> tip<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
means that the tip has a bit of a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
means that the tip has a bit of a
reverse<00:01:06.180> camber<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.560> lot

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
reverse camber which makes it a lot

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.420 
reverse camber which makes it a lot
easier<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.790> skin<00:01:09.060> powder<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:11.100> rocker

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
easier to skin powder with that rocker

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.859 
easier to skin powder with that rocker
technology<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.659> rocker<00:01:12.960> tip<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.979> all

some of our best technologies that we

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.640 
some of our best technologies that we
can<00:01:20.759> find<00:01:21.000> also<00:01:21.150> even<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.869> our<00:01:21.990> race<00:01:22.350> skis
