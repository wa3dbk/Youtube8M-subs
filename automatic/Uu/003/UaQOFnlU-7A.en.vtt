here<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.580> there's<00:00:23.580> basically<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.240> one

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
here and there's basically just one

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.720 
here and there's basically just one
gameplay<00:00:24.810> mode<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> main<00:00:25.830> game<00:00:26.099> there

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
gameplay mode here the main game there

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.000 
gameplay mode here the main game there
is<00:00:26.849> also<00:00:27.060> instant<00:00:27.750> play<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.349> those<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.890> all

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is also instant play but those are all

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
is also instant play but those are all
the<00:00:29.189> same<00:00:29.429> levels<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.179> also<00:00:30.359> practice<00:00:31.019> mode

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the same levels and also practice mode

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.560

which<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> same<00:00:32.189> levels<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.450> it's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
which are all the same levels so it's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.200 
which are all the same levels so it's
really<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.989> main<00:00:34.200> game<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.090> you<00:00:36.090> can

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
really just a main game here and you can

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.760 
really just a main game here and you can
choose<00:00:36.540> between<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.960> different<00:00:37.290> characters

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
choose between the different characters

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.080 
choose between the different characters
that<00:00:37.950> doesn't<00:00:38.250> make<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> difference<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:39.059> all

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that doesn't make a difference at all

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810 
that doesn't make a difference at all
and<00:00:39.540> then<00:00:40.350> there's<00:00:40.620> those<00:00:40.950> five<00:00:41.460> different

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and then there's those five different

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.740 
and then there's those five different
worlds<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> each<00:00:43.590> world<00:00:43.890> has<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:45.000> think

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
worlds here and each world has I think

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.290 
worlds here and each world has I think
he<00:00:46.079> had<00:00:46.200> 20<00:00:46.710> individual<00:00:47.309> levels<00:00:47.670> inside<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
he had 20 individual levels inside it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.229 
he had 20 individual levels inside it
and<00:00:48.620> beating<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> whole<00:00:50.129> game<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.730> five

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and beating the whole game all five

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.100 
and beating the whole game all five
worlds<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:52.350> only<00:00:52.590> take<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:52.980> two<00:00:53.670> hours<00:00:54.110> so

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
worlds will only take about two hours so

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.729 
worlds will only take about two hours so
that's<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.559> much<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.750> honestly<00:00:57.750> for

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that's not really much and honestly for

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
that's not really much and honestly for
four<00:00:58.980> dollars<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> ninety-nine<00:00:59.609> cents<00:01:00.180> just

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
four dollars and ninety-nine cents just

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.619 
four dollars and ninety-nine cents just
two<00:01:00.780> hours<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> gameplay<00:01:01.620> isn't<00:01:01.920> much<00:01:02.629> but

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
two hours the gameplay isn't much but

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.170 
two hours the gameplay isn't much but
this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> game<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.460> starts<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.030> really

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
this is a game and it starts out really

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
this is a game and it starts out really
easy<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.619> level<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
easy here this is the first level and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.370 
easy here this is the first level and
you<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> hold<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.890> phone<00:01:11.220> at<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
you have to hold your phone at a kind of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.219 
you have to hold your phone at a kind of
angle<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.270> comfortable

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
angle which is not really comfortable

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
angle which is not really comfortable
for<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.189> sitting<00:01:17.460> down<00:01:17.689> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
for when you're just sitting down it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.260 
for when you're just sitting down it's
almost<00:01:19.049> flat<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.159> ground<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.000> not

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
almost flat to the ground but not

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.140 
almost flat to the ground but not
completely<00:01:21.840> flat<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.250> angle<00:01:23.790> isn't<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
completely flat so that angle isn't the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.469 
completely flat so that angle isn't the
best<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.229> works<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.040> once<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.240> used

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
best but it works and once you get used

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
best but it works and once you get used
to<00:01:27.600> controls<00:01:28.170> they're<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:28.950> pretty<00:01:29.100> good

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to controls they're actually pretty good

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
to controls they're actually pretty good
a<00:01:29.670> lot<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> complaints<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
a lot of the complaints on the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
a lot of the complaints on the
marketplace<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.549> probably<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:33.000> people<00:01:33.329> who

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
marketplace are probably from people who

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
marketplace are probably from people who
downloaded<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> trial<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.799> played<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
downloaded the trial and played it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.969 
downloaded the trial and played it
really<00:01:35.939> briefly<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.720> never<00:01:36.930> got<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.380> chance<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
really briefly and never got a chance to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.749 
really briefly and never got a chance to
actually<00:01:38.159> get<00:01:38.460> used<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> controls<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.549> game

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
actually get used to controls the game

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.240 
actually get used to controls the game
should<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.329> bit<00:01:42.570> challenging<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.470> it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
should be a bit challenging and it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.440 
should be a bit challenging and it's
good<00:01:44.790> where<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> controls<00:01:47.970> did<00:01:48.210> take

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
good where it is the controls did take

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.560 
good where it is the controls did take
me<00:01:48.479> about<00:01:48.960> probably<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.060> 20<00:01:51.060> minutes<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
me about probably like 20 minutes to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020 
me about probably like 20 minutes to
actually<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:51.990> used<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.460> once<00:01:53.759> you're

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
actually get used to but once you're

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.010 
actually get used to but once you're
used<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.420> them<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:54.750> work<00:01:54.899> really<00:01:55.140> well<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
used to them they work really well and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020 
used to them they work really well and
what's<00:01:58.020> probably<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> most<00:01:58.740> difficulty<00:01:59.579> get

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
what's probably the most difficulty get

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.719 
what's probably the most difficulty get
used<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.899> camera<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.430> camera

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
used to is the camera the camera

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
used to is the camera the camera
controls<00:02:03.299> because<00:02:04.290> they're<00:02:04.469> automatically

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
controls because they're automatically

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.969 
controls because they're automatically
controlled<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.509> sometimes<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
controlled but sometimes like when you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.520 
controlled but sometimes like when you
start<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.700> backwards<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:10.200> may<00:02:10.379> not

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
start to go backwards here you may not

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.400 
start to go backwards here you may not
want<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.220> switch

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
want it to switch

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.550 
want it to switch
and<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.830> kind<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.130> throws<00:02:13.520> off<00:02:13.990> your<00:02:14.990> whole

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and that kind of throws off your whole

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.360 
and that kind of throws off your whole
balance<00:02:16.900> but<00:02:17.900> once<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.380> actually<00:02:18.620> understand

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
balance but once you actually understand

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
balance but once you actually understand
how<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.670> controls<00:02:20.210> work<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.690> how<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.900> camera

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
how the controls work and how the camera

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.300 
how the controls work and how the camera
works<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.730> controls<00:02:23.150> are<00:02:23.270> really<00:02:23.510> fun<00:02:23.750> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
works the controls are really fun and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.580 
works the controls are really fun and
you<00:02:25.310> can<00:02:25.340> do<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> lot<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.150> precision<00:02:27.080> moving

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
you can do a lot of precision moving

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.140 
you can do a lot of precision moving
throughout<00:02:28.100> some<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.610> levels<00:02:28.790> which

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
throughout some of the levels which

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.770 
throughout some of the levels which
really<00:02:29.480> require<00:02:29.960> precision<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.850> there's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
really require precision and there's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.770 
really require precision and there's
plenty<00:02:32.960> of<00:02:33.170> variation<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.040> levels<00:02:34.490> too

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
plenty of variation in the levels too

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.760 
plenty of variation in the levels too
sometimes<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.110> drop<00:02:36.410> down

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
sometimes you have to drop down

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.380 
sometimes you have to drop down
sometimes<00:02:37.460> you<00:02:37.610> have<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.820> go<00:02:37.940> down<00:02:38.120> some

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
sometimes you have to go down some

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.590 
sometimes you have to go down some
really<00:02:38.930> steep<00:02:39.410> ramps<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.820> sometimes<00:02:41.480> you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
really steep ramps and sometimes you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.650 
really steep ramps and sometimes you
have<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.840> go<00:02:41.960> across<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.440> narrow<00:02:42.680> paths<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:44.300> it

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
have to go across the narrow paths so it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.420 
have to go across the narrow paths so it
definitely<00:02:45.020> gets<00:02:45.320> tougher<00:02:45.860> as<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.280> go<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:49.100> we

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
definitely gets tougher as you go and we

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.160 
definitely gets tougher as you go and we
could<00:02:49.610> go<00:02:49.700> ahead<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.030> jump<00:02:50.360> into<00:02:50.600> one<00:02:50.960> of<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
could go ahead and jump into one of the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.590 
could go ahead and jump into one of the
tougher<00:02:51.530> levels<00:02:51.890> here<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.120> can<00:02:53.240> just<00:02:53.270> go

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
tougher levels here so you can just go

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.370 
tougher levels here so you can just go
back<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.080> main<00:02:54.290> menu<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:55.780> also<00:02:56.780> once<00:02:57.200> you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
back to the main menu and also once you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.530 
back to the main menu and also once you
complete<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.880> whole<00:03:00.070> stage<00:03:01.070> like<00:03:01.460> 10<00:03:02.060> levels

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
complete the whole stage like 10 levels

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.630 
complete the whole stage like 10 levels
there<00:03:02.780> it'll<00:03:03.290> give<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.590> ranking<00:03:04.160> here<00:03:04.430> and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
there it'll give you a ranking here and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.120 
there it'll give you a ranking here and
you<00:03:05.300> can<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.720> back<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.140> look<00:03:06.320> at<00:03:06.680> your<00:03:06.830> rank

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
you can go back and look at your rank

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
your rankings and some of those levels I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.510 
your rankings and some of those levels I
did<00:03:17.180> really<00:03:17.480> good<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.200> others<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.220> didn't

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
did really good on and others I didn't

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.730 
did really good on and others I didn't
do<00:03:19.610> as<00:03:19.820> good<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:21.020> can<00:03:21.200> open<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.650> it

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
do as good on you can open it and it

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.290

the xbox live leaderboards which are
pretty<00:03:32.060> nice<00:03:32.240> because<00:03:32.990> that<00:03:33.350> actually<00:03:33.680> gives

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
pretty nice because that actually gives

confusing the use but he'll get more

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.930

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
any level and practice it so here we go

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.180 
any level and practice it so here we go

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.660 
we can jump into one of the more
difficult

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
the presentation is pretty good the 3d

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.410 
the presentation is pretty good the 3d
world<00:05:15.230> looks<00:05:15.530> really<00:05:15.860> nice<00:05:16.040> the<00:05:16.820> only<00:05:17.180> thing

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
world looks really nice the only thing

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.380 
world looks really nice the only thing
that<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:17.750> really<00:05:18.200> bad<00:05:18.650> about<00:05:18.950> it<00:05:19.160> is<00:05:19.390> the

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
that is really bad about it is the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.500 
that is really bad about it is the
animated<00:05:21.200> character<00:05:21.680> inside<00:05:22.130> because<00:05:22.640> as<00:05:22.910> you

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
animated character inside because as you

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.230 
animated character inside because as you
can<00:05:23.660> see<00:05:23.900> it's<00:05:24.080> just<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.380> 2d<00:05:24.950> figure<00:05:25.520> it's<00:05:26.030> not

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
can see it's just a 2d figure it's not

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.980 
can see it's just a 2d figure it's not
even<00:05:26.510> in<00:05:26.630> 3d<00:05:27.430> so<00:05:28.430> for<00:05:28.610> some<00:05:28.790> reason<00:05:28.820> that<00:05:29.630> was

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
even in 3d so for some reason that was

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.350 
even in 3d so for some reason that was
really<00:05:30.470> bad<00:05:30.650> about<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.070> game<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.910> rest<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.300> it

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
really bad about the game the rest of it

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.420 
really bad about the game the rest of it
looks<00:05:32.630> fabulous<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.350> it<00:05:33.500> loads<00:05:33.710> really<00:05:34.160> fast

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
looks fabulous and it loads really fast

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:41.380 
looks fabulous and it loads really fast
and<00:05:34.820> it's<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.870> great<00:05:36.080> game<00:05:39.370> so<00:05:40.370> for<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.180> price

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
and it's a great game so for the price

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.800 
and it's a great game so for the price
of<00:05:41.770> four<00:05:42.770> dollars<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.310> ninety-nine<00:05:43.580> cents<00:05:44.270> it

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
of four dollars and ninety-nine cents it

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.370 
of four dollars and ninety-nine cents it
might<00:05:45.110> not<00:05:45.230> be<00:05:45.290> worth<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:45.920> just<00:05:46.220> because<00:05:47.380> the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
might not be worth it just because the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.190 
might not be worth it just because the
lasting<00:05:48.890> value<00:05:49.070> is<00:05:49.580> only<00:05:49.940> at<00:05:50.330> about<00:05:50.360> two<00:05:50.960> hours

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
lasting value is only at about two hours

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.440 
lasting value is only at about two hours
it<00:05:51.860> could<00:05:52.130> be<00:05:52.250> even<00:05:52.340> faster<00:05:52.670> if<00:05:53.060> you're<00:05:53.210> really

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
it could be even faster if you're really

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.150 
it could be even faster if you're really
good<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:54.020> you<00:05:54.170> don't<00:05:54.320> ever<00:05:54.470> have<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.800> keep<00:05:54.980> on

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
good and you don't ever have to keep on

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.990 
good and you don't ever have to keep on
retrying<00:05:55.700> levels<00:05:56.150> and<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:58.190> with<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.730> little

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
retrying levels and so with that little

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.540 
retrying levels and so with that little
lasting<00:05:59.510> value<00:05:59.750> the<00:06:00.680> game<00:06:00.860> really<00:06:01.130> does<00:06:01.340> get

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
lasting value the game really does get

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.930 
lasting value the game really does get
hurt<00:06:01.960> but<00:06:02.960> otherwise<00:06:03.170> the<00:06:04.010> presentation<00:06:04.790> is

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
hurt but otherwise the presentation is

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.490 
hurt but otherwise the presentation is
really<00:06:04.970> good<00:06:05.360> other<00:06:05.570> than<00:06:05.780> this<00:06:05.990> really

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
really good other than this really

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.730 
really good other than this really
crappily<00:06:07.070> animated<00:06:07.760> 2d<00:06:08.600> figure<00:06:08.990> here<00:06:09.350> in<00:06:09.530> the

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
crappily animated 2d figure here in the

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.550 
crappily animated 2d figure here in the
center<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.280> monkey<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:10.880> the<00:06:11.440> gameplay<00:06:12.440> is

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
center the monkey and the gameplay is

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.130 
center the monkey and the gameplay is
really<00:06:12.590> fun<00:06:13.160> that<00:06:13.370> controls<00:06:13.850> they<00:06:14.570> get<00:06:14.810> a<00:06:14.840> lot

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
really fun that controls they get a lot

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.320 
really fun that controls they get a lot
better<00:06:15.380> as<00:06:15.740> you<00:06:15.770> actually<00:06:16.310> play<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.700> game<00:06:16.880> so

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
better as you actually play the game so

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.510 
better as you actually play the game so
don't<00:06:18.050> count<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.650> game<00:06:18.830> off<00:06:19.040> just<00:06:19.370> because

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
don't count the game off just because

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.220 
don't count the game off just because
you<00:06:19.790> don't<00:06:19.970> like<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.240> controls<00:06:20.780> the<00:06:21.020> first

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
you don't like the controls the first

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.590 
you don't like the controls the first
time<00:06:21.440> you<00:06:21.590> play<00:06:21.800> it<00:06:21.980> at<00:06:22.550> first<00:06:22.880> when<00:06:23.210> I<00:06:23.330> played

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
time you play it at first when I played

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.180 
time you play it at first when I played
it<00:06:23.750> I<00:06:23.840> thought<00:06:24.080> yeah<00:06:24.440> these<00:06:24.620> controls<00:06:25.070> are

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
it I thought yeah these controls are

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.660 
it I thought yeah these controls are
crap<00:06:25.550> but<00:06:26.390> now<00:06:27.050> I've<00:06:27.530> learned<00:06:28.010> to<00:06:28.190> love<00:06:28.400> them

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
crap but now I've learned to love them
