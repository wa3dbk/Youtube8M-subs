for<00:00:35.780> survival<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:38.500> two<00:00:39.500> ways<00:00:39.800> are<00:00:40.190> kind<00:00:41.180> of

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
for survival and two ways are kind of

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.750 
for survival and two ways are kind of
difficult<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.199> not<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:42.829> easy<00:00:43.129> to<00:00:43.280> build<00:00:43.579> and

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
difficult and not that easy to build and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.290 
difficult and not that easy to build and
one<00:00:44.659> way<00:00:45.019> is<00:00:45.409> really<00:00:46.400> easy<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:46.850> build<00:00:47.030> and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
one way is really easy to build and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.200 
one way is really easy to build and
don't<00:00:47.809> need<00:00:48.110> much<00:00:48.409> space<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.159> that's<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
don't need much space and that's the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.359 
don't need much space and that's the
first<00:00:50.510> one<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.019> it's<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.710> easiest<00:00:52.040> way<00:00:52.309> to

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:52.369 
first one and it's the easiest way to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:58.000 
first one and it's the easiest way to
build<00:00:53.000> an<00:00:53.119> automatic<00:00:53.269> door<00:00:54.580> and<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:57.830> only

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
build an automatic door and the only

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.460 
build an automatic door and the only
thing<00:00:58.159> you<00:00:58.489> have<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.699> do<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.720> get<00:00:59.900> through<00:01:00.229> it

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
thing you have to do to get through it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.429 
thing you have to do to get through it
this<00:01:00.830> you<00:01:01.070> just<00:01:01.280> have<00:01:01.549> to<00:01:01.729> hold<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:03.080> block

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
this you just have to hold this block

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.039 
this you just have to hold this block
and<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.580> sand<00:01:04.790> will<00:01:04.939> fall<00:01:05.180> down<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.840> can

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
and the sand will fall down and you can

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.450 
and the sand will fall down and you can
walk<00:01:06.290> through<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:07.509> it<00:01:08.509> works<00:01:09.220> because<00:01:10.220> of

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
walk through it it works because of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.560 
walk through it it works because of
block<00:01:10.759> update<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:13.400> just<00:01:13.610> have<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.970> dig<00:01:14.509> a

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
block update and you just have to dig a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.789 
block update and you just have to dig a
hole<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:15.229> two<00:01:15.770> blocks<00:01:16.040> down<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.630> then<00:01:18.049> put<00:01:18.619> a

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
hole of two blocks down and then put a

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.050 
hole of two blocks down and then put a
charge<00:01:19.130> here<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.960> then<00:01:20.960> just<00:01:21.350> place<00:01:22.280> sand<00:01:22.850> on

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
charge here and then just place sand on

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.550 
charge here and then just place sand on
top<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:25.090> because<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.359> block<00:01:26.539> update<00:01:26.990> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
top and because of the block update and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.609 
top and because of the block update and
it<00:01:28.009> will<00:01:28.189> fall<00:01:28.490> down<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.759> few<00:01:29.210> whole<00:01:29.539> the<00:01:30.259> block

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
it will fall down a few whole the block

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.179 
it will fall down a few whole the block
in<00:01:30.829> front<00:01:31.219> of<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:33.259> second<00:01:33.619> version<00:01:33.799> is

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
in front of it the second version is

I i use this version also and it's real

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.230 
I i use this version also and it's real
it's<00:01:53.840> not<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:55.490> easy<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:56.270> build<00:01:56.539> but<00:01:57.350> it's

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
it's not that easy to build but it's

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.709 
it's not that easy to build but it's
really<00:01:59.240> cool<00:01:59.630> way<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.880> need<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.270> sand

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
really cool way and you need a sand

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.129 
really cool way and you need a sand
block<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:04.189> just<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.939> place<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.450> there<00:02:05.840> on

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
block and just have to place it there on

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.740 
block and just have to place it there on
this<00:02:06.709> block<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.729> sand<00:02:08.060> will<00:02:08.240> fall<00:02:08.509> down

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
this block and the sand will fall down

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.390 
this block and the sand will fall down
but<00:02:09.679> first<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.280> will<00:02:10.520> show<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.759> how<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.330> works

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
but first I will show you how it works

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.809 
but first I will show you how it works
so<00:02:13.400> if<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.760> place<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.090> block<00:02:15.080> there<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:16.340> will

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
so if you place the block there it will

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.000 
so if you place the block there it will
fall<00:02:17.060> down<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.540> break<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.140> cactus<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
fall down and break the cactus and the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.440 
fall down and break the cactus and the
cactus<00:02:19.370> will<00:02:19.550> break<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.450> signs<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:22.450> sand

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
cactus will break the signs and the sand

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.630 
cactus will break the signs and the sand
is<00:02:23.660> placed<00:02:23.959> on<00:02:24.200> top<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.770> signs<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.220> it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
is placed on top of the signs and it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.140 
is placed on top of the signs and it
will<00:02:25.879> fall<00:02:26.180> down<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.780> let's<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.159> works

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
will fall down so let's see if it works

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.319 
will fall down so let's see if it works
and<00:02:30.400> yes<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.670> works<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.819> only<00:02:34.970> thing<00:02:35.090> you

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
and yes it works so the only thing you

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.280 
and yes it works so the only thing you
have<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:36.670> hope<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:38.120> have<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.079> new

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
have to hope you have to have a new

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.350 
have to hope you have to have a new
inventory<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.860> open<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.250> store<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.819> block

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
inventory to open the store is a block

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.920 
inventory to open the store is a block
to<00:02:41.629> put<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.409> there<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.760> as<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.629> can<00:02:44.780> see

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
to put it there and you as you can see

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.360 
to put it there and you as you can see
it<00:02:45.110> works<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.390> have<00:02:47.629> em<00:02:48.069> number<00:02:49.069> three

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
it works then we have em number three

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.819 
it works then we have em number three
it's<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.109> most<00:02:51.430> difficult<00:02:52.430> way<00:02:52.909> to<00:02:52.970> build<00:02:53.829> but

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
it's the most difficult way to build but

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.089 
it's the most difficult way to build but
it's<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:55.700> really<00:02:56.090> cool<00:02:56.599> way<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.530> also<00:02:57.799> it's

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
it's a really cool way and it also it's

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.990 
it's a really cool way and it also it's
also<00:02:58.310> possible<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.939> hide<00:02:59.359> this<00:03:00.019> way<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:01.000> lock

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
also possible to hide this way this lock

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.849 
also possible to hide this way this lock
or<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:03.010> way<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.069> open<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.609> because<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:06.829> just

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
or this way to open it because you just

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.330 
or this way to open it because you just
have<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.400> break<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.090> sand<00:03:08.510> block<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.340> can

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
have to break the sand block and you can

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.099 
have to break the sand block and you can
also<00:03:10.579> use<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:12.970> stone<00:03:13.970> block<00:03:14.239> instead<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
also use a stone block instead of the

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.550 
also use a stone block instead of the
sand<00:03:15.349> block<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.689> nobody<00:03:17.689> knows<00:03:18.049> where<00:03:18.409> the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
sand block so nobody knows where the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.339 
sand block so nobody knows where the
block<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:19.299> which<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.510> have<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.780> break<00:03:21.019> and

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
block is which you have to break and

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.020 
block is which you have to break and
nobody<00:03:22.310> knows<00:03:22.519> how<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.760> go<00:03:23.269> in<00:03:23.480> your<00:03:24.019> house<00:03:24.260> and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
nobody knows how to go in your house and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.629 
nobody knows how to go in your house and
how<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.150> works<00:03:26.359> I<00:03:26.720> think<00:03:27.319> there<00:03:27.769> are<00:03:27.799> easier

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
how it works I think there are easier

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.289 
how it works I think there are easier
way<00:03:28.909> how<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.780> use<00:03:30.019> your<00:03:30.049> way<00:03:30.439> how<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.650> do<00:03:30.889> this

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
way how you use your way how to do this

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.970 
way how you use your way how to do this
but<00:03:32.299> i'll<00:03:32.480> show<00:03:32.659> you<00:03:33.010> my<00:03:34.010> way<00:03:34.660> it's<00:03:35.709> them<00:03:36.709> if

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
but i'll show you my way it's them if

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.670 
but i'll show you my way it's them if
you<00:03:37.160> break<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.579> block<00:03:37.819> this<00:03:38.419> science<00:03:38.959> will

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
you break the block this science will

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.819 
you break the block this science will
break<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.169> this<00:03:42.169> sand<00:03:42.889> block<00:03:43.160> will<00:03:43.609> fall<00:03:44.829> next

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
break and this sand block will fall next

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.780 
break and this sand block will fall next
to<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> cactus<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.919> like<00:03:48.919> every<00:03:49.430> time<00:03:49.639> this

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
to a cactus and like every time this

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.270 
to a cactus and like every time this
cactus<00:03:50.090> will<00:03:50.389> break<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:51.319> science<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.040> the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
cactus will break the science and the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.129 
cactus will break the science and the
science<00:03:52.790> will<00:03:54.879> break<00:03:55.879> and<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.629> scent<00:03:56.900> will

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
science will break and the scent will

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.539 
science will break and the scent will
fall<00:03:57.500> down<00:03:58.449> into<00:03:59.449> a<00:03:59.479> hole<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.650> let's<00:04:00.979> see<00:04:01.220> if<00:04:01.400> it

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
fall down into a hole so let's see if it

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.960 
fall down into a hole so let's see if it
works

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.790 

and<00:04:04.900> as<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.620> can<00:04:05.770> see<00:04:05.800> it<00:04:06.130> works<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.530> hope

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
and as you can see it works so I hope

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.980 
and as you can see it works so I hope

and<00:04:24.240> like<00:04:25.240> i<00:04:25.270> said<00:04:25.420> this<00:04:25.690> easiest<00:04:26.320> way<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:26.830> the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
and like i said this easiest way and the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.340 
and like i said this easiest way and the
other<00:04:27.280> ways<00:04:27.820> are<00:04:28.090> kind<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.600> difficult<00:04:29.140> but

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
other ways are kind of difficult but

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.120 
other ways are kind of difficult but
also<00:04:30.210> cool<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.590> let's<00:04:33.480> see<00:04:34.480> we'll<00:04:35.110> see<00:04:35.230> us<00:04:35.530> in

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
also cool so let's see we'll see us in

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.980 
also cool so let's see we'll see us in
the<00:04:36.340> next<00:04:36.430> video<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.980> why
