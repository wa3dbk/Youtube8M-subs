00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.120 
hey everybody mr. West here I found
something<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.629> think<00:00:06.690> quite<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.589> few<00:00:07.680> people

something I think quite a few people
might<00:00:08.460> be<00:00:08.610> interested<00:00:09.000> in

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
might be interested in

might be interested in
most<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.429> us<00:00:11.550> when<00:00:11.759> we're<00:00:11.969> building<00:00:12.320> from

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
most of us when we're building from

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.070 
most of us when we're building from
scratch<00:00:14.750> carbon<00:00:15.750> fiber<00:00:16.250> is<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.570> good<00:00:18.840> thing

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
scratch carbon fiber is is a good thing

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.460 
scratch carbon fiber is is a good thing
right

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
right

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.620 
right
carbon<00:00:19.859> fiber<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.310> good<00:00:20.460> thing<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.390> when

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
carbon fiber is a good thing and when

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.700 
carbon fiber is a good thing and when
we're<00:00:21.750> talking<00:00:22.020> about<00:00:22.140> doing<00:00:22.650> twin<00:00:23.400> boom<00:00:23.640> or

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
we're talking about doing twin boom or

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.320 
we're talking about doing twin boom or
single<00:00:25.710> boom<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> tail<00:00:26.519> section<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.150> it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
single boom with a tail section on it

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.000 
single boom with a tail section on it
like<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
like that

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
like that
a<00:00:29.010> big<00:00:29.670> fat<00:00:29.970> tube<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.750> carbon<00:00:31.170> fiber

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
a big fat tube of carbon fiber

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.110 
a big fat tube of carbon fiber
superlight<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.130> rigid<00:00:32.640> would<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
superlight and rigid would be really

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.389 
superlight and rigid would be really
swell<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.630> well<00:00:33.870> those<00:00:33.989> are<00:00:34.280> kind<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
swell right well those are kind of

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.930 
swell right well those are kind of
expensive<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.860> there's<00:00:37.860> there's<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> lot

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
expensive and there's there's not a lot

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.510 
expensive and there's there's not a lot
of<00:00:38.969> places<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.040> super

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
of places out there that has it super

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.049 
of places out there that has it super
super<00:00:41.879> thin<00:00:42.090> wall<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.570> light<00:00:43.610> yes<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.820> there

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
super thin wall and light yes it's there

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.720 
super thin wall and light yes it's there
but<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.600> expensive<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.640> here's<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but it's very expensive so here's a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.069 
but it's very expensive so here's a
solution<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.600> found<00:00:48.989> out<00:00:49.730> while

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
solution that I found out while

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.220 
solution that I found out while
strolling<00:00:52.079> through<00:00:52.320> Walmart<00:00:53.690> go<00:00:54.690> back<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.050> the

and I'll show you that real quick so at

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.350 
and I'll show you that real quick so at
the<00:01:33.420> bottom<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.549> cane<00:01:35.549> bottom<00:01:36.180> or

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the bottom it has like a cane bottom or

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
the bottom it has like a cane bottom or
you<00:01:36.960> could<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> cane

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you could use this kind of like a cane

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640 
you could use this kind of like a cane
and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.360> has<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> rubber<00:01:39.900> plug<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and then it has a rubber plug at the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.100 
and then it has a rubber plug at the
other<00:01:40.799> end<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> pole<00:01:42.750> looks

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
other end so this is what the pole looks

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.760 
other end so this is what the pole looks
like<00:01:45.229> extended<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.990> again<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.170> ten<00:01:49.439> feet

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
like extended and again it's ten feet

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.050 
like extended and again it's ten feet
long<00:01:51.049> all<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.470> whole<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.490> material

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
long all right a whole lot of material

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.690 
long all right a whole lot of material
here<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> save<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> best<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.470> last

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
here I'm going to save the best for last

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.170 
here I'm going to save the best for last
check<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.850> out

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.480 

take<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.960> bottom<00:02:02.320> off<00:02:02.470> there's<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:02.980> cap<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
take the bottom off there's a cap and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.680 
take the bottom off there's a cap and
I'm<00:02:07.030> guessing<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.289> can<00:02:08.649> take<00:02:09.280> off

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
I'm guessing so that you can take off

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.190 
I'm guessing so that you can take off
take<00:02:10.690> out<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.790> upper<00:02:13.120> section<00:02:13.390> all<00:02:14.050> right

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
take out the the upper section all right

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.440 
take out the the upper section all right
so<00:02:14.890> what<00:02:15.100> do<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.220> got<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.940> got<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.240> whole

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
so what do you got here I got a whole

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.220 
so what do you got here I got a whole
lightweight<00:02:20.850> tons<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:22.060> material<00:02:22.660> boom<00:02:22.930> right

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
lightweight tons of material boom right

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.100 
lightweight tons of material boom right
there<00:02:23.290> that's<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.950> single<00:02:24.310> boom<00:02:24.780> put<00:02:25.780> two<00:02:25.959> of

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
there that's a single boom put two of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.170 
there that's a single boom put two of
these<00:02:26.200> together<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.800> got<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> twin<00:02:27.250> boom<00:02:27.490> it's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
these together you got a twin boom it's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.780 
these together you got a twin boom it's
a<00:02:28.209> good<00:02:28.450> dimension<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.920> very<00:02:30.280> light<00:02:30.580> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
a good dimension it is very light and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.699 
a good dimension it is very light and
it's<00:02:31.060> very<00:02:31.180> rigid<00:02:31.690> all<00:02:32.290> right<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:32.530> I'm<00:02:32.590> going

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
it's very rigid all right so I'm going

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's very rigid all right so I'm going
to<00:02:32.770> put<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.010> aside<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:34.750> there's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
to put that aside and then there's

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.380 
to put that aside and then there's
another<00:02:35.410> two<00:02:36.010> more<00:02:36.220> sections<00:02:36.550> right<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.209> got

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
another two more sections right you got

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.780 
another two more sections right you got
a<00:02:37.420> tip<00:02:38.170> section<00:02:40.920> here's<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.100> tip<00:02:42.310> section<00:02:42.520> it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
a tip section here's the tip section it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.340 
a tip section here's the tip section it
has<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.940> little<00:02:43.239> rubber<00:02:43.420> plug<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.050> which<00:02:44.170> can

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
has a little rubber plug in it which can

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.640 
has a little rubber plug in it which can
come<00:02:44.560> out<00:02:44.739> real<00:02:44.920> easy<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.489> then<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> front

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
come out real easy and then the front

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.250 
come out real easy and then the front
front<00:02:47.650> section<00:02:48.190> which<00:02:48.910> joins<00:02:49.300> our<00:02:49.630> slips

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
front section which joins our slips

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.400 
front section which joins our slips
right<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.489> front<00:02:51.730> section<00:02:52.140> now<00:02:53.140> this

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
right here this front section now this

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.400 
right here this front section now this
this<00:02:53.860> bit<00:02:54.220> right<00:02:54.459> here<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.030> still<00:02:55.720> hollow<00:02:56.020> and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
this bit right here is still hollow and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.640 
this bit right here is still hollow and
it's<00:02:57.280> very<00:02:57.670> flexible<00:02:58.260> they'll<00:02:59.260> know<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.560> it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
it's very flexible they'll know that it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.160 
it's very flexible they'll know that it
can<00:02:59.800> be<00:02:59.830> used<00:03:00.100> for<00:03:00.280> much<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.760> tip<00:03:00.940> section<00:03:01.180> but

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
can be used for much the tip section but

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.060 
can be used for much the tip section but
the<00:03:02.290> back<00:03:02.530> excuse<00:03:03.190> me<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.459> middle<00:03:03.700> section<00:03:04.030> is

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the back excuse me the middle section is

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.039 
the back excuse me the middle section is
is<00:03:06.070> pretty<00:03:06.760> rigid<00:03:07.060> it's<00:03:07.750> pretty<00:03:08.019> light<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
is pretty rigid it's pretty light I

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.070 
is pretty rigid it's pretty light I
would<00:03:11.049> say<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:12.610> would<00:03:12.910> work<00:03:13.209> for<00:03:13.480> twin<00:03:13.780> boom

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
would say it would work for twin boom

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.420 
would say it would work for twin boom
for<00:03:14.500> sure<00:03:14.910> probably<00:03:15.910> not<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.600> single<00:03:17.170> boom<00:03:17.440> you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
for sure probably not a single boom you

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.789 
for sure probably not a single boom you
know<00:03:18.549> like<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> single<00:03:19.630> boom<00:03:20.110> in<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.380> standard

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
know like a single boom in a standard

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.000 
know like a single boom in a standard
tail<00:03:21.730> configuration<00:03:22.570> definitely<00:03:23.500> twin<00:03:23.769> boom

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
tail configuration definitely twin boom

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.680 
tail configuration definitely twin boom
because<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.489> two<00:03:24.640> of<00:03:24.760> them<00:03:24.880> would<00:03:25.090> lend

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
because the two of them would lend

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.470 
because the two of them would lend
strength<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.200> one<00:03:26.350> another<00:03:26.590> it'd<00:03:26.769> be<00:03:26.920> all<00:03:27.040> cool

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
strength to one another it'd be all cool

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.970 
strength to one another it'd be all cool
okay<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.750> wanted<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.170> show<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.680> and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
okay so I just wanted to show that and

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.500 
okay so I just wanted to show that and
then<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:35.200> kicker<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:37.269> this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
then so the the kicker is is that this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.059 
then so the the kicker is is that this

it's<00:03:53.370> there<00:03:53.910> go<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.020> fishing<00:03:55.320> pole

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
it's there go to the fishing pole

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.120 
it's there go to the fishing pole
section<00:03:55.980> go<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.270> poles<00:03:57.570> only<00:03:58.200> section

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
section go to the poles only section

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.020 
section go to the poles only section
there's<00:03:59.640> poles<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.510> reels<00:04:01.170> on<00:04:02.010> one<00:04:02.610> side<00:04:02.850> and

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
there's poles and reels on one side and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.690 
there's poles and reels on one side and
then<00:04:03.120> there's<00:04:03.300> just<00:04:03.600> rods<00:04:04.320> only<00:04:04.830> on<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
then there's just rods only on the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.820 
then there's just rods only on the
right-hand<00:04:06.090> side<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.680> most

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
right-hand side and you have the most

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.730 
right-hand side and you have the most
expensive<00:04:08.310> end<00:04:08.760> towards<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.270> front<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.870> then

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
expensive end towards the front and then

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.380 
expensive end towards the front and then
you<00:04:10.860> go<00:04:11.010> all<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.280> way<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.610> back<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.150> you

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
you go all the way to the back and you

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.570 
you go all the way to the back and you
have<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.720> bamboo<00:04:13.170> fishing<00:04:13.770> poles<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.460> you

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
have the bamboo fishing poles and you

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.530 
have the bamboo fishing poles and you
then<00:04:14.790> have<00:04:15.090> these<00:04:15.330> fiberglass<00:04:15.960> carbon<00:04:16.770> fiber

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
then have these fiberglass carbon fiber

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.080 
then have these fiberglass carbon fiber
units<00:04:18.540> right<00:04:18.750> here<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:20.220> actually<00:04:20.940> this

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
units right here and so actually this

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.210 
units right here and so actually this
may<00:04:21.390> be<00:04:23.390> just<00:04:24.390> black<00:04:24.630> fiberglass<00:04:25.260> but<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:25.860> don't

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
may be just black fiberglass but I don't

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.910 
may be just black fiberglass but I don't
think<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:26.670> because<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.440> no<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.560> fact<00:04:28.770> I

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
think so because this is no in fact I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.710 
think so because this is no in fact I
can<00:04:29.070> see<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.370> inside<00:04:29.670> now<00:04:29.730> how<00:04:30.150> do<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.300> look

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
can see it inside now how do I look

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.550 
can see it inside now how do I look
you've<00:04:31.350> got<00:04:31.590> true<00:04:31.890> carbon<00:04:32.340> fiber<00:04:32.640> here<00:04:33.560> the

what else I can see it doesn't tell me
there's<00:04:56.790> also<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:57.090> 13-footer<00:04:57.870> as<00:04:58.080> well<00:04:58.290> I<00:04:58.320> don't

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
there's also a 13-footer as well I don't

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.050 
there's also a 13-footer as well I don't
I<00:04:58.860> don't<00:04:58.980> really<00:04:59.190> see<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.640> point<00:04:59.850> in

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
I don't really see the point in

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.730 
I don't really see the point in
13-footer<00:05:00.810> because<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:01.200> main<00:05:01.470> section

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
13-footer because this main section

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.650 
13-footer because this main section
right<00:05:02.130> here<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.370> more<00:05:02.850> than<00:05:03.060> enough<00:05:03.210> for<00:05:03.600> a
