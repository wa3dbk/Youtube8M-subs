think<00:03:22.470> toppling<00:03:23.040> Bernard<00:03:23.519> Hopkins<00:03:23.700> just

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
think toppling Bernard Hopkins just

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.840 
think toppling Bernard Hopkins just
dominating<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.380> way<00:03:25.530> he<00:03:25.739> did<00:03:26.010> an<00:03:26.220> all-time

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
dominating the way he did an all-time

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.210 
dominating the way he did an all-time
great<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.570> think<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.440> puts<00:03:28.739> them<00:03:28.829> in<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
great I think that puts them in the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.460 
great I think that puts them in the
running<00:03:29.760> absolutely<00:03:30.390> okay<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.660> thought<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
running absolutely okay I thought that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.500 
running absolutely okay I thought that
win<00:03:31.709> has<00:03:31.890> historical<00:03:32.670> significance<00:03:32.880> because

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
win has historical significance because

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.150 
win has historical significance because
it<00:03:33.690> may<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:33.989> been<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.170> end<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.799> maybe<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
it may have been the end and maybe the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.520 
it may have been the end and maybe the
last<00:03:35.340> bite<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.850> Bernard<00:03:36.480> Hopkins<00:03:36.660> now<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:37.440> the
