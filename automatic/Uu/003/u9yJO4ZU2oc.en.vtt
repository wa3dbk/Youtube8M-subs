00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
in the last video it's getting changed

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:36.390 
in the last video it's getting changed
next<00:03:25.459> Monday<00:03:26.739> back<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.920> my<00:03:28.069> usual<00:03:29.079> red

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.250 

interview<00:03:37.750> next<00:03:38.750> week<00:03:42.310> joining<00:03:43.310> some

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
interview next week joining some

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.500 
interview next week joining some
scientific<00:03:45.260> programs<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.129> I<00:03:46.819> need<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.390> do

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
scientific programs and I need to do

00:03:47.510 --> 00:04:03.260 
scientific programs and I need to do
training<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.019> stuff

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.730 

so<00:04:04.270> I<00:04:04.300> thought<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:04.960> microphone<00:04:05.200> was

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
so I thought that this microphone was

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.790 
so I thought that this microphone was
stereo<00:04:06.310> which<00:04:07.060> meant<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.480> would<00:04:07.600> cooled<00:04:08.380> left

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
stereo which meant it would cooled left

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.360 
stereo which meant it would cooled left
and<00:04:09.220> right<00:04:10.200> but<00:04:11.200> apparently<00:04:11.650> it's<00:04:11.860> not

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
and right but apparently it's not

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.600 
and right but apparently it's not
despite<00:04:12.760> all<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:14.100> descriptions<00:04:15.100> of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
despite all of the descriptions of

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.090 
despite all of the descriptions of
Amazon<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.140> fact<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.590> literally

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
Amazon and the fact that I literally

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.820 
Amazon and the fact that I literally
typed<00:04:18.489> in<00:04:18.700> stereo<00:04:19.269> USB<00:04:22.110> but<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.350> can<00:04:24.150> edit<00:04:25.150> my

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
typed in stereo USB but I can edit my

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.570 
typed in stereo USB but I can edit my
sound<00:04:27.000> so<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.150> just<00:04:28.360> left<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.870> right<00:04:29.580> which

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
sound so it's just left and right which

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:51.680 
sound so it's just left and right which
isn't<00:04:30.760> perfect<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:35.590> will<00:04:36.160> do<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:38.400> video
