of time and also one that comes out

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.630 
of time and also one that comes out
really<00:00:15.350> crispy<00:00:15.860> on<00:00:15.890> the<00:00:15.980> outside<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:16.400> nice

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
really crispy on the outside and nice

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
really crispy on the outside and nice
and<00:00:16.850> fluffy<00:00:17.029> on<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.269> inside<00:00:17.359> this<00:00:17.840> is<00:00:17.900> a<00:00:19.660> way

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
and fluffy on the inside this is a way

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.290 
and fluffy on the inside this is a way
of<00:00:20.690> doing<00:00:21.170> it<00:00:21.320> I<00:00:22.030> tweaked<00:00:23.030> it<00:00:23.150> in<00:00:23.240> the

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
of doing it I tweaked it in the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.580 
of doing it I tweaked it in the
microwave<00:00:23.600> basically<00:00:24.110> for<00:00:24.260> three<00:00:24.440> minutes

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
microwave basically for three minutes

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.450 
microwave basically for three minutes
first<00:00:24.949> of<00:00:25.130> all<00:00:26.560> which<00:00:27.560> basically<00:00:27.860> just<00:00:28.010> speeds

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
first of all which basically just speeds

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.790 
first of all which basically just speeds
up<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.699> cooking<00:00:29.539> process<00:00:29.750> in<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.740> main<00:00:31.490> oven

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
up the cooking process in the main oven

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.259 
up the cooking process in the main oven
instead<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:33.949> using<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.250> tray<00:00:34.550> I'll<00:00:34.729> use<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:34.969> piece

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
instead of using a tray I'll use a piece

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:42.549 
instead of using a tray I'll use a piece
of<00:00:36.999> aluminium<00:00:37.999> foil<00:00:40.839> remember<00:00:41.839> to<00:00:41.960> poke<00:00:42.409> the

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
of aluminium foil remember to poke the

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.149 
of aluminium foil remember to poke the
edges<00:00:42.829> in<00:00:42.979> these<00:00:43.489> little<00:00:43.789> things<00:00:44.659> here<00:00:45.159> stops

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
edges in these little things here stops

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.579 
edges in these little things here stops
the<00:00:46.429> Roll<00:00:46.729> falling<00:00:47.239> out<00:00:47.420> when<00:00:48.289> you're<00:00:48.409> trying

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
the Roll falling out when you're trying

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.639 
the Roll falling out when you're trying
to<00:00:48.710> pull<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.789> fall<00:00:50.030> out<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.229> make<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.409> little

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
to pull the fall out and I make a little

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.479 
to pull the fall out and I make a little
tray<00:00:56.379> so<00:00:57.379> if<00:00:57.469> you're<00:00:57.589> in<00:00:57.649> a<00:00:57.739> hurry<00:00:57.889> it<00:00:58.190> stops

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
tray so if you're in a hurry it stops

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.759 
tray so if you're in a hurry it stops
you<00:00:58.729> know<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.359> means<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.350> don't<00:01:00.440> have<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.619> do

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
you know it means you don't have to do

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.000 
you know it means you don't have to do
any<00:01:00.889> washing<00:01:01.219> up<00:01:02.379> I'll<00:01:03.379> make<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.589> little<00:01:03.799> tray

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
any washing up I'll make a little tray

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
any washing up I'll make a little tray
like<00:01:04.190> this<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:06.850> then<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:08.000> give<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.800> some<00:01:10.030> tricks

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
like this and then I give it some tricks

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.650 
like this and then I give it some tricks
with<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.300> fork<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:13.210> then<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.270> put<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.510> in<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
with the fork and then I put it in the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:25.719 
with the fork and then I put it in the
microwave<00:01:19.300> okay<00:01:20.300> so<00:01:20.680> three<00:01:21.680> minutes<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:22.130> there

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.330 

okay<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.229> potato<00:01:28.229> has<00:01:28.500> been<00:01:28.679> in<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.100> way

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
okay so potato has been in the back way

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.529 
okay so potato has been in the back way
for<00:01:29.700> three<00:01:30.030> minutes<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.149> done<00:01:33.360> has

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
for three minutes so all that's done has

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.440 
for three minutes so all that's done has
just<00:01:33.570> made<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.020> inside<00:01:34.969> slightly<00:01:35.969> softer

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
just made the inside slightly softer

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.749 
just made the inside slightly softer
which<00:01:36.659> speeds<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> process<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:38.130> browning

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
which speeds up the process of browning

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.899 
which speeds up the process of browning
it<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.210> crisping<00:01:39.569> it<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.020> oven

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
it off and crisping it up in the oven

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.550 
it off and crisping it up in the oven
when<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> put<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.179> in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.329> microwave<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.929> turned

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
when I put it in the microwave I turned

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.669 
when I put it in the microwave I turned
on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.159> fan<00:01:44.610> oven<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.299> about<00:01:45.329> 210<00:01:46.319> degrees

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
on the fan oven to about 210 degrees

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.429 
on the fan oven to about 210 degrees
which<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.039> about<00:01:47.369> 410<00:01:48.240> Fahrenheit<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.289> it's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
which is about 410 Fahrenheit so it's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.559 
which is about 410 Fahrenheit so it's
all<00:01:49.590> warm<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.069> ready<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.310> when<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> in

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
all warm and ready for when I put it in

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.059 
all warm and ready for when I put it in
so<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.319> reason<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> put<00:01:52.709> in<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.890> little

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
so the reason I put in this little

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.850 
so the reason I put in this little
phrase<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.209> just<00:01:54.600> saves<00:01:54.929> on<00:01:55.200> mass<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
phrase that it just saves on mass and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.399 
phrase that it just saves on mass and
it's<00:01:55.950> saving<00:01:56.429> it's<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.819> bit<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
it's saving it's just a bit of a

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.979 
it's saving it's just a bit of a
time-saving<00:01:59.179> exercise<00:02:00.179> so<00:02:00.720> what<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> want<00:02:00.959> to

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
time-saving exercise so what I want to
