00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.139
 good evening once is not custom I 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.660
 am a TV host 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.390
 a little like the philippe risoli du val 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.950
 d'oise present a series of guitar 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.779
 since it is found here at guitar 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.329
 village we change the guitars 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.360
 so you do so we take a 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.640
 guitar like that all stupid all 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.460
 fresh from his chore or his 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.500
 mexico or his natal japan and we 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.390
 put him microphones in more donations 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.250
 the idea too is that behind it 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.219
 is not to take that out on 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.019
 potentiometers crouch and so there is some 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.899
 behind is all that goes well 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.850
 take for example this classic 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.730
 player 50 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.309
 there she left with 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.789
 berne cults lorraine and there suddenly 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.519
 takes another color or 7 doc iluv 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.800
 rock and good with muse barnacles 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.100
 its one to google for example you 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.680
 take this TV 50 years we have him 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.110
 put I do not even know how much here ceded 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.810
 4.54 to what is quite logical 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.850
 here and then we can even make 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.040
 delusions there for example it's a joke 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.899
 toc and fia did not even know she 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.299
 would end up in case brownie pile of fortune 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.520
 with a tipi jones power hole and the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.350
 completely disconnected selector we're going 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.289
 without listening to two or three stories that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.310

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.770
