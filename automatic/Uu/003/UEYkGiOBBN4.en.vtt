00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
which Nintendo claims was at the e3

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.840 
which Nintendo claims was at the e3
advantage<00:02:43.580> unfortunately<00:02:44.580> never<00:02:44.670> got<00:02:44.819> a

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
advantage unfortunately never got a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.770 
advantage unfortunately never got a
chance<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> see<00:02:45.120> at<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.330> point<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.569> this<00:02:45.660> is

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
chance to see at that point so this is

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.309 
chance to see at that point so this is
brand<00:02:46.049> new<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:46.560> us<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.330> nutshell<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:49.200> can

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
brand new for us in a nutshell you can

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.789 
brand new for us in a nutshell you can
see<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> TV<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.930> car<00:02:52.230> drive<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> we

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
see on the TV is just a car drive and we

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.890 
see on the TV is just a car drive and we
think<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> car<00:02:53.400> driving<00:02:53.700> along<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.510> streets

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
think is a car driving along the streets

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
think is a car driving along the streets
and<00:02:55.140> from<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.519> actually<00:02:56.730> get<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and from here you can actually get a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.009 
and from here you can actually get a
more<00:02:57.150> interactive<00:02:57.360> view<00:02:57.750> where<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.930> can

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
more interactive view where you can

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.850 
more interactive view where you can
actually<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.530> kind<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:59.450> rotate<00:03:00.450> see

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
actually just kind of rotate see

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.199 
actually just kind of rotate see
basically<00:03:01.860> all<00:03:02.190> sides<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> street<00:03:03.030> think

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
basically all sides of the street think

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.300 
basically all sides of the street think
it<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.620> real-time<00:03:04.620> google<00:03:05.069> street

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
it is like a real-time google street

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.750 
it is like a real-time google street
view<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:06.510> goes<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:08.250> i<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.489> do<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
view and goes up and i can do it on the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.580 
view and goes up and i can do it on the
interesting<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.209> no<00:03:09.510> matter<00:03:09.750> how<00:03:09.930> far<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.500> go

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
interesting is no matter how far I go

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.660 
interesting is no matter how far I go
down<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.130> can<00:03:11.790> never<00:03:12.000> ever<00:03:12.420> see<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.620> driver<00:03:14.489> in

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
down I can never ever see the driver in

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.020 
down I can never ever see the driver in
question<00:03:16.190> also<00:03:17.190> if<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.370> actually<00:03:17.519> did<00:03:17.730> rotate

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
question also if I actually did rotate

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.960 
question also if I actually did rotate
like<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.359> in<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.660> car<00:03:18.840> I'd<00:03:19.109> probably<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.760> dead

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
like this in a car I'd probably be dead

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.849 
like this in a car I'd probably be dead
at<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.420> point<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> last<00:03:22.620> thing<00:03:22.709> we're

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
at this point so the last thing we're

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.890 
at this point so the last thing we're
going<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.010> look<00:03:23.070> at<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.609> HD<00:03:24.420> experience

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
going to look at is the HD experience

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.990 
going to look at is the HD experience
what<00:03:25.500> we're<00:03:25.650> seeing<00:03:25.799> here<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.280> basically<00:03:26.549> an

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
what we're seeing here is basically an

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.819 
what we're seeing here is basically an
example<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.569> what<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:27.989> use<00:03:28.200> powers<00:03:28.620> can<00:03:28.799> be

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
example of what do we use powers can be

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.039 
example of what do we use powers can be
capable<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.370> whereas<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.180> wii<00:03:30.359> was<00:03:30.600> decidedly

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
capable of whereas the wii was decidedly

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.449 
capable of whereas the wii was decidedly
more<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.319> standard<00:03:31.590> definition<00:03:32.010> console

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
