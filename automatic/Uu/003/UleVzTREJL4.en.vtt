00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.620
 good this is a short video to show my new gilbert computer 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.370
 current 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.399
 it's a cpv tower 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.379
 of the model that inspired pavilion to hp 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.210
 that comes with superior graphics card that envies kids poor's that 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.480
 can handle high definition without any problem 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.390
 windows 7 came as a prize but I supported it installed with windows 7 pozas 1 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.419
 and it comes with the most important the process which isabel 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.280
 second generation 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.800
 and it is a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 It is a quad-core processor 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 things that can not be seen abroad 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.010
 of the tower is that it comes with ten and the valse ram memory 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.220
 1 points 5 operated this hard drive 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.979
 that allows me to continue with percent problem 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:52.890
 shopkeeper 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310
 multiple open applications 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.760
 in the computer 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 what are you portico 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.550
 has as mind player hobbies I decided to divide 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.369
 burned or live 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.880
 but also something to guide so different is that it also has a 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.120
 blu-ray disc player 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.290
 then if no problem and propose a blu-ray disc like the one 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.390
 showing now 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 and you can see it in high definition through the computer 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.690
 not so obvious things 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
 is this little ticket to be able 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880
 rooms 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.820
 two front or 0 points just in case they are necessary 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.630
 and a reader of all kinds of crisis cards of st 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.399
 hs 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.399
 high capacity the ctc 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.310
 things that I added part sometimes you small extension of for more 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.970
 rooms that yield two points 0 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.970
 because of the need for so many devices that need that 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.550
 It has an infrared controller 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.000
 It is used with this remote control with which the computer came for 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.049
 windows media center 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.629
 this is here simply there is an applicator is ninth with the 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.569
 computer 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 this came as 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.729
 deceased mass and microphone 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:22.449
 to be able to listen 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.229
 for 100 obama sounds 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.539
 the internet installation also changes 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.489
 wiring harness lambri co 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.219
 that way you can save a little money 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.569
 of not having to have so much meat 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.519
 and is that I use ideas in my own way also this computer can handle 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.539
 no problems wireless signals 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.539
 just like the playstation 3 that is on the side 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:46.969
 a computer 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.709
 damiá has cost has installed a small Toshiba portable hard drive 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.269
 in this way you can save information 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.139
 and if something is lost it becomes clear what I can have and I can transfer it to another 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.539
 computer was informed 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.629
 efe previously one of the things with which the computer comes 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.269
 with special characteristics 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.090
 it is because of the graphics card being of such high quality and high 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.229
 technology 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.229
 allows one configuration and two monitors 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.040
 which is using a 46-inch samsung TV with a main monitor 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.659
 3d inches 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.939
 and I'm using as a secondary monitor 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.129
 a 15-inch monitor of o 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.709
 I only use it 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.379
 occasionally when I need to monitor a window while I'm 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.879
 working in the 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.189
 aa main monitor 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.289
 It also configures the way the room has 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:47.639
 I can show what this has and I know a design of two tables 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.899
 in parallel to each other in that way a mass 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.109
 is true such a mind 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.799
 us room for the monitors that another months totally 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.779
 the available so that I can work study 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.749
 I need to write have enough space to do it because there 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:06.589
 changes 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:08.429
 to move freely 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.669
 this is a small sample of my keyboard and the books of which of 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.299
 urge 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.299
 easily empower my bishop or microphone to 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.090
 to do that 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.090
 when I need to communicate through the internet 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.430
 so this is a small sample 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.520
 d as I configured today designed things so I can afford to work with 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.719
 more easily 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.329
 one of the main reasons is because I'm going to be spying on programming 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.909
 the baby 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:42.309
 the language is 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:44.969
 percent and for database management 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.240
 díez always good shopkeeper a screen available 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.690
 Large size percent, especially with 12, is quantified by the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.690
 multiple by 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.719
 in my next video is showing 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.360
 a test of the graphics card like some videos in high definition 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.870
 from YouTube 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.020
 and also to test the internet speed of 7 2 megabits per second efe 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.069
 I have 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.469
 I ate internet provider to be approved
