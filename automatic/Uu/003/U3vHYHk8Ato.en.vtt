00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.600
 nick simon mignolet million we just have the main force and the castle 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.689
 on top of the mountain 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.989
 corio was a place where many artists settled, such as 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.400
 mathys are welcome 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.890
 in that classification 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.960
 because it can add up here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.659
 the wait is 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:25.919
 on the other hand is the eye 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.300
 to be inspired 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.039
 and this is how you look at all artists behind me 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.010
 who are all selling art 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.570
 And then yes they try not only to win the tour but for example 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.280
 also needed 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520
 yes make beautiful things 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.410
 I have a drawing block on 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.320
 and get it 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.520
 what a large share in the first place to find on the street 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 we ask if they mean together with my team 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 maria drink strong coffee 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.160
 We have asked ourselves a number of complaints are the ones there 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.790
 but not every 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.670
 artist wants to help me 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.670
 opponent self-direction artists 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.800
 I mean 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.410
 there are so many people 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.440
 I'm just going to look at yourself 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.890
 can help with this 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 to complete this drawing 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.229
 the case has a number of people at home and this has finally come true 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.090
 and now I hear you think 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.920
 there seems nothing like bommel at all that is more than three years old 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.049
 It was all about your disorder, and even the sun 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.600
 with a little six on these drawings and that will increase 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.140
 years the city still art 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.030
 means what artists 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.920
 I can't say if six of these artists have a strong advance 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.200
 I was also not yet able to say what is the best they could only do with puzzle pieces 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.479
 catch oneself 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.980
 and they have 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.509
 he so i didn't do a drawing 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.809
 have a drawing this piece has better of all kinds of different people 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.829
 don't know jordan plans 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.879
 people connected that way 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.879
 and that is perhaps even better 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.849
 do you want to know what i have on the rest of the list with those in it 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.760
 on the Dutchman but I am already doing my bit
