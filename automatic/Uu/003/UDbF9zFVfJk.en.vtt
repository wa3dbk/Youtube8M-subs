00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.970
 so I'm going to introduce you to the 182 death receiver that you 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.370
 allows to replace a wired motor command by the radio commando that you 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.370
 will allow the centralization of flying from a distance 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.949
 same with which I did as you can see we put ourselves in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.720
 a junction box 3 it goes in 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.300
 who more than it is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 the two lists on each side 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.970
 who is thus to put an end to his days to fix it to the wall this way of life of his 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.300
 classical 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 Why 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 and then you put two cages of cleanliness 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.610
 on the spot on the global order 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.980
 so even a new one shown how could even extend this command 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.179
 the summer current 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.480
 a carmine mouth not to command 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.570
 so you simply press the programming button which is a sequel 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.939
 but the hello pressing the stop button the statuette 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.620
 then you press the button on the remote 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.890
 and it's recorded 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.440
 so now that we have recorded the remote control you 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.650
 show that we made blood so blood flow it presses the button 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.690
 descent 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.830
 it's like you can see 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 the health component 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.510
 for a moment on the sidelines 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.810
 new room 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.329
 you can then not be more than ever beholden luxembourg 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.859
 according to him the problem 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.570
 so as you could see we programmed on three tracks 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.070
 rolling 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.990
 now we made this film on three shutters 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.550
 and we will show you how to centralize its three roller shutters 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.890
 so we installed it on the first roller shutter or seeing it more 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.580
 large 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.450
 he presses the down button on the remote control and the downlight on 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.310
 extends its first five clubs 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.310
 I will now be on the second channel 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 of my remote control and I bring down the Gabonese people 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.649
 still not with the same remote but a small point of 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.279
 suture on the second channel and so on on the third tier as 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:20.079
 surprising powers placing on the third channel this sensitive subject 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.739
 third tier 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.129
 we will now see that do you want three shutters are closing 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.449
 and we will be able to see legally 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.789
 than with the channel for example 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.159
 we are going to be able to climb all three at the same time we wanted 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.699
 close all three at the same time 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 so I'm on the canal 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.449
 I press the key up 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.639
 you will see the three parts 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.639
 do not miss 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.950
 so what allows you so by doing grouped orders on a same 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.519
 channel the control multiple flaps you can put all your rollers on a 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.519
 multiple channel allowing to make orders days 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.389
 for any questions do not hesitate to send your questions 5
