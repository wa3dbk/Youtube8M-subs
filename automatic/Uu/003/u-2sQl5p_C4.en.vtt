00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
that's for that and it the car does

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.950 
that's for that and it the car does
slide<00:01:35.210> like<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:38.550> back<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.540> then

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
slide like this and back so and then

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.240 
slide like this and back so and then
here<00:01:40.230> is<00:01:40.440> Darth<00:01:41.040> Maul<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.580> he<00:01:42.510> fits<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.250> these

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
here is Darth Maul and he fits in these

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130 
here is Darth Maul and he fits in these
two<00:01:44.490> basically<00:01:44.880> stud<00:01:45.270> looking<00:01:45.600> pieces<00:01:45.810> there

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
two basically stud looking pieces there

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.399 
two basically stud looking pieces there
and<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:49.050> bottom<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.470> his<00:01:49.620> feet<00:01:50.900> go<00:01:51.900> on<00:01:52.140> there

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
and the bottom of his feet go on there

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.670 
and the bottom of his feet go on there
so<00:01:52.800> he<00:01:53.400> does<00:01:53.580> move<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.600> main<00:01:54.810> feature

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
so he does move this is the main feature

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.140 
so he does move this is the main feature
here<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.400> lightsaber<00:01:57.590> his<00:01:58.590> forearm<00:01:59.220> area<00:01:59.430> can

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
here the lightsaber his forearm area can

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.719 
here the lightsaber his forearm area can
spin<00:02:00.740> 360<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.870> his<00:02:03.870> arm<00:02:04.110> does<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.500> Bend<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
spin 360 and his arm does not Bend so it

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.760 
spin 360 and his arm does not Bend so it
stays<00:02:05.970> straight<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.810> loop<00:02:07.590> around

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
stays straight but it can loop around

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.110 
stays straight but it can loop around
and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.990> then<00:02:10.950> obviously<00:02:11.130> then<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and then and then obviously then that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.110 
and then and then obviously then that
can<00:02:12.500> swim<00:02:13.500> all<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.709> way<00:02:13.830> around<00:02:13.980> also<00:02:14.430> same

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
can swim all the way around also same

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.050 
can swim all the way around also same
thing<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.540> when<00:02:15.750> this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
thing with this when this

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.860 
thing with this when this
one<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:17.080> loop<00:02:17.739> around<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.670> does<00:02:19.239> not<00:02:19.420> Bend

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
one can loop around but it does not Bend

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.870 
one can loop around but it does not Bend
much<00:02:20.110> out<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.770> positions<00:02:21.190> already<00:02:21.370> bent

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
much out of that positions already bent

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.880 
much out of that positions already bent
