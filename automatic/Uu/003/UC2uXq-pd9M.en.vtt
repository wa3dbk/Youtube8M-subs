00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.730
 I wonder if it's been a while since today 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:12.809
 So do not you've met do video program 's not the first time the store this year de likely 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:18.670
 That's right Ikanella went up and entered a different program 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.050
 It seems that you are on the studio in the upper studio and come to see 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:27.660
 Yet if before about 10 years 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.110
 The other day like also still have to talk of'm fledgling for example work if you ask me the place and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 Whether this was better that the Do not want to see I say 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.250
 I can say that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.010
 Hey, if Haitai 20 years 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:44.570
 It's delicious too much and I can't treat one sound like that 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.859
 It can not be obtained in the manner I Yeah I I am saying if there be heard in that sense 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.239
 That's right 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.239
 I wish I could do it 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.060
 After all, it feels like a relationship 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:17.220
 here nyo 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.360
 That 's it from the old days of Koyano 7 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.600
 Now everyone who says Mutoh ears 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.870
 I'm a master, so the program on that plane is still a little under budget 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 Because say not read those people 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.450
 I went with only young people 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 Shelf more than ten years more 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.630
 At that time, I will complain if I can play a sound of Mr. Kin 's own back 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.190
 Charles Bronson also did me 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.140
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.530
 Isn't it like this shovel? 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 Do you hear my father's voice in a rare smoke is a cat couple 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:59.400
 It's hard to cry or Na Ne is there No that does not sweets insight 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.370
 Roughness difficult still of considerable research and not Tone Takeron It seems easy but that Mikoto guy the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.390
 I become monotonous 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.570
 That everyone, in a low voice, I say Bosobosobosoboso 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.170
 However , while doing it ah 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.520
 It's very difficult I think I have a or of that person 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.330
 I kinda had tone between its unique because 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.420
 Even though it's low, it doesn't calculate properly, it's just a stick 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:29.010
 Said the wind Tteyuu Zenze sound shift 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.000
 That's why it's a bit difficult, I guess- once or twice. 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.640
 I can not do that , there 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.800
 I think that I understand because I'm a musician , that rhythm 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.900
 For example, when the line is a note 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:52.240
 And some people can not use only three in this Once you have that there is this from here to here 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.870
 But when it comes to other companies, I will be able to use it in various ways in many ways. 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.300
 you know 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.480
 You may be able to grow sharply even during this long gone 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.819
 To fit between the and packed push the sound of its sides 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.590
 Came 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.710
 It's tar, isn't it? 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.260
 But not much heard in the bar and have heard centralization 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.530
 It's perfectly there is this and that listening is a good person ears a 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:21.680
 I don't feel west and I'm after recording 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:25.459
 For example, why is also a good towards the people shining a number of the pitch even if the opportunities in the video 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:31.549
 I can't take it, so I'm not listening consciously 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:38.060
 So the little things than their middle, for example, it that it is in my case it's Bronson 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:39.200
 It is this sound to have It is Bronson system when it says in the wind that it is understood so well 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.670
 It is 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.340
 When it comes to lady Chiwa Guidomark 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:54.020
 At a place where I became a little closer to my own voice , I was able to speak a little here 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:04:00.460
 It is a Widmark medicine It is a mouse when you talk only with your own high tone 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:03.030
 I mean become Fu say old Iyandaa', not living a 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.030
 By me 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.940
 It's a great job if you buy a couple 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:16.889
 Valley is this I think the first job is a guy who is a cat 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:22.980
 Linearity Is Well That cartoon is still comic So 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:29.370
 The three-dimensionality of the part is completely different depending on the person who enters Seven Ile 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.600
 Rarely me any more strongly and delicately that make up the character in that sense 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.510
 You 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.080
 The sloppy man's scorpion or loneliness or Ehime and Kan 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.440
 The I mean protect black I'd have to Tteyuu black demon king in the place I went to that 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.060
 Is 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.020
 U 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.860
 that 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:49.270
 But I be thought after all that it is black Mao of a post rats I 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.750
 Say angry Bibi et al. In what I rat man or what I there that it was heard 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:57.500
 Elementary school child 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.500
 It's a rare task in the mean time, so a foolish guy comes out a little 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:08.420
 Otsuka swears, so let's say Otsu value view and say 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:11.070
 I 'm going to fly a rat and you're told that you're a rat-boy and you're going to be a kid 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.760
 Not regret the next moment that or say that 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.540
 I have to go there 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.540
 Though
