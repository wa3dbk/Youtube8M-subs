the<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.780> a<00:00:21.810> second<00:00:22.110> time<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:23.100> wanted<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the for a second time we we wanted to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.150 
the for a second time we we wanted to
keep<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.029> over-the-top<00:00:24.720> style<00:00:25.199> moves<00:00:25.830> that

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

we<00:00:26.279> already<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.910> first<00:00:27.180> game<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.990> bit

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we already have in first game it's bit

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.230 
we already have in first game it's bit
crazy<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.949> bit<00:00:29.160> unrealistic<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.029> it's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
crazy it's bit unrealistic but it's

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.260 

Just<00:00:36.269> Cause<00:00:36.330> two<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.829> realistic<00:00:38.430> we

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
Just Cause two is it's not realistic we

Just Cause two is it's not realistic we
don't<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.960> realistic<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> more

much all the time

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.959 
much all the time
you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.410> jump<00:00:55.620> from<00:00:55.770> vehicle<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> vehicle<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you can jump from vehicle to vehicle you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
you can jump from vehicle to vehicle you
can<00:00:57.120> find<00:00:57.329> around<00:00:57.480> other<00:00:57.840> vehicles<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.500> can

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
steal one of the vehicle to drive

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.150 
steal one of the vehicle to drive
alongside<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> other<00:01:01.680> chasing

alongside one of the other chasing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
alongside one of the other chasing
vehicles<00:01:02.550> jump<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> roof<00:01:03.329> shoot<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
vehicles jump up to the roof shoot the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100 
vehicles jump up to the roof shoot the
tire<00:01:04.350> off

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.950 

maybe<00:01:07.800> plant<00:01:08.130> c4<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.850> their<00:01:09.030> roof<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.720> jump

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
maybe plant c4 of their roof then jump

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.950 
maybe plant c4 of their roof then jump
to<00:01:10.110> another<00:01:10.170> vehicle<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.920> set<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> off

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.840 

and<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.680> integrated<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.460> combat

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and it's integrated with the combat

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.000 
and it's integrated with the combat
system<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.480> while<00:01:18.930> you're<00:01:19.230> climbing<00:01:19.560> around

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
system so while you're climbing around

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.460 
system so while you're climbing around
on<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.310> vehicles<00:01:20.730> you<00:01:21.120> can<00:01:21.390> at<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.930> same<00:01:22.170> time

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
on the vehicles you can at the same time

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.969 
on the vehicles you can at the same time
fire<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.610> reference<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.420> enemies

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.980 

and<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.430> course<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:28.880> use<00:01:29.030> more<00:01:29.270> creative

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
and of course you can use more creative

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.140 
and of course you can use more creative
ways<00:01:30.170> as<00:01:30.380> well<00:01:30.590> use<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.159> grappling<00:01:31.700> hook

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
ways as well use a grappling hook

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.330 
ways as well use a grappling hook
maybe<00:01:32.720> tethering<00:01:33.260> at<00:01:33.380> one<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.979> guards

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
maybe tethering at one of the guards

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.370 
maybe tethering at one of the guards
inside<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.790> vehicle<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.300> its<00:01:35.360> own<00:01:35.540> vehicle<00:01:36.080> so

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
inside the vehicle to its own vehicle so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.350 
inside the vehicle to its own vehicle so
he<00:01:36.530> gets<00:01:36.770> dragged<00:01:37.070> along<00:01:37.220> behind<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:37.880> vehicle

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
he gets dragged along behind the vehicle

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.840 
he gets dragged along behind the vehicle
what<00:01:39.320> happens<00:01:39.590> if<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:39.800> tether<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.190> car<00:01:40.490> to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
what happens if you tether the car to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.750 
what happens if you tether the car to
one<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.720> statues<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.650> pass<00:01:42.890> along

cross the desert you probably want an

cross the desert you probably want an
off-road<00:02:10.640> vehicle

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.900 

you<00:02:13.170> could<00:02:13.350> run<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.680> grass<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.370> will<00:02:14.460> feel<00:02:14.700> one

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
you could run on grass it will feel one

way if you're driving on ice in the
Arctic<00:02:16.620> region<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:17.190> skid<00:02:17.460> about<00:02:17.670> rather

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
Arctic region you will skid about rather

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.180 
Arctic region you will skid about rather
much<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.600> even<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.500> weather<00:02:19.680> system<00:02:20.070> is
