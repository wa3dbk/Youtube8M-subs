something like that and this is for like

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.280 
something like that and this is for like
a<00:03:41.620> analog<00:03:42.620> which<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.400> not<00:03:43.639> as<00:03:43.760> good<00:03:43.909> as<00:03:44.030> a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
a analog which is not as good as a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.520 
a analog which is not as good as a
digital<00:03:45.290> other<00:03:45.739> way<00:03:45.919> I<00:03:45.950> hear<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.450> yeah<00:03:47.720> he's

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
digital other way I hear so yeah he's

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.110 
digital other way I hear so yeah he's
kind<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:48.859> different<00:03:49.430> than<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.579> expected<00:03:50.000> it

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
kind of different than I expected it

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.470 
kind of different than I expected it
would<00:03:50.150> be

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
would be

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.099 
would be
anyways<00:03:50.810> let's<00:03:51.019> put<00:03:51.199> that<00:03:51.290> aside<00:03:51.680> oh<00:03:53.079> yeah<00:03:54.079> I

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
anyways let's put that aside oh yeah I

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.569 
anyways let's put that aside oh yeah I
think<00:03:54.319> this<00:03:54.409> is<00:03:54.470> also<00:03:54.620> for<00:03:54.859> if<00:03:55.010> your<00:03:55.159> receiver

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
think this is also for if your receiver

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.219 
think this is also for if your receiver
I<00:03:55.669> think<00:03:55.849> what<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.209> mainly<00:03:56.629> purpose<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.079> for

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
I think what this mainly purpose is for

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.759 
I think what this mainly purpose is for
is<00:03:57.349> a<00:03:57.379> if<00:03:58.159> your<00:03:58.310> receiver<00:03:58.669> does<00:03:59.389> not<00:03:59.930> have<00:04:00.650> an

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
is a if your receiver does not have an

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.830 
is a if your receiver does not have an
HDMI<00:04:01.190> port<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.120> where<00:04:02.329> this<00:04:02.419> thing<00:04:02.629> comes
