literally<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.120> game<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:52.320> you're

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
literally in this game I think you're

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.950

going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.699> i'm<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:54.180> sure<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.570> for

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
going to see i'm pretty sure it's for

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.479 
going to see i'm pretty sure it's for
but<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> might<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.800> three<00:00:56.039> team<00:00:56.850> kills<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
but it might be three team kills so

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
but it might be three team kills so
there's<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.609> lot<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.930> spots<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.350> map<00:01:01.649> where

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
there's a lot of spots on this map where

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.329 
there's a lot of spots on this map where
your<00:01:02.010> name<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.730> pop<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:04.339> we

third<00:02:45.239> map<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.810> was<00:02:45.930> pretty<00:02:46.170> epic<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.890> I'll

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
third map that was pretty epic so I'll

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.100 
third map that was pretty epic so I'll
most<00:02:47.700> likely<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:48.180> posting<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.079> think

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
most likely be posting that and I think

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.140 
most likely be posting that and I think
I<00:02:49.380> may<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.650> went<00:02:49.829> like<00:02:49.980> five<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.489> five<00:02:50.670> or<00:02:50.910> five

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
I may it went like five and five or five

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.120 
I may it went like five and five or five
and<00:02:51.360> six<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.989> was<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.590> was<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.860> such<00:02:53.099> a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and six but it was it was just such a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.229 
and six but it was it was just such a
team<00:02:53.750> team<00:02:54.750> map<00:02:55.349> like<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:56.549> all<00:02:56.790> work<00:02:57.030> together

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
team team map like we all work together

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.530 
team team map like we all work together
it's<00:02:57.720> pretty<00:02:57.989> good<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:59.120> you'll<00:03:00.120> probably<00:03:00.329> be
