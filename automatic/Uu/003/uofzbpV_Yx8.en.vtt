00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
it's about 8:30 in the evening I do

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.720 
it's about 8:30 in the evening I do
notice<00:04:30.670> lipstick<00:04:31.510> starting<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.200> bleed<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:33.100> the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
notice lipstick starting to bleed on the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.020 
notice lipstick starting to bleed on the
outside<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.270> my<00:04:34.360> lips<00:04:34.630> more<00:04:35.320> so<00:04:35.710> on<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.700> right

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
outside of my lips more so on the right

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.860 
outside of my lips more so on the right
side<00:04:37.590> with<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.860> long<00:04:39.190> last<00:04:39.550> lasting<00:04:40.420> finish

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
side with the long last lasting finish

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.420 
side with the long last lasting finish
it's<00:04:41.320> weird<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:41.590> they<00:04:41.770> would<00:04:41.920> call<00:04:42.160> this<00:04:42.370> a

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
it's weird that they would call this a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.780 
it's weird that they would call this a
matte<00:04:42.850> finish<00:04:43.120> because<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:45.250> doesn't<00:04:45.670> really

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
matte finish because it doesn't really

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.790 
matte finish because it doesn't really
look<00:04:46.000> like<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.240> matte<00:04:46.510> finish<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:47.230> me<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.410> could

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
look like a matte finish to me I could

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.150 
look like a matte finish to me I could
still<00:04:48.100> see<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.340> light<00:04:48.640> reflecting<00:04:48.670> off<00:04:49.570> the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
still see the light reflecting off the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.430 
still see the light reflecting off the
lipstick<00:04:51.160> as<00:04:51.340> I<00:04:51.580> showed<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:51.970> earlier

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
lipstick as I showed you earlier

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.380 
lipstick as I showed you earlier
transferwise<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:55.690> get<00:04:55.870> more<00:04:56.080> transfer<00:04:56.890> from

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
transferwise you get more transfer from

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.350 
transferwise you get more transfer from
this<00:04:58.390> lipstick<00:04:58.900> than<00:04:59.890> the<00:05:00.280> matte<00:05:00.520> one<00:05:00.940> I<00:05:01.150> think

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
this lipstick than the matte one I think

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.960 
this lipstick than the matte one I think
the<00:05:01.480> color<00:05:01.750> payoff<00:05:02.050> is<00:05:02.410> beautiful<00:05:02.920> on<00:05:03.070> both<00:05:03.100> it

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
the color payoff is beautiful on both it

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.630 
the color payoff is beautiful on both it
goes<00:05:04.150> on<00:05:04.360> evenly<00:05:04.900> it's<00:05:05.290> smooth<00:05:05.710> they<00:05:06.130> smell

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
goes on evenly it's smooth they smell

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.910 
goes on evenly it's smooth they smell
really<00:05:06.970> nice<00:05:07.330> too<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.140> pigmentation<00:05:08.710> is

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
really nice too and the pigmentation is

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.160 
really nice too and the pigmentation is
just<00:05:09.160> beautiful<00:05:09.730> I<00:05:09.910> do<00:05:10.270> believe<00:05:10.810> they<00:05:10.960> are

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
just beautiful I do believe they are

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.010 
just beautiful I do believe they are
long<00:05:11.500> lasting<00:05:11.980> lip<00:05:12.190> colors<00:05:12.550> if<00:05:12.820> you're<00:05:13.720> not

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
long lasting lip colors if you're not

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.010 
long lasting lip colors if you're not
eating<00:05:14.620> anything<00:05:15.090> otherwise<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.510> comes<00:05:16.810> off

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
eating anything otherwise it comes off

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.320 
eating anything otherwise it comes off
just<00:05:17.050> like<00:05:17.440> any<00:05:17.710> other<00:05:18.010> lipstick<00:05:18.760> if<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.120> were

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
just like any other lipstick if I were

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.450 
just like any other lipstick if I were
to<00:05:19.480> choose<00:05:19.750> one<00:05:19.810> over<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.470> other<00:05:20.650> I<00:05:21.100> would

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
to choose one over the other I would

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.120 
to choose one over the other I would
choose<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.570> matte<00:05:22.840> color<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:23.530> because<00:05:23.740> it's

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
choose the matte color just because it's

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.330 
choose the matte color just because it's
less<00:05:24.640> transfer<00:05:25.419> so<00:05:26.140> that's<00:05:26.680> pretty<00:05:27.070> much<00:05:27.190> it

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
less transfer so that's pretty much it

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.730 
less transfer so that's pretty much it
