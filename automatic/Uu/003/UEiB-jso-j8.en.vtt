00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.620
 hello friends how were you welcome to 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.940
 how to play to play guitar and 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.430
 well this time I wanted to talk about 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.929
 a very important issue that is the subject of 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.259
 the people who want to learn to 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:17.110
 play guitar and are left-handed well is a 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.029
 important issue because usually in 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.859
 all sides of the scores the courses 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.380
 the guitars are all made for 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.619
 right-handed then the whole theory is 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.689
 thought for right-handed people then 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.300
 a lefty finds himself with that chorus and 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.180
 now what do I do then there are two 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.030
 ways of playing being left-handed and those two 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.090
 forms for me there is one that is the most the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.879
 the logic would be better for me and it's the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.129
 which is best suited to all normals 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.170
 and everything that is the theory and 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.789
 practice is understood much faster and 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.300
 is handled with them with the same 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.440
 terms the other one is already more didactic in 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.120
 the sense that we have to change 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.000
 some things especially in the way of 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.280
 the chords 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.920
 but for me it has certain limitations 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.920
 not for that reason there have been many musicians 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.020
 lefties and they have done it this way this 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.450
 and they have not had any problems 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.170
 but in the case of them is and hendrix 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.539
 another is this gary moore for example by 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.530
 example I say but in some cases they 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.509
 they have said that they have felt 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.950
 limited in the subject of what is the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.250
 practice of execution in the part of 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.560
 speed and some other details 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.719
 then also what you have as 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.789
 disadvantage that those who take 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.229
 new figures of chords new things 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.240
 then it's like that besides having to 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.600
 learn the whole theory of the whole beach 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.219
 we have to learn to do it differently 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.739
 then like for me it would not be 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.009
 logical the logical thing would be to be able to use the 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:47.590
 guitar in a normal way playing like 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.209
 left-handed and be able to see what we see 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.709
 all social chords in the same way 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.899
 the scores in the same way then 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.509
 what happens if we make one 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.630
 common guitar any guitar 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.610
 is made for a right-hander so that in 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.579
 the left hand to the chords and the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.750
 right hand do the squeegee well in the 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.940
 case of a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.480
 left-handed one finds that if the return to the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.970
 guitar has a small problem that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.830
 can not can not do the chords of 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.220
 same way because the first one is 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.810
 up and the sixth is down or the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.230
 I keep the ones that will have to be on top 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.720
 they are below then here where I 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.370
 I say that we have to change the shape of 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.890
 figures because obviously to be able 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.450
 make an example a chord of 2 what 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.520
 we have to do so then that the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.440
 chord doc was different then this 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.750
 is wrong and this is what I said and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.540
 explained on the subject that we have to 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.160
 changing the figures is more uncomfortable and 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.040
 for me it would not be logical then what 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.050
 logical is to have a guitar for left-handed 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.760
 that today is manufactured old today 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.489
 in day they have always manufactured what 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.600
 happens that they are less in the case 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.520
 of a creole guitar 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 we can adapt it because what 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.070
 we have to do 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.690
 grab to change the strings that 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.940
 general on guitar bridges 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.100
 classic we will not have a problem with the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.630
 the sixth hole that we will go through 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.920
 the little hole in the first one and what 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.460
 we will have to turn in the capo 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.040
 the game is played here so that the height 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.080
 that we had on this side 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.180
 stay on this side then it's the same 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.500
 we change the arrangement of the strings 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.240
 and here what we have is this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.420
 we have half the same way 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.360
 then we are left-handed here we go 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.880
 to use the left hand to do 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.690
 plagiarism and arpeggios and the right hand 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.940
 in this case it will happen to do the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.730
 chords and chords will be seen from the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.530
 same way that in the right hand what 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.000
 only thing that we have to take into account is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.990
 that is going to be the other way around the use of 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.760
 hands well if with righties do 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.820
 you tap with this and we call 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.610
 to this hand the finger one two three and 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.530
 four for lefties is going to be the other way around 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.420
 it's going to be the left hand that's going to 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.980
 do the taps and let's call finger 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.920
 one of 22 of 23 and 24 to the fingers of the 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.870
 hand be right then hand 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.630
 left now is going to be the arpeggios 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.570
 let's call it thumb finger index finger 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.919
 older finger and ring finger then the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.109
 only difference that we're going to 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.120
 simply find the change of hands 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.190
 but then the rest is going to be everything 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.190
 same let's make the chords of equal 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.879
 way well then the southpaw will be able 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.199
 touch 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.340
 comfortably and will learn that way 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.979
 because let's not forget that when 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.379
 we learn guitar in the first stage 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.780
 it's difficult and once we learned and 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:43.409
 we went through a whole development will change 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.789
 all that development in the middle that is 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.159
 half complicated we do not have to 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.949
 decide what is the way we go 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.560
 to touch to bone the u2 have the option 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.960
 to play one way or another for me 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.580
 is that explained if the ropes 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.750
 were upside down from how they are now 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.039
 would be the logical thing well besides this for 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.469
 example this guitar has a problem 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.330
 that has this curvature like this in this 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.400
 case is uncomfortable but there are guitars that 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.250
 already come prepared so that this 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.560
 part is upside down as if we were 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.610
 left-handed and we looked backwards okay 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.680
 so 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.090
 and that's what they have to have in 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.949
 count the lefties who have those two 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.930
 options for me the logic of the 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.669
 adopted guitar what happens that of 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.280
 suddenly many like they do not have a 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.849
 adapted guitar start playing like this and 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.750
 they learn in the best way 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.090
 you think it's okay so I do not know 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.009
 disappointed because he's being left-handed 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.050
 can play the guitar and can 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.639
 learn all theories or learning 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.620
 the same as we learn all the 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.939
 Right-handed 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.979
 in the same way they can learn what 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:51.099
 same simply that they have to achieve 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.110
 this get your instrument in the case 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.300
 of transformers you already know that they can 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.430
 adapt in the case an electric is already 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.139
 a little more difficult as acoustic 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.110
 because bridges sometimes do not 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.349
 allow or by how they are made but 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.479
 good what's important if we want to learn 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.039
 of really we can start with a 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.469
 Creole that we can adapt up to 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.300
 can we buy a guitar that is 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.599
 for lefties that is adapted made 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.919
 basuro luthier or a sovereign someone 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.419
 that burns and the guitar that can 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.790
 do that can do the transformation 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.250
 of the guitar for 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.410
 in the arrangement that we need well 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.540
 but starting with a tribe would already be a 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.700
 good option and for me this is logical 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.860
 but you are lucky to be able 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.860
 decide if they go for one side they go for the 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.690
 another because suddenly if they do it for 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.140
 the other capable way that gives them some 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.360
 creativity as has happened with some 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.250
 musicians is a different creativity 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.500
 that suddenly as they see it from another 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.140
 perspective have other options and 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.330
 can generate other songs that 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.670
 they sound different from what we do 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.770
 commonly with the same scales the 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:00.340
 right then and it would be the advantage that 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:03.010
 could have the left-hander if he takes the part 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.340
 to change the figure of the chords but 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:09.220
 for me it would not be logical for me 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.320
 logical and come and work on this in 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.360
 this area more comfortable and the 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.190
 creativity to really use it for 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.800
 where it is used with 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.950
 creativity in its greatest exponent or 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.670
 whether you have it, if it is 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.250
 good 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.140
 developed well this has been all 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.610
 I hope that jump of the video see you 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.610
 the next lot of luck 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.870
