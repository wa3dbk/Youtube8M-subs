you're trying to be accurate with that
one<00:00:53.100> shot<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.880> very<00:00:54.210> much<00:00:54.450> harder<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
one shot it was very much harder in

one shot it was very much harder in
battlefield<00:00:55.380> 3<00:00:55.470> than<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.250> ever<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.030> Bad

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

battlefield 3 than it ever was in Bad
Company<00:00:57.600> 2<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.380> apparently<00:00:58.860> this<00:00:59.040> was<00:00:59.280> all<00:00:59.460> as

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
Company 2 and apparently this was all as

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.300 
Company 2 and apparently this was all as
a<00:00:59.760> result<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.330> the<00:01:00.480> popularity<00:01:00.990> and<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
a result of the popularity and the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.249 
a result of the popularity and the
feeling<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> sniping<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.630> Bad<00:01:03.780> Company<00:01:04.049> 2

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
feeling that sniping in Bad Company 2

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.039 
feeling that sniping in Bad Company 2
was<00:01:04.589> almost<00:01:04.920> overpowered<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:05.850> they<00:01:06.540> gave<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
was almost overpowered so they gave the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.430 
was almost overpowered so they gave the
whole<00:01:07.320> sniper<00:01:08.310> class<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.000> bit<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.630> nerf<00:01:09.870> but<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
whole sniper class a bit of a nerf but I

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.470 
whole sniper class a bit of a nerf but I
have<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> say<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> skins<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.910> sniper<00:01:12.360> or

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
have to say the skins for the sniper or

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.420 
have to say the skins for the sniper or
the<00:01:12.600> Recon<00:01:13.050> class<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.890> completely

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the Recon class to be completely

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.980 
the Recon class to be completely
accurate<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.970> battlefield<00:01:15.750> 3<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
accurate in battlefield 3 and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
accurate in battlefield 3 and
battlefield<00:01:16.380> 4<00:01:16.760> aren't<00:01:17.760> really<00:01:18.060> skinned<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
battlefield 4 aren't really skinned so I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620 
battlefield 4 aren't really skinned so I
particularly<00:01:19.110> liked<00:01:19.440> apart<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.150> US

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

ghillie<00:01:51.720> suits<00:01:51.990> came<00:01:52.200> from<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:53.100> were

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
ghillie suits came from and they were

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.760 
ghillie suits came from and they were
very<00:01:53.460> first<00:01:53.760> used<00:01:54.120> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> British<00:01:54.659> Army<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.650> a

start of the 20th and sort of the end of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.590 
start of the 20th and sort of the end of
the<00:01:58.440> 19th<00:01:58.950> century<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.790> were<00:01:59.850> first<00:02:00.299> feature

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the 19th century they were first feature

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.380 
the 19th century they were first feature
really<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.920> second<00:02:02.400> bow<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.850> war<00:02:03.060> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
really in the second bow of war so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
really in the second bow of war so
that's<00:02:03.570> where<00:02:03.810> ghillie<00:02:04.140> suits<00:02:04.409> come<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:05.010> now

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that's where ghillie suits come from now

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.670 
that's where ghillie suits come from now
ghillie<00:02:05.760> suits<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.690> downsides<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.500> real

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
ghillie suits do have downsides in real

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.880 
ghillie suits do have downsides in real
life<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.489> are<00:02:08.519> bloody<00:02:09.360> worn<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.289> wear<00:02:10.500> so

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
life they are bloody worn to wear so

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710 
life they are bloody worn to wear so
maybe<00:02:11.549> if<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:11.940> were<00:02:12.000> ever<00:02:12.180> brought<00:02:12.480> back

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
maybe if they were ever brought back

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360 
maybe if they were ever brought back
there<00:02:12.959> could<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.140> some<00:02:13.529> kind<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.829> a<00:02:13.950> mobility

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
there could be some kind of a mobility

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.819 
there could be some kind of a mobility
penalty<00:02:15.239> would<00:02:15.420> ghillie<00:02:15.749> suits<00:02:16.049> because<00:02:16.529> of

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
penalty would ghillie suits because of

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.130 
penalty would ghillie suits because of
the<00:02:16.889> fact<00:02:17.129> they<00:02:17.370> they're<00:02:17.999> heavy<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:18.930> not

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the fact they they're heavy but it's not

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.990 
the fact they they're heavy but it's not
much<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.860> heaviness<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.370> them<00:02:20.730> because

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
much that the heaviness of them because

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.610 
much that the heaviness of them because
of<00:02:21.120> course<00:02:21.210> as<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> soldier<00:02:22.050> you're<00:02:22.170> wearing

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
of course as a soldier you're wearing

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.170 
of course as a soldier you're wearing
lots<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.920> armor<00:02:23.220> anyway<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.550> that's<00:02:23.819> going<00:02:24.090> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
lots of armor anyway so that's going to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.720 
lots of armor anyway so that's going to
be<00:02:24.330> heavy<00:02:24.660> it's<00:02:25.350> more<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.980> fact<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.580> it's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
be heavy it's more the fact that it's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.180 
be heavy it's more the fact that it's
sealing<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.510> all<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.959> heat<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:28.770> you're<00:02:28.950> in

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
sealing in all the heat so if you're in

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.460 
sealing in all the heat so if you're in
a<00:02:29.340> sort<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.670> combat<00:02:30.120> zone<00:02:30.390> which<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.660> very<00:02:31.140> warm

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
a sort of combat zone which is very warm

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
a sort of combat zone which is very warm
ghillie<00:02:31.950> suits<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.430> make<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.819> almost

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
ghillie suits can make you almost

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.630 
ghillie suits can make you almost
overheat<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:34.950> were<00:02:35.010> ever<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.490> come

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
overheat so if they were ever to come

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.980 
overheat so if they were ever to come
back<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.970> maybe<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.360> would<00:02:36.480> could<00:02:36.750> come

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
back and maybe they would could come

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.600 
back and maybe they would could come
with<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> mobility<00:02:37.470> penalty<00:02:38.130> although<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> don't

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
with a mobility penalty although I don't

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.880 
with a mobility penalty although I don't
see<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.060> point<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.480> ghillie<00:02:40.380> suits<00:02:40.650> for

Bad Company 2 game when I think about it

Bad Company 2 game when I think about it
if<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.780> could<00:03:09.959> sum<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.470> almost<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.250> image

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
if I could sum it up almost in one image

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.280 
if I could sum it up almost in one image
it<00:03:11.700> would<00:03:11.820> be<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.060> image<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.600> guy<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.200> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
it would be an image of a guy in a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.720 
it would be an image of a guy in a
ghillie<00:03:13.500> suit<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:13.950> there<00:03:14.070> were<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.459> many

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
ghillie suit but there were so many

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.000 
ghillie suit but there were so many
things<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.450> loved<00:03:15.720> about<00:03:15.900> Bad<00:03:16.260> Company<00:03:16.560> 2

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
things I loved about Bad Company 2

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.160 
things I loved about Bad Company 2
but<00:03:17.519> ghillie<00:03:17.760> suits<00:03:18.060> was<00:03:18.269> definitely<00:03:18.900> one<00:03:19.140> of

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
but ghillie suits was definitely one of

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.740 
but ghillie suits was definitely one of
them<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.130> guess<00:03:20.400> are<00:03:20.730> we<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.420> see

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
them so I guess are we going to see

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.449 
them so I guess are we going to see
ghillie<00:03:22.019> suits<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.590> battlefield<00:03:23.070> 4<00:03:23.130> we've

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.130 
ghillie suits in battlefield 4 we've
only<00:03:23.610> got<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:23.820> day<00:03:24.239> you'll<00:03:24.360> see<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:24.959> left

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
only got one day you'll see really left

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.890 
only got one day you'll see really left
that's<00:03:25.350> final<00:03:25.829> stand<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.970> possibility<00:03:27.450> we

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
that's final stand it's a possibility we

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.479 
that's final stand it's a possibility we
could<00:03:28.049> see<00:03:28.200> seeing<00:03:28.620> ghillie<00:03:28.890> suits<00:03:29.220> in

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
could see seeing ghillie suits in

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.590 
could see seeing ghillie suits in
battlefield<00:03:30.299> 4

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
battlefield 4

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.930 
battlefield 4
I<00:03:30.950> highly<00:03:31.950> doubt<00:03:31.980> we'll<00:03:32.459> see<00:03:32.700> them<00:03:32.910> in

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
I highly doubt we'll see them in

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.729 
I highly doubt we'll see them in
battlefield<00:03:33.480> hardline<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.230> never<00:03:34.500> know

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
battlefield hardline but you never know

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.150 
battlefield hardline but you never know
but<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:36.000> it's<00:03:36.180> highly<00:03:36.570> unlikely<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:37.440> I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
but I think it's highly unlikely but I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.130 
but I think it's highly unlikely but I
suppose<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.820> next<00:03:39.000> game<00:03:39.269> we<00:03:39.480> might<00:03:39.690> be<00:03:39.900> seeing

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
suppose the next game we might be seeing

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.440 
suppose the next game we might be seeing
them<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.560> if<00:03:40.739> they<00:03:40.920> do<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.220> bad<00:03:41.640> company<00:03:41.970> free

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
them is if they do a bad company free

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.420 
them is if they do a bad company free
and<00:03:42.660> they<00:03:43.049> are<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> must<00:03:43.620> if<00:03:43.920> there's<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.190> bad

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
and they are a must if there's a bad

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.580 
and they are a must if there's a bad
company<00:03:44.700> free<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.570> have<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:46.110> see<00:03:46.320> ghillie

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.130 
company free we have to see ghillie
suits<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:47.130> my<00:03:47.280> opinion<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.720> final<00:03:49.049> thing

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
suits in my opinion and the final thing

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.509

aggressive<00:03:55.620> recon<00:03:55.829> but<00:03:56.220> I'll<00:03:56.310> drop<00:03:56.579> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
aggressive recon but I'll drop the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.729

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
the g3 or the m1 garand and I'd have a

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.640 
the g3 or the m1 garand and I'd have a
squad<00:04:03.090> I'd<00:04:03.329> have<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> guy<00:04:03.810> playing<00:04:04.230> assault

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
squad I'd have a guy playing assault

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.949 
squad I'd have a guy playing assault
dropping<00:04:05.010> ammo<00:04:05.280> we'd<00:04:05.489> have<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> medic<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.480> what

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.319 
dropping ammo we'd have a medic and what
I<00:04:06.989> would<00:04:07.170> do<00:04:07.380> as<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.920> aggressive<00:04:08.430> recon<00:04:09.120> is

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
I would do as the aggressive recon is

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.600 
I would do as the aggressive recon is
throw<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.870> motion<00:04:10.260> bulls<00:04:10.500> say<00:04:11.130> for<00:04:11.250> example

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
throw the motion bulls say for example

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.890 
throw the motion bulls say for example
the<00:04:11.730> goon<00:04:11.880> appraisal<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.510> were<00:04:12.630> going<00:04:12.780> to

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the goon appraisal we were going to

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.750
