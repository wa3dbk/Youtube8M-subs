few farms there with little patches of

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.890 
few farms there with little patches of
bamboo<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.910> there<00:00:21.060> are<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.450> natural

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
bamboo and there are just a natural

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
bamboo and there are just a natural
resource<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.740> could<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.100> for

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
resource that you could use for

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.090 
resource that you could use for
virtually<00:00:23.850> anything<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.710> that<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.860> when<00:00:26.070> I

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
virtually anything and that was when I

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.529 
virtually anything and that was when I
first<00:00:26.880> thought<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.570> bamboo<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.580> when

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
first thought about bamboo but then when

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.330 
first thought about bamboo but then when
I<00:00:30.570> had<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> wrecking<00:00:31.260> yard<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.710> working<00:00:32.129> in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I had the wrecking yard I was working in

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.000 
I had the wrecking yard I was working in
Japan<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.239> place<00:00:33.449> called<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.900> water<00:00:34.110> it's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
Japan the place called your water it's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.360 
Japan the place called your water it's
in<00:00:35.280> between<00:00:35.430> Kyoto<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.570> Osaka<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.470> that's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
in between Kyoto and Osaka and that's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450 
in between Kyoto and Osaka and that's
the<00:00:38.579> capital<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.120> car<00:00:39.570> Wrecking<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.170> Japan<00:00:40.620> but

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the capital of car Wrecking in Japan but

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280 
the capital of car Wrecking in Japan but
in<00:00:41.670> amongst<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.510> wrecking<00:00:42.840> yards

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
in amongst all the wrecking yards

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.970 
in amongst all the wrecking yards
there's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> huge<00:00:44.070> forest<00:00:44.880> of<00:00:45.329> bamboo<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.829> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
there's a huge forest of bamboo and I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.590 
there's a huge forest of bamboo and I
was<00:00:47.130> up<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.520> once<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> good<00:00:48.450> bit

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
was up there once and get a good bit

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
was up there once and get a good bit
homesick<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.320> wandered<00:00:49.710> into<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.040> forest

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
homesick so I wandered into this forest

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.430 
homesick so I wandered into this forest
and<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> wet<00:00:51.120> day<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> misty<00:00:52.200> rain

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and it was a wet day and the misty rain

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.889 
and it was a wet day and the misty rain
and<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.399> absolutely<00:00:53.940> magic<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and it was just absolutely magic and

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.260 
and it was just absolutely magic and
that's<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.950> think<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.640> where<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> bamboo

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that's I think is where the bamboo

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
that's I think is where the bamboo
captured<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.980> thought<00:00:59.309> right

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
captured me from then on I thought right

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.029 
captured me from then on I thought right
this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> way<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.200> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> live

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
this is the way I want to live

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.810 
this is the way I want to live
that's<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.120> peaceful<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.809> serene<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
that's just so peaceful and serene and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.859 
that's just so peaceful and serene and
then<00:01:05.820> put<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.240> into<00:01:06.539> an<00:01:06.690> agricultural

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
then put that into an agricultural

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.710 
then put that into an agricultural
product<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.539> where

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
product it's got to go and that's where

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
product it's got to go and that's where
it<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.930> started<00:01:12.560> bamboo<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:14.490> probably<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it all started bamboo it's probably the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.389 
it all started bamboo it's probably the
one<00:01:15.270> most<00:01:15.740> environmentally<00:01:16.740> friendly<00:01:17.130> plant

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
one most environmentally friendly plant

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.940 
one most environmentally friendly plant
on<00:01:17.580> earth<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:18.780> Asia<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.649> can<00:01:19.800> see

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
on earth if you go into Asia you can see

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.669 
on earth if you go into Asia you can see
it's<00:01:20.069> the<00:01:20.160> backbone<00:01:20.459> of<00:01:20.729> Asian<00:01:21.270> culture<00:01:21.679> it

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
it's the backbone of Asian culture it

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.230 
it's the backbone of Asian culture it
doesn't<00:01:23.039> matter<00:01:23.160> if<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.429> Indonesia<00:01:24.000> or

China any of the Asian countries that's
there<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> took<00:01:28.349> bamboo<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:29.099> those

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
there if you took bamboo out of those

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.070 
there if you took bamboo out of those
countries<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.819> whole<00:01:29.940> props<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.420> fall<00:01:30.660> over

countries the whole props to fall over

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.770 
countries the whole props to fall over
there's<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.830> old<00:01:31.979> saying<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.580> bamboo<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
there's an old saying with bamboo the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
there's an old saying with bamboo the
uses<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.590> limited<00:01:35.009> by<00:01:35.220> your

uses are just limited by your
imagination<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> use<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.560> virtually

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
imagination you can use it for virtually

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.830 
imagination you can use it for virtually
anything<00:01:38.429> if<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.119> look<00:01:39.300> around<00:01:39.660> if
