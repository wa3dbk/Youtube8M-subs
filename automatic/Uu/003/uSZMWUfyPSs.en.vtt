little swirly designs and circles
there's<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.139> triangles<00:00:16.590> right<00:00:16.710> here

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
there's some triangles right here

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.120 
there's some triangles right here
however<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:18.380> what<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> mean<00:00:19.619> must<00:00:19.830> really
