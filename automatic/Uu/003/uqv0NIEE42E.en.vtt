00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.210
 very well 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.740
 first of all say that previously 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.430
 the project has uploaded a news 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.139
 saying that playstation 4 had been 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.960
 hacked and that many people had said 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.480
 that we had been a little eyelash like 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.310
 they were doing work 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.250
 maintenance 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.970
 Playstation Sanson and he will not tell you 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.619
 you that are let 'not be traded 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.190
 playstation obviously if you do not enter 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.790
 panic then they have been able to fix that 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.949
 problem and it already works perfectly you 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.309
 has given very little time but 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.540
 it has really been hacked so no 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.379
 I think there's no problem with the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.309
 theme of passwords and such we stay 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.050

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.790
 commemorative of the 20th anniversary go 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.470
 what is a playstation box or is it a 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.379
 edition that is composed of a 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.860
 playstation 4 184 and a playstation 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.620

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.990
 queue for the celebration of 20 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 anniversary it turns out that if you have 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.730
 made with one of these consoles can 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.950

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.710
 some who have bid up to fifteen thousand 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.430
 dollars for it apparently this remittance 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.740
 what would have done are and was very very 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.530
 very small cortita for this 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.800
 playstation x that was the first console 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.700
 that took out sony 20 years ago 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.750
 have that also sold for 499 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.570
