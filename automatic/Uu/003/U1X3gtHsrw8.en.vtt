00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
footage of this and I've played some

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.620 
footage of this and I've played some
other<00:05:31.220> mickey<00:05:31.520> mouse<00:05:31.790> games<00:05:32.090> on<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.360> Super

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
other mickey mouse games on the Super

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.510 
other mickey mouse games on the Super
Nintendo<00:05:32.750> as<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.290> child<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:34.130> I'm<00:05:34.310> pretty

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
Nintendo as a child so I'm pretty

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.730 
Nintendo as a child so I'm pretty
excited<00:05:34.640> to<00:05:35.150> dive<00:05:35.390> into<00:05:35.630> this<00:05:35.840> one<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.290> see

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
excited to dive into this one and see

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.190 
excited to dive into this one and see
how<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:37.010> goes<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.520> don't<00:05:38.210> think<00:05:38.450> it<00:05:38.570> very<00:05:38.870> long

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
how it goes I don't think it very long

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.960 
how it goes I don't think it very long
so<00:05:39.590> this<00:05:39.740> is<00:05:39.860> probably<00:05:40.100> going<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:40.580> be<00:05:40.640> when<00:05:40.880> the

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970
