doesn't it no of course it does i just
died<00:02:00.700> i<00:02:00.909> tend<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.210> think<00:02:01.270> there's<00:02:01.899> always<00:02:02.200> a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
died i tend to think there's always a

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.230 
died i tend to think there's always a
way<00:02:02.289> of<00:02:02.499> catching<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:02.920> fish<00:02:03.100> course<00:02:03.549> yeah<00:02:03.789> and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
way of catching a fish course yeah and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.480 
way of catching a fish course yeah and

yeah so with all that natural food in
there<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> fish<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.640> sit<00:02:45.910> down<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.360> eat<00:02:46.570> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
there the fish can sit down just eat the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.170 
there the fish can sit down just eat the
natural<00:02:47.020> food<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.410> don't<00:02:47.830> believe<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.970> fish

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
natural food I don't believe the fish

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.420 
natural food I don't believe the fish
are<00:02:49.330> on<00:02:49.450> naturals<00:02:49.960> for<00:02:50.260> any<00:02:50.530> period<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:51.010> time<00:02:51.070> I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
are on naturals for any period of time I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.980 
are on naturals for any period of time I
really<00:02:52.060> think<00:02:52.210> they're<00:02:52.390> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.600> go<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.870> eat

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
really think they're going to go and eat

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.150 
really think they're going to go and eat
the<00:02:53.080> boilers<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.500> eat<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.830> food<00:02:54.010> we're

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
the boilers and eat the food we're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.130 
the boilers and eat the food we're
putting<00:02:54.430> out<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.790> by<00:02:55.510> eating<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> boilie

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
putting out that by eating the boilie

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.260 
putting out that by eating the boilie
they're<00:02:56.650> getting<00:02:56.980> more<00:02:57.130> goodness<00:02:57.550> for<00:02:58.120> less

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
they're getting more goodness for less

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.910 
they're getting more goodness for less
energy<00:02:58.720> it's<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.320> that<00:02:59.470> little<00:02:59.650> pool

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
energy it's just on that little pool

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.290 
energy it's just on that little pool
yeah<00:03:00.070> it's<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.460> dinner<00:03:00.670> play<00:03:00.940> isn't<00:03:01.150> it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
yeah it's like a dinner play isn't it

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.370 
yeah it's like a dinner play isn't it
rather<00:03:01.390> than<00:03:01.600> rummaging<00:03:02.020> through<00:03:02.200> all<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
boilers I do tend to bait out large

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.560 
boilers I do tend to bait out large
areas<00:03:14.290> if<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.530> can<00:03:14.770> yeah<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.520> do<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.390> fish

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
areas if I can yeah I do like the fish

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.510 
areas if I can yeah I do like the fish
moving<00:03:16.900> around<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.680> pick<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> bait<00:03:18.160> up<00:03:18.310> here

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
moving around to pick a bait up here

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.800 
moving around to pick a bait up here
they<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:18.730> competing<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:19.180> over<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.480> fish<00:03:19.660> for

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
they are competing with over a fish for

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.930 
they are competing with over a fish for
the<00:03:19.870> food<00:03:20.110> then<00:03:20.710> I<00:03:20.830> find<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.520> they<00:03:21.670> tend<00:03:21.850> to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
the food then I find that they tend to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.940 
the food then I find that they tend to
make<00:03:22.090> more<00:03:22.270> mistakes<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:23.140> I've<00:03:23.230> had<00:03:23.350> loads<00:03:23.770> of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
make more mistakes and I've had loads of

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.980 
make more mistakes and I've had loads of
multiple<00:03:24.400> caches<00:03:24.580> by<00:03:24.910> fishing<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.360> way<00:03:25.540> not

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
multiple caches by fishing that way not

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.200 
multiple caches by fishing that way not
just<00:03:26.020> on<00:03:26.410> here<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:27.160> on<00:03:27.310> other<00:03:27.460> villages<00:03:27.910> homes

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
just on here but on other villages homes

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.900 
just on here but on other villages homes
yeah<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:29.200> do<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.100> turn<00:03:30.310> up<00:03:30.520> and<00:03:30.700> put

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
yeah so you just do you turn up and put

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.020 
yeah so you just do you turn up and put
in<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.180> set<00:03:31.390> amount<00:03:31.480> every<00:03:32.050> time<00:03:32.080> orgy<00:03:32.800> no<00:03:33.670> just

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
in a set amount every time orgy no just

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.970 
in a set amount every time orgy no just
you<00:03:34.120> blend<00:03:34.360> literally<00:03:34.780> not<00:03:34.930> it'll<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.770> read

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
you blend literally not it'll you read

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.470 
you blend literally not it'll you read
on<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.160> situation<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:36.970> don't<00:03:37.180> think

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
on the situation that you don't think

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.750 
on the situation that you don't think
last<00:03:38.110> time<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.350> come<00:03:38.590> here<00:03:38.650> put<00:03:39.100> set<00:03:39.550> them<00:03:39.670> out

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
last time I come here put set them out

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.070 
last time I come here put set them out
of<00:03:39.850> bait<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.300> I'm<00:03:40.390> going<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.600> turn<00:03:40.750> up<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.020> do

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
of bait and I'm going to turn up and do

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.900 
of bait and I'm going to turn up and do
exactly<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.650> same<00:03:41.680> because<00:03:42.370> then<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.730> doesn't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
exactly the same because then it doesn't

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.310 
exactly the same because then it doesn't
happen<00:03:43.090> because<00:03:43.360> it's<00:03:43.570> not<00:03:43.720> always<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.020> same

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
happen because it's not always the same
