00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.050
 let's make a mousse cake 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.780
 chocolate the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.560
 for our cake is the base and for the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:21.579
 base we're going to need 200 grams of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.009
 ground biscuit that is a package 100 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:26.739
 grams of butter and another 100 grams 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.619
 of chocolate the first thing we're going to 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.220
 to do is melt butter with 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.220
 chocolate 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.780
 well as you can see it's already well melted 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.780
 we separate it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.059
 and we are going to add the cookie 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.769
 We will form as a blanket for the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.769
 background 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.030
 well we have already well mixed now 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.130
 let's put in the bottom of our 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.650
 mold as you see I have put a paper 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.980
 underneath to later unmold the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.980
 best 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.840
 Well, we already have extended well 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.610
 our basis for this we are going to 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.370
 book in the fridge 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.070
 good as we have already made our base 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.550
 now let's make our music for 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.580

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.940

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.850
 dessert chocolate can already be white 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.910

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.250
 chocolate with the yolks 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.000
 it is a little thick but good what 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.000
 let's reserve 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.530
 Well, we already have our 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.380

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.650
 let's put a little bit of the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.650
 Meringue 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.810
