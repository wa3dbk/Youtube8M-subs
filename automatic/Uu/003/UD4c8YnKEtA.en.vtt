00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
being this is a contemporary monastery

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.390 
being this is a contemporary monastery
so<00:00:57.489> we're<00:00:57.760> different<00:00:58.210> than<00:00:58.420> almost<00:00:58.629> any<00:00:59.199> other

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
so we're different than almost any other

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.670 
so we're different than almost any other
group<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.610> religious<00:01:01.150> in<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.050> Komen<00:01:02.410> Catholic

group of religious in the Komen Catholic
Church<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.670> by<00:01:03.940> being<00:01:04.089> contemplative<00:01:04.809> we

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
Church so by being contemplative we

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.740 
Church so by being contemplative we
intend<00:01:06.310> to<00:01:06.369> live<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.580> life<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:07.090> prayer<00:01:07.479> and

intend to live a life of prayer and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.800 
intend to live a life of prayer and
meditation<00:01:08.310> rather<00:01:09.310> than<00:01:09.759> doing<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.570> prayer

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
meditation rather than doing the prayer

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.320 
meditation rather than doing the prayer
and<00:01:10.930> meditation<00:01:11.020> has<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.490> launch<00:01:12.729> board<00:01:13.030> to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
and meditation has the launch board to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.320 
and meditation has the launch board to
do<00:01:13.479> ministry<00:01:13.979> either<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.190> a<00:01:15.250> parish<00:01:15.790> or<00:01:16.000> school

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
do ministry either in a parish or school

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.770 
do ministry either in a parish or school
university<00:01:17.170> or<00:01:17.259> some<00:01:17.470> others<00:01:17.710> social<00:01:18.310> study

university or some others social study

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.740 
university or some others social study
so<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.920> it's<00:01:21.220> oriented<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.090> prayer<00:01:22.450> and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
so because it's oriented to prayer and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.469 
so because it's oriented to prayer and
meditation<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.680> study<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:25.479> have<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:27.479> explicit

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
meditation and study we have an explicit

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.550 
meditation and study we have an explicit
commitment<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.410> being<00:01:30.570> self-supporting<00:01:31.600> so

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
commitment to being self-supporting so

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.139 
commitment to being self-supporting so
that's<00:01:32.800> why<00:01:32.979> we<00:01:33.220> have<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:33.490> manual<00:01:33.850> labor

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
that's why we have it's manual labor

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.170 
that's why we have it's manual labor
component<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:35.080> our<00:01:35.289> life<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.850> kind<00:01:37.119> of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
component to our life so that kind of

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.850 
component to our life so that kind of
differentiates<00:01:37.840> us<00:01:38.020> from<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.380> rest<00:01:38.530> over

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
differentiates us from the rest over

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.460 
differentiates us from the rest over
again<00:01:39.760> most<00:01:40.060> of<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.330> rest<00:01:40.689> of<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.990> Catholic

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
again most of the rest of the Catholic

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.359 
again most of the rest of the Catholic
churches<00:01:42.130> villages<00:01:42.820> as<00:01:43.060> well<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:45.189> of<00:01:45.220> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
churches villages as well one of the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.050 
churches villages as well one of the
reasons<00:01:45.729> we're<00:01:46.240> doing<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.840> broom<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.799> um

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
reasons we're doing a broom is that um

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.719 
reasons we're doing a broom is that um
brewing<00:01:49.060> itself<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:50.140> labor<00:01:50.530> intensive<00:01:51.159> so

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
brewing itself is not labor intensive so

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.800 
brewing itself is not labor intensive so
our<00:01:52.030> brew<00:01:52.420> day<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:54.100> basically<00:01:54.790> need<00:01:55.119> two<00:01:55.479> people

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
our brew day I basically need two people

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.649 
our brew day I basically need two people
in<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.049> brew<00:01:56.259> house<00:01:56.500> one<00:01:57.159> of<00:01:57.310> those<00:01:57.460> being<00:01:57.970> lab

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
in the brew house one of those being lab

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
in the brew house one of those being lab
proficient

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.950 

Packaging<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.579> hard<00:02:03.880> part<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.390> running<00:02:04.750> a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
Packaging is the hard part of running a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.429 
Packaging is the hard part of running a
brute

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
brute

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.690 
brute
so<00:02:06.219> in<00:02:06.729> our<00:02:06.939> packaging<00:02:07.509> ha<00:02:07.689> we<00:02:08.170> need<00:02:08.349> 5<00:02:08.800> minimum

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
so in our packaging ha we need 5 minimum

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.509 
so in our packaging ha we need 5 minimum
but<00:02:10.420> we<00:02:10.599> almost<00:02:10.840> always<00:02:11.200> have<00:02:11.530> 6<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.190> with

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
but we almost always have 6 and with

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:20.309 
but we almost always have 6 and with
many<00:02:13.090> days<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.720> 7<00:02:16.739> our<00:02:17.739> community<00:02:19.319> coming

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
many days we have 7 our community coming

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.770 
many days we have 7 our community coming
to<00:02:20.620> terms<00:02:20.890> with<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.580> fact<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:22.150> needed<00:02:22.420> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
to terms with the fact that we needed to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.900 
to terms with the fact that we needed to
get<00:02:22.930> involved<00:02:23.319> in<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.709> new<00:02:23.890> industry<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.610> order

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
get involved in a new industry in order

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.140 
get involved in a new industry in order
to<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.989> allow<00:02:26.530> our<00:02:26.739> monastic<00:02:27.099> life<00:02:27.879> and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
community to flourish in years to come

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.960 
community to flourish in years to come
it<00:02:31.660> involved<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> lot<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.379> hurdles<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.310> go<00:02:33.549> over

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
it involved a lot of hurdles to go over

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.710 
it involved a lot of hurdles to go over
just<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.870> project<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.829> going

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
just to get this project up and going

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.470

two brothers who went to Belgium to
learn<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.269> art<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.690> brewing<00:02:47.680> here<00:02:49.739> the

monastic Brewers have really gotten up

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.839 
monastic Brewers have really gotten up
to<00:02:53.530> speed<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.010> gotten<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> lot<00:02:54.430> more<00:02:54.489> training

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
to speed and gotten a lot more training

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.720 
to speed and gotten a lot more training
the<00:02:55.690> beer<00:02:56.170> itself<00:02:56.769> we've<00:02:57.340> really<00:02:57.610> achieved

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
the beer itself we've really achieved

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.259 
the beer itself we've really achieved
the<00:02:58.720> flavor<00:02:59.049> profile<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.860> we<00:03:00.250> intended<00:03:00.879> and

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
the flavor profile we we intended and

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.569 
the flavor profile we we intended and
we're<00:03:02.019> brewing<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> lot<00:03:02.769> of<00:03:02.799> consistency

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
we're brewing with a lot of consistency

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.390 
we're brewing with a lot of consistency
so<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.780> at<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.959> point<00:03:05.260> I'd<00:03:05.560> say<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:06.130> biggest

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
so so at this point I'd say the biggest

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.129
