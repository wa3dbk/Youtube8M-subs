00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 the decision on the combat aircraft took time 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.850
 how we live 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.989
 were competing in two other manufacturers with one Swedish 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:09.619
 and other Americans 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.819
 they are hunts of last generation 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:16.109
 What is the meaning of this purchase for the Brazilian military? 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.359
 see in the report of sandra bonera 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.180
 next year they start to be built 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.399
 a shipyard at a naval base in Itaguaí in the state of Rio 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.399
 there will be mounted four conventional submarines 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.950
 nuclear powered 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.280
 the design and construction of rivers system will be developed in Brazil with 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.950
 Conventional submarines are of a model like 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.420
 that scorpéne that is powered by diesel and electricity 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.660
 have to climb to the surface to recharge the batteries the scorpéne has 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.310
 70 meters long travels at a set speed to 11 kilometers per 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.360
 hour and is a depth of 50 to 500 meters 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.590
 each cost 415 million euros' more than one billion reais 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.290
 the nuclear submarine the barracuda is an adaptation of scorpion only greater and 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.420
 with propulsion generated by nuclear hector 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.340
 has a length of 100 meters reaches a speed of around 11 to 65 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 kilometers per hour reaches deep water 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.110
 cost 1 1 billion and 250 million euros about 3 billion reais with 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.190
 transfer of French technology will also be built in Brazil in the 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.670
 helibrás factory in itajubá in minas gerais' 50 helicopters of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.899
 transport and modern rescue 725 euro eurocopter 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.190
 the agreement also provides that the export of this model to southern 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.990
 Africa is made by Brazil 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.610
 the Brazilian government also announced that it will buy 36 fighters from France 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.830
 rafale state-of-the-art aircraft that reach up to 2,000 kilometers per 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.589
 hour and has the ability to attack eight targets at once 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:18.039
 competed with the rafale the Swedish gripen and the American f 18 super hornets 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.829
 specialists heard by the good day Brazil affirm that the armament 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.010
 is compatible with the needs of the country 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.509
 and that this fleet makes Brazil the greatest military power 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.169
 of all Latin America 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.209
 for collection I can fulfill your international responsibilities 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.119
 and to the main I believe he is able to take care of his territory 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.359
 of its territorial waters 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.719
 and this today is done either with modern equipment or by means 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.799
 Brazil then declines this equipment and later that 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.479
 nilton the knowledge needed to develop these electronic media etc.
