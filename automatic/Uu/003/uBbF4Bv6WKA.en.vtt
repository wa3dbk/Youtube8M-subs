00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
looking absolutely fantastic i'm very

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.530 
looking absolutely fantastic i'm very
happy<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.710> nice<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.540> fluid

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
happy with it and it's nice and fluid

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.119 
happy with it and it's nice and fluid
and<00:00:39.840> everything<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.710> looks<00:00:40.890> great

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and everything like that it looks great

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.160 
and everything like that it looks great
I<00:00:41.309> mean<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> doesn't<00:00:41.850> look<00:00:42.000> quite<00:00:42.239> gold<00:00:42.719> at<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
I mean it doesn't look quite gold at the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.750 
I mean it doesn't look quite gold at the
moment<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
moment but I think that's because of the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.010 
moment but I think that's because of the
way<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.360> fluid<00:00:48.870> reacts<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.530> white<00:00:49.829> light

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
way the the fluid reacts to white light

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
way the the fluid reacts to white light
but<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.399> natural

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
but when it's you know when it's natural

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.549 
but when it's you know when it's natural
daylight<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> i<00:00:54.180> turn<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> LEDs<00:00:55.199> off<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
daylight and i turn the LEDs off it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.020 
daylight and i turn the LEDs off it
looks<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.250> looks<00:00:56.579> fantastic<00:00:58.850> it's<00:00:59.850> all

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
looks it looks fantastic it's all

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.569 
looks it looks fantastic it's all

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
if you look at the previous video and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
if you look at the previous video and
compare<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> how<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.339> looks<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:05.610> you'll

on me on the gold mix and its a mix of
clear<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.869> gold<00:01:22.140> pearls<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> how<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
clear with gold pearls which is how you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.070 
clear with gold pearls which is how you
get<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> color<00:01:25.640> what<00:01:26.640> seems<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.720> doesn't

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

seem<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.590> quite<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> same<00:01:29.520> effect<00:01:29.579> while

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
seem to have quite the same effect while

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.899 
seem to have quite the same effect while
it's<00:01:30.450> running<00:01:30.630> through<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> tubes<00:01:31.909> as

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
it's running through the tubes as

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.600 
it's running through the tubes as
something<00:01:33.659> which<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.100> more<00:01:35.340> solid

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
something which is like a more solid

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.130 
something which is like a more solid
darker<00:01:36.299> color<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:37.140> molasses<00:01:37.710> red<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
darker color like molasses red or the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.910 
darker color like molasses red or the
extension<00:01:40.140> green<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.530> anything<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
extension green or anything like that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.460 
extension green or anything like that
because<00:01:41.220> um<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.840> mean<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:42.990> looking<00:01:43.229> through

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
because um I mean you're looking through

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.580 
because um I mean you're looking through
the<00:01:43.680> most<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.670> side<00:01:44.880> panel<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.380> look

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the most of my side panel on if you look

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.389 
the most of my side panel on if you look
it<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.640> quite<00:01:48.560> thin<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> core<00:01:50.189> it's

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it it's quite thin on the core it's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280 
it it's quite thin on the core it's
quite<00:01:50.729> thin<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> choose<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> can't

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
quite thin in the choose but you can't

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.550 
quite thin in the choose but you can't
see<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.200> obviously

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
see it and it's you know it's obviously

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.100 
see it and it's you know it's obviously
a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.950> better<00:01:56.159> than<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.909> before<00:01:57.240> again<00:01:58.079> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
a lot better than it was before again I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
a lot better than it was before again I
think<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.530> also<00:01:58.950> partly<00:01:59.340> due<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
think this is also partly due to the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.590 
think this is also partly due to the
light<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.869> everything<00:02:01.729> if<00:02:02.729> i<00:02:02.909> turn<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> LEDs

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
light and everything if i turn the LEDs

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.970 
light and everything if i turn the LEDs
or<00:02:03.689> few<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> XP<00:02:04.380> anything

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
or few of the XP anything

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.410 
or few of the XP anything
because<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.460> quite<00:02:05.670> dark<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:06.030> room<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
because it's quite dark your room and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600
