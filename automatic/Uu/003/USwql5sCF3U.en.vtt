00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.730 
I hope this isn't too smelly you guys
are<00:01:25.780> gonna<00:01:25.869> have<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.080> problem<00:01:28.439> in-game<00:01:29.439> you

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
are gonna have a problem in-game you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.499 
are gonna have a problem in-game you
stir<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.100> pot<00:01:30.280> for<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.549> couple<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.820> seconds<00:01:31.270> but

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
stir the pot for a couple of seconds but

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.820 
stir the pot for a couple of seconds but
I<00:01:31.540> have<00:01:31.689> a<00:01:31.750> feeling<00:01:31.869> it's<00:01:32.170> gonna<00:01:32.290> take<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.560> lot

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
I have a feeling it's gonna take a lot

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.440 
I have a feeling it's gonna take a lot
longer<00:01:32.979> than<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.640> cook<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.970> massive

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
longer than that to cook the massive

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.020 
longer than that to cook the massive
amount<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.750> cabbage<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:36.340> been<00:01:36.490> boiling<00:01:36.700> for

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
amount of cabbage it's been boiling for

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.460 
amount of cabbage it's been boiling for
about<00:01:37.119> 10<00:01:37.479> minutes<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:37.930> looks<00:01:38.049> like<00:01:38.320> it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
about 10 minutes it looks like it's

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:49.260 
about 10 minutes it looks like it's
about<00:01:38.680> done<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:40.330> let's<00:01:40.689> test<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
about done so let's test it it's

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.040 
about done so let's test it it's
actually<00:01:49.810> not<00:01:49.990> terrible<00:01:51.420> there's<00:01:52.420> way<00:01:53.020> more

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
actually not terrible there's way more

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.240 
actually not terrible there's way more
salt<00:01:53.560> than<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:53.830> would<00:01:53.979> typically<00:01:54.340> use<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.710> if

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
salt than I would typically use but if

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.309 
salt than I would typically use but if
we<00:01:57.429> added<00:01:57.610> some<00:01:58.000> like<00:01:58.360> pepper<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.020> other

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
we added some like pepper and other

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.680 
we added some like pepper and other
seasonings<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.490> think<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.000> actually<00:02:01.119> has<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.479> lot

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
seasonings I think it actually has a lot

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.639 
seasonings I think it actually has a lot
of<00:02:01.720> potential<00:02:03.179> yeah<00:02:04.179> finally<00:02:05.080> something

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
of potential yeah finally something

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.419 
of potential yeah finally something
doesn't<00:02:05.920> suck

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
doesn't suck
