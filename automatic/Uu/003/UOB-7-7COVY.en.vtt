00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the bus of the transport cooperative 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.690
 southeast started from zumba at 13 o'clock 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.690
 30 hours at approximately 6:00 p.m. 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.580
 the emergency call is recorded at 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.240
 911 who reported the event the unit 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 number 12 with 878 steel plates in the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.670
 sector of cachaco via yangana valladolid 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.500
 lost track falling into an abyss of 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.300
 Approximately 200 meters 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.240
 Exactly what it would cause in the incident 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.800
 they are being investigated by 7 but 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 the heavy rain and the dense fog 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.020
 were determining factors was in a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.540
 heals a fairly closed curve that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.440
 caused the bus to go to the abyss and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 really that the weather prevents us from 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 act more quickly and access 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.579
 in situations of rain it is quite 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.129
 complicated to know the seriousness of the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.140
 accident the echo 911 running the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.090
 transfer of 11 ambulances of forces 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.860
 armed and ministries of health and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.600
 personal rescue groups 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.930
 special operations of the police and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.059
 fire brigade we coordinate that it 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.840
 move towers so there is light 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.030
 of light that can focus us where 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.159
 there is the accident so they can 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.530
 better perform the work of 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.539
 rescue despite the hard work of rescue 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.340
 of the equipment the balance was inevitable 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.140
 since eight people died at 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.670
 moment of impact and 17 were left 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.229
 wounded of which two were 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.869

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.520

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.229
 ten lightly wounded remained in the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.450
 vilcabamba hospital ceded 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.020
 they really have a condition 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.649
 example we have 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.609
 two people who are with 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.829

 thoracoabdominal trauma that are in 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.869
 serious situation there the rest is in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 a moderate condition we have around 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.000
