00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.050

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.810

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.650
 on the right guitar from the guitar 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.630
 because they are first drawn and then 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.030
 spread out on a 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.770

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 weight reduction you have done with 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.500
