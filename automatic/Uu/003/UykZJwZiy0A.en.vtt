00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
can make a helicopter from this from

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.900 
can make a helicopter from this from
five<00:01:00.420> pieces<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.840> wood<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.730> yeah<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
five pieces of wood but yeah it's a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
five pieces of wood but yeah it's a
really<00:01:03.090> cool<00:01:03.329> mod<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> texture<00:01:04.170> looks<00:01:04.350> really

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
really cool mod the texture looks really

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.670 
really cool mod the texture looks really
nice<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.510> into<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.560> we

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
nice and if when we go into here when we

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640 
nice and if when we go into here when we
start<00:01:07.920> flying<00:01:08.130> about<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.810> Spears<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.439> on

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
start flying about at Spears to go up on

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.250 
start flying about at Spears to go up on
shift<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.140> use

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
shift to go down and then you just use

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.480 
shift to go down and then you just use
the<00:01:13.380> w/e<00:01:13.770> s<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.689> D<00:01:16.049> key<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.619> move<00:01:16.979> about<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the w/e s a and D key to move about and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
the w/e s a and D key to move about and
as<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.110> very<00:01:19.439> realistic

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
as you can see here it's very realistic

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.429 
as you can see here it's very realistic
you<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.430> damaged<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.060> well<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.450> ya<00:01:21.810> when

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you have damaged as well when ya when

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.490 
you have damaged as well when ya when
the<00:01:22.560> rotors<00:01:22.890> hit<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> trees<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.750> get<00:01:24.960> loads

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the rotors hit the trees you get loads

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
the rotors hit the trees you get loads
of<00:01:25.590> damage<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> show<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.240> what

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
of damage and just to show you what

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.109 
of damage and just to show you what
happens<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.530> there's<00:01:29.430> damage<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.909> just

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
happens when there's damage it just

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.300 
happens when there's damage it just
blows<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.530> creates<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> lot<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.070> fire

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
blows up and it creates a lot of fire

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.810 
blows up and it creates a lot of fire
basically<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.810> does<00:01:33.960> cool<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> we're<00:01:35.729> going

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
basically what does cool so we're going

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.080 
basically what does cool so we're going
to<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:35.939> ahead<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.479> try<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.759> I'm

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to go ahead and try out it go in and I'm

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
to go ahead and try out it go in and I'm
not<00:01:39.119> sure<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.509> about<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.170> why<00:01:40.950> there<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
not sure actually about the why there is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.740 
not sure actually about the why there is
the<00:01:42.680> shadow<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.570> put

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the shadow but it but we will go and put

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.350 
the shadow but it but we will go and put
this<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> normal<00:01:46.710> okay<00:01:47.640> otherwise<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.270> doesn't

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
this to normal okay otherwise it doesn't

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.859 
this to normal okay otherwise it doesn't
look<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.689> nice<00:01:49.020> does<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.119> but<00:01:51.119> oh<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.810> we

go we've got the thing back in Oh got it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.889 
go we've got the thing back in Oh got it
lost<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> as<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.420> I'm<00:01:57.420> kind

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
lost it as you can see here I'm kind

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.420 
lost it as you can see here I'm kind
kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.439> losing<00:01:58.619> her<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.159> reason

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
kind of like losing her for some reason

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340 
kind of like losing her for some reason
but<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.509> think<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
but I think it's just because of the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.959 
but I think it's just because of the
trees<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.369> her<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
trees but as you can see her it's got a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.190 
trees but as you can see her it's got a
really<00:02:03.270> nice<00:02:03.479> huh<00:02:03.780> displayed<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:06.200> but

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
really nice huh displayed to it and but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
really nice huh displayed to it and but
it's<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:07.560> complicated<00:02:07.950> well<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.580> very

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it's very complicated well it's not very

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.750 
it's very complicated well it's not very
complicated<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.420> fly<00:02:09.599> actually<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.280> wsad<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
complicated to fly actually a wsad a to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
complicated to fly actually a wsad a to
go<00:02:12.390> left<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
go left the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.710 
go left the
to<00:02:13.590> go<00:02:13.710> right<00:02:14.010> s<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.580> go<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.480> can't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
to go right s to go well you can't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.180 
to go right s to go well you can't
really<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:16.020> well<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.380> can't<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:16.830> backwards

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
really go well you can't go backwards

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.370 
really go well you can't go backwards
actually<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.570> can't<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.020> where

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
actually but you can't really see where

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.330 
actually but you can't really see where
you're<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.830> you're<00:02:19.980> going<00:02:20.130> backwards

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you're going if you're going backwards

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.380 
you're going if you're going backwards
and<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:21.170> W<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.200> go<00:02:22.440> forward<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.010> space<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.240> go

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and then W to go forward a space to go

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.020 
and then W to go forward a space to go
up<00:02:24.600> or<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.350> speed<00:02:25.770> up<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.220> rotor<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
up or to like speed up this rotor and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.290 
up or to like speed up this rotor and
shift<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:28.200> go<00:02:28.380> down<00:02:28.620> again<00:02:29.310> what<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> felt

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
