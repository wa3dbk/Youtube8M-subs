00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.140 
on people so if you're playing the Star

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.400 
on people so if you're playing the Star
Wars<00:00:03.170> or<00:00:03.800> the<00:00:04.549> public<00:00:04.970> then<00:00:05.660> you<00:00:05.959> might<00:00:06.290> be

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
Wars or the public then you might be

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.049 
Wars or the public then you might be
encountering<00:00:06.680> some<00:00:07.100> matters<00:00:07.370> one<00:00:07.850> of<00:00:07.970> the

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
encountering some matters one of the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.890 
encountering some matters one of the
common<00:00:08.450> errors<00:00:08.720> is<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.200> record<00:00:09.770> c7<00:00:10.280> so<00:00:10.900> we

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
common errors is the record c7 so we

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.500 
common errors is the record c7 so we
have<00:00:12.020> actually<00:00:12.200> figured<00:00:12.860> out<00:00:12.950> how<00:00:13.340> to<00:00:13.400> fix<00:00:14.210> it

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
have actually figured out how to fix it

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.509 
have actually figured out how to fix it
and<00:00:14.720> but<00:00:15.230> before<00:00:15.350> that<00:00:15.740> let<00:00:15.980> me<00:00:16.010> just<00:00:16.309> tell<00:00:16.490> you

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
and but before that let me just tell you

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.700 
and but before that let me just tell you
why<00:00:16.820> are<00:00:17.330> you<00:00:17.449> getting<00:00:17.779> this<00:00:17.900> error<00:00:18.109> this

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
why are you getting this error this

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.259 
why are you getting this error this
error<00:00:18.890> may<00:00:19.249> be<00:00:19.279> because<00:00:19.820> of<00:00:21.189> the<00:00:22.269> under

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
error may be because of the under

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.200 
error may be because of the under
specification<00:00:23.839> that<00:00:24.109> you<00:00:24.259> are<00:00:24.349> not<00:00:24.499> able<00:00:24.740> to

specification that you are not able to

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.609 
specification that you are not able to
your<00:00:26.210> computer<00:00:26.630> is<00:00:26.839> not<00:00:27.079> able<00:00:27.289> to<00:00:27.439> be

your computer is not able to be
compatible<00:00:28.220> for<00:00:28.730> playing<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.119> game<00:00:29.150> then<00:00:29.989> you

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
compatible for playing the game then you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.269 
compatible for playing the game then you
need<00:00:30.289> to<00:00:30.380> check<00:00:30.589> the<00:00:30.769> system<00:00:31.069> requirements

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
need to check the system requirements

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.810 
need to check the system requirements
other<00:00:31.970> than<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.859> maybe<00:00:33.859> because<00:00:34.399> your

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
other than that maybe because your

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.529 
other than that maybe because your
graphics<00:00:35.480> are<00:00:35.750> not<00:00:35.960> available<00:00:36.320> for<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.829> game

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
graphics are not available for the game

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.779 
graphics are not available for the game
or<00:00:38.539> your<00:00:39.379> game<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:39.800> not<00:00:39.949> able<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.280> use<00:00:40.399> your

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
or your game is not able to use your

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.910 
or your game is not able to use your
graphics<00:00:41.480> that<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:41.870> present<00:00:42.320> at<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.469> computer

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
graphics that is present at a computer

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.900 
graphics that is present at a computer
so<00:00:43.160> you<00:00:43.190> need<00:00:43.460> to<00:00:43.699> fix<00:00:44.690> those<00:00:44.960> stuff<00:00:45.320> using<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
so you need to fix those stuff using the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.419 
so you need to fix those stuff using the
solution<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.539> I'm<00:00:47.629> going<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:47.870> provide<00:00:48.079> you

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
solution that I'm going to provide you

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.790 
solution that I'm going to provide you
so<00:00:49.719> the<00:00:50.719> first<00:00:50.989> thing<00:00:51.199> is<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.469> minimum

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
so the first thing is the minimum

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.529 
so the first thing is the minimum
requirements<00:00:52.370> that<00:00:52.429> you<00:00:52.550> need<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.879> actually

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
requirements that you need to actually

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.529 
requirements that you need to actually
check<00:00:53.809> on<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.289> you<00:00:55.010> do<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:55.519> know<00:00:55.670> carefully

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
check on and you do you know carefully

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.319 
check on and you do you know carefully
understand<00:00:57.079> what<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:58.339> system<00:00:58.760> requirements

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
understand what the system requirements

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.290 
understand what the system requirements
are<00:00:59.710> so<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:00.949> can<00:01:01.100> easily<00:01:01.219> examine<00:01:02.030> the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
are so that you can easily examine the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.249 
are so that you can easily examine the
solutions<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.980> first<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:05.689> processor

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
solutions so the first is the processor

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.679 
solutions so the first is the processor
it<00:01:06.950> will<00:01:06.979> go<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.549> processor<00:01:08.000> 2.0

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
it will go to to a processor 2.0

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:09.850 
it will go to to a processor 2.0

you need to use ok so a DVD ROM 8x or
better<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:38.030> basely<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.500> these<00:01:39.860> are<00:01:40.070> the

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
better of basely so these are the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.709 
better of basely so these are the
various<00:01:41.079> important<00:01:43.450> configurations<00:01:44.450> are

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
various important configurations are

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.779

important<00:01:45.469> system<00:01:45.950> requirements<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:46.670> you

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
important system requirements that you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.160 
important system requirements that you
will<00:01:46.939> need<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.479> check<00:01:47.780> on<00:01:47.960> ok

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
will need to check on ok

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.289 
will need to check on ok
so<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.530> first<00:01:50.829> solution<00:01:51.009> that<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.820> mostly

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
framework and other sequence features

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.170 
framework and other sequence features
that's<00:02:40.450> what<00:02:40.980> mostly<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.579> used<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.030> other

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
that's what mostly is used in other

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.819 
that's what mostly is used in other
games<00:02:43.450> also<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.690> basic<00:02:47.140> issue<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.799> that

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
games also so the basic issue is that

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.000 
games also so the basic issue is that
your<00:02:48.579> graphics<00:02:49.269> your<00:02:49.870> game<00:02:50.140> isn't<00:02:50.380> detecting

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
your graphics your game isn't detecting

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
your graphics your game isn't detecting
your<00:02:51.160> graphics<00:02:51.549> card<00:02:51.819> properly<00:02:52.480> okay<00:02:53.290> so

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
your graphics card properly okay so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.809 
your graphics card properly okay so
maybe<00:02:55.030> because<00:02:55.480> you're<00:02:56.049> not<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.859> admin

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
maybe because you're not in the admin

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.870 
maybe because you're not in the admin
mode<00:02:58.060> which<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.870> switched<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.350> just<00:02:59.620> like

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
mode which is switched you just like

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.030 
mode which is switched you just like
silly<00:03:00.880> as<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> reason<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:01.870> maybe<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.980> might

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
silly as a reason but maybe you might

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.039 
silly as a reason but maybe you might
try<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:04.359> it<00:03:04.450> works<00:03:04.690> for<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.019> then

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
try it and if it works for you then

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.860 
try it and if it works for you then
pretty<00:03:05.560> much<00:03:05.739> fine<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.370> by<00:03:06.940> playing<00:03:07.420> your<00:03:07.660> game

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
pretty much fine so by playing your game

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.220 
pretty much fine so by playing your game
with<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.319> admin<00:03:09.220> mode<00:03:09.459> okay<00:03:10.060> playing<00:03:11.019> in<00:03:11.139> the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
with the admin mode okay playing in the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.580 
with the admin mode okay playing in the
admin<00:03:11.500> board<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:11.980> not<00:03:12.280> difficult<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:13.060> need<00:03:13.239> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
admin board is not difficult you need to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.289 
admin board is not difficult you need to
just<00:03:14.590> log<00:03:14.859> in<00:03:15.069> with<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.310> user<00:03:15.489> account<00:03:15.850> but

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
just log in with the user account but

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.080 
just log in with the user account but
understand<00:03:17.049> that

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
understand that

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.949 
understand that
then<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.910> other<00:03:21.090> thing<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.420> I'm<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
then the other thing that I'm going to

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.360 
then the other thing that I'm going to
suggest<00:03:22.379> is<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.340> should<00:03:23.580> try<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.390> play

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
suggest is that you should try to play

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.640 
suggest is that you should try to play
in<00:03:26.370> different<00:03:26.989> compatibility<00:03:27.989> mode<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.379> it<00:03:28.530> is

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
in different compatibility mode if it is

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.860 
in different compatibility mode if it is
available<00:03:28.879> so<00:03:29.879> try<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.209> play<00:03:30.629> in<00:03:30.690> different

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
available so try to play in different

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.589 
available so try to play in different
compatibility<00:03:31.739> mode<00:03:31.950> okay<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:33.030> especially

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
compatibility mode okay it's especially

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.039 
compatibility mode okay it's especially
for<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.019> on<00:03:34.530> windows<00:03:35.340> then<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.940> use<00:03:36.150> XP

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
for you on windows then you can use XP
