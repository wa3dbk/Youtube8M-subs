00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.530 

many<00:00:02.770> times<00:00:03.130> you'll<00:00:03.400> need<00:00:03.639> to<00:00:03.790> use<00:00:03.820> your<00:00:04.029> own

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:04.540 
many times you'll need to use your own

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.070 
many times you'll need to use your own
images<00:00:04.569> in<00:00:05.350> Maya<00:00:05.740> and<00:00:06.100> that<00:00:06.670> involves<00:00:07.420> loading

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
images in Maya and that involves loading

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.009 
images in Maya and that involves loading
a<00:00:08.230> bitmap<00:00:08.650> image<00:00:09.550> so<00:00:10.179> we<00:00:10.389> can<00:00:10.540> do<00:00:10.629> that<00:00:10.780> very

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019 
a bitmap image so we can do that very

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.020 
a bitmap image so we can do that very
easily<00:00:11.110> let's<00:00:12.099> just<00:00:12.280> go<00:00:12.400> ahead<00:00:12.490> and<00:00:12.639> create<00:00:12.879> a

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
easily let's just go ahead and create a

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.080 
easily let's just go ahead and create a
simple<00:00:13.570> plain<00:00:13.929> shade<00:00:14.709> it<00:00:14.919> and<00:00:15.160> I'm<00:00:15.820> gonna<00:00:15.940> go

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
simple plain shade it and I'm gonna go

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.000 
simple plain shade it and I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.270> turn<00:00:16.510> off<00:00:16.539> the<00:00:16.840> grid<00:00:17.050> here<00:00:17.350> so

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
ahead and turn off the grid here so

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.290 
ahead and turn off the grid here so
first<00:00:18.310> thing<00:00:18.400> we<00:00:18.490> have<00:00:18.580> to<00:00:18.640> do<00:00:18.760> is<00:00:18.880> to<00:00:18.970> sign<00:00:19.150> the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
first thing we have to do is to sign the

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.640 
first thing we have to do is to sign the
material<00:00:19.750> I'm<00:00:19.900> gonna<00:00:20.050> show<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:20.289> that<00:00:20.500> trick

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
material I'm gonna show you that trick

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.950 
material I'm gonna show you that trick

up our marking menu if you go down to
the<00:00:24.550> bottom<00:00:24.730> here<00:00:25.210> we<00:00:25.420> can<00:00:25.570> actually<00:00:25.689> assign<00:00:26.170> a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
the bottom here we can actually assign a

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.679 
the bottom here we can actually assign a
new<00:00:26.650> material<00:00:27.009> or<00:00:27.400> assign<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.029> favorite

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
material so let's go ahead and assign a

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.450 
material so let's go ahead and assign a
Lambert<00:00:31.269> to<00:00:31.660> this<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.259> that<00:00:32.590> brings<00:00:32.830> up<00:00:33.070> my

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
Lambert to this and that brings up my

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.300 
Lambert to this and that brings up my
attribute<00:00:34.420> editor<00:00:34.630> now<00:00:35.260> for<00:00:35.710> this<00:00:35.920> let's<00:00:36.250> just

attribute editor now for this let's just

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.330 
attribute editor now for this let's just
go<00:00:36.550> ahead<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.850> put<00:00:37.480> a<00:00:37.720> bitmap<00:00:38.020> into<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.980> color

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
go ahead and put a bitmap into the color

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.980 
go ahead and put a bitmap into the color
channel<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:39.940> I'm<00:00:40.000> gonna<00:00:40.090> go<00:00:40.300> ahead<00:00:40.420> and<00:00:40.690> click

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
on this little texture icon here and

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.140 
on this little texture icon here and
it's<00:00:43.840> going<00:00:44.080> to<00:00:44.260> bring<00:00:44.470> up<00:00:44.740> my<00:00:44.770> create<00:00:45.580> render

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
it's going to bring up my create render

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's going to bring up my create render
node<00:00:46.360> now<00:00:46.900> I<00:00:46.930> just<00:00:46.960> want<00:00:47.260> to<00:00:47.290> scroll<00:00:47.650> down<00:00:47.680> make

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
node now I just want to scroll down make

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.850 
node now I just want to scroll down make
sure<00:00:48.130> 2d<00:00:48.730> textures<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.570> highlighted<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.410> just

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
sure 2d textures is highlighted and just

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.700 
sure 2d textures is highlighted and just
select<00:00:51.040> file<00:00:51.490> now<00:00:52.000> nothing<00:00:52.870> comes<00:00:53.080> up<00:00:53.320> well

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
select file now nothing comes up well

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.710 
select file now nothing comes up well
that's<00:00:53.890> because<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.160> need<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.820> do<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.030> second

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
step here and that's load the image so I

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.030 
step here and that's load the image so I
just<00:00:58.120> hit<00:00:58.300> my<00:00:58.390> little<00:00:58.660> folder<00:00:59.140> option<00:00:59.650> here

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
just hit my little folder option here

and I have a very nice picture of a
donut<00:01:02.080> here<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.620> we<00:01:02.800> can<00:01:02.950> just<00:01:02.980> go<00:01:03.250> ahead<00:01:03.280> and

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
donut here and we can just go ahead and

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.510 
donut here and we can just go ahead and
open<00:01:03.580> that<00:01:03.790> up<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.330> if<00:01:05.199> I<00:01:05.530> hit<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.979> number-6

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
open that up and if I hit the number-6

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.389 
open that up and if I hit the number-6
to<00:01:07.090> do<00:01:07.539> Hardware<00:01:07.929> texturing<00:01:08.229> it<00:01:08.649> should<00:01:09.130> show

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
to do Hardware texturing it should show

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.370 
to do Hardware texturing it should show
up<00:01:09.579> go<00:01:10.270> ahead<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.509> scale<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.929> what's<00:01:11.229> the

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
up go ahead and scale this what's the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.080 
up go ahead and scale this what's the
right<00:01:11.530> length<00:01:11.799> and<00:01:12.070> there<00:01:12.549> we<00:01:12.670> go

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
right length and there we go

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.870 
right length and there we go
now<00:01:13.420> if<00:01:13.840> I<00:01:14.079> want<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.590> can<00:01:14.799> go<00:01:14.950> ahead<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.399> adjust

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
now if I want I can go ahead and adjust

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.569 
now if I want I can go ahead and adjust
the<00:01:16.719> bitmap<00:01:17.109> itself<00:01:17.619> so<00:01:17.799> if<00:01:17.890> I<00:01:17.979> select<00:01:18.429> my

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
the bitmap itself so if I select my

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.730 
the bitmap itself so if I select my
Lambert<00:01:19.240> go<00:01:19.780> into<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:19.990> color<00:01:20.170> Channel<00:01:20.590> and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
Lambert go into the color Channel and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.440 
Lambert go into the color Channel and
then<00:01:21.070> just<00:01:21.340> go<00:01:21.460> ahead<00:01:21.579> and<00:01:21.789> hit<00:01:21.880> my<00:01:21.969> connection

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
then just go ahead and hit my connection

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.020 
then just go ahead and hit my connection
here<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:23.020> can<00:01:23.530> scroll<00:01:23.920> down<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.549> you'll<00:01:24.850> see

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
here I can scroll down and you'll see

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.730 
here I can scroll down and you'll see
that<00:01:25.179> actually<00:01:25.509> have<00:01:25.749> some<00:01:26.140> additional

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
that actually have some additional

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.649 
that actually have some additional
options<00:01:26.979> if<00:01:27.579> you're<00:01:27.939> using<00:01:28.179> high<00:01:28.600> dynamic

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
options if you're using high dynamic

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.830 
options if you're using high dynamic
range<00:01:29.409> images<00:01:30.189> you<00:01:30.549> can<00:01:30.789> change<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.569> float

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
range images you can change the float

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.959 
range images you can change the float
value<00:01:32.079> here<00:01:32.649> but<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.159> one<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.310> actually<00:01:33.579> like

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
value here but the one I actually like

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.580 
value here but the one I actually like
is<00:01:34.179> color<00:01:34.509> balance<00:01:34.899> so<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:35.259> can<00:01:35.439> actually

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
is color balance so you can actually

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.249 
is color balance so you can actually
change<00:01:36.130> your<00:01:36.579> default<00:01:36.999> color<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:37.899> if<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.079> want

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
change your default color so if you want

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.130 
change your default color so if you want
you<00:01:38.380> can<00:01:38.469> tint<00:01:38.799> this<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.299> know<00:01:40.420> any<00:01:40.719> sort<00:01:41.079> of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
you can tint this you know any sort of

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.260 
you can tint this you know any sort of
color<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.590> want<00:01:41.859> I'm<00:01:42.310> not<00:01:42.460> gonna<00:01:42.579> do<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:42.789> so

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
color you want I'm not gonna do that so

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.120 
color you want I'm not gonna do that so
let's<00:01:43.509> just<00:01:43.689> go<00:01:43.840> ahead<00:01:43.869> there<00:01:44.200> or<00:01:44.619> we<00:01:44.979> can

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
let's just go ahead there or we can

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.649 
let's just go ahead there or we can
change<00:01:45.310> what's<00:01:45.490> called<00:01:45.700> color<00:01:45.939> gain<00:01:46.179> which<00:01:46.509> is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
change what's called color gain which is

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.139 
change what's called color gain which is
basically<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.710> top<00:01:47.979> end<00:01:48.249> of<00:01:48.520> your<00:01:48.700> color<00:01:48.939> so

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
basically the top end of your color so

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.639 
basically the top end of your color so
you<00:01:49.240> can<00:01:49.270> actually<00:01:49.600> change<00:01:49.899> how<00:01:50.139> bright<00:01:50.439> this

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
you can actually change how bright this

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.249 
you can actually change how bright this
is<00:01:50.920> we<00:01:51.340> can<00:01:51.460> also<00:01:51.609> change<00:01:51.939> color<00:01:52.329> offset<00:01:52.990> which

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
is we can also change color offset which

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.109 
is we can also change color offset which
is<00:01:53.439> kind<00:01:53.679> of<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.859> lower<00:01:54.100> values<00:01:54.579> so<00:01:54.759> that<00:01:54.939> kind

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
is kind of the lower values so that kind

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.419 
is kind of the lower values so that kind
of<00:01:55.179> brings<00:01:55.359> the<00:01:55.539> black<00:01:55.990> levels<00:01:56.469> up<00:01:56.649> it<00:01:57.189> kind<00:01:57.399> of

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
of brings the black levels up it kind of

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:58.919 
of brings the black levels up it kind of
makes<00:01:57.579> a<00:01:57.670> little<00:01:57.819> bit<00:01:58.030> brighter<00:01:58.240> or<00:01:58.659> maybe<00:01:58.840> a

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
makes a little bit brighter or maybe a

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.270 
makes a little bit brighter or maybe a
little<00:01:59.079> too<00:01:59.259> bright<00:01:59.499> in<00:01:59.649> this<00:01:59.770> particular

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
little too bright in this particular

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.580 
little too bright in this particular
case<00:02:00.459> and<00:02:00.759> then<00:02:01.090> we<00:02:01.179> can<00:02:01.299> also<00:02:01.450> do<00:02:01.749> alpha<00:02:02.229> gain

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
case and then we can also do alpha gain

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.349 
case and then we can also do alpha gain
alpha<00:02:02.889> offset<00:02:03.459> we<00:02:03.700> also<00:02:03.819> have<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.060> number<00:02:04.240> of

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
alpha offset we also have a number of

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.539 
alpha offset we also have a number of
different<00:02:04.810> effects<00:02:05.259> one<00:02:05.829> of<00:02:05.979> them<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.310> called

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
different effects one of them is called

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.760 
different effects one of them is called
filter<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.389> this<00:02:07.509> actually<00:02:07.869> determines<00:02:08.410> how

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
filter and this actually determines how

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.610 
filter and this actually determines how
Maya<00:02:09.280> filters<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.420> bitmap<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.260> doesn't

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
Maya filters the bitmap so it doesn't

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.530 
Maya filters the bitmap so it doesn't
get<00:02:11.920> jaggies<00:02:12.460> that<00:02:12.730> sort<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.060> thing<00:02:13.300> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
get jaggies that sort of thing and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.630 
get jaggies that sort of thing and
here's<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.260> place<00:02:14.500> where<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.830> can<00:02:15.010> actually<00:02:15.190> in

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
here's a place where you can actually in

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.370 
here's a place where you can actually in
BIRT<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:16.030> bitmap<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.600> if<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.780> right-click<00:02:16.990> over

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
BIRT a bitmap so if you right-click over

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.350 
BIRT a bitmap so if you right-click over
that<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.160> do<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.819> then<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.210> also

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
that you can do that and then we also

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.720 
that you can do that and then we also
have<00:02:19.630> UV<00:02:20.170> coordinates<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.890> that's<00:02:21.310> really

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
have UV coordinates and that's really

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.559 
have UV coordinates and that's really
how<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.270> image<00:02:22.780> maps<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:25.060> object<00:02:25.450> that

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
how this image maps to the object that

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.540 
how this image maps to the object that
it's<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.990> when<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.920> work<00:02:27.130> with<00:02:27.160> bitmaps

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
it's on when you work with bitmaps

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's on when you work with bitmaps
you're<00:02:27.940> actually<00:02:28.270> working<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.690> files

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
you're actually working with files

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.340 
you're actually working with files
outside<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:30.400> your<00:02:30.850> actual<00:02:31.180> Maya<00:02:31.540> file<00:02:31.900> for

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
outside of your actual Maya file for

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.170 
outside of your actual Maya file for
example<00:02:32.680> if<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.890> were<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.160> save<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
example if I were to save this the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.449 
example if I were to save this the
actual<00:02:34.630> image<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.380> donut<00:02:35.680> would<00:02:36.130> still

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
actual image of that donut would still

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.240 
actual image of that donut would still
be<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:36.970> JPEG<00:02:37.660> file<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.260> loaded<00:02:38.650> so

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
be in that JPEG file that I loaded so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.280 
be in that JPEG file that I loaded so
this<00:02:39.520> can<00:02:39.910> make<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.390> hard<00:02:40.510> sometimes<00:02:40.990> to

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
this can make it hard sometimes to

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.900 
this can make it hard sometimes to
manage<00:02:41.650> project<00:02:42.070> because<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.489> may<00:02:42.640> bring

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
manage project because you may bring

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.180 
manage project because you may bring
them<00:02:43.090> by<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> binary<00:02:43.540> over<00:02:44.140> but<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.800> bitmaps

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
them by a binary over but the bitmaps

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.520 
them by a binary over but the bitmaps
may<00:02:45.459> not<00:02:45.790> come<00:02:46.060> along<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.050> really

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
may not come along so this is a really

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.580 
may not come along so this is a really
good<00:02:47.800> time<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.520> use<00:02:48.760> projects<00:02:49.570> because<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.110> you

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
good time to use projects because if you

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.190 
good time to use projects because if you
store<00:02:51.040> your<00:02:51.640> images<00:02:51.820> in<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.480> source<00:02:52.780> images

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
store your images in the source images

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.650 
store your images in the source images
directory<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.920> project<00:02:54.610> then<00:02:55.180> all<00:02:55.480> you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
directory of the project then all you

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.270 
directory of the project then all you
have<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.080> move<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.410> entire<00:02:56.709> project

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
have to do is move the entire project

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.940 
have to do is move the entire project
and<00:02:57.459> everything<00:02:57.790> will<00:02:58.330> link<00:02:58.870> up<00:02:59.140> when<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.769> get

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and everything will link up when you get

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.060 
and everything will link up when you get
it<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.070> your<00:03:00.370> new<00:03:00.550> computer
