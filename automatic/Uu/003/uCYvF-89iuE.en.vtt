not sure but gold bumblebee is on the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
not sure but gold bumblebee is on the
package<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.519> rub<00:00:26.849> side<00:00:29.390> there

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
package it's got a little rub side there

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.520 
package it's got a little rub side there
on<00:00:30.779> his<00:00:32.719> back<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> usually<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> don't

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
on his back and usually if you don't

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.720 
on his back and usually if you don't
play<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> while<00:00:35.160> they<00:00:35.340> usually<00:00:35.610> take

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
play them for a while they usually take

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.139 
play them for a while they usually take
a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:35.910> while<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> warm<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:38.000> works<00:00:39.000> just

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
a little while to warm up but works just

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
a little while to warm up but works just
fine<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:40.800> transform<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
fine and then transform it and it's the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
fine and then transform it and it's the
same<00:00:42.090> mold<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.899> legends<00:00:43.649> bum<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:43.950> be

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
same mold as the legends bum will be

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
same mold as the legends bum will be
that<00:00:44.190> already<00:00:44.460> came<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.840> part<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that already came out as part of the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.389 
that already came out as part of the
universe<00:00:46.530> line<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:48.680> it's<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.800> colored

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
universe line I think it's just colored

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
universe line I think it's just colored
differently<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> doesn't<00:00:52.770> look<00:00:52.860> quite

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
differently so so it doesn't look quite

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.299 
differently so so it doesn't look quite
as<00:00:53.149> advanced<00:00:54.530> say<00:00:55.530> advanced<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.129> they're

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
as advanced say advanced because they're

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.099 
as advanced say advanced because they're
legends<00:00:56.610> figures<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.180> uh<00:00:57.239> doesn't<00:00:58.020> look

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
legends figures but uh doesn't look

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.900 
legends figures but uh doesn't look
quite<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.829> date<00:00:58.980> as<00:00:59.160> some<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> other

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.189 
quite as up to date as some of the other
ones<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> looks<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.660> looks<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.050> little

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
