xbox 360 version and i feel like that's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
xbox 360 version and i feel like that's
probably<00:00:37.590> how<00:00:37.950> most<00:00:38.219> people<00:00:38.340> were<00:00:38.910> introduced

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
probably how most people were introduced

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.630 
probably how most people were introduced
to<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.690> game<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:42.149> central<00:00:43.040> conceit<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to this game so the central conceit or I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
to this game so the central conceit or I
hesitate<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.360> say<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> central

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
hesitate to say this for the central

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.580 
hesitate to say this for the central
gimmick<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.950> braid<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.329> idea<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
gimmick of braid is this idea that you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.400 
gimmick of braid is this idea that you
can<00:00:49.890> manipulate<00:00:50.340> time<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.320> was

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
can manipulate time and I think it was

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.139 
can manipulate time and I think it was
kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> oversimplified<00:00:53.579> by<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:54.030> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
kind of oversimplified by a lot of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.279 
kind of oversimplified by a lot of
people<00:00:54.390> thinking<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.930> could<00:00:55.110> just

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
people thinking that you could just

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
people thinking that you could just
rewind<00:00:55.949> time<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> case<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
rewind time this is not the case for the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.670 
rewind time this is not the case for the
majority<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> game<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:01:00.359> of

create<00:01:45.960> these<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.380> shouldn't<00:01:47.009> say<00:01:47.100> 200,000<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
create these I shouldn't say 200,000 to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
create these I shouldn't say 200,000 to
him<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.329> much<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.380> $200,000<00:01:50.100> budget

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
him but much of that $200,000 budget

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
him but much of that $200,000 budget
went<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> him<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.240> create<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.689> sanaya<00:01:52.049> got

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
went to him to create these sanaya got

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.690 
went to him to create these sanaya got
to<00:01:52.860> say<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> think<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.280> money<00:01:53.520> well<00:01:53.759> spent

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
to say I think it's money well spent

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300 
to say I think it's money well spent
so<00:01:55.479> one<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.750> our<00:01:55.930> objectives<00:01:56.080> in<00:01:56.650> braids<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.130> to

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
so one of our objectives in braids is to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.770 
so one of our objectives in braids is to
pick<00:01:57.460> out<00:01:57.549> those<00:01:57.790> puzzle<00:01:58.210> pieces<00:01:58.240> like<00:01:58.659> the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
pick out those puzzle pieces like the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.660 
pick out those puzzle pieces like the
first<00:01:58.990> one<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.320> just<00:01:59.439> saw<00:01:59.680> right<00:01:59.860> there<00:02:00.070> it's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
first one you just saw right there it's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.520 
first one you just saw right there it's
not<00:02:00.790> our<00:02:00.939> only<00:02:01.180> objective<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.080> fact<00:02:02.259> you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
not our only objective and in fact you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.380 
not our only objective and in fact you
could<00:02:02.680> pretty<00:02:03.280> much<00:02:03.369> get<00:02:03.759> through<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.119> entire

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
could pretty much get through the entire

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.789 
could pretty much get through the entire
game<00:02:04.630> without<00:02:04.750> collecting<00:02:05.290> any<00:02:05.409> puzzle

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
game without collecting any puzzle

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.649 
game without collecting any puzzle
pieces<00:02:05.950> if<00:02:06.189> that's<00:02:06.369> what<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.610> wanted<00:02:06.939> but

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
pieces if that's what you wanted but

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.380 
pieces if that's what you wanted but
these<00:02:07.990> are<00:02:08.229> these<00:02:08.950> are<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.250> driving<00:02:09.580> force<00:02:10.090> of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
these are these are the driving force of

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.820 
these are these are the driving force of
the<00:02:10.539> puzzles<00:02:10.899> let's<00:02:11.080> put<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.410> way<00:02:11.470> most

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the puzzles let's put it that way most

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.199 
the puzzles let's put it that way most
of<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.040> puzzles<00:02:12.400> are<00:02:12.489> set<00:02:12.760> up<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.180> way

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
of the puzzles are set up in a way

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.300 
of the puzzles are set up in a way
that's<00:02:13.630> that's<00:02:14.319> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> make<00:02:14.800> these<00:02:14.980> puzzle

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
that's that's going to make these puzzle

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.790 
that's that's going to make these puzzle
pieces<00:02:15.459> difficult<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.120> get<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:17.290> they'll<00:02:17.530> braid

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
pieces difficult to get so they'll braid

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.280 
pieces difficult to get so they'll braid

animals right there but most of braid is
really<00:02:31.269> going<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.480> challenge<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.959> way<00:02:32.110> that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
really going to challenge the way that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.090 
really going to challenge the way that
we<00:02:33.190> typically<00:02:33.790> think<00:02:34.090> about<00:02:34.150> platformers<00:02:35.100> you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
we typically think about platformers you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.789 
we typically think about platformers you
know<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:36.489> contrary<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> lot<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:37.989> puzzlers

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
know it's contrary to a lot of puzzlers

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.150 
know it's contrary to a lot of puzzlers
slash<00:02:39.420> platformer<00:02:40.420> type<00:02:40.600> games<00:02:41.040> there's<00:02:42.040> a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
slash platformer type games there's a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.670 
slash platformer type games there's a
pretty<00:02:42.850> fair<00:02:43.180> mix<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.780> puzzle<00:02:44.230> pieces<00:02:44.260> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
pretty fair mix of puzzle pieces that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.220 
pretty fair mix of puzzle pieces that
require<00:02:45.069> great<00:02:45.819> knowledge<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.450> puzzling<00:02:47.019> and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
require great knowledge of puzzling and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.690 
require great knowledge of puzzling and
those<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.500> require<00:02:47.799> good<00:02:48.069> platforming

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
those that require good platforming

mechanics<00:02:49.290> there<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.319> just<00:02:50.380> demonstrated<00:02:51.220> that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
mechanics there I just demonstrated that

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.940 
mechanics there I just demonstrated that
a<00:02:51.780> rewinding<00:02:52.780> time<00:02:53.019> feature<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.769> do

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
a rewinding time feature that you can do

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.500 
a rewinding time feature that you can do
and<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:54.549> can<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:54.819> there's<00:02:55.000> two<00:02:55.150> puzzle

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
and you can see there's two puzzle

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.580 
and you can see there's two puzzle
pieces<00:02:55.690> here<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.019> are<00:02:56.200> right<00:02:56.470> now

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
pieces here that are right now

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.370 
pieces here that are right now
inaccessible<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.610> us<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.750> doesn't<00:02:59.290> mean

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
inaccessible to us but that doesn't mean

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.410 
inaccessible to us but that doesn't mean
we<00:02:59.500> can't<00:02:59.709> go<00:02:59.859> to<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.070> puzzle<00:03:00.430> mural<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.150> set

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
we can't go to this puzzle mural and set

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420 
we can't go to this puzzle mural and set
up<00:03:01.570> set<00:03:02.170> up<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> pieces<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.859> we<00:03:03.010> have<00:03:03.190> thus

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
up set up the pieces that we have thus

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.240 
up set up the pieces that we have thus
far<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:04.750> I'm<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.989> little<00:03:05.109> bit<00:03:05.260> puzzle<00:03:05.709> retarded

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
far now I'm a little bit puzzle retarded

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.120 
far now I'm a little bit puzzle retarded
I<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:06.519> have<00:03:06.700> yeah<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.410> time<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.650> should<00:03:08.829> have

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
I just have yeah the time I should have

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.620 
I just have yeah the time I should have
spent<00:03:09.370> doing<00:03:09.670> puzzles<00:03:09.880> as<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.209> kid<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.480> spent

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
spent doing puzzles as a kid I spent

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.140 
spent doing puzzles as a kid I spent
playing<00:03:10.989> video<00:03:11.350> games<00:03:11.620> how<00:03:11.890> ironic<00:03:12.549> now<00:03:12.760> that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
playing video games how ironic now that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.380 
playing video games how ironic now that
that<00:03:14.140> has<00:03:14.290> come<00:03:14.470> back<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.739> bite<00:03:14.769> me<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.130> ass

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that has come back to bite me in the ass

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.580 
that has come back to bite me in the ass
it<00:03:16.390> will<00:03:16.510> put<00:03:16.660> those<00:03:16.780> three<00:03:17.079> pieces<00:03:17.290> together

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
it will put those three pieces together

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.750 
it will put those three pieces together
because<00:03:17.920> that'll<00:03:18.100> save<00:03:18.250> us<00:03:18.280> some<00:03:18.519> time<00:03:18.730> a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
because that'll save us some time a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.490 
because that'll save us some time a
little<00:03:18.850> bit<00:03:19.120> later<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.570> we'll<00:03:20.320> uh<00:03:20.350> we'll

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
little bit later and we'll uh we'll

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.620 
little bit later and we'll uh we'll
leave<00:03:21.010> those<00:03:21.280> puzzle<00:03:21.640> pieces<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.030> next<00:03:22.269> time

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
leave those puzzle pieces for next time

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.900 
leave those puzzle pieces for next time
we'll<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.560> those<00:03:23.739> closer<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.609> end<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.850> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
we'll get those closer to the end of the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.270 
we'll get those closer to the end of the
video<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.320> these<00:03:26.470> levels<00:03:26.859> and<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.070> level

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
video so on these levels and this level

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.069 
video so on these levels and this level
appears<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.790> couple<00:03:28.359> of<00:03:28.420> times<00:03:28.630> throughout<00:03:28.930> the

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
appears a couple of times throughout the

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.020 
appears a couple of times throughout the
game<00:03:29.109> this<00:03:29.470> type<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.709> level<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.190> should<00:03:30.400> say<00:03:30.579> all

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
game this type of level I should say all

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.270 
game this type of level I should say all
you<00:03:31.269> have<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.480> do<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.840> kill<00:03:32.260> these<00:03:32.440> enemies<00:03:32.470> and

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
you have to do is kill these enemies and

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.849 
you have to do is kill these enemies and
when<00:03:33.880> they're<00:03:34.060> all<00:03:34.209> killed<00:03:34.540> then<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.930> door<00:03:35.170> to

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
when they're all killed then the door to

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.130 
when they're all killed then the door to
the<00:03:35.980> puzzle<00:03:36.160> piece<00:03:36.370> at<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.549> top<00:03:36.640> unlocks<00:03:37.299> so

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
the puzzle piece at the top unlocks so

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.840 
the puzzle piece at the top unlocks so
it<00:03:38.290> sounds<00:03:38.680> simple<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.100> this<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.519> really<00:03:39.730> our

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
it sounds simple but this is really our

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.410 
it sounds simple but this is really our
first<00:03:39.880> taste<00:03:40.480> in<00:03:40.810> braid<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.530> kind<00:03:41.769> of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
first taste in braid of the kind of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.220 
first taste in braid of the kind of
nonlinear<00:03:43.420> thinking<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.959> we're<00:03:44.049> going<00:03:44.170> to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
nonlinear thinking that we're going to

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.620 
nonlinear thinking that we're going to
have<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.470> do<00:03:44.620> because<00:03:44.799> as<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.250> see<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:46.000> can

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
have to do because as you can see I can

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.420 
have to do because as you can see I can
rewind<00:03:46.930> time<00:03:47.200> as<00:03:47.350> many<00:03:47.530> times<00:03:47.769> as<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.040> want<00:03:48.280> but

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
rewind time as many times as I want but

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.770 
rewind time as many times as I want but
I<00:03:48.489> can<00:03:48.670> never<00:03:48.819> make<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.090> jump<00:03:49.569> as<00:03:49.810> is

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
I can never make that jump as is

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.780 
I can never make that jump as is
it's<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.290> rewinding<00:03:51.770> time<00:03:51.950> back<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.400> before<00:03:52.760> I

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
it's a rewinding time back to before I

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.570 
it's a rewinding time back to before I
made<00:03:53.030> some<00:03:53.390> mistake<00:03:53.840> let's<00:03:54.830> go<00:03:54.920> see<00:03:55.160> if<00:03:55.280> we<00:03:55.340> can

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
made some mistake let's go see if we can

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.430 
made some mistake let's go see if we can
we<00:03:55.820> can<00:03:55.970> rectify<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.480> problem<00:03:56.660> keep<00:03:57.200> in<00:03:57.290> mind

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
we can rectify this problem keep in mind

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.050 
we can rectify this problem keep in mind
this<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:57.770> third<00:03:58.130> level<00:03:58.550> that<00:03:58.700> we've<00:03:58.820> seen

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
this is the third level that we've seen

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.440 
this is the third level that we've seen
so<00:03:59.330> far<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.230> kind<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:01.520> rude

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
so far so this is kind of a rude

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.270 
so far so this is kind of a rude
awakening<00:04:02.600> let's<00:04:03.170> say<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:03.560> is<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.710> harsh

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
awakening let's say this is a harsh

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.270 
awakening let's say this is a harsh
reminder<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:05.450> this<00:04:05.750> game<00:04:05.960> is<00:04:06.170> not<00:04:06.380> really

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
reminder that this game is not really

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.970 
reminder that this game is not really
like<00:04:07.640> other<00:04:07.850> games<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.959> difficulty<00:04:09.560> curve<00:04:09.770> is

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
like other games the difficulty curve is

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.190 
like other games the difficulty curve is
pretty<00:04:10.250> substantial<00:04:10.540> but<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.570> think<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:12.050> kind

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
pretty substantial but I think it kind

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.130 
pretty substantial but I think it kind
of<00:04:12.580> lays<00:04:13.580> any<00:04:13.910> frustration<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.780> might

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
of lays any frustration that you might

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.009 
of lays any frustration that you might
get<00:04:15.320> just<00:04:15.920> cuz<00:04:16.040> though<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.609> whole<00:04:17.019> aesthetic

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
get just cuz though the whole aesthetic

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.449 
get just cuz though the whole aesthetic
of<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.380> game<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.709> so<00:04:18.859> beautiful<00:04:19.310> the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
of the game is so beautiful the

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.310 
of the game is so beautiful the
hand-painted<00:04:19.970> backgrounds<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.750> music<00:04:21.200> is

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
hand-painted backgrounds the music is

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.110 
hand-painted backgrounds the music is
fantastic<00:04:22.390> just<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.690> entire<00:04:24.850> visual<00:04:25.850> and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
fantastic just the entire visual and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.330 
fantastic just the entire visual and
audio<00:04:26.510> design<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.110> this<00:04:27.230> is<00:04:27.470> it's<00:04:27.919> superb

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
audio design of this is it's superb

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.630 
audio design of this is it's superb
actually<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.360> game<00:04:29.770> apparently<00:04:30.770> was<00:04:30.980> mostly

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
actually the game apparently was mostly

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.480 
actually the game apparently was mostly
finished<00:04:31.970> as<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.810> about<00:04:33.080> two<00:04:33.710> years<00:04:34.040> before<00:04:34.280> it

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
finished as of about two years before it

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.440 
finished as of about two years before it
came<00:04:34.580> out<00:04:34.910> but<00:04:35.600> Jonathan<00:04:36.260> Blow<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.650> developer

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
came out but Jonathan Blow the developer

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.340 
came out but Jonathan Blow the developer
should<00:04:38.450> say<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.690> designer<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.230> developer

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
should say the designer and developer

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.130 
should say the designer and developer
but<00:04:39.830> in<00:04:39.919> any<00:04:40.040> case<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.490> actually<00:04:41.390> held<00:04:41.660> back<00:04:41.900> on

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
but in any case I actually held back on

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.540 
but in any case I actually held back on
releasing<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.620> for<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> long<00:04:43.010> time<00:04:43.040> because<00:04:43.430> he

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
releasing it for a long time because he

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.180 
releasing it for a long time because he
wanted<00:04:43.790> to<00:04:43.850> make<00:04:44.000> sure<00:04:44.210> he<00:04:44.390> had<00:04:44.480> this

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
wanted to make sure he had this

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.220 
wanted to make sure he had this
perfectly<00:04:46.190> crafted<00:04:46.510> work<00:04:47.510> of<00:04:47.690> art<00:04:47.870> which<00:04:48.080> is

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
perfectly crafted work of art which is

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.740 
perfectly crafted work of art which is
pretty<00:04:48.440> much<00:04:48.590> I'd<00:04:49.340> say<00:04:49.400> what<00:04:49.730> he<00:04:49.820> got<00:04:49.970> I'm<00:04:50.450> glad

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
pretty much I'd say what he got I'm glad

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.150 
pretty much I'd say what he got I'm glad
you<00:04:50.870> took<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> time<00:04:51.260> obviously<00:04:51.890> I<00:04:51.919> would<00:04:52.070> have

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
you took the time obviously I would have

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.760 
you took the time obviously I would have
liked<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.370> play<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.730> earlier<00:04:53.030> but<00:04:53.330> uh<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:54.650> know

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
liked to play it earlier but uh you know

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.710 
liked to play it earlier but uh you know
I<00:04:54.800> can't<00:04:55.729> argue<00:04:55.850> with<00:04:56.000> this<00:04:56.210> finished<00:04:56.479> product

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
I can't argue with this finished product

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.870 
I can't argue with this finished product
this<00:04:57.050> is<00:04:57.280> potentially<00:04:58.280> one<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.700> best

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
this is potentially one of the best

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.480 
this is potentially one of the best
games<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.240> played<00:04:59.450> in<00:04:59.570> my<00:04:59.660> entire<00:04:59.690> life

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
games I played in my entire life

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.159 
games I played in my entire life
so<00:05:01.490> those<00:05:01.729> puzzle<00:05:02.450> pieces<00:05:02.479> that<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.840> just<00:05:03.020> got

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
so those puzzle pieces that I just got

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.690 
so those puzzle pieces that I just got
usually<00:05:03.440> require<00:05:03.890> a<00:05:03.919> little<00:05:04.460> bit<00:05:04.580> more

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
usually require a little bit more

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.820 
usually require a little bit more
thinking<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.780> can<00:05:05.900> see<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.169> first<00:05:06.440> one<00:05:06.650> was

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
thinking you can see that first one was

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.140
