00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:02.850
 m 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.100
 that's why m 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
 foot it is only more beautiful 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:09.220
 the success we know 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.599
 to remedy the problem a little more known 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.229
 the brand 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.889
 the ceasefire 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.220
 smoke 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 it's a wish 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.740
 weapons while others then follow all the measures 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.550
 Councillor 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.890
 it's great more than a week ago for cause 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.060
 remember that map 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.700
 even 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
 business to follow 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.170
 like at night 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.050
 who judge the crimes 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.770
 the other eight reunion top six also I ran a lot but 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 therefore like every Thursday up to the neck 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 no sense to take part in this regard 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.120
 ap 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.120
 in fact the few retouches by the fact that it is 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.690
 after 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
 earlier m 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 no 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.330
 Why 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.160
 I do not see how you can understand 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.410
 on the other hand aubry is in front of something else 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.850
 to finish us it's a story of selling millions more dead a 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.850
 evolution right now at the cinema 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.640
 yes in a tweet brandon the street pressure 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.710
 among the authors but he quotes the mans things 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.340
 but see if the lawyers 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 less than two hours against him
