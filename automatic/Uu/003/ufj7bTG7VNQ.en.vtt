00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.799
 if you're 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.770
 this is a control recipe I want 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.650
 know how you're doing how you feel 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.900
 results as you see your scar in 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.580
 the forehead his eyelid scarf his 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.030
 preferred that is the most important the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.100
 that crosses and cuts the cheekbone and now what 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.489
 who told me in the neck tell me 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.199
 with many times it gives you better time 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.290
 I feel very happy I think that the 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.629
 change was instantly noticed the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.610
 people who see me on the street said today 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.610
 I thought it would be worse than you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.520
 I was going to harm your nothing and everything but they tell me 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.079
 that sees me this because well what 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.479
 I'm prettier and all those things and we 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.390
 they make me feel good I think the point 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.000
 number one is that my self-esteem has 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 elevated more 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 so that the scars I can already 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.090
 cover them I can make up 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.520
 because the thickness is not noticed anymore 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.100
 nor the loss of tissue that he had 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.660
 I believe that the operation has helped full 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.200
 and with the procedure that we are going to 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.500
 keep doing while I'm going to stay 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.500
 best 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.440
 currently what I do think that seeing 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 the result of the others that is super 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.570
 that well I also want to deal with in the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.450
 neck and also because I feel a little 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.420
 of discomfort and then I want to be 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.460
 well completely and now, yes, nothing 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 no scar that reminds me of that 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:09.240
 good night today we had planned to be 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.300
 I was going to perform 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.670
 the only one with regard to scars 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.990
 by marÃ­a fernanda bars well I do not know 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.100
 news seems that there has been a change 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.500
 that way you always exams the most 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.390
 near possible to do well and we 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.130
 we observed that the hematocrit and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.100
 hemoglobin were very low to their 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.900
 red blood cells are very low and I 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.730
 I have recommended that we are going to analyze if 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.490
 understands for recording reason that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.380
 had maybe some kind of detour and 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.310
 solved to those of a next surgery 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.770
 then in the next surgery in addition to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.150
 correct the subject again the spur I know 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.480
 who still want a smaller than what 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.190
 we can do this because not the wings 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.350
 that are a little bit of fin diet 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.800
 of the nose we only have a little bit a 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.380
 little bit more I think that 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.620
 so you have to take precautions 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.280
 then we will see that it is totally 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.530
 well I think this week good 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.530
 also with regard to the have 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.630
 apart 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.550
 dr to see what possibility there was for 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.310
 power this 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.030
 alleviate your problem and I do 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.030
 a little bit of everything 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.560
 Matt consider the message you would give to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.150
 all those people who have the same 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.890
 similar problem sometimes a doctor but 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.040
 and they have totally lost 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.590
 hopes to a certain extent has a 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.230
 sporty and you do not want to improve your 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.750
 image there is solution for all then 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.659
 I think I did have a scar and 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.970
 sorribas and then see me now super 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.220
 that recovered has helped me to have 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.859
 much more faith than I have before 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.060
 put with the help of a good surgeon 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.470
 this doctor who has helped me a lot and I 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.299
 I think that the people who have this 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.790
 problem because these photos are not 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.340
 sent I believe they do not lose faith 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.690
 because all is not lost and it always goes 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.229
 to have procedures and new 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.959
 technologies to be able to evade 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.269
 problem that had or disappear 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.419
 scars completely then I think 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.850
 that they should only have faith in God and 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.349
 find a very good surgeon like me 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.110
 I did it, it was Dr. Luis Perez 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.000
 to help you overcome those 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.490
 problems that you have had and for the cash 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.410
 I was marked full of satisfaction 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.650
 see that your patrices were very many 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.570
 right now a happy person 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.590
 we must admit that he has been able to leave 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.020
 go ahead in this process besides seeing you 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.840
 better our image overcome the problem 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.020
 not relate your scars to the 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.050
 previous problem and be an example for 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.729
 many people who see in your achievement if 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.889
 there is a hope of being able to do it 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.800
 then for me bonus and have 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.850
 contributed in this cause and in this type 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.620
 of good work I chose the doctor 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.410
 one because it was like the person who 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.370
 it gave me more confidence and minimized more 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.430
 the excuses I had 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.040
 the one at the beginning gave me hope 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.340
 that my scars and my face already 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.020
 it's like before and even that it was going to 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.330
 bring the active life very well before 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.400
 so I think that had a lot to do with 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.050
 see why the producers like me 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400
 they said not everything is transition to be 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.770
 permanent and they will always be there 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.919
 but Dr. Luis Perez from the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.800
 principle told me that that was something this 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.990
 small and that he with his technology 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.470
 could help to mitigate labor 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.470
 full 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.509
 and
