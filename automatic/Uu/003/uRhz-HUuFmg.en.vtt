 areas one of them connection once again 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 troops clashed with limited 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.109
 tactical communications capabilities 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.720
 the link they are morally obsolete it 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.439
 led to transmission delays 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.200
 information combat information from this 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.040
 the day of the tasks 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.829
 provided on task for ministry

 touched the defense minister problem 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.170
 polygon readiness according to him is already in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 the near future will be presented to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.489
 review the program for their 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.270
 modernization needs to be taken to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.859
 improving the right provision of troops and 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.020
 increasing the level of military training 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.140
 engineers 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.470
 Here an important role will play our 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 upgraded modernize cu 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.360
 polygons we have to complete 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.509
 program to modernize all of our 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.340
 landfills and carrying them out like on the ground 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.220
 so in the air and mind and the corresponding 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.950
 condition so that you can fully 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.110
 conduct all the training 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.939
 necessary for the armed forces and fleet 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.790
 in large-scale exercises were involved

 over 160 thousand servicemen over 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.920
 five thousand tanks and armored personnel carriers 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.200
 130 aircraft and nearly 70 ships 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.880
 perfect march throws on thousands 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.250
 kilometers allowed to check 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.490
 the readiness of military equipment that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.020
 at times it also crashed out of 14 seconds. 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.979
 half thousand different samples 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.399
 there were 305 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.979
 and brother 305 emily breakdown samples and 273 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.710
 breakdowns almost eliminated 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.930
 repair and restoration bodies 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.110
 there is 90 percent this to the fact that in 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.060
 principle decision to restore 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.790
 repair service troops absolutely 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.470
 right after all and 90 percent at 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.690
 such events technology 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.880
 it is precisely the troops that are being repaired 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.830
 large-scale exercises made it possible 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.020
 objectively assess the state of the armed 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.420
 forces check interspecific interaction 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.310
 command and control complex of tasks was 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.140
 really huge and for the most part 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 executed at the same time military 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.770
 encountered some unforeseen 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.630
 difficulties for example at the airport 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.700
 Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk at first simply 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.010
 refused to accept military aircraft 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.110
 citing the lack of prior 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.959
 payment according to the deputy minister 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.590
 Dmitry Bulgakov in the future such 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.500
 situations 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.810
 will exclude from the first sea you know 14 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.239
 years on all civil airfields 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.790
 articles with federal law we will 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.810
 look for a landing without squeezing any fees 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.420
 here today from January 1, 14 because 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 that the one who listened remember I will go 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.260
 Sakhalin role not led since January 1 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.090
 we will be on any civil slave 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.680
 sit down without any payment all 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.510
 there are changes in the past 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 federal law today 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.380
 separately kneel raised questions 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.630
 development of military medicine because the number 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.019
 military doctors involved go 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.110
 exercise was also unprecedented around 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.420
 8 thousand medical workers took 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.790
 participation in these exercises did not happen 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.600
 even during the Soviet Union only in 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.930
 military doctors officers were 850 people 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.510
 whether to use the hospital 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.829
 was attracted made long marches 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.840
 medical trance special 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.879

 military personnel and journalists who 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.109
 For two weeks covered in detail 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.239
 the course of the exercises among those whose contribution was also 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.790
 It turned out to be marked and our employees 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.349
 tv channel and so final conclusions on 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.780
 the results of a sudden check of combat readiness 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.889
 the armed forces allowed to state 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.930
 in general, with their tasks

 the military successfully coped 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.469
 lack of opinion 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.049
 military leaders only confirmed 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.239
 necessary similar maneuvers that 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.549
 now there will be no doubt 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.079
 take place regularly in firewood 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.579
