00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 here is the new lg g3 the successor of the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.730
 lg g2 which has received so many awards in the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.410
 2013 as the best smartphone 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.759
 how to improve the best 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.440
 smartphone of 2013 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.509
 we touched on a series of points 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 first we improved the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.189
 display a display that becomes 5.5 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.630
 inches with a truly resolution 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.609
 very high we talk about a resolution 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.990
 quad hd from 2560 x 1440 points a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.420
 resolution that will allow you to have 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.480
 details never seen before 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 think 538 points per inch which is the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.559
 33 percent more than a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.809
 full hd display of the same size 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.969
 therefore a display so great is however gods 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 very thin edges you think it occupies 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.890
 as many as 76.4 percent of the surface 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.379
 front for an experience a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.989
 full screen but with the minimum 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 overall dimensions a footprint that is given precisely 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.710
 from these thin edges but above all 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.260
 very high handling thanks 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.629
 to the curved section that adapts to the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.609
 own hand and then talking about design 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 we have improved the part a lot 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.000
 back where we adopted one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.799
 particular technique is called metallic 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.850
 skin or a particular process 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.680
 which makes the whole look of the metal however 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 maintaining the lightness of plastic 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.040
 this gives us the opportunity to have 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.799
 just a very large display in just 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.729
 148 grams and a thickness of 8.9 mm 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.530
 another function that we have improved 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.990
 remarkably was the camera which 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.100
 see the 13 megapixel sensor again 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 the optical image stabilizer 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.729
 but that we have further 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.070
 improved because it comes into operation with 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.930
 20 percent more speed then 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.390
 see this black window it is 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 of a laser autofocus allows us to 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 focus when we activate the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.670
 camera really in a way 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.899
 very fast regardless of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.729
 light conditions therefore also in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.320
 this case where we are illuminated 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.149
 simply from the windows 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.619
 we really have a focus 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.079
 very quickly this allows us to 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.380
 take pictures at the speed of 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.420
 light 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.430
 think about that too 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.829
 the interface you see just a touch to 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 focus and to shoot and if 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.360
 we want to make a self pass us 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.369
 swipe your finger and here we are 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.619
 we see in squares and then also here 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.940
 just tap to take a self between us 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.280
 the other we have also equipped with others 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.110
 functionality for 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.550
 gesture recognition and many 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.200
 other things regarding then 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.510
 the interface was completely 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.069
 magazine has become much simpler 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.540
 and elegant and then we added some 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.670
 functionality like smart notes 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 imagine that for example you have 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.690
 refused a call because you were 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.310
 engaged in a smart known meeting 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.260
 after a while if you have not recalled the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.790
 contact will suggest you to call him back 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.709
 or to delete applications that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.180
 not used and so on 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.950
 another thing we did for 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.319
 make writing easier 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 sms for example is the possibility of 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.580
 adjust the keyboard height because 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.940
 not all of us have hands 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.890
 of the same size and therefore 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.600
 we can adjust the height directly 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.390
 of our keyboard to make it more 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.530
 small or even more extensive 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.930
 at the moment we may have some 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.340
 ditte grossa here's this is lg g3 is one 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.170
 top of the range smartphones we have at his 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.080
 internal quad core processor 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.239
 snapdragon 801 up to 2500 different between 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.890
 the other a 3,000 mile battery not 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.200
 it is however with the removable cover we have 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.970
 listened to your suggestions then 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.010
 as a removable matter 3000 thousand in per 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.530
 hours expandable memory up to 2 ter a 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.630
 with micro sd then you can put 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.200
 all the content you want to his 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.610
 lgg 3 interior comes in three colors 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.650
 at the end of June 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.209
 we have the gold as you see here yes 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.950
 called shine gold then we also have the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.049
 metallic black and we also have the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.150
 white version among the accessories of lg 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.890
 g3 we also have this quick circle 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.109
 cover or an interactive case 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.519
 with this blog from which we can 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.049
 quietly look for example le 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.299
 our notifications or forecasts 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.010
 weather or interact with different 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.019
 applications for example the camera 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.489
 or the music players messages 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.620
 last calls or the new service 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.209
 lg health that allows us to keep 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.209
 an eye on our physical form
