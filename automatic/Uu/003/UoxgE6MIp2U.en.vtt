only thing I would not use this lens for
is<00:01:01.230> something<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.710> portrait<00:01:02.609> photography

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
is something like portrait photography

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
is something like portrait photography
you<00:01:03.660> want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.350> longer<00:01:04.799> lens<00:01:05.070> in

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you want to use a longer lens in

you want to use a longer lens in
portrait<00:01:05.519> photography<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.540> you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
portrait photography for one because you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.670 
portrait photography for one because you
can<00:01:06.780> blur<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> background<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
can blur out the background with a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
can blur out the background with a
longer<00:01:07.860> lens<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.479> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
longer lens you can do that with this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.039 
longer lens you can do that with this
too<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.880> features<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> face<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:13.020> look

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
too but the features on a face will look

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
too but the features on a face will look
a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.439> different<00:01:13.590> using<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.670> they<00:01:14.909> look

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
a little different using this they look

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
a little different using this they look
a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.450> wider<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.470> sort<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
a little bit wider in that sort of a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
a little bit wider in that sort of a
setting<00:01:17.369> than<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> longer<00:01:18.210> length<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.540> if

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
setting than with a longer length so if

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
setting than with a longer length so if

when you're shooting are you going to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.069 
when you're shooting are you going to
need<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.780> zoom<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.530> out<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:02.040> subject

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
lens for that one because you can zoom

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.010 
lens for that one because you can zoom
in<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.430> pull<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.970> lens<00:02:16.150> back<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.599> you

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
can get fairly close up and then when

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.640 
can get fairly close up and then when
the<00:02:19.660> little<00:02:19.840> guys<00:02:19.959> are<00:02:20.170> out<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.470> outfield

you can zoom all the way in and get them
in<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.569> outfield<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.080> they<00:02:23.200> still<00:02:23.560> are

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
in the outfield and they still are

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.760 
in the outfield and they still are
fairly<00:02:24.310> big<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.810> your<00:02:26.080> image<00:02:26.230> they're<00:02:26.560> not

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
fairly big in your image they're not

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.670 
fairly big in your image they're not
like<00:02:27.580> three<00:02:27.940> pixels<00:02:28.300> in<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.540> far<00:02:29.170> distance

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
like three pixels in the far distance

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.759 
like three pixels in the far distance
and<00:02:29.860> they<00:02:30.150> would<00:02:31.200> definitely<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.410> blow<00:02:32.739> up

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
and they would definitely not blow up

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.380 
and they would definitely not blow up
well<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.430> want<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.640> be<00:02:33.760> able<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.970> pull<00:02:34.120> them<00:02:34.269> in
