I<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:14.820> think<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.210> likely<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I don't think is likely first one is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
I don't think is likely first one is
primitive<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.549> very<00:01:18.000> simple<00:01:18.330> he

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
primitive there you go very simple he

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.210 
primitive there you go very simple he
