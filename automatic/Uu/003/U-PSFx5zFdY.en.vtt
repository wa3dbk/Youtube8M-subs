00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
one that I like a lot better than mono

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330 
one that I like a lot better than mono
development<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.020> think<00:00:16.560> modern<00:00:16.740> development

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
development I think modern development

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.990 
development I think modern development
is<00:00:17.520> alright<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.570> um<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.770> new<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.970> a

is alright but um this new one I like a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.259 
is alright but um this new one I like a
lot<00:00:21.240> better<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.470> pretty<00:00:23.070> much<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.789> go<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.280 
notepad but it's friendly to all kinds
of<00:00:34.800> developers<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:36.450> save<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.110> any

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
of developers it can save out in any

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.280 
of developers it can save out in any
language<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.010> want<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.870> does<00:00:40.110> all

the highlighting and everything else

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
the highlighting and everything else
that<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.120> normal<00:00:42.739> like<00:00:43.739> mono<00:00:44.040> development

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that a normal like mono development

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.150 
that a normal like mono development
would<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> find<00:00:46.260> mono<00:00:46.469> development<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
would do but I find mono development to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.660 
would do but I find mono development to
be<00:00:47.250> very<00:00:47.550> slow<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.510> loading<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
be very slow when loading it up and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.240 
be very slow when loading it up and
whatnot<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:52.260> particularly<00:00:52.980> like

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
whatnot and I don't particularly like

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
whatnot and I don't particularly like
the<00:00:53.460> style<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.180> set<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.110> all

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the style that set up with it and all

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.369 
the style that set up with it and all
that<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.579> decided<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.379> notepad

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that so I decided to go with notepad

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.399 
that so I decided to go with notepad
plus<00:00:58.829> plus<00:00:59.390> so<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.550> download<00:01:02.550> page

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
plus plus so they have the download page

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.260 
plus plus so they have the download page
you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.530> download<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:05.820> sure<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.150> this

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you can download it I'm not sure if this

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.800 
you can download it I'm not sure if this
is<00:01:06.330> only<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.229> Windows<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.810> Mac

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
is only for Windows or if it's for Mac

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
is only for Windows or if it's for Mac
as<00:01:10.020> well<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.590> guess<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.100> guys<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
as well I guess you guys will have to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
as well I guess you guys will have to
check<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.689> out

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
check it out

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.359 
check it out
and<00:01:13.110> find<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.920> go<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and find out about that but if we go in

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
and find out about that but if we go in
the<00:01:17.580> air<00:01:17.700> you'll<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.509> save<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:18.869> like

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the air you'll just save it out like

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.050 
the air you'll just save it out like
normal<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:19.979> computer<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.670> project
