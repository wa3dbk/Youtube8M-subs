00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.699
 HTC "Sense Home" is a system that will display apps on your 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.449
 depending on where you are, or your 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.349
 browsing habits. 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.430
 So that the interface learns more easily to show you the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.150
 relevant applications, go to Settings to "Customize HTC Sense Home" 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.050
 You can then share your precise position, 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.600
 for the One M9 to suggest restaurants, or other places to 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.640
 proximity for example, or also your personal usage data. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240
 These are the apps you use, the sites you visit ... 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.420
 so, again, to improve the relevance of HTC's "Sense Home" display. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.940
 To customize the graphical appearance of your HTC One M9, 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.780
 there is the application "Themes", installed basic on the smartphone, which contains themes 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.240
 paid or free that will completely change the appearance of your phone. 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.039
 Just download them as you would with an application, 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.229
 and then apply the selected theme, in order to edit 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.889
 the phone interface. 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.230
 Also know that it is possible to create your own theme 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.090
 with the "+" button here, in which you can choose both the image of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 wallpaper but also packs of icons, etc. 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.280
 You see this black band above the HTC One M9? It's done 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 the infrared sensor, which will allow, thanks to the telephone, 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.940
 to remotely control your television. The application "Peel Smart Remote", 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.370
 once again installed by default on the HTC One M9, 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.230
 is the one that will have to be configured to control your television, 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.950
 depending on its model and your TV package. 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.830
 Let's talk a little about the camera. That of the HTC One M9 is 20.7 megapixels, 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.710
 but by default, the 16: 9 ratio of the camera 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.730
 does not exploit the whole possible definition. It takes for that to go in 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.590
 Camera Settings, 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.040
 touch "Ratio" and choose "Normal (10: 7)". 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.980
 Note however that this leaves two black bands on the right and left of 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.260
 the camera. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.110
 The buttons on the navigation bar of the HTC One M9 are very 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.430
 classic "Back", "Home" and recent applications. 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.369
 possible to customize them and add a fourth one. Go for that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.300
 in Settings, touch "Customize" then 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.639
 "Change navigation buttons". 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.879
 Remember that you can only display four at a time, but you 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.389
 can for example change their display order and confirm with ok. 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.779
 Who says HTC One also says technology "BoomSound", with its two 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.239
 speakers on the front. Know that in Settings always, it is possible 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.790
 to switch between a "Music" mode and a "Video" mode to get the best 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.370
 party of the front speakers. 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.759
 In the same way, when you connect a headset to the HTC One M9, 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.339
 you can choose its type, in order to get the best quality possible. 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.929
 Finally last tip that is not exclusive to HTC One M9, 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:46.990
 but which is still very useful, 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.130
 it's about getting rid of "BlinkFeed", the HTC's special content aggregator. 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.650
 For that, you have to make a long press on an empty space of the office of 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.669
 your phone then 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.509
 "Manage pages home screen". Drag them to find HTC "BlinkFeed", 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.260
 and click on "Delete" 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.220
 to finally see it disappear. 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.189
