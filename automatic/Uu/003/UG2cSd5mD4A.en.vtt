so<00:00:00.510> an<00:00:00.840> organic<00:00:01.620> peg<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.970> order<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.419> be

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
so an organic peg in order to be

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.480 
so an organic peg in order to be
certified<00:00:03.959> organic<00:00:04.200> for<00:00:04.620> these<00:00:04.740> babies<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.370> be

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
certified organic for these babies to be

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.490 
certified organic for these babies to be
certified<00:00:05.940> organic<00:00:06.240> our<00:00:06.600> moms<00:00:06.960> need<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.379> be

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
certified organic our moms need to be

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.990 
certified organic our moms need to be
out<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.160> last<00:00:08.340> third<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.849> their

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
out here for the last third of their

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.080 
out here for the last third of their
gestation<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.840> certified<00:00:10.260> organic<00:00:10.559> land

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
gestation on the certified organic land

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
gestation on the certified organic land
and<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.750> means<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.530> pig<00:00:13.860> gestation<00:00:14.280> is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
and that means so a pig gestation is

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.039 
and that means so a pig gestation is
three<00:00:14.790> months<00:00:15.059> three<00:00:15.330> weeks<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.780> three<00:00:16.020> days

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
three months three weeks and three days

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.540 
three months three weeks and three days
so<00:00:16.379> essentially<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.039> need<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.400> out<00:00:17.430> here

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
so essentially they need to be out here

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.429 
so essentially they need to be out here
for<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.970> last<00:00:18.090> month<00:00:18.539> week<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:18.990> day<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.289> their

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
for the last month week and day of their

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.260 
for the last month week and day of their
gestation<00:00:19.770> once<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.730> come<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.150> they

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
gestation once they come out here they

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.750 
gestation once they come out here they
start<00:00:21.539> eating<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:22.020> certified<00:00:22.710> organic<00:00:23.340> green

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.689> land<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.080> they're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this is all the land that they're

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770 
this is all the land that they're
rooting<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.859> also<00:00:32.250> certified<00:00:32.579> organic<00:00:33.030> see

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
rooting it is also certified organic see

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.060 
rooting it is also certified organic see
all<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> stuff<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:34.890> isn't

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
all the stuff that you know isn't

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
all the stuff that you know isn't
necessarily<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.030> would<00:00:36.300> want<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.540> eat

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
necessarily what we would want to eat

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.770 
necessarily what we would want to eat
but<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.320> love<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.270> pretty

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
but they love it so all of that pretty

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.510 
but they love it so all of that pretty
much<00:00:39.899> makes<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.440> certify<00:00:40.890> organic<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.430> then

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
much makes them certify organic and then

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100 
much makes them certify organic and then
they<00:00:41.670> also<00:00:41.820> must<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.600> certified<00:00:43.079> organic

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
they also must go to a certified organic

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
they also must go to a certified organic
processor<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.129> um<00:00:44.390> we<00:00:45.390> actually<00:00:45.420> don't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
processor which um we actually don't

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.420 
processor which um we actually don't
necessarily<00:00:46.350> always<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:46.980> sometimes<00:00:47.280> our

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
necessarily always do so sometimes our

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.740 
necessarily always do so sometimes our
meat<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.789> raised<00:00:48.030> organically<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.660> not

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
meat is raised organically but not

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.439 
meat is raised organically but not
necessarily<00:00:49.200> certified<00:00:49.710> organic<00:00:50.070> um<00:00:50.460> they're

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
necessarily certified organic um they're

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.869 
necessarily certified organic um they're
the<00:00:51.989> processors<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:53.039> choose<00:00:53.399> our<00:00:53.640> based

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the processors that we choose our based

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.299 
the processors that we choose our based
on<00:00:54.030> welfare<00:00:54.329> standards<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.440> choose

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
on welfare standards and how they choose

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.880 
on welfare standards and how they choose
to<00:00:56.430> process<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.120> meat<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:58.050> our<00:00:58.500> number

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
to process the meat so that's our number

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
to process the meat so that's our number
one<00:00:59.039> concern<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.520> typically<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.149> our

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
one concern and typically that's our

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.450 
one concern and typically that's our
buyers<00:01:00.660> number<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.230> concern<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.370> if

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
buyers number one concern as well so if

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.560 
buyers number one concern as well so if
we<00:01:02.550> tell<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:03.030> didn't<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.359> an

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
we tell them that they didn't go to an

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.649 
we tell them that they didn't go to an
organic<00:01:04.339> certified<00:01:05.339> organic<00:01:05.580> processor<00:01:06.150> but

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
organic certified organic processor but

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.210 
organic certified organic processor but
we<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.900> happy<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.350> their<00:01:07.500> standards<00:01:07.920> then

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
we are happy with their standards then

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.859 
we are happy with their standards then

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that I get to play with pigs some of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.149 
that I get to play with pigs some of
them<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.380> why<00:01:16.530> would<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> do

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
them are like why would you want to do

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.890

they<00:01:19.110> love<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> mud<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
they love the mud but that's because it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
they love the mud but that's because it
keeps<00:01:20.670> them<00:01:20.880> cool<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> summer<00:01:21.570> because

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
keeps them cool in the summer because

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.630 
keeps them cool in the summer because
they<00:01:22.619> don't<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.009> believe<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.369> sweat

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
they don't I don't believe they sweat

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
they don't I don't believe they sweat
and<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.840> how<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.049> stay<00:01:25.229> cool<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.619> roll

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and that's how they stay cool they roll

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.700 
and that's how they stay cool they roll
in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> watery<00:01:26.310> muddy<00:01:26.790> area<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.439> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
in the watery muddy area and then it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.899 
in the watery muddy area and then it
also<00:01:28.860> prevents<00:01:29.490> them<00:01:29.640> from<00:01:29.670> getting

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
also prevents them from getting

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.499 
also prevents them from getting
sunburned<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> other<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.759> some<00:01:33.270> people

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
sunburned so other than that some people

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
sunburned so other than that some people
are<00:01:33.810> sad<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.530> students<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.040> sad

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
are sad some students are really sad

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.219

certain point that ours are we tried out

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.840

facilities<00:01:53.850> processing<00:01:54.390> facilities<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.079> what

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
facilities processing facilities is what

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.069 
facilities processing facilities is what
they<00:01:55.320> should<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.560> called<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:57.780> for

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
they should be called and we look for

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
they should be called and we look for
that's<00:01:58.590> our<00:01:58.740> highest<00:01:58.920> standard<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.520> look<00:01:59.640> for

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that's our highest standard we look for

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.280 
that's our highest standard we look for
the<00:01:59.850> highest<00:02:00.000> standard<00:02:00.450> available<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:01.140> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the highest standard available for that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.219 
the highest standard available for that
so<00:02:01.860> explaining<00:02:02.729> students<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.570> aspect<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
so explaining students that aspect of it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
so explaining students that aspect of it
is<00:02:04.350> sometimes<00:02:04.710> hard<00:02:04.890> especially<00:02:05.729> I've<00:02:05.850> had

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
is sometimes hard especially I've had

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.609 
is sometimes hard especially I've had
little<00:02:06.240> kids<00:02:06.479> come<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.350> asked

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
little kids come out here and they asked

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
little kids come out here and they asked
to<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.099> tell<00:02:08.700> them<00:02:08.819> flat<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.300> like

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
to and I tell them flat out I'm like

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
to and I tell them flat out I'm like
as<00:02:09.840> pork<00:02:10.290> production<00:02:10.560> these<00:02:10.920> are<00:02:11.100> pork

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
as pork production these are pork

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.450 
as pork production these are pork
production<00:02:12.300> animals<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.280> that's<00:02:14.280> probably

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
production animals and that's probably

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460 
production animals and that's probably
the<00:02:14.610> hardest<00:02:14.970> part<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.570> people<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.900> grasp<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the hardest part for people to grasp and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.750 
the hardest part for people to grasp and
I'm<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.710> well<00:02:16.890> where<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.340> think<00:02:17.520> your

so it's really it is sad but it's making
making<00:02:44.310> meat<00:02:44.460> production<00:02:44.700> better<00:02:45.030> which<00:02:45.210> is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
making meat production better which is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.970 
making meat production better which is
really<00:02:45.540> important<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.500> one<00:02:46.770> thing<00:02:46.920> to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
really important it's one thing to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.830 
really important it's one thing to
understand<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.850> environmental<00:02:48.240> issues<00:02:48.660> that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
understand the environmental issues that

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.510 
understand the environmental issues that
we<00:02:48.930> face<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> planet<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.280> whole

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
we face on the planet but it's a whole

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.550 
we face on the planet but it's a whole
nother<00:02:50.550> thing<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.120> develop<00:02:51.570> an<00:02:51.720> ethic<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.170> care

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
nother thing to develop an ethic of care

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.070 
nother thing to develop an ethic of care
and<00:02:52.890> what<00:02:53.670> we're<00:02:53.850> saying<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.300> happening<00:02:54.780> here

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
and what we're saying is happening here

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.140 
and what we're saying is happening here
is<00:02:55.230> students<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.830> Lexi<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.340> Joe<00:02:56.550> Fox<00:02:56.820> and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
is students like Lexi and Joe Fox and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.960 
is students like Lexi and Joe Fox and
all<00:02:57.240> my<00:02:57.420> other<00:02:57.450> amazing<00:02:58.410> students<00:02:58.830> learn<00:02:59.670> how

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
all my other amazing students learn how

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.250 
all my other amazing students learn how
to<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.270> carers<00:03:01.430> here<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.730> very<00:03:03.000> real<00:03:03.270> context

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
to be carers here in a very real context

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.860 
to be carers here in a very real context
and<00:03:04.440> then<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.980> ethic<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.490> care<00:03:05.820> radiates<00:03:06.630> out

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and then that ethic of care radiates out

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.260 
and then that ethic of care radiates out
and<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.590> when<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.950> learn<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.700> care<00:03:09.030> for

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
and so when you learn to care for

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.780 
and so when you learn to care for
another<00:03:09.570> being<00:03:09.960> or<00:03:10.290> another<00:03:10.560> species<00:03:11.160> you

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
another being or another species you

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.120 
another being or another species you
then<00:03:12.030> develop<00:03:12.450> those<00:03:12.630> skills<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.230> care<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:13.920> an

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
then develop those skills to care for an

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.240 
then develop those skills to care for an
ecosystem<00:03:15.060> or<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.959> farm<00:03:16.410> or<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.860> farm

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
ecosystem or for a farm or a farm

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.430 
ecosystem or for a farm or a farm
community<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.660> radiates<00:03:19.260> out

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
community and then that radiates out

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.680 
community and then that radiates out
even<00:03:19.709> further<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.459> learn<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.850> develop<00:03:21.390> an

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
even further and you learn to develop an
