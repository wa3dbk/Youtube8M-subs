00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
important thing to think about there is

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.870 
important thing to think about there is
yeah<00:00:29.949> it's<00:00:30.100> actually<00:00:30.430> like<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.580> say<00:00:30.760> the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
yeah it's actually like you say the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.550 
yeah it's actually like you say the
process<00:00:31.270> basically<00:00:31.510> sure<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.169> actually<00:00:32.289> kind

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
process basically sure and actually kind

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.810 
process basically sure and actually kind
of<00:00:32.590> having<00:00:32.739> that<00:00:32.860> planned<00:00:33.190> out<00:00:33.340> in<00:00:33.520> your<00:00:33.640> head

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
of having that planned out in your head

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.720 
of having that planned out in your head
right<00:00:34.030> before<00:00:34.720> it<00:00:34.810> happens<00:00:35.140> I<00:00:35.530> think<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.190> get

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
right before it happens I think I get

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.069 
right before it happens I think I get
idea<00:00:37.000> possibly<00:00:37.120> sometimes<00:00:37.660> that<00:00:37.810> people

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
idea possibly sometimes that people

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.319 
idea possibly sometimes that people
don't<00:00:38.200> necessarily<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:39.790> kind<00:00:40.060> of<00:00:40.120> things

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
don't necessarily have kind of things

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.120 
don't necessarily have kind of things
planned<00:00:40.630> you'll<00:00:40.960> see<00:00:41.110> people<00:00:41.290> net<00:00:41.560> fish<00:00:41.829> and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
do see that happen so that the first

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.139 
do see that happen so that the first
thing<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:50.890> always<00:00:50.920> do<00:00:51.579> which<00:00:51.820> is<00:00:51.850> really

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
thing I always do which is really

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.490 
thing I always do which is really
important<00:00:52.540> is<00:00:52.630> just<00:00:52.750> to<00:00:52.840> leave<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.140> fish<00:00:53.350> in

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
important is just to leave the fish in

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.069 
important is just to leave the fish in
the<00:00:53.590> net<00:00:53.620> just<00:00:54.219> for<00:00:54.520> 5-10<00:00:55.420> minutes<00:00:55.450> just<00:00:55.930> to

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
the net just for 5-10 minutes just to

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.479 
the net just for 5-10 minutes just to
lay<00:00:56.200> recover<00:00:56.530> obvious<00:00:56.770> it's<00:00:56.890> just<00:00:57.040> fought<00:00:57.280> for

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
lay recover obvious it's just fought for

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.220 
lay recover obvious it's just fought for
its<00:00:57.579> life<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.180> know<00:00:58.300> it's<00:00:58.809> worn<00:00:59.050> out

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
its life you know it's worn out

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.490 
its life you know it's worn out
literature<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.820> know<00:01:00.940> so<00:01:01.270> I<00:01:01.600> personally

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
literature you know so I personally

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.660 
literature you know so I personally
don't<00:01:02.590> believe<00:01:02.739> it's<00:01:02.950> a<00:01:02.980> good<00:01:03.129> thing<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.579> bring

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
don't believe it's a good thing to bring

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.340 
don't believe it's a good thing to bring
the<00:01:03.850> fish<00:01:04.000> out<00:01:04.149> straightaway<00:01:04.600> I<00:01:04.899> just<00:01:05.229> think

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
the fish out straightaway I just think

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.289 
the fish out straightaway I just think
giving<00:01:05.649> it<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:06.189> know<00:01:06.310> just<00:01:06.759> five<00:01:07.090> minutes

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
giving it you know just five minutes

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.480 
giving it you know just five minutes
maybe<00:01:07.600> just<00:01:08.319> to<00:01:08.409> recover<00:01:08.560> just<00:01:08.889> the<00:01:09.189> literary

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
maybe just to recover just the literary

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.889 
maybe just to recover just the literary
that<00:01:09.639> gets<00:01:09.880> breath<00:01:10.119> back<00:01:10.359> and<00:01:10.569> a<00:01:10.600> little<00:01:10.689> bit

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
on your mat water will sit in that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.390 
on your mat water will sit in that
recess<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.350> there's<00:03:14.530> always<00:03:14.830> some<00:03:15.040> water<00:03:15.220> on

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
recess so there's always some water on

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.430 
recess so there's always some water on
the<00:03:15.520> mat<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.910> doesn't<00:03:15.940> get<00:03:16.270> all<00:03:16.390> dry<00:03:16.690> by<00:03:17.260> golly

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
the mat it doesn't get all dry by golly

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.520 
the mat it doesn't get all dry by golly
so<00:03:18.010> any<00:03:18.940> small<00:03:19.270> thing<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.720> know<00:03:19.810> yes<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.350> this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
so any small thing you know yes so this

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.170 
so any small thing you know yes so this
this<00:03:20.740> Mac<00:03:20.980> really<00:03:21.100> holds<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.670> water<00:03:21.790> then

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
this Mac really holds the water then

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.540 
this Mac really holds the water then
yeah<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.690> does<00:03:22.840> soak<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> sponge<00:03:23.860> no<00:03:24.190> no

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
yeah it does soak up like a sponge no no

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.880 
yeah it does soak up like a sponge no no
it's<00:03:24.700> made<00:03:24.790> from<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> Apple<00:03:25.240> sex<00:03:25.420> material<00:03:25.959> so

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
it's made from the Apple sex material so

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.370 
it's made from the Apple sex material so
yes<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.310> does<00:03:27.490> it<00:03:27.720> sort<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.750> repels<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.170> water

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
yes it does it sort of repels the water

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.930 
yes it does it sort of repels the water
but<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.770> little<00:03:29.920> recess<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.520> helps<00:03:30.760> keep

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
but that little recess just helps keep

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.760 
but that little recess just helps keep
just<00:03:31.150> keep<00:03:31.180> sitting<00:03:31.480> area<00:03:31.810> last<00:03:32.050> as<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.560> ya

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
just keep sitting area last as on ya

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.410 
just keep sitting area last as on ya
obviously<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.160> fact<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.400> repels<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.970> makes

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
obviously the fact that repels it makes

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.520 
obviously the fact that repels it makes
it<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> lot<00:03:34.600> easier<00:03:34.660> when<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.110> comes<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.380> packing

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
it a lot easier when it comes to packing

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.050 
it a lot easier when it comes to packing
away<00:03:35.740> as<00:03:35.950> well<00:03:36.130> because<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.580> dries<00:03:36.850> much

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
away as well because it dries much

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.780 
away as well because it dries much
quicker<00:03:37.560> same<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.709> sling<00:03:38.980> as<00:03:39.100> well<00:03:39.250> that's

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
quicker same in sling as well that's

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.000 
quicker same in sling as well that's
made<00:03:39.940> from<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.180> same<00:03:40.360> material<00:03:40.959> it's<00:03:41.770> got<00:03:41.890> all

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
made from the same material it's got all

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.550

the same properties as that really nice

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.870 
the same properties as that really nice
and<00:03:44.740> light<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.280> kind<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.459> feather<00:03:45.700> way

those<00:03:55.390> aluminium<00:03:55.720> poles<00:03:56.020> that<00:03:56.230> spreads<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
those aluminium poles that spreads the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.610 
those aluminium poles that spreads the
weight<00:03:57.520> these<00:03:58.240> two<00:03:58.510> points<00:03:58.720> there's<00:03:59.050> fish

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
weight these two points there's fish

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.930 
weight these two points there's fish
clucking<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.220> middle<00:04:00.490> no<00:04:00.790> there's

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
clucking in the middle no there's

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.150 
clucking in the middle no there's
nothing<00:04:01.060> worse<00:04:01.360> than<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.720> slings<00:04:02.020> that<00:04:02.530> kind

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
nothing worse than the slings that kind

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.140 
nothing worse than the slings that kind
of<00:04:03.190> come<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.459> from<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.670> middle<00:04:03.790> because<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
of come in from the middle because the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.610 
of come in from the middle because the
fish<00:04:04.300> is<00:04:04.420> being<00:04:04.660> bent<00:04:04.900> yeah<00:04:05.230> whereas<00:04:05.590> that

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
fish is being bent yeah whereas that

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.290 
fish is being bent yeah whereas that
spreads<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.430> way<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.850> fish<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.180> just

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
spreads the way to the fish is just

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.110 
spreads the way to the fish is just
going<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.540> stay<00:04:08.220> lateral<00:04:09.220> shape<00:04:09.430> yeah<00:04:09.790> exactly

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
going to stay lateral shape yeah exactly

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.340 
going to stay lateral shape yeah exactly
ya<00:04:11.459> got<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.489> little<00:04:12.750> loops<00:04:13.750> on<00:04:13.930> there<00:04:14.050> for<00:04:14.200> way

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
ya got the little loops on there for way

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.740 
ya got the little loops on there for way
in<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.770> keeps<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.070> scales<00:04:15.419> centered<00:04:16.419> stops

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
in so it keeps the scales centered stops

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.630 
in so it keeps the scales centered stops
them<00:04:16.930> from<00:04:16.959> swinging<00:04:17.470> around<00:04:17.680> yeah<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:18.459> a

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
them from swinging around yeah and a

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.640 
them from swinging around yeah and a
last<00:04:19.060> little<00:04:19.180> point<00:04:19.480> got<00:04:19.900> zips<00:04:20.169> on<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.440> side

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
last little point got zips on the side

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.680 
last little point got zips on the side
actually<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.609> can<00:04:21.760> zip<00:04:21.910> up<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.479> know<00:04:22.570> how<00:04:22.660> to

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
actually you can zip up just know how to

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.980 
actually you can zip up just know how to
do<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.080> um<00:04:23.440> safe<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.130> secure<00:04:24.400> Sean<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.120> I

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
do that um safe and secure Sean and I

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.700 
do that um safe and secure Sean and I
guess<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.260> last<00:04:26.380> little<00:04:26.620> thing<00:04:26.710> about<00:04:27.160> 50
