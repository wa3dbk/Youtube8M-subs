00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.120
 and then people connected with pets come 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.330
 bring to you but a tutorial that will 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.699
 be of how to put songs in the foot 2013 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.519
 The Method of Putting Music on Foot 2013 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.880
 It's very simple, everything is fine. 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.769
 quick and easy understanding of you 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.930
 the program we are going to use here in this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.059
 tutorial is the fault staff converts 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.790
 to the most up-to-date version 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.719
 I found it is a short story that already does the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:48.090
 service on with good quality 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:49.440
 There the file of this program is going 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 to be with anyone here in the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.170
 video to download you will 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.850
 unzip a file it is going 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.850
 generating this installation file here 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:09.240
 it was ok to move forward and forward 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.750
 launching the installation is very fast and well 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 simple 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.030
 now you will be prompted to run the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.549
 problem is that in the program you take 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 which will have the from which is the format of the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.640
 file you go because the music you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.570
 You will want to put in the game going 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.320
 be in my case sp3 that this song 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 here o 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.780
 You'll hear a start from her there. 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.549
 home can see that she will not 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.549
 work properly inside the game 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.060
 in the program here 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 It will be good and here it will have a front 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.620
 mp3 and tool to shale that format 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.620
 that the game recognizes 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.600
 there you will carry the music ready to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:14.100
 music is here you will click on next 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:15.660
 next and use the same folder or if you want 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.220
 select another also passes to 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.640
 save the file just click on the three 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.950
 Points to choose the folder is that the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.950
 conversion was successful. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.570
 ready to close the program to the music 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.480
 point to 10x you'll be copying it 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.900
 and in the folder of your foot 2013 goes in the square 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.710
 which serves a pet folder that is 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.710
 installed on your at your feet 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.480
 image goes here and the team has 02 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.870
 has created 302 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.660
 if already if your pet does not have it is not only 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:08.880
 you create that bt 0 12 point image 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:15.330
 and mg is what you 're going to be renaming in a 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:18.900
 music for the name of 19 the first 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.680
 music that is the first cd you have to 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.010
 the music 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:30.180
 there you can up to 50 that the maximum you 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:34.290
 I've seen so far coming back a little more 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.250
 the folders you will have to have the sounds oea 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.480
 that I put there was with the 19 test 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.580
 here o 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.500
 how do you teach in aac format to put 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.800
 here in that song file that is where you 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.320
 will save the title of the song and 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.200
 artist so that it can appear 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.490
 inside the game 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.500
 the first one here you will put a 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.360
 number you have placed in the file 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.020
 within as of 2012 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.720
 in my case it was the 19th in which with the title 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.530
 of the music playing the test and artist of 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.030
 close on hq 4.0 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.730
 then you save the file and test the game 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.380
 to see if the music is working 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.519
 I'll go in the game here and I'll see if it's 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.519
 to work properly 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.720
 so here in the game is still 15 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.720
 options 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.480
 the song was added to yoki as 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.169
 you can see the test now there was a 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.169
 also because the official is not 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.840
 can really learn who 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.370
 so folks 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.840
 that's it this was another tutorial here 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.280
 on the front channel 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.770
 any question you can post on 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.390
 comments any suggestion also from 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.980

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:15.060
 comments as soon as possible 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.060
 I'll try doing the tutorials 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.670
 always visit our blog always is 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.630
 being the quality for reductions 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.670
 there is also our forum and it is already 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.170
 with enough members and we need each 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.830
 time is over is growing because 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:37.560
 quality of both editions may be 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.150
 Christ is always evolving the account and 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.810
 has grown topic here in our forum that 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.200
 will have many users besides editors 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.650
 also comments in its editions so that 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.560
 she is evaluated as possible 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.070
 so skype was another champion and even 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.070
