00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:12.850
 First of all, you need to look at the definition of Korean education . 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:17.860
 4 5 The Korean education as one of Korea for foreign as outer 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:20.410
 The goal of the church is to reach the height of the Korean high-level literacy learners 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.490
 We are talking about making 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.750
 Once the target foreigner should do it 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.320
 What teaching can now become a biography of Korean language education 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.489
 And now it is that compels us uppercut, where the port number of the current 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.589
 It is said that the level of utilization is high level of completion so we can communicate 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:45.100
 Geotyiji to learn Korean with Learn Korean What What What in Korea 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:50.159
 I interpret it as an artwork or an anthropic nation and it is not for this reason. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 Come to Korea and live with a Korean person, work in a job or work as a worker 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:58.629
 I work in a factory or I go to college and take contract classes . 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.429
 It is the problem of using Korean language . 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:07.300
 Lee is using foreigners and Korea harbor and the ability to focus on the part now 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:09.750
 Not least language training and language training is take a look at whether that has any difference 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.940
 You need to see. 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:19.560
 Native language education is 4 countries 2 people who speak Korean as their mother tongue 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.020
 Education for people with the right expression as the title for the first language and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.290
 We say that it is for the purpose of understanding 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.550
 Here we are now foreign languages 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.570
 The first language. These words are coming out . It 's the first language. 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.040
 That man was born to say the first language to recover the burner to the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.250
 It's prepared. 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.600
 Next, the ship speaks language as a second language 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.009
 Now yigoyo classification different from that part And now both foreign and yet now 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.330
 I have a criterion. 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:53.040
 So a foreign language literally means a foreign word I have not learned. 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:57.330
 Five things should be born and taught by mom and dad. 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.350
 Okay, so it's a bit different, but nevertheless, 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.369
 So now we are outside Russisch Korean language education 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.310
 He told, the outside third country cooking, but now after the party've now content 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.560
 I will. 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:18.900
 For example, those who got married and came to live in South Korea South Korea who is now such 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.250
 For those of you who speak Korean, it functions as a bilingual language, not a foreign language. 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.820
 I talk to you. 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:28.799
 So now it looks like the Canadian Chest Taebaek area and it 's light. 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.299
 Now Canada is the official language. But now the recovery area is French. 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.310
 Now I use it mainly 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:39.360
 So what are all these things, what is the subject and what is the example 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.170
 Then foreigners can come and obscure these standards . 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.940
 In order to communicate with the first learned mother and father 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.900
 So if you have a language that you use mainly when you think about it, 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.739
 You can. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.750

 In the control area now 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.140
 French is the second language , so it's mostly the first 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.930
 If it is not a language but a language that is now used in the home, it can be a j language. 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:23.130
