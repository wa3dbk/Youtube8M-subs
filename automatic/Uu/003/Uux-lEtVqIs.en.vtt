00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello how are we in a new video and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.700
 today we are going to learn to be nose 180 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.740
 good first before throwing the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.170
 980 we're going to have to have learned 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.360
 previously the facebook and the roll back 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.340
 since two tricks are given I do two parts 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.619
 of the trick that will help us a lot 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 if we have it already mastered this trick 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.500
 It will be easier than normal since 180 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.330
 we will have to lift only the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.010
 rear wheel and the front will stay 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 stuck to the ground as well as if you want 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.060
 throw we're going to throw the normal 180 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.199
 start first by this trick n 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.029
 you will only have to lift the wheel 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.590
 back so you do not have that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 normal feeling you can see the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 bunny and control is a bit effective 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 back the 980 we can do it for the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.420
 right or to the left to know 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 the side that we see it we must 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.989
 look if we have the left pedal 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.539
 in front we must do it to the right 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.340
 and we have the right pedal in front of it 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.719
 we must do to the left the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.489
 movement will be simple let's go with 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 middle university as a body outlet 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.360
 the waist forward is in the part 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.559
 of the handlebar pushing a bit with the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.600
 hands up so he gets up 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.399
 the rear wheel and as soon as we lift 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.109
 we will push your body to the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.030
 left of the right depends where 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.560
 let's pull so that the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.329
 back wheel let's make the turn 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.790
 let us do the ceic and quickly 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.680
 pedal to be the rondo when turning the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.479
 rear wheel 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.329
 we should try to lift it as much as possible 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.119
 possible and that it falls smoothly since 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.670
 if we make a quick pull to turn 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.039
 fast but we do not get up 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.750
 is going to hit us and surely 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.520
 will start some radio because the blow 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.320
 can be very very strong is the side of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.850
 the wheels and then I'm going to 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.710
 leave several clips so you can see the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.840
 waist movement that I do as 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.429
 he lifted the wheel and as if casually 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.759
 not affect without any wheel radius 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.759
 rear 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 it's okay 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.990
 here 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.690
 take 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.890
 and until today's tutorial I hope 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.880
 that has helped you if you have 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.740
 some doubt you can leave it in the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.150
