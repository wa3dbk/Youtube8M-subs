00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome back and new holland presented 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.790
 in 2009 a hydrogen tractor 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.730
 has now changed this factor has been 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 evolved and we see everything in this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.520
 next service with the voice of marco 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.380
 ceresa the nh2 powered tractor a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.840
 hydrogen is a key element of the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.140
 concept of energy independence for 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 the farm that violates proposes a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
 project that aims to free the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 farmers of fuel costs 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.890
 fossils allowing them to reach 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.450
 full autonomy in terms of fuels 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 this concept is perfectly in line 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.399
 with the brand position you are 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.969
 confirms once again clean energy 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.039
 the idea of the experimental nh2 tractor 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.500
 derived from a model of the award-winning 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.170
 followed by 6,000 the combustion engine 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.239
 internal has been replaced with cells a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.969
 fuel powered by hydrogen 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.250
 that generate the energy used for 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.739
 operate the two electric motors one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.629
 creation in services and tombstones oe 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.689
 the other that will allow progress of the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.290
 tractor the project is much more than one 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.080
 simple idea indeed the nh2 tractor is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.369
 a prototype with 120 horses 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.650
 fully functional it is capable of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.009
 perform all the tasks of a tractor 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.340
 series t 6,000 in almost total silence 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.340
 and emitting only water vapor 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.590
 the hydrogen-powered vehicles are in 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 experimentation course for many years 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.380
 these vehicles offer many advantages 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.299
 compared to those powered by batteries 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.030
 efficient only in the start type cycles 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.820
 stop and that take a long time for the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.770
 recharges the vehicle's work cycle 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.930
 agricultural is similar to that of 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 a car traveling on a motorway 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.610
 at constant speed 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.259
 hydrogen powered vehicles exceed 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.420
 these obstacles thanks to hydrogen 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.240
 compressed feeding the cells a 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.880
 fuel that produce electricity 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.950
 fuel cells have a long one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.990
 operational life and avoidance 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.280
 the environmental problem of disposal 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.710
 of the batteries 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.959
 morite hydrogen compressed at high 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.569
 energy potential can be 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.690
 conveniently stored in tanks also 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.940
 for a long time allowing 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.650
 fast and front supplies 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.330
 traditional obstacles regarding 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.120
 to the use of hydrogen only 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.709
 especially the distribution and the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.690
 availability the concept of 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.930
 energy independence for the company 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.150
 agricultural which new holland thinks provides 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.850
 that the customers themselves produce in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.020
 right at the hydrogen compressed starting 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.459
 water 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.400
 using a process called 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.930
 electrolysis a semi filter system 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.320
 selective and catalysts that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.640
 will allow the recovery of hydrogen 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.060
 directly from the methane produced by 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.180
 biogas obtained through fermentation 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.370
 from the by-products or biomass the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.709
 concept also provides that the systems 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.620
 of production are powered by 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.450
 wind farms or solar panels e 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.850
 that hydrogen is stored in 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.299
 underground tanks located near 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.209
 the farm itself compared to 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.950
 cars to tractor trucks 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.260
 combine harvesters usually work shortly 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.720
 distance from the company headquarters e 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.269
 they can therefore be refueled without 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.280
 problems the farmers are in one 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.019
 position of absolute advantage for 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.570
 take advantage of the technology of 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.340
 use of hydrogen have the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.290
 enough space to install 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.660
 alternative generation systems 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.700
 electricity for example 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.890
 solar wind farms for the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.049
 biomass treatment and for 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.600
 store the energy produced below 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.760
 form of hydrogen 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.859
 in addition to the environmental advantages a 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.049
 system of this type would allow 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.730
 to farms to become 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.980
 independent from the point of view 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.540
 energy and improve their own 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.299
 financial stability 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.430
 fuel costs make up 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.739
 in fact a significant part of the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.070
 operating expenses that a farm 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.780
 is facing daily 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.170
 the original tractor had been 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.230
 presented in 2009 but now in 2012 there 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.750
 the version evolved in this way new 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.769
 holland agriculture reaffirms its 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.019
 role of clean 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.269
 energy leader with the release of the new one 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.069
 hydrogen powered tractor e 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.629
 called nh2 the new nh2 is wanted 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:31.710
 from the concept that won the medal 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:34.949
 gold at the 2009 earthquake was 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.080
 developed in collaboration with crf ha 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.349
 called riccardo borselli product 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.629
 development innovation a process that 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.030
 involved new equipment 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.680
 for the development of the machine with all 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.270
 the features needed for 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.310
 ensure achievement of 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.310
 performance similar to a tractor the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.590
 traditional diesel both in the field and up 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.819
 road derived from the model in 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.830
 production new all anti 6140 the new 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.319
 tractor can work with all 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.360
 necessary tools for different jobs 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.990
 seasonal soil preparation 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.789
 sowing transport pressing and le 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.789
