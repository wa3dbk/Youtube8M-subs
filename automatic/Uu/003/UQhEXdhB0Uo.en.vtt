00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:10.540
 Like a lion cub and a turtle they sing a song 

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:15.584
 There was a lion in Africa. 

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:21.614
 His name was ... "Rrrr-meow". That's right! His name was "Rrrr-meow" 

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:25.478
 One day he went for a walk through the desert and met ... 

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:31.197
 A great turtle! 

00:00:31.912 --> 00:00:34.307
 The tortoise was lying in the sun 

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:38.143
 and hummed a happy song. 

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:53.846
 Can you hear it? 

00:00:54.496 --> 00:00:58.287
 I'm lying in the sun 

00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:02.192
 And I'm looking at the sun 

00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:06.263
 I'm lying down, I'm lying down 

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:10.355
 I'm lying in the sun 

00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.366
 What a beautiful song! Now I get a little closer 

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:16.074
 The little lion approached 

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:19.469
 but the tortoise did not notice him because his eyes were closed, 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.953
 immersed in the pleasure of the song. 

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:29.265
 A rhino - ceronte, va 

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:34.265
 A crocodile - drillo, swim 

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:38.239
 I just keep lying down 

00:01:38.468 --> 00:01:41.911
 and I keep looking at the sun. 

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.677
 The little lion approached furtively 

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:45.905
 and lay down on the sand 

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.913
 next to the turtle. Then he raised an ear to listen better. 

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:53.005
 Yes, so I can listen better. 

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:58.966
 Now there is a lion near me 

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:03.334
 And it's moving his ears 

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:07.725
 But I continue to lie down 

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:11.667
 And I keep looking at the sun 

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.598
 The turtle finished singing and opened his eyes 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.484
 Good morning. 

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:22.141
 I'm a big turtle. 

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:23.985
 Who are you? 

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:27.837
 I am a lion: Rrrr-Meow. 

00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:32.001
 I really like your song 

00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:38.737
 I'm sitting in the sun 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.808
 I look at the sun 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.649
 I'm sitting, I'm sitting 

00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:50.164
 I look at the sun 

00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:51.871
 You should be lying down, not sitting 

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:53.962
 You're lying down, I'm sitting 

00:02:55.015 --> 00:02:58.387
 A rhino - ceronte, va 

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:02.307
 A crocodile - drillo, swim 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.490
 I'm just sitting 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.240
 And I keep looking at the sun 

00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:15.401
 You should sing "I'm lying", because it's me who invented the song. 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.567
 How can I say "lying" if I'm sitting? 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:25.429
 Lie down and your song will tell the truth 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.896
 So lie down and sing 

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.651
 Thus: "Only I am lying" 

00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:36.529
 But I don't like to lie down, I like to run 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.343
 or at least to sit 

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:45.545
 But you were lying when you approached me 

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.729
 Yes, but I did it just to listen to your song better 

00:03:50.028 --> 00:03:53.641
 I lie only for special occasions 

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:59.614
 You won't sleep sitting down, will you? 

00:04:00.303 --> 00:04:00.947
 No. 

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:02.978
 No, of course I sleep lying down 

00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:06.773
 But while I sleep I don't sing 

00:04:07.401 --> 00:04:14.050
 Imagine singing and sleeping at the same time 

00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:16.306
 I'll try 

00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:19.840
 Let's start again! 

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.475
 Eeeee away! 

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:27.057
 I'm lying in the sun 

00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:31.009
 And I look at the sun 

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.637
 I'm lying down, I'm lying down 

00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:38.466
 And I look at the sun 

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:41.907
 But even now my song does not tell the truth, because when I sleep I have my eyes closed 

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:43.861
 And so I can't see the sun 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.805
 Then open your eyes, and imagine that you sleep with your eyes open, and sing. 

00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:50.715
 Okay, I try 

00:04:51.303 --> 00:04:52.423
 Eeeeee away! 

00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:55.516
 A rhino - ceronte, va 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.678
 A crocodile - drillo, swim 

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:07.074
 I'm just lying down, And I keep looking at the sun. 

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:10.740
 Now you sing alone, because I can't sing talking about myself 

00:05:11.336 --> 00:05:14.524
 There is a lion near me 

00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.050
 And it's moving his ears 

00:05:18.394 --> 00:05:21.925
 I alone, I'm lying down 

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:25.771
 And I don't look at the little lion 

00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:44.608
 It's really a nice little song! Just a beautiful song! 

00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:48.282
 Now take me on my back! 

00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:52.206
 When the sun went away, they separated 

00:06:52.737 --> 00:06:56.513
 Goodbye big turtle! 

00:06:56.951 --> 00:07:01.487
 Will you invent a new song tomorrow? 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.252
 Sure, come back tomorrow 

00:07:07.418 --> 00:07:11.216
 All right. See you tomorrow! 

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:21.543
 A rhino - ceronte, va 

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:25.403
 A crocodile - drillo, swim 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.958
 As he walked, he kept thinking: 

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:32.877
 How can you sleep with your eyes open? 

00:07:32.997 --> 00:07:37.552
 and sing a song at the same time? I do not understand.. 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.825
 I alone, I'm sitting .. Oops, I wanted to say .. 

00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:44.428
 I alone, I'm lying down. 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:48.091
 And I keep looking at the sun 

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.285
 End.
