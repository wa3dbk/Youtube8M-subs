00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you can see the screws are in there I've

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.840 
you can see the screws are in there I've
actually<00:00:36.360> marked<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.989> holes<00:00:37.309> plus<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> minus

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
actually marked the holes plus and minus

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610 
actually marked the holes plus and minus
that<00:00:39.300> way<00:00:39.420> there's<00:00:39.629> no<00:00:39.690> mistakes<00:00:40.230> things

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
that way there's no mistakes things

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.639 
that way there's no mistakes things
being<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> backwards<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.440> has<00:00:43.620> been

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
being put in backwards this has been

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.610 
being put in backwards this has been
glued<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> clear<00:00:44.700> piece<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.170> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
glued to the clear piece that way that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.490 
glued to the clear piece that way that
doesn't<00:00:46.920> end<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.129> moving<00:00:47.280> around<00:00:48.289> we've<00:00:49.289> got

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
doesn't end up moving around we've got

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
doesn't end up moving around we've got
the<00:00:49.649> wires<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.840> they're<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.020> bit

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the wires and they're a little bit

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
the wires and they're a little bit
longer<00:00:52.289> than<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.620> needed<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.489> I'd

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
longer than they needed to be but I'd

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.410 
longer than they needed to be but I'd
rather<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.239> long<00:00:55.039> that<00:00:56.039> way<00:00:56.270> they<00:00:57.270> can

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
rather have them long that way they can

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.549 
rather have them long that way they can
be<00:00:57.539> adjusted<00:00:58.129> I've<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.340> two<00:00:59.609> in<00:01:00.050> 35<00:01:01.050> magnets

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
be adjusted I've got two in 35 magnets

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.260 
be adjusted I've got two in 35 magnets
on<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:03.049> believe<00:01:04.049> their<00:01:04.799> eighth<00:01:05.280> inch<00:01:06.710> so

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
on there I believe their eighth inch so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
on there I believe their eighth inch so
on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> sides<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> head<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.500> went<00:01:11.100> ahead

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
on the sides of the head I went ahead

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.130 
on the sides of the head I went ahead
and<00:01:11.729> went<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.240> route<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> sides<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> head

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
and went that route so sides of the head

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.390 
and went that route so sides of the head
same<00:01:16.140> thing<00:01:16.439> eighth<00:01:17.189> inch<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:18.350> 35<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> let's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
same thing eighth inch in 35 so let's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.200 
same thing eighth inch in 35 so let's
slap<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.939> bad<00:01:24.180> boy<00:01:24.360> together

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.960 

I<00:01:31.960> have<00:01:32.380> smaller<00:01:32.680> magnets<00:01:33.190> but<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.430> decided<00:01:33.850> to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
I have smaller magnets but I decided to

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:43.550 
I have smaller magnets but I decided to
go<00:01:34.150> with<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:35.170> larger<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:39.510> there's<00:01:40.510> no

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.550 

problems<00:01:44.560> with<00:01:44.940> wiggle<00:01:45.940> room<00:01:46.119> or<00:01:46.509> it's<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:47.350> L

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
problems with wiggle room or it's so L

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.680 
problems with wiggle room or it's so L
pretty<00:01:47.860> much<00:01:48.040> snap<00:01:48.430> right<00:01:48.820> right<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:49.570> the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
pretty much snap right right in the

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.350 
pretty much snap right right in the
place<00:01:49.900> where<00:01:49.930> it's<00:01:50.229> supposed<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.090> we've

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
place where it's supposed to so we've

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.210 
place where it's supposed to so we've
got<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:52.780> one<00:01:52.990> we're<00:01:53.710> going<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.890> put<00:01:54.009> this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
got that one we're going to put this

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:04.180 
got that one we're going to put this
side<00:01:54.490> on

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.340 

now<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.970> haven't<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.360> haven't<00:02:05.690> moved<00:02:06.080> him<00:02:06.290> or

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
now I haven't I haven't moved him or

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.040 
now I haven't I haven't moved him or
anything<00:02:06.620> but<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.890> can<00:02:07.040> see<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:08.510> these

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
anything but you can see now this these

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.420 
anything but you can see now this these
wires<00:02:09.350> are<00:02:09.500> going<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.770> get<00:02:09.860> attached<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.280> the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
wires are going to get attached to the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.690 
wires are going to get attached to the
LED<00:02:10.790> that's<00:02:11.000> going<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.240> get<00:02:11.300> mounted<00:02:11.480> up<00:02:11.720> here

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
LED that's going to get mounted up here

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.660 
LED that's going to get mounted up here
but<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:14.000> can<00:02:14.210> see<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:15.130> how<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.160> wiring

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
but you can see in there how the wiring

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:29.840 
but you can see in there how the wiring
is<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.910> then

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:41.180 

tuck<00:02:30.480> those<00:02:30.630> out<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.050> way

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.860 

see<00:02:41.790> i<00:02:41.820> might<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.030> took<00:02:42.420> him<00:02:42.570> off<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
see i might just took him off to the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.890 
see i might just took him off to the
side<00:02:43.110> here<00:02:46.070> just<00:02:47.070> need<00:02:47.400> him<00:02:47.520> out<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.780> way

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
side here just need him out of the way

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.890 
side here just need him out of the way
move

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.899 

and<00:02:53.900> here's<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.379> back<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.860> head<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.580> this

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
and here's the back of the head now this

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.789 
and here's the back of the head now this
actually<00:02:56.150> solves<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.930> problem<00:02:56.959> for<00:02:57.530> me<00:02:57.560> because

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
actually solves a problem for me because

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.460 
actually solves a problem for me because
I<00:02:58.340> wasn't<00:02:59.030> too<00:02:59.150> keen<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.480> having<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:02.140> pull<00:03:03.140> this

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
I wasn't too keen on having to pull this

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.649 
I wasn't too keen on having to pull this
portion<00:03:03.920> off<00:03:04.159> anytime<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.120> would<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
portion off anytime that you would the

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.839 
portion off anytime that you would the
lights<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.049> in<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.379> head<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.769> having<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.579> pull

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
lights on in the head of having to pull

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.289 
lights on in the head of having to pull
that<00:03:08.000> off<00:03:08.060> flip<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.930> switch<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.950> idea<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:11.000> in

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
that off flip the switch the idea so in

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.660 
that off flip the switch the idea so in
the<00:03:11.540> long<00:03:11.720> run<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.409> actually<00:03:12.680> fix<00:03:13.519> that

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
the long run this actually fix that

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.759 
the long run this actually fix that
problem<00:03:13.819> for<00:03:14.180> me<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:16.400> there's<00:03:16.579> that<00:03:16.670> together

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
problem for me so there's that together

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:25.059 
problem for me so there's that together
I've<00:03:18.769> got<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:23.720> main<00:03:23.930> power<00:03:24.140> thing<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.739> just

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
I've got the the main power thing I just

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.720 
I've got the the main power thing I just
snipped<00:03:25.370> off<00:03:25.549> all<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.000> LEDs<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:28.549> just

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
snipped off all the LEDs and I just

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.300 
snipped off all the LEDs and I just
attached<00:03:29.090> magnets<00:03:29.629> to<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.590> ends<00:03:30.859> here<00:03:31.069> to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
attached magnets to the the ends here to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.490 
attached magnets to the the ends here to
the<00:03:31.430> positive<00:03:31.609> negative<00:03:32.200> I've<00:03:33.200> got<00:03:33.379> this

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
the positive negative I've got this

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.949 
the positive negative I've got this
label<00:03:33.889> positive<00:03:34.609> on<00:03:35.510> here<00:03:36.190> though<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.810> way

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
label positive on here though the way

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.930 
label positive on here though the way
it's<00:03:39.109> going<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.349> end<00:03:39.409> up<00:03:39.500> doing<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:40.220> if<00:03:40.489> I<00:03:40.609> try

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
it's going to end up doing is if I try

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.690 
it's going to end up doing is if I try
and<00:03:42.190> let's<00:03:43.190> say<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:44.480> goes<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.780> side<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.700> think

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
and let's say it goes that side I think

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.099 
and let's say it goes that side I think
the<00:03:46.790> way<00:03:46.909> I'm<00:03:47.060> going<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.299> end<00:03:47.480> up<00:03:47.569> routing<00:03:47.989> it

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
the way I'm going to end up routing it

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.710 
the way I'm going to end up routing it
is<00:03:48.349> all<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.150> positives<00:03:50.150> going<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.450> go<00:03:50.540> down

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
is all the positives going to go down

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.190 
is all the positives going to go down
the<00:03:50.840> right<00:03:51.019> side<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.760> just<00:03:53.180> like<00:03:53.629> one

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
the right side and just like one

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.259 
the right side and just like one
continuous<00:03:54.379> loop<00:03:54.950> except<00:03:55.400> for<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:56.030> legs

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
continuous loop except for in the legs

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.689 
continuous loop except for in the legs
if<00:03:57.169> i<00:03:57.349> play<00:03:57.530> lights<00:03:57.859> in<00:03:58.010> there<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.430> those<00:03:58.549> are

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
if i play lights in there and those are

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.099 
if i play lights in there and those are
about<00:03:59.000> going<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.359> be<00:03:59.419> on<00:03:59.510> separate<00:03:59.870> things

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
about going to be on separate things

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.659 
about going to be on separate things
just<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.680> case<00:04:00.859> something's<00:04:01.220> up<00:04:01.370> happening

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
just in case something's up happening

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.020 
just in case something's up happening
with<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:01.970> wiring<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.419> it<00:04:03.049> breaks<00:04:03.319> or<00:04:03.650> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
with the wiring and it breaks or the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.420 
with the wiring and it breaks or the
something<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.889> because<00:04:06.889> if<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.280> have

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
something like that because if you have

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.369 
something like that because if you have
a<00:04:07.459> break<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.030> circuit<00:04:08.389> it's<00:04:08.959> going<00:04:09.349> to

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
a break in the circuit it's going to

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.879 
a break in the circuit it's going to
knock<00:04:10.010> out<00:04:10.190> all<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.669> lights<00:04:10.879> so<00:04:11.870> somewhere<00:04:12.829> in

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
knock out all the lights so somewhere in

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.860 
knock out all the lights so somewhere in
there<00:04:13.250> there'll<00:04:13.609> be<00:04:13.639> a<00:04:13.790> central<00:04:14.239> hub<00:04:16.180> but<00:04:17.180> for

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
there there'll be a central hub but for

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:28.480 
there there'll be a central hub but for
this<00:04:18.019> okay<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:18.500> we<00:04:18.769> got<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.099> baton<00:04:23.919> tada

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.260 

now<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.569> camera<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:31.669> camera<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.060> going<00:04:32.090> to

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
now the camera the camera is going to

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.510 
now the camera the camera is going to
pick<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.479> up<00:04:32.599> a<00:04:32.720> lot<00:04:33.020> brighter<00:04:33.259> it's<00:04:34.160> picking

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
pick it up a lot brighter it's picking

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.800 
pick it up a lot brighter it's picking
up<00:04:34.610> all<00:04:34.819> the<00:04:34.970> glow<00:04:35.150> through<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.419> head<00:04:35.660> and

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
up all the glow through the head and

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.460 
up all the glow through the head and
everything<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:37.400> lot<00:04:37.940> brighter<00:04:38.180> than<00:04:38.479> it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.200 

actually<00:04:42.470> looks<00:04:42.860> in<00:04:43.009> person<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.849> think

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
actually looks in person but I think

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.930 
actually looks in person but I think
that<00:04:47.240> looks<00:04:47.539> pretty<00:04:48.319> badass<00:04:51.340> no<00:04:52.340> flickering

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
that looks pretty badass no flickering

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.689 
that looks pretty badass no flickering
know<00:04:53.449> anything<00:04:55.539> i<00:04:56.889> could<00:04:57.889> probably<00:04:58.400> get<00:04:58.639> away

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
know anything i could probably get away

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.899 
know anything i could probably get away
with<00:04:58.880> just<00:04:59.240> that<00:04:59.509> in<00:05:00.349> there<00:05:00.680> but<00:05:03.130> i'm<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.370> you

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
with just that in there but i'm a you

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.300 
with just that in there but i'm a you
know<00:05:05.030> looking<00:05:05.419> at<00:05:05.569> it<00:05:05.889> well<00:05:06.889> let's<00:05:07.039> see<00:05:07.159> here

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
know looking at it well let's see here

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:21.959 
know looking at it well let's see here
where's<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.789> fresh<00:05:10.449> I'll<00:05:11.449> be<00:05:11.599> older

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.049 

let's<00:05:22.599> test<00:05:23.139> this<00:05:23.349> out<00:05:23.559> here<00:05:23.829> we're<00:05:24.189> a<00:05:24.549> step

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:25.059 
let's test this out here we're a step

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:41.380 
let's test this out here we're a step
back<00:05:25.360> here's<00:05:25.749> the<00:05:25.869> front

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.220 

there's<00:05:42.050> a<00:05:42.140> rough<00:05:42.500> it<00:05:42.770> together

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.710 

yeah<00:05:46.830> doesn't<00:05:47.490> look<00:05:47.700> bad

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.020 

you<00:05:52.260> know<00:05:52.380> for<00:05:52.770> some<00:05:53.040> reason<00:05:53.070> in<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.640> camera

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
you know for some reason in the camera

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.120 
you know for some reason in the camera
like<00:05:54.570> he<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:54.780> so<00:05:55.230> show<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.560> like<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.950> heads

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
like he is so show it like the heads

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.690 
like he is so show it like the heads
glowing<00:05:56.490> but<00:05:56.670> looking<00:05:56.940> at<00:05:57.090> in<00:05:57.330> person<00:05:58.700> it's

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
glowing but looking at in person it's

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.810 
glowing but looking at in person it's
not<00:06:00.150> that<00:06:00.210> bad<00:06:03.770> you<00:06:04.770> know<00:06:04.890> i<00:06:05.100> may<00:06:05.370> leave<00:06:05.550> that

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
not that bad you know i may leave that

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.480 
not that bad you know i may leave that
as<00:06:06.000> is<00:06:06.380> for<00:06:07.380> right<00:06:07.590> now<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:08.040> just<00:06:09.830> tea<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.340> one

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
as is for right now and just tea the one

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.890 
as is for right now and just tea the one
thing<00:06:11.670> looking<00:06:12.000> at<00:06:12.120> straight<00:06:12.420> on<00:06:12.570> that<00:06:12.750> I

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
thing looking at straight on that I

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.630 
thing looking at straight on that I
notice<00:06:13.260> is<00:06:15.830> like<00:06:16.830> this<00:06:17.340> one<00:06:17.750> shows<00:06:18.750> through

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
notice is like this one shows through

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.160 
notice is like this one shows through
it's<00:06:20.640> because<00:06:20.790> the<00:06:21.090> way<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.390> diode<00:06:21.720> is<00:06:21.960> in

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
it's because the way the diode is in

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.470 
it's because the way the diode is in
there<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:23.070> LED<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.730> showing<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.300> little

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
there the the LED is showing a little

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.990 
there the the LED is showing a little
bit<00:06:24.750> more<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.110> one<00:06:25.290> side<00:06:25.320> but<00:06:26.100> that's<00:06:26.670> okay

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
bit more to one side but that's okay

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.930 
bit more to one side but that's okay
because<00:06:27.030> I'm<00:06:27.480> getting<00:06:27.810> great<00:06:28.260> great<00:06:28.830> view<00:06:29.070> on

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
because I'm getting great great view on

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:38.519
