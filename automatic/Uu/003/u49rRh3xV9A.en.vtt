accessory pack in September of 2014 and
may<00:01:43.570> change<00:01:43.870> ever<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.380> slightly<00:01:44.680> as<00:01:44.980> I<00:01:45.580> guess

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
may change ever so slightly as I guess

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.340

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
so the nursery item came with two beds

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.740 
so the nursery item came with two beds
because<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.040> original<00:01:51.490> family<00:01:51.700> came<00:01:52.480> with

one thing about this double bed is that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.240 
one thing about this double bed is that

and<00:05:24.970> I<00:05:25.900> do<00:05:25.960> think<00:05:26.350> that<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.560> furniture<00:05:27.010> really

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
and I do think that the furniture really

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.110 
and I do think that the furniture really
makes<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.640> difference

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
makes the difference

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.750 
makes the difference
so<00:05:28.210> we<00:05:28.360> purchased<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.960> hundred<00:05:29.410> dollar
