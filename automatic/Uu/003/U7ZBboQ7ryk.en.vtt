00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.140
 bike and with some doubts and I 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.239
 I'm trying to put it is there for you. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.210
 to get some questions with some 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.239
 details that were missing there will 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.350

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.730

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.290

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.510
 here's a rubber 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.510
 a bicycle camera rubber here 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.829
 your space in a pure 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.780
 in the can here and binds both sides to 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:44.020
 sale 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.409
 and pass the bike here, here 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.800
 but a hole here but the future here a 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.820
 right bead string 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.620
 This string here he goes. 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.159
 passing the bike here 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.429
 passes through the wheel hub 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.429
 through the wheel hub and it goes up 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.340
 Do you live on your paw? 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.340
 O 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.370
 this part here 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.220
 who to be more inside 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.030
 because otherwise it comes out and it comes out 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.170
 out like that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.170

 I have a little bit of blue 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.340
 It's more or less like the ox cars . 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.340
