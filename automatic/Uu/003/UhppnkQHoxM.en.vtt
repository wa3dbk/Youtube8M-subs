00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
flinch when here we're looking at the

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.430 
flinch when here we're looking at the
weapons<00:00:36.340> were<00:00:36.489> in<00:00:36.670> this<00:00:36.790> video<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:38.200> here's<00:00:38.410> a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
weapons were in this video so here's a

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.460 
weapons were in this video so here's a
comparison<00:00:38.590> with<00:00:39.190> them<00:00:39.309> without<00:00:39.400> focus

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.980 

you<00:00:42.980> can<00:00:43.160> see<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.850> soy<00:00:44.030> starts<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.510> kick<00:00:44.660> in<00:00:44.690> on

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
you can see the soy starts to kick in on

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.020 
you can see the soy starts to kick in on
the<00:00:45.740> right-hand<00:00:46.160> side<00:00:46.220> it's<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.580> lot<00:00:46.820> larger

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
the right-hand side it's a lot larger

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.700 
the right-hand side it's a lot larger
than<00:00:47.330> with<00:00:47.660> focus

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.709 

alright<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.790> next<00:00:52.940> thing<00:00:53.090> we<00:00:53.270> can<00:00:53.420> do<00:00:53.540> is

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
alright the next thing we can do is

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.619 
alright the next thing we can do is
position<00:00:54.559> your<00:00:54.890> character<00:00:55.309> is<00:00:55.430> in<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.510> if

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
position your character is in so if

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.689 
position your character is in so if
you're<00:00:56.750> standing<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:57.350> got<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:57.829> large<00:00:58.370> mass

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
you're standing it's got a large mass

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.970 
you're standing it's got a large mass
way<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.750> you're<00:00:59.870> crouching<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.379> has<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.530> bit

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
way and you're crouching that has a bit

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.920 
way and you're crouching that has a bit
less<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:01.399> as<00:01:01.519> you<00:01:01.940> can<00:01:02.120> see<00:01:02.149> here<00:01:02.540> when<00:01:02.809> you're

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
less and as you can see here when you're

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.649 
less and as you can see here when you're
prone<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.559> almost<00:01:03.980> non-existent<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:04.850> way<00:01:05.030> so

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
prone is almost non-existent this way so

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.350 
prone is almost non-existent this way so
the<00:01:05.840> position<00:01:06.320> your<00:01:06.470> characters<00:01:06.890> in<00:01:07.009> is<00:01:07.190> a<00:01:07.580> big

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
the position your characters in is a big

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.430 
the position your characters in is a big
factor<00:01:08.659> here

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.460 

okay<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.370> final<00:01:12.700> technique<00:01:13.300> is<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.870> zoom

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
okay and the final technique is to zoom

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.470 
okay and the final technique is to zoom
in<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:14.800> out<00:01:14.920> as<00:01:15.190> i<00:01:15.820> showed<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.000> earlier<00:01:16.180> in

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
in and out as i showed you earlier in

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.960 
in and out as i showed you earlier in
the<00:01:16.570> video<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.770> waste<00:01:17.920> kicks<00:01:18.250> in<00:01:18.430> about<00:01:18.760> a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
the video to waste kicks in about a

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.420 
the video to waste kicks in about a
second<00:01:19.390> or<00:01:19.450> two<00:01:19.510> into<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.260> so<00:01:20.830> we<00:01:20.950> can<00:01:21.100> do<00:01:21.280> is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
second or two into it so we can do is

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.150 
second or two into it so we can do is
zoom<00:01:21.910> in<00:01:22.090> zoom<00:01:22.210> out<00:01:22.480> quickly<00:01:22.750> zooming<00:01:23.320> zoom

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
zoom in zoom out quickly zooming zoom

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.040 
zoom in zoom out quickly zooming zoom
out<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.330> then<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.600> stops<00:01:25.930> the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
out and so on and then that stops the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.380 
out and so on and then that stops the
sway<00:01:26.260> from<00:01:26.290> appearing<00:01:26.980> you<00:01:27.850> can<00:01:27.970> see<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.210> works

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
sway from appearing you can see it works

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.140 
sway from appearing you can see it works
here<00:01:28.630> on<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:29.290> rifle

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
here on the rifle

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.720 
here on the rifle
what<00:01:31.810> works<00:01:32.230> with<00:01:32.410> every<00:01:32.650> weapon<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.130> every

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
what works with every weapon and every

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.690 
what works with every weapon and every
attachment<00:01:33.970> as<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.690> can<00:01:34.780> see<00:01:34.930> here<00:01:35.700> except

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
attachment as you can see here except

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.480 
attachment as you can see here except
for<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.910> sniper<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.680> sway<00:01:39.040> kicks<00:01:39.310> in

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
for the sniper the sway kicks in

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.080 
for the sniper the sway kicks in
immediately<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:42.100> can<00:01:42.220> see<00:01:42.370> here<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.850> way

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
immediately you can see here this way

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.090 
immediately you can see here this way
kicks<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.480> immediately<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:44.140> where<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:44.950> can

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
kicks in immediately so where you can

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.600 
kicks in immediately so where you can
have<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.310> do<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.640> zoom<00:01:46.300> out<00:01:46.450> straight<00:01:47.080> away

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
have to do is zoom out straight away

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.250 
have to do is zoom out straight away
alternatively<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.940> with<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.480> sniper<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.080> can

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
alternatively as with a sniper you can

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.430 
alternatively as with a sniper you can
hold<00:01:50.470> your<00:01:50.620> breath<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.720> can<00:01:52.900> do<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.260> as

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
an alternative method and then their

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.220 
an alternative method and then their
works<00:01:56.800> just<00:01:57.040> as<00:01:57.190> well<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:58.540> guys<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.810> see<00:01:58.960> in<00:01:59.110> the
