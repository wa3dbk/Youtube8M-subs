00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
yeah anyway you know once again like in

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.960 
yeah anyway you know once again like in
the<00:02:21.720> previous<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.950> fleece<00:02:23.190> uh<00:02:23.220> Bank<00:02:23.610> I

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the previous one it's a fleece uh Bank I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.970 
the previous one it's a fleece uh Bank I
imagine<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.140> fleece<00:02:25.380> uh<00:02:25.410> banks<00:02:25.860> would

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
imagine like the fleece uh banks would

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.979 
imagine like the fleece uh banks would
be<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.490> more<00:02:26.760> smaller<00:02:27.470> heists<00:02:28.760> cuz<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.840> know

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
be the more smaller heists cuz you know

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.680 
be the more smaller heists cuz you know
you<00:02:31.020> got<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.920> stores<00:02:32.370> obviously<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.420> cannot

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
you got the stores obviously you cannot

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.390 
you got the stores obviously you cannot
really<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:35.280> example

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
really see that on here but for example

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.110 
really see that on here but for example
there's<00:02:36.030> one<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:38.280> imagine<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
there's one here and I imagine the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.970 
there's one here and I imagine the
fleece<00:02:39.360> uh<00:02:39.390> banks<00:02:39.989> would<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.650> another

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
fleece uh banks would be like another

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.050 
fleece uh banks would be like another
