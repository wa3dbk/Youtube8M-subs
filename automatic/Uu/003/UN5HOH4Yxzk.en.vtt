going to do is we're going to take a
really<00:00:17.010> really<00:00:17.400> simple<00:00:17.670> groove<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.380> we're

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
really really simple groove and we're

really really simple groove and we're
going<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.740> change<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.310> way<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.609> put<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
accent on the hi-hat to give the groove

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.580 
accent on the hi-hat to give the groove
a<00:00:23.580> different<00:00:23.970> feel<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.350> play

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a different feel so we're going to play

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
a different feel so we're going to play
there's<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.310> few<00:00:26.519> options<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> basic

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
there's a few options but the basic

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.540 
there's a few options but the basic
wouldn't<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:28.050> are<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.859> play<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.250> no

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
wouldn't really are to play with no

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.229 
wouldn't really are to play with no
accents<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:31.740> play<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.130> accents<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.059> beat

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
accents to play with accents on the beat

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.690 
accents to play with accents on the beat
to<00:00:33.750> give<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.620> groove<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.040> sense<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.489> urgency

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
to give the groove a sense of urgency

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.170 
to give the groove a sense of urgency
and<00:00:36.210> push<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.870> groove<00:00:37.140> forward<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.940> play

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and push that groove forward to play

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
and push that groove forward to play
with<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.750> accent<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.890> false<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
with an accent on to and false or the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.389 
with an accent on to and false or the
same<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> snare<00:00:42.360> drum<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.800> gives<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
same as the snare drum so that gives the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
same as the snare drum so that gives the
the<00:00:45.210> groove<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.629> little<00:00:45.660> bit<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> more

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the groove a little bit of a more

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
the groove a little bit of a more
laid-back<00:00:46.800> feel<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.700> maybe<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> ballad

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
laid-back feel so maybe kind of a ballad

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.260 
laid-back feel so maybe kind of a ballad
type<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.260> field<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> put<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> accent

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
type of field and then to put the accent

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.170 
type of field and then to put the accent
off<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.899> beat<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.520> which<00:00:53.520> gives<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> little

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
off the beat and which gives it a little

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
off the beat and which gives it a little
bit<00:00:54.360> more<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.780> funky<00:00:55.260> groove<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
bit more of a funky groove and then to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.860 
bit more of a funky groove and then to
just<00:00:57.149> simply<00:00:57.600> open<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.109> higher<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:59.600> 101<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
just simply open the higher on 101 and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.439 
just simply open the higher on 101 and
if<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.680> can't<00:01:01.890> mean<00:01:02.010> eight<00:01:02.160> thugs<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
if you can't mean eight thugs so one and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.039 
if you can't mean eight thugs so one and
two<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> three<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.650> four<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> which

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
two and three and four and one and which

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.010 
two and three and four and one and which
gives<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.250> funky<00:01:09.020> monk

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
gives it then a much more funky monk

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.870 
gives it then a much more funky monk
much<00:01:10.229> more<00:01:10.439> funky<00:01:10.830> feel<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
much more funky feel so I'm going to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.399 
much more funky feel so I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.540> those<00:01:12.659> ideas<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.260> on

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
demonstrate some of those ideas now on

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.219 
demonstrate some of those ideas now on
the<00:01:13.500> king<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.090> we're<00:01:15.090> using<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the king and we're using the the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.609 
the king and we're using the the
fantastic<00:01:16.880> pasty<00:01:17.880> symbol<00:01:18.210> over<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.630> which

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
fantastic pasty symbol over here which

00:01:19.619 --> 00:04:02.110 
fantastic pasty symbol over here which
you'll<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> hear<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> minute

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:11.430 

you

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.250 

you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.860 

okay<00:04:18.950> so<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.160> few<00:04:19.340> little<00:04:19.870> demonstrations

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
okay so a few little demonstrations

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.660 
okay so a few little demonstrations
there<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.560> I'm<00:04:21.680> hoping<00:04:21.920> you<00:04:22.160> can<00:04:22.310> see<00:04:22.520> the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
there and I'm hoping you can see the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.250 
there and I'm hoping you can see the
difference<00:04:23.060> between<00:04:23.180> just<00:04:23.630> changing<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.110> axe

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
difference between just changing the axe

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.090 
difference between just changing the axe
and<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.530> other<00:04:24.680> thing<00:04:24.800> that's<00:04:24.920> really

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
and the other thing that's really

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.370 
and the other thing that's really
changed<00:04:25.580> when<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.850> basic<00:04:26.390> groove<00:04:26.630> was<00:04:27.230> to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
changed when the basic groove was to

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.350 
changed when the basic groove was to
change<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.800> accent<00:04:28.190> part<00:04:28.400> up<00:04:28.820> on<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.180> higher

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
change the accent part up on the higher

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.380 
change the accent part up on the higher
over<00:04:29.690> here<00:04:29.900> now<00:04:30.170> to<00:04:30.620> give<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:30.920> that<00:04:31.090> edgy<00:04:32.090> feel

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
over here now to give it that edgy feel

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.900 
over here now to give it that edgy feel
give<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.260> more<00:04:33.410> laid-back<00:04:33.710> feel<00:04:34.220> make<00:04:34.760> it

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
give it a more laid-back feel make it

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.700 
give it a more laid-back feel make it
really<00:04:35.240> straight<00:04:35.600> or<00:04:35.840> give<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.320> more<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.560> a

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
really straight or give it more of a

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.800 
really straight or give it more of a
funky<00:04:37.160> feel<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.910> hopefully<00:04:38.390> next<00:04:38.540> time<00:04:38.630> you

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
funky feel so hopefully next time you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.540 
funky feel so hopefully next time you
sit<00:04:38.930> down<00:04:38.990> in<00:04:39.200> practice<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:40.070> can<00:04:40.190> check<00:04:40.430> out

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
sit down in practice you can check out

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.280
