00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
seeing a finished product that'll look

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.170 
seeing a finished product that'll look
it'll<00:03:37.739> look<00:03:37.919> a<00:03:38.069> lot<00:03:38.220> more<00:03:38.280> professional<00:03:39.030> but

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
it'll look a lot more professional but

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.289 
it'll look a lot more professional but
it'll<00:03:39.329> basically<00:03:39.480> be<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.290> same<00:03:40.530> thing<00:03:41.299> and

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
it'll basically be the same thing and

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.369 
it'll basically be the same thing and
those<00:03:42.510> are<00:03:42.540> probably<00:03:42.870> going<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.169> be<00:03:43.230> more

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
those are probably going to be more

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.020 
those are probably going to be more
expensive<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:44.010> haven't<00:03:44.280> decided<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.699> a<00:03:44.760> final

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
expensive I haven't decided on a final

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.629 
expensive I haven't decided on a final
price<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.910> thanks<00:03:47.910> for<00:03:48.000> watching<00:03:49.639> depending

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
price so thanks for watching depending

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.979 
price so thanks for watching depending
on<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.849> amount<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.150> time<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.569> takes<00:03:51.659> make

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
on the amount of time that it takes make

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.629 
on the amount of time that it takes make
you<00:03:52.139> think<00:03:52.379> means<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.799> price<00:03:52.980> might<00:03:53.220> jump<00:03:53.489> up

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
you think means the price might jump up

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.119 
you think means the price might jump up
from<00:03:53.669> 10-2<00:03:54.329> more<00:03:55.049> like<00:03:55.199> 15<00:03:55.620> just<00:03:55.919> for

from 10-2 more like 15 just for

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.390 
from 10-2 more like 15 just for
prototype<00:03:56.669> builds<00:03:57.269> will<00:03:58.230> see<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:59.069> price<00:03:59.250> will

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
prototype builds will see the price will

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.250 
prototype builds will see the price will
probably<00:03:59.430> jump<00:03:59.909> up<00:04:00.090> as<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.690> increasing

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
probably jump up as the increasing

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.259 
probably jump up as the increasing
quality<00:04:02.389> I'll<00:04:03.389> cap<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:03.810> out<00:04:03.900> probably<00:04:04.260> around

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
quality I'll cap it out probably around

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.939
