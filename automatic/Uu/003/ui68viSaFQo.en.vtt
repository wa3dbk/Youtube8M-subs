00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.150

in<00:01:39.850> all<00:01:39.970> sorts<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.390> random<00:01:40.660> directions<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:41.590> it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
in all sorts of random directions so it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.210 
in all sorts of random directions so it
effectively<00:01:42.580> CC's<00:01:43.330> them<00:01:43.630> until<00:01:44.440> they<00:01:44.650> can<00:01:44.890> get

effectively CC's them until they can get

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.510 
effectively CC's them until they can get
out<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.820> crowd<00:01:46.120> control<00:01:46.510> effect<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:48.400> I

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
out of the crowd control effect and I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.820 
out of the crowd control effect and I
look<00:01:48.670> pretty<00:01:48.880> silly<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:55.290> another<00:01:56.290> good<00:01:56.560> staff

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
look pretty silly to another good staff

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.500 
look pretty silly to another good staff
you<00:01:57.040> can<00:01:57.190> use<00:01:57.370> is<00:01:57.550> called<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.970> staff<00:01:58.270> of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
you can use is called the staff of

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.540 
you can use is called the staff of
etheric<00:01:58.960> walls<00:01:59.230> so<00:01:59.650> this<00:01:59.860> creates<00:02:00.220> pretty

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
etheric walls so this creates pretty

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.520 
etheric walls so this creates pretty
much<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.910> very<00:02:01.240> big<00:02:01.510> wall<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:01.990> front<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.380> you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
much a very big wall in front of you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.680

that<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:03.010> very<00:02:03.220> good<00:02:03.370> for<00:02:03.430> closing<00:02:04.390> out

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
that is very good for closing out

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.719 
that is very good for closing out
enemies<00:02:05.650> coming<00:02:05.979> towards<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.370> and<00:02:06.400> making

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.260 
them run around or maybe sealing off a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.960 
corridor so they can't get to you very
easily<00:02:10.650> so<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.860> lasts<00:02:12.070> for<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.310> while<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.790> to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
levitation so this is pretty cool since

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.670 
levitation so this is pretty cool since
it<00:02:25.480> basically<00:02:25.720> gives<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> power<00:02:26.560> to
