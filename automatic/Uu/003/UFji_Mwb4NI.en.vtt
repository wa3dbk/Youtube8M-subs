00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:10.130
 those videos that uploaded lately are 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.110

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.800

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.430

 day more and more and if you have any 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.770

 well not a freckle but a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.720
 implementing a game and I gladly dollars 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.060
 of gameplay so I think this has 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.140
