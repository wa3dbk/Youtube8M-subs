on<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.939> lashes<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.780> prime<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
on the lashes this will prime them and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.820 
on the lashes this will prime them and

mascara on and I'm just going through

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.090 
mascara on and I'm just going through
the<00:01:36.509> lashes<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.259> separates<00:01:37.770> them

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the lashes because this separates them

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429 
the lashes because this separates them
