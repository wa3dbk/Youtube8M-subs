plans<00:01:31.400> you<00:01:32.400> pay<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.909> only<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.509> SIM<00:01:33.840> card

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
plans you pay for only one SIM card

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
plans you pay for only one SIM card
insert<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> SIM<00:01:35.100> card<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.390> will
