in<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.959> short<00:00:04.140> segment<00:00:04.410> we're<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:04.799> to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
in this short segment we're going to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.349 
in this short segment we're going to
discuss<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.370> method<00:00:05.520> for<00:00:05.790> protecting<00:00:06.270> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
discuss a method for protecting the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.629 
discuss a method for protecting the

mount float switch when you use the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.709 
mount float switch when you use the
float<00:00:11.400> switch<00:00:11.429> mounted<00:00:12.030> high<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> chamber

float switch mounted high in a chamber

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.600 
float switch mounted high in a chamber
normally<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:13.980> by<00:00:14.130> mounting<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
normally you do so by mounting the

normally you do so by mounting the
switch<00:00:14.880> through<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> hole<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.170> lid<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.500> that

switch through a hole in the lid of that
chamber<00:00:16.890> like<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:21.439> this<00:00:22.439> keeps<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> wires<00:00:23.070> and

the appropriate seal in this case we

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.240 
the appropriate seal in this case we

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
would use PVC cement we then suggest

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.190 
would use PVC cement we then suggest
that<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.460> pack<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.940> pipe<00:02:01.120> with<00:02:01.510> silicone<00:02:02.020> or

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
that you pack the pipe with silicone or

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.800 
that you pack the pipe with silicone or
epoxy<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:03.250> prevent<00:02:03.580> condensation<00:02:03.820> or<00:02:04.630> other

liquids from ever getting inside by
doing<00:02:07.570> this<00:02:07.720> you've<00:02:07.990> effectively<00:02:08.440> extended

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
doing this you've effectively extended

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.460 
doing this you've effectively extended
the<00:02:09.250> switch<00:02:09.490> step<00:02:09.930> now<00:02:10.930> you<00:02:10.960> can<00:02:11.230> use<00:02:11.350> an

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
the switch step now you can use an

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.680 
the switch step now you can use an
appropriate<00:02:11.740> fitting<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.370> mount<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.760> pipe<00:02:12.970> to

appropriate fitting to mount the pipe to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.630 
appropriate fitting to mount the pipe to

because<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.390> switch<00:03:01.630> cutting<00:03:01.989> is

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
because the switch cutting is

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.130 
because the switch cutting is
automatically<00:03:02.709> outside<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.430> chamber
