the sheath is dogshit mixed with cheap

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.570 
the sheath is dogshit mixed with cheap
nylon<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.270> expected<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> blade<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.360> aa<00:01:24.540> 6<00:01:25.580> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
nylon as I expected the blade is aa 6 so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.330 
nylon as I expected the blade is aa 6 so
it<00:01:27.060> might<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.659> flexible<00:01:28.350> enough<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.740> withstand

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it might be flexible enough to withstand

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.510 
it might be flexible enough to withstand
some<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.540> without<00:01:31.110> breaking<00:01:33.799> but<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.100> highly

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
some use without breaking but I highly

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
some use without breaking but I highly
doubt<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.210> hold<00:01:36.390> an<00:01:36.600> edge<00:01:36.780> worth

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
doubt that it would hold an edge worth

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
doubt that it would hold an edge worth
the<00:01:37.350> shit<00:01:37.970> does<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> tanto<00:01:40.140> tip<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.430> can

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the shit does have a tanto tip so it can

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.200 
the shit does have a tanto tip so it can
probably<00:01:42.140> withstand<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:44.159> forward<00:01:44.880> aft

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
probably withstand the forward aft

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.149 
probably withstand the forward aft
pressure<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.970> penetrating<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.240> zombie<00:01:48.720> skull

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
pressure of penetrating the zombie skull

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.370 
pressure of penetrating the zombie skull
but<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> would<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.729> try<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.380> decapitation

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
but I would not try for decapitation

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.270 
but I would not try for decapitation
because<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> does<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> long<00:01:54.030> blade

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
because it does have a long blade

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
because it does have a long blade
