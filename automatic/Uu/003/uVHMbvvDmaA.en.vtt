00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.210
 here is a tutorial to learn knitting with elected circular according to 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.269
 the so-called magnifying glass putty method 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.469
 then the method of magic the other is a step that will allow to knit 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.689
 with circular v8 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:18.460
 knitwear the of diameter cables this year with a low number of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.909
 mails 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.910
 theoretically the particulars the beginnings of the double point 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.179
 for that to be part of the night 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.720
 if we go to circular flow we have a step that is very fast enough 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.910
 simple and allows to get rid of v8 2 points 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.820
 so we start with have been wrong in a classic way 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.560
 and then we put the stitches along the cable 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.430
 the calculator eg8 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.100
 and we will divide in two 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.050
 enamel why maintain as much right than left we can argue 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 16 so I'm going and he's going to kill one on each side 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.690
 the mark the demarcation 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.350
 this simon cable game 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.990
 to be able to go through the dams 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.990
 and I congratulate my father the losc 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.070
 I find myself with half the mails from one side to the other half of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.720
 the other 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.270
 as I was basically knitting what I want to do 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.010
 and connected 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.810
 the first is that I mounted 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 with the last to start to appeal 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.110
 so I'm going to dictate 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.250
 enamel 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.160
 he does not have the tip of the syrup they did not attach 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
 the end of the movie i will click on my first night 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.560
 and I told myself that the other needles 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 the long run at the start 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.100
 that's what I'm going to use this delegate for her 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.650
 my first rank 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.540
 I explained the g-8 in the first wave that I missed 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.280
 connect the target 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.680
 Nkunda 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.010
 barker to quantify and I start my first rank 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.390
 her first demonstration at the evenings she drew a little bit 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.390
 why the report advocates intervention 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.860
 so that's this harvest normally 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.860
 we invite you from 2010 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.030
 nothing complicated 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.030
 the operation knitting the first half 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.820
 and when I finish knitting the first half of the roll it must 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.649
 I knit the second 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.649
 in what I want to congratulate the cable 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.819
 along the mails then on the ten soldiers 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.939
 so here is the city of mails that I'm going to knit now and I do not know 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.069
 nothing of the basilica has slipped so let's remember 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.699
 mails I just knit and I use them 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 to knit 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.939
 second part of my role 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.129
 once I've finished it's a pity that we found 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.749
 quebec 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:03.980
 at the forefront 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.639
 who was trained 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.459
 while he might have missed worrying a ring markers for 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.639
 mark since the end of the big bridge knits with circular treble 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.149
 down the paws and I had none at hand 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.139
 so now I'm going to start second place so for that I want 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.519
 congratulate monte carlo along the hands and I knitted 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.379
 let it pass around the needles 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.200
 with age the type that attack me 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.449
 I will be a little too serious shot Iran 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.449
 and the fact that the second line is 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.799
 it's up to papeete for a second round 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.159
 always the same way 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.179
 so me what I like with this technique 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.219
 and that women avoid using v8 double tip did not do it 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.179
 manipulated fewer elected officials and at the same time 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.519
 so overall little faster 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.439
 and since I find it interesting also texas elite to invest in treble 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.589
 double point 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.379
 that's half the amount of material needed since with the churches 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.769
 circular 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.249
 it can be forbidden, as a circular church, 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.919
 It's high time that he double-pointed 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.459
 he signed a second rank 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
 in doubt guy 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 the management side montpelliÃ©rain 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.969
 so we started at cost price for us 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.340
 was a step it's still 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.560
 a country quite easy to achieve 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.620
 once we understand the method
