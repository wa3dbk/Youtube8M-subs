it's something that it wasn't enough to

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.060

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
or a snake she'll wait it'll crawl off

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.740 
or a snake she'll wait it'll crawl off
the<00:00:40.010> bacteria<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:40.820> her<00:00:40.940> mouth<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.329> actually<00:00:41.719> a

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
the bacteria in her mouth is actually a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.770 
the bacteria in her mouth is actually a
small<00:00:42.620> venom<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.190> very<00:00:43.609> light<00:00:43.879> venom<00:00:44.300> that

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
small venom a very light venom that

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.920 
small venom a very light venom that
eventually<00:00:45.170> will<00:00:45.559> cause<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:45.980> animal<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.489> die

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
eventually will cause the animal to die

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.270 
eventually will cause the animal to die
so<00:00:47.930> she'll<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:48.350> use<00:00:48.530> her<00:00:48.649> big<00:00:48.859> old<00:00:49.039> tongue

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
tongue to taste the ground and then

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.779 
tongue to taste the ground and then
chase<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.379> prey<00:01:00.620> down<00:01:00.829> sometimes<00:01:01.429> up<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:01.640> a

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
chase the prey down sometimes up to a

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.990 
chase the prey down sometimes up to a
quarter<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.239> half<00:01:02.420> mile<00:01:02.690> away<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.850> then

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000

of<00:01:26.060> 9lives<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.960> actually<00:01:27.680> feed<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:28.100> this

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
of 9lives and actually feed it to this

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.400 
of 9lives and actually feed it to this
monitor<00:01:28.700> well<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.210> could<00:01:29.510> but<00:01:30.200> it'd<00:01:30.290> be<00:01:30.380> very

bad<00:01:30.860> for<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.370> would<00:01:31.430> actually<00:01:31.760> cause<00:01:31.940> it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
bad for it it would actually cause it

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.240 
on them though so you have to keep their
nails<00:03:41.269> trimmed<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.380> sometime<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:43.040> fun

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
nails trimmed and that sometime is fun

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.370 
nails trimmed and that sometime is fun
to<00:03:43.370> try<00:03:43.610> if<00:03:43.670> you've<00:03:43.940> ever<00:03:44.090> tried<00:03:44.390> snipping<00:03:45.320> a

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
to try if you've ever tried snipping a

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.250 
to try if you've ever tried snipping a
4-foot<00:03:45.890> lizards<00:03:46.310> nails<00:03:46.640> it's<00:03:47.000> it's<00:03:47.720> no<00:03:47.989> fun

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
4-foot lizards nails it's it's no fun

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.840 
4-foot lizards nails it's it's no fun
it's<00:03:48.470> even<00:03:49.040> worse<00:03:49.190> than<00:03:49.370> doing<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.670> dog

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
it's even worse than doing a dog

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.830 
it's even worse than doing a dog
sometimes<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.860> I<00:03:52.640> think<00:03:53.239> that's<00:03:53.390> about<00:03:53.480> all<00:03:53.630> we

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
sometimes so I think that's about all we

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.930 
sometimes so I think that's about all we
have<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.140> say<00:03:54.290> about<00:03:54.410> shark<00:03:54.860> he's<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.670> pretty

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
have to say about shark he's a pretty

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.810 
have to say about shark he's a pretty
cool<00:03:56.180> little<00:03:56.299> critter<00:03:56.600> though
