behind<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.850> microphone<00:01:06.090> element<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.950> i've

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
behind the microphone element so i've

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.130 
behind the microphone element so i've
got<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:09.030> triple<00:01:09.540> layer<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:12.030> light<00:01:12.240> three<00:01:12.900> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
got a triple layer on the light three so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.960 
got a triple layer on the light three so
three<00:01:13.170> layers<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.770> light<00:01:13.950> i<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> red

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970

three layers of light i have the red
behind<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> microphone<00:01:15.659> using<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> ipad<00:01:17.189> i

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
behind the microphone using the ipad i

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
behind the microphone using the ipad i
just<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> catalyst<00:01:19.020> hundreds<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
just think of the catalyst hundreds of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.980 
just think of the catalyst hundreds of
thousands<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> ipad<00:01:20.820> backgrounds<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
thousands of ipad backgrounds that you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.649 
thousands of ipad backgrounds that you
could<00:01:22.170> use<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:23.250> swipe<00:01:23.580> behind<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.180> object<00:01:24.630> i

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
could use to swipe behind your object i

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.090 
could use to swipe behind your object i
mean<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.020> even<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.320> an<00:01:25.650> iphone

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
mean you can even use an iphone

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
mean you can even use an iphone
especially<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:26.729> using<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> macro<00:01:27.420> lens<00:01:27.630> i'm

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
especially for using a macro lens i'm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
especially for using a macro lens i'm
just<00:01:28.140> swiping<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.979> behind<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
just swiping in this behind the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.429 
just swiping in this behind the
microphone<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:32.030> i'm<00:01:33.030> also<00:01:33.240> using<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.990> de<00:01:34.110> vela

shutter<00:01:49.049> boss<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.860> lets<00:01:50.399> me<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.790> control

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
shutter boss which lets me have control

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.530 
shutter boss which lets me have control
over<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:52.590> self<00:01:53.220> timer<00:01:53.460> delay<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.390> really

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
over a self timer delay which I really

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.859 
over a self timer delay which I really
don't<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.759> for<00:01:56.759> setting<00:01:57.090> specific<00:01:58.009> and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
don't use but for setting specific and

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.700 
don't use but for setting specific and
time<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:02.000> have<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.360> shutter<00:02:03.659> set<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.290> example

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
time I have my shutter set for example

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.470 
time I have my shutter set for example
now<00:02:04.829> i'm<00:02:05.070> using<00:02:05.759> time<00:02:05.969> dilation

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
now i'm using time dilation

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.170 
now i'm using time dilation
and<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> more<00:02:07.580> opportunity<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.730> 13

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
and so I have a more opportunity at 13

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.050 
and so I have a more opportunity at 13
seconds<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.260> take<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:10.620> shot<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.250> i'm<00:02:11.820> actually

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
seconds to take my shot so i'm actually

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.280

getting<00:04:33.440> me<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> diffuse<00:04:34.960> stroboscopic<00:04:35.960> effect

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
getting me a diffuse stroboscopic effect

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.670 
getting me a diffuse stroboscopic effect
for<00:04:37.610> giving<00:04:38.510> like<00:04:38.660> moving<00:04:39.320> i'll<00:04:39.530> actually

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
for giving like moving i'll actually

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.160 
for giving like moving i'll actually
have<00:04:40.040> a<00:04:40.070> macro<00:04:40.610> object<00:04:41.210> on<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> string<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.020> I'll

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
have a macro object on a string and I'll

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.010 
have a macro object on a string and I'll
actually<00:04:42.320> do<00:04:42.560> stroboscopic<00:04:44.020> elimination

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
actually do stroboscopic elimination

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.960 
actually do stroboscopic elimination
which<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.380> doing<00:04:45.680> about<00:04:45.770> an<00:04:45.950> hour<00:04:46.130> ago<00:04:46.370> where

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
which is doing about an hour ago where

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.630 
which is doing about an hour ago where
I'll<00:04:47.120> actually<00:04:47.480> time<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.470> strobe<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.980> fire<00:04:49.280> at

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
I'll actually time the strobe to fire at

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.970 
I'll actually time the strobe to fire at
a<00:04:49.670> certain<00:04:49.940> sequence<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.960> interval<00:04:51.350> but<00:04:51.860> i'll

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
a certain sequence and interval but i'll

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.620 
a certain sequence and interval but i'll
have<00:04:52.130> an<00:04:52.220> object<00:04:52.610> swinging<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.270> in<00:04:53.510> the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
have an object swinging so in the

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.940 
have an object swinging so in the
picture<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.080> looks<00:04:54.260> like<00:04:54.440> there<00:04:54.590> are<00:04:54.620> multiple

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
picture it looks like there are multiple

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.940 
picture it looks like there are multiple
objects<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:58.010> possibilities<00:04:58.820> are<00:04:58.850> just

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
objects so the possibilities are just

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.750 
objects so the possibilities are just
phenomenally<00:05:00.950> endlessly<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.490> can<00:05:01.640> make

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
phenomenally endlessly you can make

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.580 
phenomenally endlessly you can make
hundreds<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.300> videos<00:05:02.450> about<00:05:03.020> lightbox

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
hundreds of videos about lightbox

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.740 
hundreds of videos about lightbox
photography<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.700> this<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.150> hardly<00:05:05.540> a
