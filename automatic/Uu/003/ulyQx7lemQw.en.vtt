a<00:00:28.019> fan<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.130> there<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> sort

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
a fan out there I think that it's sort

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.229 
a fan out there I think that it's sort
of<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.050> right<00:00:31.439> now<00:00:32.149> you<00:00:33.149> know

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
of like a right here right now you know

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
of like a right here right now you know
that<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.960> said<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.469> gotta<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that it just said we gotta do it this

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860 
that it just said we gotta do it this
year<00:00:35.219> or<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.360> know<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.750> we

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
year or you know you know what are we

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
year or you know you know what are we
playing<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.670> we<00:00:38.670> put<00:00:39.239> some<00:00:39.360> good<00:00:39.570> years<00:00:39.690> on

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
playing for we put some good years on

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.569 
playing for we put some good years on
the<00:00:39.960> field<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.469> think<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.950> stopped<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the field I think that we stopped a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940 
the field I think that we stopped a
progression<00:00:42.140> that<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> had<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> last<00:00:43.739> few

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
progression that we had the last few

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
progression that we had the last few
years<00:00:44.010> last<00:00:44.550> year<00:00:44.730> getting<00:00:44.969> halted<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
years last year getting halted in the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.369 
years last year getting halted in the
playoffs<00:00:46.550> early<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
playoffs early on but I think this is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.750 
playoffs early on but I think this is
the<00:00:49.500> year<00:00:49.590> we're<00:00:49.950> finally<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> top<00:00:50.610> will

the year we're finally the top will
Seattle<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.629> year<00:00:51.780> we're<00:00:51.930> finally

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
thoughts about what Steve could be but

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
thoughts about what Steve could be but
basically<00:02:06.299> until<00:02:06.689> Steve<00:02:06.960> took<00:02:07.170> over<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
basically until Steve took over that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.990 
basically until Steve took over that
team<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> don't<00:02:08.039> think<00:02:08.190> anybody<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.789> knew

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

that mystery thing I think we gathered
back<00:02:18.450> there<00:02:18.719> the<00:02:18.900> least<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.469> thing<00:02:19.650> we're

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
back there the least the one thing we're

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:20.929 
back there the least the one thing we're
not<00:02:19.950> going<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.189> have<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.489> lot<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.670> teams

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.349 
he's now playing for Oakland Ryan
Fitzpatrick<00:03:19.859> is<00:03:20.549> going<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.819> be<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.030> starting

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
Fitzpatrick is going to be the starting

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.119 
Fitzpatrick is going to be the starting
quarterback<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:22.019> Texans<00:03:22.500> which<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.859> think

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
quarterback the Texans which I think

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.719 
quarterback the Texans which I think
honestly<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> huge<00:03:24.359> step<00:03:25.290> backwards<00:03:25.729> you

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
honestly is a huge step backwards you

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.699 
honestly is a huge step backwards you
look<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.120> what<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.449> the<00:03:27.720> Houston<00:03:28.109> Texans<00:03:28.260> once

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
look at what the the Houston Texans once

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.699 
look at what the the Houston Texans once
were<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.310> don't<00:03:30.030> think<00:03:30.120> shabb<00:03:30.599> progressed<00:03:31.290> that

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
were I don't think shabb progressed that

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.319 
were I don't think shabb progressed that
much<00:03:32.040> as<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.310> quarterback<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.909> you<00:03:33.060> had<00:03:33.209> to

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
much as the quarterback that you had to

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.449 
much as the quarterback that you had to
let<00:03:33.510> him<00:03:33.689> go<00:03:33.919> honestly<00:03:34.919> I<00:03:34.979> think<00:03:35.069> there<00:03:35.310> was

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
let him go honestly I think there was

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.740 
let him go honestly I think there was
other<00:03:35.639> things<00:03:35.699> on<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.150> team's<00:03:36.389> they<00:03:36.569> could

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
other things on the team's they could

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.509 
other things on the team's they could
have<00:03:36.840> fixed<00:03:37.049> but<00:03:37.379> we<00:03:37.799> know<00:03:37.919> with<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.159> losing
