160<00:00:25.340> little<00:00:26.090> bit<00:00:26.180> of<00:00:26.270> redneck<00:00:26.660> engineering

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
160 little bit of redneck engineering

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.440 
160 little bit of redneck engineering
here<00:00:27.649> from<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:27.980> spring<00:00:28.520> and<00:00:28.669> throttle<00:00:29.060> cable

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
here from the spring and throttle cable

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.130 
here from the spring and throttle cable
works<00:00:30.410> like<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.710> champ<00:00:31.040> I'm<00:00:32.000> a<00:00:32.060> muffler<00:00:32.630> this

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
works like a champ I'm a muffler this

works like a champ I'm a muffler this
wasn't<00:00:33.440> designed<00:00:33.710> for<00:00:33.950> a<00:00:34.010> go-kart<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:34.670> the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
wasn't designed for a go-kart so the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.290 
wasn't designed for a go-kart so the
muffler<00:00:35.149> is<00:00:35.329> well<00:00:36.110> on<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.290> wrong<00:00:36.500> side<00:00:37.090> so<00:00:38.090> I'm

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
muffler is well on the wrong side so I'm

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.910 
muffler is well on the wrong side so I'm
gonna<00:00:38.450> do<00:00:38.630> a<00:00:38.660> little<00:00:38.809> redneck<00:00:39.289> engineering

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
gonna do a little redneck engineering

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.919 
gonna do a little redneck engineering

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.620 
choke there it won't run off full choke
it<00:01:24.710> will<00:01:24.799> run<00:01:25.009> like<00:01:25.040> on<00:01:25.399> partial<00:01:25.939> choke<00:01:26.270> but

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
it will run like on partial choke but

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.209 
it will run like on partial choke but
some<00:01:27.229> of<00:01:27.320> me<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.469> seems<00:01:27.619> we<00:01:27.680> got<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.799> fuel<00:01:28.009> pump

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
some of me it seems we got a fuel pump

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.389 
some of me it seems we got a fuel pump
on<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.579> Murray<00:01:29.509> couldn't<00:01:29.869> make<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.130> push<00:01:31.130> more

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
on it Murray couldn't make a push more

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.039 
on it Murray couldn't make a push more
worth<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.820> crap<00:01:32.180> but<00:01:32.450> they<00:01:32.570> could<00:01:32.719> sure<00:01:32.899> make

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
worth the crap but they could sure make

it's from 2000 it's a marine Explorer

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.580 
it's from 2000 it's a marine Explorer
series<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:43.610> yeah<00:01:43.759> I'd<00:01:43.939> start<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:44.810> wet

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
series so yeah I'd start it but it's wet

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.480 
series so yeah I'd start it but it's wet
and<00:01:45.619> starting<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:46.549> rain<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.789> little<00:01:47.000> bit<00:01:48.490> here's

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
and starting to rain a little bit here's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.560 
and starting to rain a little bit here's
the<00:01:49.780> other<00:01:50.780> go-kart<00:01:51.969> and<00:01:52.969> as<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.210> all<00:01:53.299> know<00:01:53.479> it
