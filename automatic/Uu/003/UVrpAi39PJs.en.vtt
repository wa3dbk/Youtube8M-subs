00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
nice and all the padding's nice but uh

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
nice and all the padding's nice but uh
it's<00:00:35.280> kind<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> heavy<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.809> feels<00:00:37.079> weird<00:00:37.320> at

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it's kind of heavy and it feels weird at

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.720 
it's kind of heavy and it feels weird at
first<00:00:38.239> but<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.290> comfortable<00:00:40.730> I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
first but it's it's really comfortable I

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940

about<00:00:49.309> $200<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.390> guess<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.230> between

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
about $200 to I guess it's in between

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.189 
about $200 to I guess it's in between
$300<00:00:53.190> somewhere<00:00:54.090> around<00:00:54.149> there

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.349 

I<00:00:58.230> liked<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.640> brother<00:00:59.850> liked<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:02.359> he

I liked it my brother liked it but he

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.960 
I liked it my brother liked it but he
said<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.660> times<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.320> kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> bugs<00:01:05.189> him<00:01:05.400> but

said at times it kind of bugs him but

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.039 
said at times it kind of bugs him but
then<00:01:06.180> he<00:01:06.590> has<00:01:07.590> those<00:01:07.799> days<00:01:08.040> where<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:09.299> you
