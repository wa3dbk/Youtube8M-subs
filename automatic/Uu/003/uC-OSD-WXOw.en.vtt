that adventure I ran into a problem with
getting<00:00:41.010> both<00:00:41.399> interfaces<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.660> work<00:00:43.050> at<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
getting both interfaces to work at the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.119 
getting both interfaces to work at the
same<00:00:43.980> time<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> needed<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> figure<00:00:46.980> out

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
why it's all daisy chained as far as

solid blue light good then your next

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.080 
solid blue light good then your next
phase<00:06:29.820> interface<00:06:30.820> you<00:06:31.180> turn<00:06:31.420> that<00:06:31.660> on<00:06:31.900> and

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
phase interface you turn that on and

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.240 
phase interface you turn that on and
once<00:06:34.090> at<00:06:34.630> blanks<00:06:35.290> and<00:06:35.470> you<00:06:35.560> got<00:06:35.740> a<00:06:35.770> solid<00:06:36.010> blue

as far as the number of interfaces you

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:49.240 
as far as the number of interfaces you
can<00:06:41.800> do<00:06:42.800> I<00:06:43.430> don't<00:06:43.640> know<00:06:44.320> go<00:06:45.320> find<00:06:45.500> out<00:06:46.780> I<00:06:48.250> think
