moves<00:00:27.759> that<00:00:27.970> compose<00:00:28.329> this<00:00:28.509> combination<00:00:29.140> but

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
moves that compose this combination but

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.019 
moves that compose this combination but
it's<00:00:29.380> going<00:00:29.529> to<00:00:29.619> be<00:00:29.770> all<00:00:29.950> about<00:00:30.279> circles

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
it's going to be all about circles

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.119 
it's going to be all about circles
Domenico<00:00:32.019> over<00:00:32.260> it<00:00:32.349> really<00:00:32.529> fast<00:00:32.830> you<00:00:33.010> guys

gonna try to combine everything is gonna

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.380 
gonna try to combine everything is gonna
be<00:00:37.720> a<00:00:37.750> circle<00:00:38.110> so<00:00:38.260> we're<00:00:38.410> going<00:00:38.530> for<00:00:38.860> our<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:40.120> big

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
be a circle so we're going for our a big

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.310 
be a circle so we're going for our a big
circle<00:00:40.870> I<00:00:41.190> broke<00:00:42.190> down<00:00:42.220> this<00:00:42.670> move<00:00:42.970> before<00:00:43.629> and

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
circle I broke down this move before and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.840 
circle I broke down this move before and
then<00:00:44.680> as<00:00:44.860> you<00:00:44.980> come<00:00:45.129> up<00:00:45.309> here<00:00:45.489> you<00:00:45.550> want<00:00:45.820> to

then as you come up here you want to

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.029 
then as you come up here you want to
bring<00:00:45.970> your<00:00:46.210> feet<00:00:46.390> together<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:47.080> then<00:00:47.920> are<00:00:48.010> we

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
gonna do a little circle and then hold

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.979 
gonna do a little circle and then hold
another<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:54.100> circle<00:00:54.610> so<00:00:54.879> it's<00:00:55.000> gonna<00:00:55.149> be<00:00:55.360> big

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
another just circle so it's gonna be big

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.650 
another just circle so it's gonna be big
hip<00:00:56.230> circle<00:00:56.680> small<00:00:57.250> hip<00:00:57.430> circle<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.420> chest

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
hip circle small hip circle and a chest

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.439 
hip circle small hip circle and a chest
circle<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.190> big<00:01:00.399> circle<00:01:00.789> takes<00:01:01.000> about<00:01:01.120> four

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
circle the big circle takes about four

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.439 
circle the big circle takes about four
counts<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:01.930> one<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.800> two<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.609> three<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:04.390> four

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
counts so one and two and three and four

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.800 
counts so one and two and three and four
five<00:01:05.490> six<00:01:06.490> you<00:01:06.670> will<00:01:06.729> be<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.000> small<00:01:07.270> circle

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
five six you will be the small circle

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.830 
five six you will be the small circle
five<00:01:08.259> six<00:01:09.250> now<00:01:09.490> drop<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.910> rme<00:01:10.300> so<00:01:10.479> you<00:01:10.570> put<00:01:10.750> the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
five six now drop the rme so you put the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.400 
five six now drop the rme so you put the
emphasis<00:01:10.990> on<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.440> chest<00:01:11.940> seven<00:01:12.940> eight<00:01:13.840> so

emphasis on the chest seven eight so

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.139 
emphasis on the chest seven eight so
I'll<00:01:14.500> do<00:01:14.649> that<00:01:14.679> a<00:01:14.860> little<00:01:15.009> bit<00:01:15.220> faster<00:01:15.640> five

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
I'll do that a little bit faster five

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.840 
I'll do that a little bit faster five
six<00:01:16.479> seven<00:01:16.869> eight<00:01:17.140> one<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.009> two<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.700> three

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850

eight okay

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.570 
eight okay
try<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.770> one<00:01:23.830> more<00:01:23.890> time<00:01:24.040> because<00:01:24.189> I<00:01:24.369> didn't

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
try that one more time because I didn't

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.730 
try that one more time because I didn't
isolate<00:01:25.090> my<00:01:25.750> chest<00:01:26.020> very<00:01:26.200> well<00:01:26.439> when<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.619> did

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
isolate my chest very well when I did

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.080 
isolate my chest very well when I did
the<00:01:26.890> small<00:01:27.070> circle<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:27.520> make<00:01:27.670> sure<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.880> really

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
the small circle so make sure you really

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.880 
the small circle so make sure you really
stop<00:01:28.390> your<00:01:28.570> chest<00:01:29.140> from<00:01:29.229> moving<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.740> your

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
stop your chest from moving to your

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.370 
stop your chest from moving to your
small<00:01:30.670> circle<00:01:31.030> with<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.210> hips<00:01:31.390> before<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.229> do

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
small circle with the hips before you do

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.190 
small circle with the hips before you do
your<00:01:32.500> chest<00:01:32.770> circle<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.280> again<00:01:33.579> one<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.780> two

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
your chest circle so again one and two

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.160 
your chest circle so again one and two
and<00:01:35.470> three<00:01:35.619> four<00:01:36.460> five<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.420> six<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.110> seven

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
and three four five and six and seven

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.510 
and three four five and six and seven
and<00:01:38.799> eight

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
and eight

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.550 
and eight
okay<00:01:39.909> it's<00:01:40.240> pretty<00:01:40.509> simple<00:01:40.900> just<00:01:41.200> kind<00:01:41.470> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
okay it's pretty simple just kind of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.319 
okay it's pretty simple just kind of
combining<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.369> circles<00:01:42.759> it's<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:42.970> really<00:01:43.180> good

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
combining the circles it's a really good

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.670 
combining the circles it's a really good
move<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.659> do<00:01:43.750> when<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.020> don't<00:01:44.200> have<00:01:44.409> really

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
move to do when you don't have really

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.170 
move to do when you don't have really
strong<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.189> beat<00:01:45.340> drums<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.909> have<00:01:46.060> to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
strong to beat drums that you have to

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.880 
strong to beat drums that you have to
feel<00:01:46.329> it<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:46.840> got<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> marking<00:01:47.409> with<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.560> hips

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
feel it you got a marking with the hips

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.010 
feel it you got a marking with the hips
but<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.700> music<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.149> nice<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.509> steady<00:01:49.720> and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
but the music is nice and steady and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.870 
but the music is nice and steady and
fast<00:01:50.259> as<00:01:50.530> well<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.920> fits<00:01:53.920> circles<00:01:54.610> usually

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
fast as well so fits circles usually

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.219 
fast as well so fits circles usually
tend<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.180> work<00:01:55.329> better<00:01:55.540> for<00:01:55.750> those<00:01:55.899> kind<00:01:56.170> of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
tend to work better for those kind of

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.960
