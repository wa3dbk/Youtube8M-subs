00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
especially if they have radiant heat now

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the cold season and come to life

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.850 
the cold season and come to life
obviously<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:18.140> they<00:01:19.140> hatch<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
obviously when they they hatch and the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.310 
obviously when they they hatch and the
way<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> most<00:01:21.720> important<00:01:22.290> thing

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
way they go but the most important thing

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.090 
way they go but the most important thing
is<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.580> about<00:01:23.820> them<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.100> right

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
is what do you do about them and right

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.310 
is what do you do about them and right
now<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> reason<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.490> warmth<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.320> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
now the reason for the warmth of the the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.700 
now the reason for the warmth of the the
sunshine<00:01:31.920> against<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.290> foundation<00:01:34.290> wall<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
sunshine against the foundation wall of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
sunshine against the foundation wall of
your<00:01:34.860> home<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:36.210> warmth<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:36.930> cases

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
your home the warmth in some cases

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.920 
your home the warmth in some cases
people<00:01:37.409> may<00:01:37.979> still<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.939> radiant<00:01:39.750> heat

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
people may still have the radiant heat

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
people may still have the radiant heat
on<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.560> cool<00:01:40.829> evening<00:01:41.070> depending<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.299> where

on in a cool evening depending on where
you're<00:01:42.540> located<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:44.549> time<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.030> year

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you're located and this time of the year

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.670 
you're located and this time of the year
is<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.659> come<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> life<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.320> i<00:01:46.470> made

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
is when they come to life as i made

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.210 
is when they come to life as i made
reference<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.869> also<00:01:48.869> along<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.680> this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
reference to and also along with this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.770 
reference to and also along with this
time<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.670> year<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:51.060> comes<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
time of the year what comes in a lot of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
time of the year what comes in a lot of
case<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.200> we've<00:01:52.380> certainly<00:01:52.710> had<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> lot<00:01:53.189> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
case then we've certainly had a lot of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.359 
case then we've certainly had a lot of
it<00:01:53.430> almost<00:01:54.299> everywhere<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.750> canada<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:56.340> year

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
it almost everywhere in canada this year

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.480 
it almost everywhere in canada this year
and<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.420> moisture<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> form<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.979> rain

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and that is moisture in the form of rain

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.800 
and that is moisture in the form of rain
so<00:02:00.240> rain<00:02:00.840> water<00:02:01.700> becomes<00:02:02.700> surface<00:02:03.509> water

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
so rain water becomes surface water

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.859 
so rain water becomes surface water
which<00:02:04.740> eventually<00:02:05.430> will<00:02:05.850> become<00:02:06.210> ground

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
which eventually will become ground

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.800 
which eventually will become ground
water<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.710> groundwater<00:02:08.539> running<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
water and groundwater running on the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.050 
water and groundwater running on the
hardpan<00:02:10.379> where<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:10.800> footings<00:02:11.220> are<00:02:11.400> located

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
hardpan where your footings are located

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.790 
hardpan where your footings are located
water<00:02:12.989> will<00:02:13.290> build<00:02:13.560> up

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
water will build up

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.610 
water will build up
against<00:02:13.980> those<00:02:14.190> puddings<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.900> push<00:02:15.900> water<00:02:16.260> in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
against those puddings and push water in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.550 
against those puddings and push water in
underneath<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.640> why<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.600> drainage

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
underneath that's why we have drainage

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.160 
underneath that's why we have drainage
systems<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.400> drainage<00:02:20.940> systems<00:02:21.420> are<00:02:21.840> very

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
systems so drainage systems are very

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.670 
systems so drainage systems are very
important<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.800> keep<00:02:23.190> cleaned<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.680> you've

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
important to keep cleaned and you've

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.860 
important to keep cleaned and you've
heard<00:02:25.860> me<00:02:26.010> say<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.250> many<00:02:26.430> many<00:02:26.520> times<00:02:26.870> every

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
heard me say it many many times every

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.390 
heard me say it many many times every
five<00:02:28.290> years<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:30.050> normally<00:02:31.050> often<00:02:31.950> enough<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
five years is normally often enough to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.220 
five years is normally often enough to
have<00:02:32.580> your<00:02:32.820> perimeter<00:02:33.240> drainage<00:02:33.570> cleaned<00:02:33.990> as

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
have your perimeter drainage cleaned as

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.320 
have your perimeter drainage cleaned as
long<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.800> don't<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> lot<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.550> residual

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
long as you don't have a lot of residual

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.900 
long as you don't have a lot of residual
that<00:02:36.990> requires<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.460> more<00:02:38.700> often

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
that requires you to do it more often

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.210 
that requires you to do it more often
possibly<00:02:39.540> every<00:02:39.720> three<00:02:40.020> years<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.070> can

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
possibly every three years but you can

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.400 
possibly every three years but you can
tell<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.670> by<00:02:41.910> using<00:02:42.150> professional<00:02:42.720> services

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
tell this by using professional services

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.180 
tell this by using professional services

of drain cleaning and having it done
properly<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.270> might<00:02:48.570> add<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:49.230> there's<00:02:49.620> a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
properly I might add because there's a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.520 
properly I might add because there's a
lot<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.270> unknown<00:02:51.270> names<00:02:51.600> out<00:02:51.900> there<00:02:51.930> doing
