car<00:00:23.220> commands<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.580> start<00:00:23.850> by<00:00:23.940> opening<00:00:24.000> this

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
car commands we start by opening this

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.460 
car commands we start by opening this
kit<00:00:24.600> we're<00:00:24.810> gonna<00:00:24.900> take<00:00:25.110> a<00:00:25.140> look<00:00:25.350> at<00:00:25.410> the

components and then Dez is gonna walk us

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.850 
components and then Dez is gonna walk us
through<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.930> each<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> components<00:00:28.680> do

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
through what each of the components do

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.890 
through what each of the components do
how<00:00:29.430> we<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:29.789> them<00:00:29.940> and<00:00:30.090> how<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.270> get<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.660> your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
how we use them and how we get this your

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.650 
how we use them and how we get this your

that goes off the back door can you show
us<00:00:49.380> how<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.739> works<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.309> shows<00:00:50.460> how<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> map

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
us how this works and shows how to map

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.549 
us how this works and shows how to map
this<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.210> ourselves<00:00:51.390> sure<00:00:51.750> sweet

this for ourselves sure sweet
so<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.860> nine<00:00:53.040> volt<00:00:53.250> adapter<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.820> does<00:00:53.940> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so this nine volt adapter what does this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.560 
so this nine volt adapter what does this
do<00:00:54.210> does<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.090> happen

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
do does this here actually if you happen

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.380 
do does this here actually if you happen

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
got power connected to the Power

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.849 
got power connected to the Power
Commander<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.319> units<00:01:22.619> ready

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
Commander we know that get units ready

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.580 
Commander we know that get units ready
to<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.130> next<00:01:23.969> step<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.359> we're<00:01:24.539> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.779> plug

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to go next step is we're going to plug

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
to go next step is we're going to plug
in<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:25.799> cd-rom<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.029> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.179> contain

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
in the cd-rom which is going to contain

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
in the cd-rom which is going to contain
all<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.899> maps<00:01:28.109> needed<00:01:28.529> to<00:01:28.889> be<00:01:29.009> able<00:01:29.099> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
all the maps needed to be able to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.269 
all the maps needed to be able to
download<00:01:29.639> and<00:01:30.149> then<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.499> USB<00:01:31.799> cable

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:32.279 
download and then this is the USB cable

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.219 
download and then this is the USB cable
and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.459> it<00:01:32.579> plugs<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.270> Power<00:01:33.630> Commander<00:01:33.869> up

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
and then it plugs the Power Commander up

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.359 
and then it plugs the Power Commander up
to<00:01:34.349> the<00:01:34.439> computer<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.069> can<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.310> that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to the computer so we can get that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.859 
to the computer so we can get that
information<00:01:35.549> from<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:36.090> computer<00:01:36.420> back<00:01:36.659> down

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
information from the computer back down

and<00:02:11.400> we're<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.850> be<00:02:11.970> doing<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.240> for<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> dyno

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and we're gonna be doing this for a dyno

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.380 
and we're gonna be doing this for a dyno
model<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> Dyna<00:02:13.890> Glide<00:02:14.070> models<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.330> you

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
don't and getting the maps okay but the

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.939 
don't and getting the maps okay but the
basic<00:05:06.389> process<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:07.080> same<00:05:07.110> correct

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
basic process is the same correct

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.290 
basic process is the same correct
okay<00:05:08.160> well<00:05:08.460> there's<00:05:08.639> you<00:05:08.880> made<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.150> look

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
okay well there's you made that look

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.480 
okay well there's you made that look
super<00:05:09.780> simple<00:05:10.169> so<00:05:10.590> basically<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:11.160> insert<00:05:11.460> a

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
super simple so basically you insert a

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.820 
super simple so basically you insert a
