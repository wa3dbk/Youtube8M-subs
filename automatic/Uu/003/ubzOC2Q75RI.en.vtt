you<00:03:07.630> drew<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.050> bottomless<00:03:08.560> afterwards<00:03:09.280> well

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
you drew the bottomless afterwards well

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.310 
you drew the bottomless afterwards well
now<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:09.940> can<00:03:10.120> spend<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.600> monster<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.080> top

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
now you can spend the monster to the top

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.420 
now you can spend the monster to the top
not<00:03:11.560> only<00:03:11.740> have<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:11.950> removed<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.370> threat

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
not only have you removed the threat

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.840 
not only have you removed the threat
from<00:03:12.700> their<00:03:12.910> field<00:03:13.150> but<00:03:13.930> you've<00:03:14.380> also<00:03:14.850> you've

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
from their field but you've also you've

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.490 
from their field but you've also you've
also<00:03:16.000> mitigated<00:03:16.630> their<00:03:16.720> draw<00:03:16.930> face<00:03:17.140> because

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
also mitigated their draw face because

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.960 
also mitigated their draw face because
they're<00:03:17.710> essentially<00:03:18.130> drawing<00:03:18.400> into<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> car

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
they're essentially drawing into a car

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.220 
they're essentially drawing into a car
that<00:03:19.000> they<00:03:19.210> already<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.720> any<00:03:19.900> way<00:03:20.050> in

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
that they already have any way in

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.470 
that they already have any way in
addition<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.160> have<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.610> out<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.240> card

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
addition you have the out to that card

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.970

like composed evac device so when I look
at<00:03:32.770> this<00:03:32.890> cards<00:03:33.340> dual<00:03:33.760> effects<00:03:34.210> I'm<00:03:34.390> like

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
at this cards dual effects I'm like

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.750 
at this cards dual effects I'm like
they're<00:03:35.170> both<00:03:35.380> fantastic<00:03:35.650> now<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.550> that's

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
they're both fantastic now this that's

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.550 
they're both fantastic now this that's
our<00:03:36.970> little<00:03:37.150> weak<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.870> know<00:03:37.990> it's<00:03:38.140> only<00:03:38.290> in

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
our little weak you know it's only in

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.880 
our little weak you know it's only in
the<00:03:38.740> you<00:03:39.280> know<00:03:39.310> roche<00:03:39.640> level<00:03:40.480> but<00:03:40.720> i<00:03:40.990> look<00:03:41.800> at

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
the you know roche level but i look at

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.620 
the you know roche level but i look at
this<00:03:42.010> car<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.370> i<00:03:42.400> think<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:43.150> know<00:03:43.180> with<00:03:43.480> two

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
this car and i think you know with two

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.780 
this car and i think you know with two
really<00:03:44.020> good<00:03:44.260> effects<00:03:44.860> like<00:03:45.070> that<00:03:45.310> i<00:03:45.340> think

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
really good effects like that i think

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.390 
really good effects like that i think
that<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.300> definitely<00:03:46.540> have<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.380> place<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.010> you

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that you definitely have a place and you

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.430 
that you definitely have a place and you

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
know this card isn't as situation was a

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.960 
know this card isn't as situation was a
car<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:50.740> Roche<00:03:50.920> because<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.370> not<00:03:51.490> like<00:03:51.760> one

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
car like Roche because it's not like one

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.940 
car like Roche because it's not like one
of<00:03:52.000> those<00:03:52.180> well<00:03:52.840> if<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.320> need<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.770> use<00:03:53.920> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
of those well if I need to use the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.290 
of those well if I need to use the
effect<00:03:54.400> i<00:03:54.550> can<00:03:54.580> do<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:54.940> i<00:03:54.970> mean<00:03:55.060> you're<00:03:55.209> not

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
bottom of every day and then you end up

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.080 
bottom of every day and then you end up
bouncing<00:04:05.830> like<00:04:06.010> their<00:04:06.310> Lobby<00:04:06.550> I<00:04:06.700> mean<00:04:06.910> do<00:04:07.000> you

bouncing like their Lobby I mean do you
know<00:04:07.180> how<00:04:07.209> ridiculous<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.080> you<00:04:08.350> just

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530

know how ridiculous that is you just
removed<00:04:08.800> basically<00:04:09.280> their<00:04:09.430> entire<00:04:09.760> bill<00:04:10.240> I

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
removed basically their entire bill I

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.930 
removed basically their entire bill I
mean<00:04:10.630> that's<00:04:10.720> that's<00:04:11.320> just<00:04:11.560> stupid<00:04:11.830> okay<00:04:12.700> um

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
mean that's that's just stupid okay um

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.150 
mean that's that's just stupid okay um
so<00:04:13.300> again<00:04:13.680> right<00:04:14.680> now<00:04:14.709> there<00:04:15.520> is<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:16.120> kind<00:04:16.540> of<00:04:16.660> a

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
so again right now there is a kind of a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.220 
so again right now there is a kind of a
shortage<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.340> power<00:04:18.609> outage<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.270> when

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
shortage of power outage on when

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.160 
shortage of power outage on when
monsters<00:04:20.680> good<00:04:21.430> level<00:04:22.270> for<00:04:22.450> when<00:04:22.600> monsters<00:04:22.930> me

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
monsters good level for when monsters me

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.900 
monsters good level for when monsters me
you<00:04:23.320> only<00:04:23.410> got<00:04:23.620> like<00:04:23.710> ten<00:04:23.980> list<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.760> most

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
you only got like ten list of the most

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.280 
you only got like ten list of the most
optimal<00:04:25.420> deck<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:25.780> would<00:04:25.930> throw<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.170> in

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
optimal deck that I would throw this in

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.740 
optimal deck that I would throw this in
right<00:04:26.500> now<00:04:26.800> would<00:04:27.460> probably<00:04:27.490> be<00:04:27.970> miss<00:04:28.510> Valley

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
right now would probably be miss Valley

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.850 
right now would probably be miss Valley
because<00:04:28.990> you've<00:04:29.200> got<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.500> mist<00:04:29.680> Valley

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
because you've got the mist Valley

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.980 
because you've got the mist Valley
Falcon<00:04:30.400> miss<00:04:30.729> Valley<00:04:30.970> soldier<00:04:31.479> and

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
Falcon miss Valley soldier and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.870 
Falcon miss Valley soldier and
last<00:04:32.140> fan<00:04:32.380> and<00:04:32.650> all<00:04:33.100> three<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.370> those<00:04:33.490> cards

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
last fan and all three of those cards

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.940 
last fan and all three of those cards
work<00:04:34.090> in<00:04:34.270> unison<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:35.920> know

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
work in unison and to like you know

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.820 
work in unison and to like you know
valley<00:04:36.310> control<00:04:36.850> but<00:04:37.810> outside<00:04:38.230> of<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.380> you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
valley control but outside of that you

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
valley control but outside of that you
know<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:38.980> really<00:04:39.220> don't<00:04:39.370> have<00:04:39.520> a<00:04:39.640> lot<00:04:39.730> of

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
know you really don't have a lot of
