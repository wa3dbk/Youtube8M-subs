00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
then I step out into this world and it

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.310 
then I step out into this world and it
just<00:00:45.280> opens<00:00:46.150> up<00:00:46.300> in<00:00:46.450> front<00:00:46.720> of<00:00:46.780> me<00:00:46.870> and<00:00:47.170> it's

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
just opens up in front of me and it's

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.760 
just opens up in front of me and it's
it's<00:00:47.680> beautiful<00:00:48.460> an<00:00:48.760> alien<00:00:49.150> it<00:00:49.540> huge<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:50.440> was

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
a sort of seminal moment for me and I

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.250

capture and reach something that was
core<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:01.060> the<00:01:01.210> game<00:01:01.390> at<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.230> beginning<00:01:02.560> was

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
core to the game at the beginning was

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.649 
core to the game at the beginning was
that<00:01:03.809> sense<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:05.080> wonder<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.000> exploration<00:01:09.659> we

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
that sense of wonder and exploration we

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.649 
that sense of wonder and exploration we
started<00:01:11.170> with<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.770> series<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.700> events<00:01:13.119> we'd

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
started with a series of events we'd

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.380 
started with a series of events we'd
basically<00:01:13.900> set<00:01:14.470> out<00:01:14.590> like<00:01:14.799> okay<00:01:15.189> from<00:01:16.150> this

came up with a whole new rig for how we
animate<00:02:23.210> faces<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.750> also<00:02:23.960> how<00:02:24.110> we<00:02:24.170> approach

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
animate faces and also how we approach

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.530 
animate faces and also how we approach
like<00:02:25.010> texturing<00:02:25.490> them<00:02:25.670> modeling<00:02:26.390> them

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
like texturing them modeling them

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.160 
like texturing them modeling them
everything<00:02:27.260> instead<00:02:27.800> put<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> lot<00:02:28.580> more<00:02:28.730> time

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
everything instead put a lot more time

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.850 
everything instead put a lot more time
difference<00:02:30.170> about<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> couple<00:02:30.590> million

tell a human story and that's going to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.250 
tell a human story and that's going to
require<00:02:36.650> us<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.070> invest<00:02:38.000> significantly<00:02:38.870> into

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.310 
the vision for what we had for this game
we<00:02:49.610> ended<00:02:49.850> up<00:02:49.940> cutting<00:02:50.209> almost<00:02:50.720> every<00:02:51.050> part<00:02:51.230> of
