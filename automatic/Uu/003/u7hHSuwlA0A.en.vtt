00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 trudeau occupies its current location 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 in the west of the island of montreal since 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 70 years old when it opens 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 1941 plus the environment of the airport 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.630
 was essentially agricultural over 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.960
 years of urbanization has gradually 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.660
 in circle and airport 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.640
 a third runway was built in 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.060
 1958 the configuration has not changed 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.949
 since the terminal was enlarged to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 repeatedly to face the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.050
 traffic growth 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 since 2000 more than 1.5 billion 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040
 dollars were invested in its 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.210
 modernization 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.559
 today montréal-trudeau welcomes 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.920
 some 13 million passengers 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.649
 annually the airfield 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
 is the heart of the airport 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 has three tracks in two parallel 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 and one is when each of the tracks 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.890
 can be used in one direction or 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.369
 in the other we say the tracks 24 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 at 06 according to the direction borrowed from 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.430
 even 10 or 28 for reasons 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.130
 aerodynamics the planes have to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.509
 take off and land facing the wines to 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.299
 montréal trudeau the prevailing winds 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 southwestern blast that's why the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.810
 most of the time planes take off and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.890
 land in the direction of the holy lake 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 louis on the tracks 24 the track 28 is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.930
 also used for takeoffs

 planes take off and land 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.659
 to the city the track 0.6 g is 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 privileged for landings and the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.149
 runway 0.6 for takeoffs 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.579
 pilots must apply 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.759
 arrival and departure procedures 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.159
 specific 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.720
 the pilot must first intercept the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.850
 final approach path to a 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.329
 distance of 5 to 10 nautical miles from

 runway threshold from 3000 feet 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.619
 he must maintain a descent angle 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.040
 3 degrees from the horizontal 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.210
 until landing 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.510
 electronic guidance instruments 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.040
 allows accurate alignment let's remember 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.500
 that planes have to land and 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.060
 take off in the wind this way they 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.190
 have less need of distance from 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.820
 ground roll to lift too 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.410
 mobilized for offsets there is 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.510
 no special procedure for 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.030
 propeller planes that in general 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.340
 read quickly to clear the way 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.470
 the jazz however must go up in 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.880
 straight line up to an altitude of 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.530
 3000 feet before tacking 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.240
 the airport must remain open 24 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.490
 hours a day but the activity is 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.170
 greatly reduced at night the big ones

 exception and special procedures 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.940
 applies in order to reduce the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.710
 noise 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.560
 from the montreal control tower 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.200
 trudeau nav canada manages air traffic 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.240
 local she assigns particular tracks 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.370
 and gives take-off instructions 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.590
 and landing 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.620
 another major component of the airport 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.940
 the terminal is composed of three sectors 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.100
 domestic and international 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.790
 cross-border transport for flights to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.520
 United States 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.800
 it has some 55

 parking bring the immense 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.930
 building covers an area of ​​more 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.080
 of 266 thousand square meters the equivalent 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.510
 of 40 football fields almost 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.430
 the entire terminal has been modernized 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.650
 or rebuilt in respect of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.390
 the environment for sale 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.150
 side city we find the same three 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.920
 sectors that on the air side here we are in 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.730
 the departures sector to the states 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.290
 United 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.120
 this one houses the counters of 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.220
 airlines terminals 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.390
 registration as well as a whole 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.300
 range of services 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.800
 there is also a similar sector 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.030
 for domestic departures and 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.680
 once registered 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.489
 passengers leave their luggage at 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.489
 point of deposit 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.150
 before being able to enter the areas 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.310
 regulated 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.310
 they must undergo a security check 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.370
 passengers to the states 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.579
 United States must also cross 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.919
 US customs in the shadows 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.530
 regulate passengers waiting to 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.120
 their flight have access to various services 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.650
 duty free shops restaurant boutique 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.199
 living room and so on 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.000
 inside passenger TV sets 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.450
 hence are isolated from the passengers 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.310
 arriving at their plane exit 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.250
 arriving passengers must borrow 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.930
 watertight corridors located on a mezzanine 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.630
 converge to the customs area 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.840
 Canadian by its size 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.940
 imposing and its design inspired the lobby 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.710
 Canadian Customs is the piece 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.270
 mistress of montreal trudeau airport 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.669
 once past the inspection line 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.300
 primary passengers proceeds to the 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:02.660
 baggage claim room then 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.100
 towards secondary customs and finally 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.740
 to the exit in public area 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.139
 the public hang- in located just in 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.750
 below the departures hall is the point 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.520
 meeting passengers arriving and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.849
 from their parents and friends who came 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.849
 to welcome 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.419
 on the city side we find the services of 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.180
 transport the parking lots the 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.449
 car rental companies and a hotel 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.530
 integrated into the terminal 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.810
 important efforts are currently 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.939
 made to improve access 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.979
 at the airport because the weather 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.830
 access is an important factor in 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.810
 competitiveness the establishment of a 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.180
 shuttle bus between the airport and 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.490
 the city ​​center will be powerless at all 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.490
 both for the airport and for 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.099
 montreal trudeau airport is part of 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.750
 of the Montreal frame since 1941 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.120
 and this essential infrastructure 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.580
 will remain at the service of Montrealers 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.580
 for still several decades to come
