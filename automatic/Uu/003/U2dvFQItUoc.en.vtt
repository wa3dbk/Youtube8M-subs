because<00:01:35.939> there's<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.869> things

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
because there's also a lot of things

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.210 
because there's also a lot of things
that<00:01:37.140> most<00:01:37.380> people<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:37.680> realize<00:01:37.890> about

that most people don't realize about
just<00:01:38.670> how<00:01:38.970> good<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.990> an<00:01:40.110> ally<00:01:40.259> Saudi<00:01:40.740> Arabia<00:01:41.189> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
just how good of an ally Saudi Arabia is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.030 
just how good of an ally Saudi Arabia is
in<00:01:41.759> many<00:01:42.210> ways<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.780> supported<00:01:43.259> us<00:01:43.380> time
