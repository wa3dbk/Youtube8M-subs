00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 very good to all guys and girls I know 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.700
 that we are in elgeta 5 and on this day 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.770
 so special I'm going to bring you the trick 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.950
 to be able to get to be able to reach 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.139
 AC 130 is the biggest airplane that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.230
 the gta 5 and well we have to go to the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 position that I just said and bring to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 a taxi now I will explain why you have to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 call the taxi good the 130 and how 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.449
 transport vehicles with the ballet 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.260
 emitting the inside a very beautiful thing 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 again I call the taxi and go to the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.769
 military base vale and metrix angelo because 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.000
 here already for the country and well then 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 I just have to call the taxi 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.649
 because thanks to him we are going to make a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.340
 book so that when we get into the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.230
 military base the police do not weigh us down 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 during a certain time that we go 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.800
 to take advantage to be able to get 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 links 130 we can also get 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.980
 other vehicles like the fighter like the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.660
 helicopter I hope in this video I'm going 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.890
 to teach how to get the cidh orients 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.270
 because to be more complicated the more 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.760
 heavy is slower and the one as is 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.410
 easy breaks good we have to was 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 hold the button and if we are of 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.740
 xbox or et of angle if we are of play 3 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.900
 to steal the taxi worth 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.400
 here you can see it stolen the taxi turned off the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.400
 radio because I do not like to have the radio 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.800
 lit 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.180
 or something like that I go out to be for 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.670
 to be able to concentrate but you can 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.920
 leave activated now we are running 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.170
 at the maximum speed that baltar is very 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.880
 important and we're going to press the button on 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.550
 e3 which is the horn button for 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.870
 activate the taxi driver missions what are we going 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.820
 to press now on the activate and we 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.270
 produces the book so that we do not get the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.770
 police with 1 time ramÃ³n now 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.510
 let's go through this part for the part 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.220
 on the left and we're going to have to 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.040
 follow this route so that it does not follow the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.550
 police now we turn off the emissions of 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.770
 taxi drivers and when crossing this door between 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.040
 activates them so we can do this one 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.180
 so the police and now we're going to 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.130
 pursue but it's going to be a little 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.950
 adopted is going to be a little bit 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.540
 does not know where we are that is why this is 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.619
 for the bug it's worth running now 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.890
 Running running running 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.090
 we have to get the oil in 30 and 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.590
 there we have got the character of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.140
 trejo because the one that is best given to 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.360
 bring these types of aircraft worth is the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.100
 what better is it to take airplanes the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.840
 but you can get what 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.690
 have with another because it is not 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 now we have to be very careful and 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.830
 go well since no tank 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.780
 throw nothing or that no car explode 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.670
 next to us because the engines are 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.040
 they break very easily and we do not 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.629
 lets fly well 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.390
 to rethink the trick so that 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.530
 boxes do not shoot us we must choose 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.920
 of everything we do not have to start 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.629
 talk 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 we have to wait until the last 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.890
 time to mislead the boxes is worth 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.380
 what's it gonna be 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.930
 Now we start flying and running 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.550
 we go down we go down so that those who do not 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.319
 they can give and once they call 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.370
 clueless to the palm 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.569
 we go running running 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.030
 Running running running 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.190
 running until the police good 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.440
 Well, no longer follow us 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.030
 Well now we are here once 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.580
 that we have already confused the police 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.430
 we landed it's worth because I'm going to show you 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.190
 how can we assemble our vehicles 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.200
 inside the 130 c and transport them 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.240
 where we want so let's go what 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.790
 first it's landing it's good to land 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.390
 a spacious site and now we're going to 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.400
 get 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.980
 I'm going to follow some vehicles for 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.350
 can upload them inside the can of the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.800
 130 well we have the mini golf this the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.620
 this call and the cross bike 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.960
 and a car first we are going to put the motorcycle 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.680
 we leave it in the little corner here to 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.680
 who goes a lot 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.670
 now let's leave the golf cart 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.630
 we can the truth is quite space 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.630
 let's get enough things 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.560
 now we put the golf cart here 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.230
 and now let's put 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.820
 the card this so good we will 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.410
 put in and let's go to the door 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.830
 reflection on how we can close the 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.650
 door a little bit a bit abrupt no 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.950
 well we put here as I can as 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.070
 you can see what I put wrong 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.020
 when turning on well and closing the door 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.580
 Well there is no problem and 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.489
 take off you have to create the ass for 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.340
 that the door so the door will 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.019
 closing 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.850
 so you always just have to 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.730
 push the door a little bit I went up 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.780
 here already some failure did not tilt well the 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.150
 airplane c-130 and I open the door and it 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.949
 I fall in the golf lane and he and the 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.410
 car but simply without anything else 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.110
 unfold that makes me very funny nothing 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.600
 more do what I do and what I do 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.600
 now I bow from the east and the 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.070
 Well, it will not escape and well, well 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.660
 it shows in which subscribed favorites 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.790
 moreover for more tricks for more things 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.190
 without forms and for more curiosities already 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.490
 you know father a like and see you later 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.490
 goodbye
