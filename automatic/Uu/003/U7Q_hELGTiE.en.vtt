son

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.370 
son
and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.240> thought<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:55.049> he's<00:01:55.170> got

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and I thought well that's what he's got

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.209 
and I thought well that's what he's got
he's<00:01:55.649> got<00:01:55.680> schizophrenia<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.049> when<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
he's got schizophrenia and so when it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.789 
he's got schizophrenia and so when it
was<00:01:59.460> probably<00:02:00.030> months<00:02:00.299> later<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:01.020> he<00:02:01.649> was

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
was probably months later that he was

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
was probably months later that he was
given<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.219> diagnosis<00:02:03.000> at<00:02:03.240> his<00:02:03.479> first

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
given a diagnosis at his first

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.990 
given a diagnosis at his first
hospitalization<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> great<00:02:07.439> relief

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
hospitalization it was a great relief

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
hospitalization it was a great relief
because<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.119> thought<00:02:09.330> oh<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.289> what<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
because I thought oh now I know what it

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.390 
because I thought oh now I know what it
is<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:12.270> fix<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
is I can fix it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.800 
is I can fix it
that<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.490> couldn't<00:02:15.080> but<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.170> thought<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> could
