 r 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.820
 how 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.810
 hello to everyone we are here with the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.760
 idiot in minecraft and today I'm going to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.300
 teach a trick how to blog or 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.310
 command blocks in Spanish that 's the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.210
 why do not I have these nudes here and 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.210
 this one that I just caught 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.300
 this only in the last snapshot before 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 everything in the not only in the last but 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.430
 it is in the venues not only of the 1 points and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.760
 1 is based on the new clear they put 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.330
 in 1.8 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.680
 what can you do that does not take away 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 no object and therefore 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.740
 it's like a text for objects and good 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.080
 this trick the once I have not seen 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.000
 from an English youtuber called simple 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.210
 art that has done it to do enough 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.210
 time and good I just decided 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.070
 do it and here you have it and good in 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.450
 zombie sequence that I killed 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.450
 So many people that you just see, it's 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 simply 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.500
 this a robot minecraft table book that 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 is the book and pen as this is a 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.150
 book and pen normal and current and as 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.810
 you see here the idea is that minecraft and 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.630
 table book and good detects one of these 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.440
 that has a page with is written and 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.860
 then the second page with 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 a good space here we have the page 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.540
 written here we have space and it makes 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.290
 an executive 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.670
 that supposes a zombie zombie with the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.500
 name of good then we have this the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.319
 when it detects that when it detects that 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.840
 I have written the space and then it is 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:59.470
 here he did it because he is here 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.960
 makes a success that creates a zombie and baby 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.470
 over there and then create the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.630
 villager this called robe and then when 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.700
 it detects that I put him to go mouth bhutto 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.700
 then kill said and then 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.260
 create a witch 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.290
 where was the first robe and then 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.750
 teleport the villager to take for 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.560
 sack let's squeeze 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.560
 and you are going to die 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.849
 x 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.999
 well the names I put them is a bit 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.999
 random 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:44.859
 and from here of the leeds manga 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:53.180
 of koji kabuto 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.780
 of maximum stress I beat because I 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.780
 bata is 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.859
 one of the creators of 10 none and then 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.859
 the jaguar more 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.670
 and we are 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.140
 and that's practically all in case it's not 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.030
 you have understood here I have an example 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.950
 simpler that is simply 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.950
 a zombie with the name of zombie 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.760
 and this that detects that when I have 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.009
 put zombie as it sends a more signal 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.990
 to the press release 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:37.289
 let's see it from this perspective 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.289
 so you can see how zombie lights up 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:48.229
 illuminated I remove the zombie des illuminated 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:53.509
 zombie illuminated not zombie is to illuminate and 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:56.599
 good this this idea of ​​doing that with 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.330
 that putting words here pass things 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:02.509
 It is also very good as a substitute for 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:07.990
 the dogs and you know this the ones that we 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.990
 you know this long command 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.290
 has links to 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.570
 to open and transport you and things 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.389
 so it's good substitute because you 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.490
 you get put here then you do that with a 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.710
 comparator go something and it is a thousand times more 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:29.380
 easy that a dog and good here had 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.030
 this to make a shinigami but I do not 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.370
 it went well it did not come out 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.150
 practically good there is a small 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.300
 gift for those of the ones who is 6 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.540
 you see everything done and here 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.990
 we have the edge and just friends link goes 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.990
 to die 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.169
 there we are 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.219
 with all the rage in the world 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.219
 dies dies 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.640
 what fun and good this has been all 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.450
 really very simple if you have any 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.450
 doubt in the comments 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:21.080
 and they liked that very much for 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:25.270
 favorites and good see you 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.270
