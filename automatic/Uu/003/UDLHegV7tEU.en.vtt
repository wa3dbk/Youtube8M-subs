mean<00:00:28.720> if<00:00:28.810> you<00:00:28.900> do<00:00:29.020> find<00:00:29.289> one<00:00:29.380> it's<00:00:29.680> just<00:00:29.830> the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
mean if you do find one it's just the

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.189 
mean if you do find one it's just the
rust<00:00:30.220> bucket<00:00:30.310> so<00:00:30.850> gotta<00:00:31.779> go<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.050> west

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
rust bucket so gotta go to the west

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.340 
rust bucket so gotta go to the west
coast<00:00:32.289> apply<00:00:32.739> one<00:00:32.949> so<00:00:33.129> we've<00:00:33.280> got<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.480> 2012

coast apply one so we've got the 2012

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.819 
coast apply one so we've got the 2012
here<00:00:35.710> it's<00:00:36.609> kind<00:00:36.819> of<00:00:36.850> like<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.059> bluegray<00:00:37.829> faster

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
here it's kind of like a bluegray faster

the<00:00:49.389> another<00:00:50.260> faster<00:00:50.769> than<00:00:50.920> ever<00:00:51.069> which<00:00:52.030> I

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
the another faster than ever which I

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.539

burners<00:01:01.329> I<00:01:02.459> thought<00:01:03.459> I<00:01:03.489> had<00:01:03.789> another<00:01:04.089> ones<00:01:04.360> but

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
burners I thought I had another ones but

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.010 
burners I thought I had another ones but
I<00:01:04.629> can't<00:01:05.199> find<00:01:05.409> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I can't find it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.060 
I can't find it
make<00:01:08.020> sure<00:01:08.260> I<00:01:08.320> didn't<00:01:08.590> lose<00:01:09.010> it<00:01:09.040> somewhere<00:01:11.070> no

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
make sure I didn't lose it somewhere no

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.040 
make sure I didn't lose it somewhere no
maybe<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.550> didn't<00:01:12.760> have<00:01:12.850> another<00:01:13.030> one<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.360> we'll

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
maybe I didn't have another one so we'll

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.070 
maybe I didn't have another one so we'll
go<00:01:14.140> ahead<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.380> crack<00:01:14.590> these<00:01:14.770> open<00:01:16.080> hacksaw

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
go ahead and crack these open hacksaw

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.150 
go ahead and crack these open hacksaw
crack<00:01:17.440> open<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.400> oldest<00:01:18.820> first<00:01:19.180> I<00:01:19.450> guess<00:01:20.160> and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
crack open the oldest first I guess and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.610 
crack open the oldest first I guess and
I<00:01:21.280> at<00:01:21.850> one<00:01:22.060> time<00:01:22.270> I<00:01:22.300> thought<00:01:22.780> these<00:01:23.050> castings

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
I at one time I thought these castings

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.610 
I at one time I thought these castings
are<00:01:23.740> exactly<00:01:24.190> like<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.550> 2002<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:26.380> they're

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
are exactly like the 2002 but they're

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.660 
are exactly like the 2002 but they're
not<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.380> mean<00:01:29.590> they're<00:01:29.710> similar<00:01:29.980> but

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
not there I mean they're similar but

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
not there I mean they're similar but
again<00:01:31.360> they<00:01:31.960> are<00:01:32.140> plastic<00:01:32.470> base<00:01:37.770> Datsun<00:01:38.770> 510

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
again they are plastic base Datsun 510

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.860 
again they are plastic base Datsun 510
but<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.710> see<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:43.210> casters<00:01:43.720> to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
but you can see these casters to

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.630 
but you can see these casters to
distance<00:01:44.350> they<00:01:44.440> look<00:01:44.470> like<00:01:44.800> them<00:01:44.950> but<00:01:45.340> they're

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
distance they look like them but they're

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.170 
distance they look like them but they're
totally<00:01:45.820> different<00:01:46.180> back<00:01:47.050> ends<00:01:47.320> different<00:01:47.860> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
totally different back ends different I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.850 
totally different back ends different I
mean<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.630> distance<00:01:49.900> kinda<00:01:50.320> but<00:01:50.470> even<00:01:50.740> though

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
mean the distance kinda but even though

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.500 
mean the distance kinda but even though
