decided to put I 20 on its own level

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.610 
decided to put I 20 on its own level
just<00:00:08.970> because<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.750> big<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.349> beast

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620

just because it's that big of a beast
you'll<00:00:11.160> recognize<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.880> as<00:00:11.969> being<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.330> first

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
you'll recognize it as being the first

you'll recognize it as being the first
level<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.590> go<00:00:13.740> through<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.099> order<00:00:14.309> to

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
jump and it was still really difficult

with<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.640> level<00:00:30.060> than<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> probably<00:00:30.750> did<00:00:31.080> in

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
with this level than you probably did in

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.880 
with this level than you probably did in
real<00:00:31.710> life<00:00:32.329> as<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.050> from<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.680> of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
real life as you can see from all of

real life as you can see from all of
these<00:00:35.010> attempts<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.790> am<00:00:36.090> having<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.690> issues

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
these attempts I am having more issues

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
these attempts I am having more issues
with<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.500> level<00:00:37.920> than<00:00:38.160> Lindsay<00:00:38.489> Lohan<00:00:39.000> has

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
with this level than Lindsay Lohan has

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.260 
with this level than Lindsay Lohan has
with<00:00:39.510> life<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.070> no<00:00:41.520> stretch<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> the

with life and that is no stretch of the
imagination

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
imagination

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
imagination
I<00:00:43.320> probably<00:00:43.860> spent<00:00:44.340> about<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> solid<00:00:45.539> hour

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
I probably spent about a solid hour

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
I probably spent about a solid hour
trying<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.530> through<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
trying to get through this and the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
trying to get through this and the
biggest<00:00:48.719> obstacles<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.559> those<00:00:49.710> first<00:00:50.070> two

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
biggest obstacles are those first two

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.459 
biggest obstacles are those first two
jumps<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> need<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.809> through<00:00:52.170> where

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
jumps that you need to go through where

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.130 
jumps that you need to go through where
all<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.640> walls<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.030> lined<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.390> spikes<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
all the walls are lined with spikes you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
all the walls are lined with spikes you
need<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> fall<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.070> specific<00:00:56.780> sorry

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
need to fall in a very specific sorry

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.380 
need to fall in a very specific sorry
they're<00:00:57.960> specific<00:00:58.530> sequence<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> latch<00:01:00.180> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
they're specific sequence and latch on

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.160 
they're specific sequence and latch on
to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.660> wall<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> jump<00:01:01.469> across<00:01:03.080> when<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to the wall and jump across when you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
to the wall and jump across when you
first<00:01:04.409> look<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> level<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.610> doesn't<00:01:06.210> seem

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
first look at this level it doesn't seem

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
first look at this level it doesn't seem
like<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.860> big<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.490> obstacle<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.330> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
like it's that big of an obstacle but if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
like it's that big of an obstacle but if
you've<00:01:09.750> played<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.710> kid<00:01:10.979> levels<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.700> have

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you've played the kid levels or have

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.440 
you've played the kid levels or have
even<00:01:12.360> tried<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:14.060> let's<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.119> say<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
even tried this one let's just say you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.280 
even tried this one let's just say you
are<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> treat<00:01:17.210> it's<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.450> slaughterhouse

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
are in for a treat it's a slaughterhouse

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.440 
are in for a treat it's a slaughterhouse
on<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.920> level<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.700> other<00:01:20.939> thing<00:01:21.299> that's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
on this level the other thing that's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.230 
on this level the other thing that's
really<00:01:22.250> perhaps<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> most<00:01:23.580> frustrating

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
really perhaps the most frustrating

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
really perhaps the most frustrating
aspect<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.990> once<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.189> through<00:01:26.430> those

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
aspect is once you get through those

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
aspect is once you get through those
very<00:01:27.119> challenging<00:01:27.780> jumps<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
very challenging jumps you have the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.789 
very challenging jumps you have the
section<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> right<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:31.049> doesn't

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
section on the right and it doesn't

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.999 
section on the right and it doesn't
appear<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.780> frustrating<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.900> first

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
appear to be that frustrating at first

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
appear to be that frustrating at first
but<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.360> amped<00:01:36.869> up

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
but I don't know you get so amped up

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.560 
but I don't know you get so amped up
that<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.220> want<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.549> beat<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> level<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that you want to beat this level and you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.350 
that you want to beat this level and you
make<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.619> mistake<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.579> drives<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
make one mistake and it drives you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.469 
make one mistake and it drives you
absolutely<00:01:42.600> insane<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.100> actually<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> few

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
absolutely insane I actually have a few

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
absolutely insane I actually have a few
clips<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:46.369> pretty<00:01:47.369> fucking<00:01:47.640> funny<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
clips that are pretty fucking funny and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.469 
clips that are pretty fucking funny and
hindsight<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.970> I'll<00:01:50.970> move<00:01:51.240> on

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
hindsight to look at that I'll move on

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
hindsight to look at that I'll move on
to<00:01:51.689> before<00:01:52.079> showing<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.890> level<00:01:53.250> looks

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to before showing what this level looks

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.280 
to before showing what this level looks
like<00:01:53.610> completed<00:01:54.149> hope<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.750> enjoy<00:01:55.049> these

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290
