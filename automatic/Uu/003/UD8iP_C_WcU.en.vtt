several<00:02:33.410> different<00:02:33.799> bobby<00:02:33.950> pins<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
several different bobby pins in the

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.640 
several different bobby pins in the
front<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.060> also<00:02:35.480> holding<00:02:36.049> it<00:02:36.170> down<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
front and also holding it down so it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.350 
front and also holding it down so it
doesn't<00:02:36.890> get<00:02:36.950> like<00:02:37.160> pull<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.790> off<00:02:37.940> my<00:02:38.120> head

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
doesn't get like pull it off my head

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.539 
doesn't get like pull it off my head
which<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.140> don't<00:02:39.200> think<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.650> will<00:02:39.799> be<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.340> cap

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
which I don't think it will be the cap

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.300 
which I don't think it will be the cap
is<00:02:40.730> actually<00:02:40.940> pretty<00:02:41.530> secure<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.650> only<00:02:43.099> other

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
is actually pretty secure the only other

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.920 
is actually pretty secure the only other
downside<00:02:43.819> is<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.390> wanted<00:02:44.599> a<00:02:44.720> head

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
downside is that if you wanted a head

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.350 
downside is that if you wanted a head
full<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.260> purple<00:02:45.680> hair<00:02:45.829> five<00:02:46.549> types<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.060> hair
