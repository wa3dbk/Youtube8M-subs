a minute or two so the eggs can begin to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.550 
a minute or two so the eggs can begin to
be<00:01:38.340> absorbed<00:01:38.670> by<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> bread<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
be absorbed by the bread then if you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.160 
be absorbed by the bread then if you
have<00:01:40.770> time<00:01:41.069> turn<00:01:41.879> each<00:01:42.119> piece<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.599> bread<00:01:42.810> over

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
have time turn each piece of bread over

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.650 
have time turn each piece of bread over
so<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.920> mixture<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.940> be<00:01:45.000> absorbed<00:01:45.390> on

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
so that the mixture can be absorbed on

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:53.749 
so that the mixture can be absorbed on
the<00:01:45.780> other<00:01:45.989> side<00:01:46.379> so<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:48.179> this<00:01:52.310> now<00:01:53.310> we're

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the other side so like this now we're

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.330 
the other side so like this now we're
going<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:54.000> make<00:01:54.209> the<00:01:54.479> streusel<00:01:54.780> topping<00:01:55.340> we're
