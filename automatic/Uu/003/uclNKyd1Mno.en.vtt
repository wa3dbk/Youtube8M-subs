 this time we are like being a pirate galley 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.280
 What you love too is why I think 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.320
 that everyone can play and personal or 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.200
 different from these is to see is that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.640
 no ad this is the most goals thing 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.070
 cissé see why I'm recording 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.899
 for you because of what you are 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.420
 serginho leave and they are with is like 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.210
 talk to very light people then 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.670
 let's go to the kits galera is not a bar 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.560
 kit is not bar than tpb 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.880
 You have to go down here and 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.759
 choose your kit 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.040
 here are the ones that tell friel tvp archer 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.149
 then made a pro am and tank 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.530
 I think most of you already 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.619
 they know all the times that they are 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.759
 normal for most lgbt is the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.710
 here on the river that what you main that is 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.740
 the tv kit by the ready galley 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.479
 here I am with the kit pvp and guys I 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.570
 I'm with faith fuel texture only 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.310
 I changed here you just touched the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.650
 damage when you 're hitting the player 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.180
 What makes these stars is I'm with 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.290
 many stores the texture because 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.110
 in the old days 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.600
 on this channel on my random channel is 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.580
 I used this texture when I did not 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.170
 knew much texture scrambled and did not use 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.330
 many other textures 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.180
 so let's get the game is the first 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.030
 Back here, I've noticed people who have 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.010
 very little is light and serbian 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.230
 That's why I really liked the guys too. 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:34.850
 without denying the championship behind here it comes out 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.510
 out mama who is the victor 771 what 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.430
 started the lf tone probably ok have a 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.700
 tank for those who do not know is what 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.640
 it seems slow and only you stay 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.850
 Mature stronger with longer armor 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.739
 powerful 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:55.639
 people do not say what they see 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:57.260
 here again says grass is and enjoying 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.480
 the galera, we'll show you here 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.780
 It was there that on the side stands its status 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.720
 of the person you killed 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.090
 What did you die and your score and people? 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.520
 another good thing is that there are many arenas 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.250
 here we do not use these arenas to 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.470
 arena fist an fps 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.450
 but as soon as you enter I hope 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.890
 you begin to use but it is not because 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.660
 they better here is psf city ​​only 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.700
 No one uses it so let's get the kit. 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.530
 here again and play a little bit more 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.430
 do not show a little of the arena to 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.190
 you 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.500
 the staff thinks sponge that in some 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.620
 towers that you climb on it you already fly 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.750
 High or low on top is full of people. 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.790
 most of the time, nor is it the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.519
 Sometimes I'm good to see, too. 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:47.030
 When you fall in your kayak is 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:51.050
 you face fell is is a guy who was 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.069
 here is viper I do not know where we are going the other one 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.170
 Want to see more here? 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.690
 It's also a kit with the girl then 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.100
 different kit and guys will be more 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.630
 easy for you as well as tests when 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.459
 You come in, it serves us. 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.989
 play with me because now the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.959
 invitation then becomes much easier 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.600
 You 're seeing that I'm not in the brain. 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.549
 if it 's online then it's easier time 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.459
 when it will be okay that this came 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.109
 write hashtag already extinct to see 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.900
 together and you already know that it missed rhythm 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.180
 thing you already know our people did 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.789
 a slaughter that our fight now has 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.470
 more people came to me then people 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:30.180
 main arena did not want to talk to 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.850
 You guys sometimes give a bug if you 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.590
 not dying in 2050 ranking 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.750

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.190
 He has how he lets me see if he has 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.530
 such as the first person you have on 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.120
 ranking can earn vip then can 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.970
 be good that it involved an album 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.490
 Virtual tea or something like that to 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.840

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.080

 I'm going to die here, the galleys are fine. 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.400

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.319
 slightly to kick in the normal world to 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.729

 to try to solve guys is very good 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.729
 to train and soul pop not very good 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.680

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.819
 When will I skip while playing yet? 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.889

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.860
