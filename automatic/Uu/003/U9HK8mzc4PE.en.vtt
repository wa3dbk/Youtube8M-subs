 about internet browsers 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.389
 for android if they suddenly want a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.099
 different browser than the phone 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 brings by default phone brings this 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 maybe the browser which is very good 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.660
 we can also download get 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.939
 other browsers such as the the chrome 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 on this phone in my case came by 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.410
 defect also with the chrome I think that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.420
 is a very good browser also has 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.759
 many interesting features like 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.700
 synchronization with our team with 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.100
 our computer and functions of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.890
 several screens other browsers very 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 interesting that may suddenly 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 You download and try to interest on 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.300
 firefox and the opera and which do not know amen 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.340
 here in the play store how much do they weigh 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.340
 in a next video well I will do 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.329
 let's look we can give browsers 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.820
 internet browsers and here I 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.699
 they bleed several options can they 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.009
 teach what opera is the opera the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.890
 opera the firefox as you see it appears 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.560
 here is the chrome that I already have 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.289
 installed the and the firefox this would say I 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.180
 which are the two most famous browsers 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.610
 that there is today as a subject country 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.950
 operative android here we can progress 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.549
 to the opera here we can see that this 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.170
 browser weighs 15.11 megabytes a 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.330
 very interesting browser comes with a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.130
 function that calls all terrain which 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.679
 allows me to navigate in conditions of 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:39.140
 low internet connection in a way 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:41.479
 very fast is also the the chrome 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.390
 the chrome also almost everything we know 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.520
 and a browser that is in the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.110
 currently surpassing internet explorer 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.600
 this browser weighs 26 megabytes this already 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.880
 I have it installed it is very friendly 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.680
 also as I told you you can 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.020
 synchronize with our browser 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.369
 house so not all the favorites that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.070
 we have in the computer of the house not 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.990
 meet on our cell phone and all the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.630
 information as formulas formulas 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.280
 you can also synchronize another 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.300
 browser that I recommend using in 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.790
 the power fox the firefox is a lounge a 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.830
 browser that is very used by the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.709
 people who know about browsers by 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.800
 engineers by systems engineers is 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.140
 a very versatile browser is a 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.070
 free code browser is a 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 browser that of having had more than more 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.500
 recognition would soon have surpassed 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.030
 because in fact in a great very good what 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.290
 I used all my life on my pc 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.970
 I started using firefox and chrome other 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.680
 browser that could soon install 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.049
 to find it would be 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.409
 of these that are here what could 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.160
 recommend to see which one comes out here as 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.990
 I remember I used 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.000

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.730
 browsers to download and 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.270
