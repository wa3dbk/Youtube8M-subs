on<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.709> I've<00:02:49.920> done<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.730> see

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
on it which I've done and you can see

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.820 
on it which I've done and you can see
demos<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.720> my<00:02:54.810> how<00:02:55.110> their<00:02:55.290> video<00:02:55.620> is

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
demos of that in my how their video is

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.660 
demos of that in my how their video is
here's<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.130> quick<00:02:56.400> look<00:02:56.610> at<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:58.430> loads<00:02:59.430> it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
here's a quick look at that loads it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.540 
here's a quick look at that loads it
quite<00:03:00.300> good<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.780> runs<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.200> smoothly<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
quite good it runs a smoothly and

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.090 
quite good it runs a smoothly and
everything<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.540> also<00:03:04.230> run<00:03:04.530> Google<00:03:04.920> Maps

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
everything so I also run Google Maps

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.759 
everything so I also run Google Maps
which<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.580> also<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> phone<00:03:06.360> right<00:03:06.540> now

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.410 

some<00:03:10.769> disadvantages<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:11.940> phone<00:03:12.269> are

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
some disadvantages to this phone are

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.030 
some disadvantages to this phone are
probably<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.959> front<00:03:16.319> screens<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.769> little<00:03:16.950> too

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
probably the front screens a little too

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.600 
probably the front screens a little too
small<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:18.630> doesn't<00:03:18.840> look<00:03:18.870> very<00:03:18.989> good

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
small and it just doesn't look very good

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.910 
small and it just doesn't look very good
but<00:03:20.610> advantages<00:03:21.480> are<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.989> hackable<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.799> put

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
but advantages are it is hackable to put

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.630 
but advantages are it is hackable to put
