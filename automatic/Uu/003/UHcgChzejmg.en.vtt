because we're going to use this to help
hold<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.170> while<00:02:20.890> we<00:02:21.130> skin<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.900> flip<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.930> over

this way do the same and we're going to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.500 
this way do the same and we're going to
keep<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.310> attached<00:02:27.670> because<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.180> feels<00:02:28.360> like

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
keep it attached because this feels like

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.930 
keep it attached because this feels like
the<00:02:28.630> fishes<00:02:29.050> hold<00:02:29.260> now<00:02:29.410> instead<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.700> pushed<00:02:30.700> it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the fishes hold now instead of pushed it

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.560 
the fishes hold now instead of pushed it
down<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.400> board<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.120> then

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
down on the on the on the board and then

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.210 
down on the on the on the board and then
would<00:02:34.750> if<00:02:35.170> it's<00:02:35.350> pushed<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.740> board<00:02:36.040> then

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
would if it's pushed on the board then

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.740 
would if it's pushed on the board then
you're<00:02:36.310> not<00:02:36.460> going<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.700> get<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.940> accurate<00:02:37.270> cut

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you're not going to get the accurate cut

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.500 
you're not going to get the accurate cut
so<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.320> want<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.590> keep<00:02:38.710> that<00:02:39.150> slab<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> meat

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so you want to keep that slab a meat

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.690 
so you want to keep that slab a meat
onto<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> side<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.280> gives<00:02:42.640> it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
onto the side so that it gives it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.000 
onto the side so that it gives it
support<00:02:43.210> now<00:02:44.110> do<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.380> same<00:02:44.530> thing<00:02:44.740> over<00:02:44.860> here

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
support now do the same thing over here

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.220 
support now do the same thing over here
cut<00:02:45.490> over<00:02:45.790> here<00:02:47.100> nice<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.310> high<00:02:48.430> up<00:02:49.080> cut<00:02:50.080> this

cut over here nice and high up cut this
down<00:02:50.440> over<00:02:50.740> here<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.340> get<00:02:51.520> started<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.340> start

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
down over here to get started and start

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.380 
down over here to get started and start
filleting<00:02:55.170> along<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.320> dorsal

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.610 

and<00:03:02.990> as<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:04.160> fillet<00:03:04.490> this<00:03:04.870> let<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.990> just<00:03:06.140> glide

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
and as you fillet this let it just glide

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.990 
and as you fillet this let it just glide
over<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:09.160> spinal<00:03:10.160> column<00:03:10.580> just<00:03:11.150> let<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.420> glide

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
over the spinal column just let it glide

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.300 
over the spinal column just let it glide
it'll<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.180> come<00:03:14.390> right<00:03:14.600> off<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.130> how

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
it'll just come right off this is how

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.550 
it'll just come right off this is how
you're<00:03:16.520> basically<00:03:17.360> playing<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.110> deboning

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
you're basically playing it and deboning

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.760 
you're basically playing it and deboning
at<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.950> same<00:03:19.160> time

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.760 

nice<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.640> precision<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.390> then<00:03:27.260> turn<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.680> back

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
nice and precision and then turn it back

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.430 
nice and precision and then turn it back
around<00:03:27.950> like<00:03:28.340> this

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:56.000 

get<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> same<00:03:34.800> down<00:03:35.010> over<00:03:35.280> here

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
and you have another slab of meat now

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.850 
and you have another slab of meat now
what<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.730> have<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.940> fish<00:04:01.300> here<00:04:01.600> with<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.560> meat

hanging<00:04:03.100> down<00:04:03.370> both<00:04:03.610> sides<00:04:05.340> put<00:04:06.340> one<00:04:06.550> side

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
hanging down both sides put one side

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.650 
hanging down both sides put one side
together<00:04:07.030> again<00:04:08.220> flip<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.250> over<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:13.450> is

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
together again flip it over and this is

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.910 
together again flip it over and this is
how<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.810> start<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:15.299> play<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.450> off<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:17.019> its<00:04:17.200> or
