00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.650
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.050
 how to make these hooks that we can 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.640
 do very easily with what they are 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.009
 the clips 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.020
 and they will help us to put it on the 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.330
 clothes well of the barbies to hang it 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.250
 or they can also serve to 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.099
 put them on our badges of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.109
 baby shower like here to this or else 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.780
 we can put it also to these 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.510
 distinctive that are for children in this 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.550
 part and good look here we would have 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.550
 with which to hang them 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.280
 Well so let's start 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.280
 see how they are made 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.750
 As I mentioned, we will need clips 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.260
 preferably of these so that 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.820
 our little hooks are big 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.409
 to place what will be the clothes of 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.010
 the barbies or for our 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.010
 distinctive 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.960
 and it is already his choice of these 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.810
 colors or from those that come in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.820
 silver color good then we go then 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.380
 to start doing it we're also going to 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.930
 need our clamps for it 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.150
 well we will start then 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.000
 first opening our climate a bit 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.530
 well and this part where you have the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.700

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.299
 let's do it up 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 and this one a little bit like that after 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.090
 here we are going to unfold this point and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.049
 now we are going to cut approximately 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.049
 like a centimeter 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.350
 well this is the bit that we have to 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.869
 remove 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.960
 and now it's just a matter of doing 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.729
 this part down and this part 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.020
 let's fold it up with the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.000
 tweezers 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.539
 to give what is the form to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.539
