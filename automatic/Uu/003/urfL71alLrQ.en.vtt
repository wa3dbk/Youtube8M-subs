00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.340
 The campaign is supported by the Mospilanu producer - Sumi Agro Poland 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.100
 In 2013, Sumi Agro Poland 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.920
 initiated the educational campaign. We build a population of pollinating insects 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.680
 This is a continuation carried out since 2006 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.900
 campaign "Plant protection safe for bees" 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.840
 As part of the new action, a special publication was issued 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.480
 and training was organized across the country 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.580
 which were very popular. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.900
 One of the lecturers was Dr. Dariusz Teper from the Department of Plant Pollination, Beekeeping Department of the Institute of Horticulture in PuÅ‚awy 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.760
 The original benefit of joining the action 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.900
 it was possible to get one of thousands of nesting houses of garden masonry 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.880
 containing 50 cocoons of this useful insect. 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.520
 It could be obtained after completing the form 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.300
 contained in promotional packaging of Mospilan 20 SP 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.720
 and on a specially created website. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.980
 60 boxes with 3 thousand cocoons were sent to selected farms. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.980
 Such a number of masonry allows pollination of 1 ha of apple orchard or rape plantation. 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.240
 After a few weeks the masonry gnawed out of the cocoons. 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.920
 Over the next weeks, they worked intensively on the plantation, collecting pollen 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 and bearing it to the nest home, 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 and at the same time pollinating our crops. 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.640
 In mid-May the bee mason has already been sitting on the reed tubes, 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.000
 lays eggs and holes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.260
 a new generation of pollinating insects will bite out of cocoons in the spring of next year. 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.920
 Remember that correct pollination allows you to obtain higher and better quality crops. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.140
 Therefore, let's build a population of pollinating insects! 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.480
 We use safe insecticides. 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.000
 We wish you a good season and high yields
