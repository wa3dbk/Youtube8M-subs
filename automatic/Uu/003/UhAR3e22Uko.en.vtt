 this time it 's a top 5 video on 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.820
 newspaper where I'll show you the five 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.779
 most relevant news of the first day 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.250
 nutrition number 25 is about what is 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.230
 responsible for where the older 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.690
 services created within the jailbreak 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.500
 together with chair installous closes its 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.989
 door we will also talk about and iphone 6 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.360
 with 17 uncovered on the campus of a 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.730
 foot we are also going to talk about that samsung 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.000
 will bring to the market terminals with say 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.989
 the ex phone is one of the reasons 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.170
 we are also going to talk about a 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.930
 estimate points to 400 thousand meters 4 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.010
 published to date and we'll talk 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.780
 about ubuntu with which it is already official 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.780
 so let's start now 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.880
 its doors here responsible for one 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.800
 of the greatest services created within 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 of the jailbreak together with silvia has 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.360
 confirmed that installs the saw 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.000
 irremediably associated with the bad 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.280
 image that has the driver beyond 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.630
 hacks and system modifications 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.640
 installous was a kind of store 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 where the user could get without 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.480
 no cost the payment applications 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.190
 available in the 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.260
 the fact that install saw goes 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.150
 also accompanied by that service 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.770
 Forums maintenance and support 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.510
 application together with the possibility of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 use it from now on 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.290
 means much less that there 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.940
 finished the only mod 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.500
 the only way to hack install 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.230
 applications inside a device 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.660
 There is a proxy jailbreak, of course 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.580
 an audi what facilitated until the 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.460
 maximum expression for most 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.460
 users without much knowledge 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.460
 technicians 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.230
 the iphone 6 with 17 uncovered in the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.610
 Apple campus starts the year and already 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.280
 we have the first ones with us 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.320
 rumors or indications of the products that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.420
 to present over the months 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.130
 that comes several developers have 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.500
 confirmed that there are several 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.840
 devices with the iphone 6 individual 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.290
 connecting to your applications from the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.530
 campus of cupertino the iphone 6 with 17 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.970
 closer and closer as usual 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.920
 time the Christmas holiday is over 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.990
 begin the rumors about the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.330
 apple products that we will see from 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.030
 of several months between them the expected 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.650
 revealed the life for the iphone continues that 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.600
 was presented on September 12 the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.360
 last year several developers of 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.510
 applications with contacted tend 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.050
 your website to share a find 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.780
 developer 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.310
 there are several dresses with a good 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.320
 iphone identifier and a system 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.690
 operating different connecting to their 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.959
 applications possibly the new 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.640
 iphone 6 with 17 that are testing from 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.020
 the laboratories of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.870
 after investigating the records 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.370
 existing ones and compare them with the new ones 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.020
 petitions that come from the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.020
 ip address on the campus of cupertino 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.700
 of apel california everything seems to indicate 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.190
 that the first test is being done 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.569
 of the company's next smartphone and 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.209
 is that the identifier in this 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.910
 device is none other than iphone 6 that 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.220
 includes a year whose identifier is not 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.540
 the same as the current one remember that in 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.270
 Currently the apple smartphone 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.630
 has or neither an iphones identifier and 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.900
 one or iphones but as two depending 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.440
 of the network model lte 4g with which 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.440
 Opera 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.590
 will bring to the market terminals as they say 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.420
 the let's foq is one of the reasons ago 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.490
 a few days and released the news of the ex 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.710
 with what would be the most powerful terminal 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.580
 of the market and designed to fight with 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.990
 the Iphone 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.060
 with this announcement we expected that the 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.070
 mobile manufacturers on tab and rest 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.980
 a little bit of Android side as we said 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.930
 it was said and done samsung announces in its 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.330
 I support say to convert with this 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.740
 terminal would not be the first time 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.860
 we hear about this operating system 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.830
 that picks up the witness of migo invade 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.450
 this last from samsung at the moment 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.860
 we know that they can be carried without 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.870
 excessive difficulty to the application 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.970
 made for android with what 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.070
 would get a significant part of the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.690
 developers if you know how to play 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.060
 good your chips 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.680
 the play is very close by any 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.050
 operating that site from competing against 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.690
 Android yesterday he has not known 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.250
 position very well and windows phone is 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.650
 wants to settle for third place 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.060
 but with the support of samsung the greatest 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.860
 terminal manufacturer with android 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.350
 making it from the competition 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.850
 anything else then pulls the most 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.850
 galaxy name that can not 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.620
 an estimate points to 400,000 meters 4 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.419
 manufactured to date all 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.300
 potential buyers of the nexus 4 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.250
 center google with the eye of the hurricane 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.389
 responsible for all the chaos and 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.699
 disinformation in everything related to the 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.349
 sale of it since it was released 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.819
 but not only that 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.129
 we all know that I knew 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:11.860
 distributed very few units are missing 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.690
 to have any solid clues about 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.970
 the any of these 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.919
 and is that how could it be otherwise 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.080
 a group of ccoo boys recognized 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.460
 per x day of flight per have been taken to 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.349
 make an estimate about the 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.300
 units produced what throws a 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.190
 total less than 400 thousand telephones 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.930
 being is counting the variants in 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.259
 the two capacities 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.590
 You can see the details in the link of the 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.590
 description 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.999
 and it's official the signs were there 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.189
 canonical wanted to be in the sector 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:46.629
 mobile starting with your installer for 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.639
 give her seven of ubuntu for 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.879
 desk going through authorizations of 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.919
 jury and on the same lts the problem is 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.840
 that so far ubuntu is not 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.260
 optimized for touch screens ni 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.630
 is 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.940
 and smartphones and although he needed to tune 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.780
 its interface for small screens the 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.290
 last step to ubuntu funds in 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.140
 ubuntu 12,046 for goal in divinity 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.210
 received a hd to replace all 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.040
 the grouped menus that I had and also 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.650
 a big update in its store 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.630
 software but it was not enough for that 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.620
 they just presented their system to 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.080
 mobile phones 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.780
 ubuntu for mobile phones will be based on 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.940
 Android in all its drivers and kernel 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.640
 linux but it would have a very different 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.320
 large at the technical level will not use dalvik 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.610
 the virtual machine of java 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.290
 in which can tricornio and his 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.180
 guilty applications that the 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.550
 interface was not too fluid in 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.750
 its first versions by not running 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.270
 about a virtual machine 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.430
 ubuntu for phones would really be 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.440
 taking full advantage of the hardware so 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.470
 powerful that there is right now in telephones 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:55.710
 Android plus ubuntu font 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.570
 will support arm and x86 architectures 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.160
 better comes when they dedicated a call 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.780
 ensures that your mobile operating system 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.780
 It will be easily adaptable to 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.880
 phones - yes existing with very few 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.290
 modifications of by means on the basis of 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.090
 this ensures that the first 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.720
 terminals will be available in the 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.490
 2014 what is curious because if 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.560
 well to say have a large part of 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.330
 software with them does not give any name 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.610
 if the system is based on android 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.910
 we would be before a similar installation 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.890
 to firefox or to fire photos that is 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.660
 install it in any accounting system 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.660
 as if it were a room of
