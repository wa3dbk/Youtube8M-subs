00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.870 
to snip pieces off the end of the
play-doh<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.730> Plato<00:00:53.000> itself<00:00:53.480> present

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
play-doh and the Plato itself present

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.910 
play-doh and the Plato itself present
has<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:55.910> nice<00:00:56.270> resistance<00:00:56.900> on<00:00:57.230> it<00:00:57.590> for<00:00:57.830> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
has a nice resistance on it for the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.270
