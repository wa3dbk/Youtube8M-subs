00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.220
 good 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.789
 pure roll that is the biggest 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.220
 flattery with which we can describe 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.199
 stack ethernet and a videogame of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.910
 huge quality that recovers like nobody 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.710
 the best rolera essence of the old 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.880
 school and adapts it to the new times 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 with exquisite taste 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.960
 and baldur's gate how we miss you 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.940
 because you do not make raul adventures anymore 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.239
 as before 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.239
 and this but if it is just what we asked 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.400
 very extensive customization options 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.800
 a deep combat system and 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.079
 challenging 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.079
 freedom of action and decision making 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.940
 a fascinating history well basted 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.940
 and with many surprises 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.120
 and above all a lot of love for the role 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.120
 of the old school 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.909
 pillars of eternity is the dream of 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.829
 any lover of the genre a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.780
 huge video game with dozens and 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.969
 dozens of missions to complete and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.859
 dangerous dungeons to explore and what 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.810
 better is that it's so fun and that your 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.280
 action is so epic and exciting that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.280
 it seems that the hours do not pass 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.590
 the virtues the pillars of eternity are 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 many but without doubt your system 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.830
 combat is one of the best tributes 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.380
 that they could dedicate to games like 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.290
 baldur's gate pure strategy 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.440
 and we do not exaggerate an oversight and you're 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440
 dead 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.790
 take advantage of the virtues of each 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 Team member using traps 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.680
 potions parchments combine weapons and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.690
 even decide wisely what enemy 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.970
 attack will be vital to survive 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.400
 these encounters and we no longer say when 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.400
 in front is a jefazo that epic 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.140
 pillars of eternity also has 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.910
 a wide variety of archetypes for 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 that we face the action as we come 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.110
 in fact there are quite traditional 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.790
 like wrestlers or sorcerers but 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.040
 also heroes of the most interesting 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.349
 as orators and dor figure is that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.430
 with his songs and mental powers he 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.430
 will come out a bit of the norm 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.840
 the character of the adventurers who 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.820
 will join our cause is also 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.560
 pretty good although if you prefer 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.870
 you can create the whole group from scratch 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.710
 just go to a tavern to pay for 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.230
 your services 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.230
 and clear pick your class and skills 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.340
 the design of the dungeons is another of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.800
 the strengths of pillars of 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.870
 eternity are very varied with each other with 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.790
 lots of secret areas and traps 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.740
 mortals protecting treasures from 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.510
 priceless value there is also some that 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.160
 another very ingenious puzzle although what 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.020
 better is the feeling of freedom that 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.459
 transmits the video game each mission 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.530
 it can be overcome in many ways 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.580
 different depending on the group of 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.580
 heroes that we control 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.450
 the game also surprises with certain 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.730
 passages of adventure that present a 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.170
 attractive literary style you remember 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.330
 of books create your own adventure 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.280
 something like that you will find in this 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.090
 title that at a plot level is at a 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.090
 colossal level 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.079
 as deep in the playable as the 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.030
 classics of yesteryear the best we can 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.860
 say the pillars of eternity is that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.930
 It is so well designed that anyone 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.879
 veterans and novices will enjoy for 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.650
 equal of the immensity of its contents 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.900
 the user interface is clear and 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.120
 intuitive everything is very well explained and 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.980
 despite the number of options never 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.319
 we will have a feeling of being lost 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.970
 something that has much merit more in a 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.650
 video game like this one that in no 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.780
 moment you mark with an arrow towards 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.209
 where you should go investigate on your own 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.579
 pay attention to the dialogues and look 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.409
 clues in each scenario you can go where 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.329
 come to you and act as you prefer 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.230
 but always knowing that every action 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.230
 it has its consequences 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.610
 if it was not enough obsidian we 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.590
 also allows to manage a large 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.900
 value that we will have to defend 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.910
 enemy raids pick up taxes 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.430
 hire mercenaries train the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.930
 heroes there are options for a while and the best 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.370
 is that visually speaking all 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.210
 our actions will be faithfully 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.210
 reflected 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.460
 You see this ruinous room, we invest 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.650
 money and ball this is something else 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.900
 prison is a bible because the same thing already 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.170
 capture enemies that something useful we 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.170
 they will say 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.720
 are these details that make 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.820
 batteries of eternity a video game 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.920
 majestic visually the beauty of 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.780
 the environments the impeccable animations 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.000
 of our heroes or the colorful of their 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.190
 special attacks few adventures of 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.530
 raul look so good and let's not say 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.350
 impressive and epic soundtrack as 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.470
 few texts have been translated into 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.470
 Spanish 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.750
 and the new obsidian is a work 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.880
 teacher with all of the law 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.920
 an immeasurable work that surprises 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.170
 its playable depth the variety and 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.360
 quality of their missions what exciting 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.790
 of his argument and his brilliant putting in 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.040
 scene the fans asked for an adventure of 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.380
 role of the old school and pillars 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.720
 of eternity is just that or 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.970
 or rather the logical evolution of those 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.560
 adventures a title that takes the best of 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.420
 that time and adapts it to the 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.950
 perfection to the new times 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.950
 often essential
