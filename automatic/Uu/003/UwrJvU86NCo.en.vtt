00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.980
 to the computer like our 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 organism communicates internally to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 Next we will know the concept of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.700
 interruption and its classification but 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.250
 first of all what are the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.130
 interruptions 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 the interruption also known as 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.989
 hardware interruption or request 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.720
 interruption is a signal received by 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.550
 the processor of a computer indicating 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.920
 that must interrupt the course of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 current execution and move on to execute the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.130
 specific code to deal with this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.560
 situation 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.870
 inside a computer there are two classes 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.690
 of interruptions by hardware and by 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.400
 software hardware interrupts 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.770
 are those that are caused by 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.660
 devices external to your processor 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.240
 main feature is that they are not 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.790
 programmed that is can occur in 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.710
 any time in the program to 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.480
 difference of this interruptions 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.030
 by software are programmed by the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.670
 user is the user decides 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.530
 when and where to execute them generally 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 are used to make entry and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.539
 exit 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 there are two types of interruptions 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.640
 hardware masks bless and does not mask 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.350
 bless in the masks bless the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.899
 processor may not serve you or 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.000
 ignore it under the control of the software 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.490
 are activated or deactivated and normally 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 they are used for attention of peripherals in 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.350
 general while in the does not mask 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.110
 bless the processor can not avoid 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.179
 serving it has higher priority than other 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.039
 type of interruptions and used in 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.039
 catastrophe-type events for the system 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 Software interruptions are 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.950
 synchronous events that are triggered by 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.289
 the program in execution 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.030
 using a special language function 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.170
 this can happen when calling the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.150
 int instruction 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.590
 when performing a division by zero or 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.959
 make a request for a 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.819
 external interruption have like 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.459
 objective that the processor executes 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.650
 some kind of function at the end of 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 execute this function will be followed 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.510
 executing the program that caused the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.430
 interrupting this type of interruptions 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.440
 are of higher priority than those of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.299
 hardware so that if you receive a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.549
 hardware interruption while it 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.120
 run a software this last one has 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.120
 priority 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.210
 already project and because the 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.070
 interruptions arose because in the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.780
 past the processor had to be 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.940
 constantly checking what 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.280
 devices needed your attention and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.800
 sometimes in vain as verified 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.020
 none needed attention causing 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.880
 a waste of time 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.850
 that's why interruptions solve 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.620
 this problem because it is not the processor 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.020
 the one that has to worry about being 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.030
 constantly checking that the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.070
 devices notify the processor 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.750
 when they need your attention and so 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.730
 saves processor time and for 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.870
 Consequently, the performance of the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.990
 system in general I already understand but they are 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.390
 important interruptions 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.830
 if it is important because the 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 mechanism of treatment of 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.520
 interrupts allows the system 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.700
 operative use the processor in 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.560
 service one application while another 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.330
 remains waiting for it to end 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.670
 an operation device 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.500
 entry / exit I understand why the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.840
 importance of interruptions as 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.970
 internal communication of the computer 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.480
 here we finish and see you until the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.480
 next
