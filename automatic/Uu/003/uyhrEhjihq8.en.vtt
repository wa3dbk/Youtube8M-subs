00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.660
 the e3 was really much better than 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.969
 Last year, we have never 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.830
 so many videos posted in a week 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.720
 all of course just about you as possible 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.880
 to inform about each game exactly 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 but we still have a game 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.530
 not talked and that's halo 5 so there 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 It finally got a video to the campaign though 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.640
 since there are already some details laid out 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.980
 we were the appearance of buck out 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.019
 Halo is not very surprised 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 anyway, have us about the return of 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:49.949
 maze infineon, by the way, is looking forward to that 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.449
 theme service with agent lok on the hunt 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.489
 after ten blue and the master chiefs 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.530
 supports the masterchief and his 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.479
 heroism is questioned and with 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 Help from different perspectives 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.059
 As a player, we become the truth 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.059
 bring light 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.890
 just a pity that we did not like usual 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.960
 the story in local splitscreen mode 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.090
 can play the first gameplay has 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.340
 However, we presented a new gadget 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.439
 with the artemis tracking system from lok 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.819
 we can track down weapons depots 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.179
 where we send members to send 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.950
 can to collect the people 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.079
 Whether the new tactics feature themselves in the game 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.119
 but it is also well integrated 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.659
 turn out if always hand 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.659
 can create 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.560
 which we actually try 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.719
 was allowed was the multiplayer mode 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 his and he liked me so much 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.969
 I go for it twice on the e3 for that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.340
 hired since the provider 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.709
 december 2014 we know that in the new 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.959
 multiplayer of halo five a lot different 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.729
 everything runs so clearly 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.429
 more agile and faster 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.890
 thanks to kloster pack sprint and clever 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.689
 function in addition to the classic arena 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.000
 four against four mode has called out like 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.609
 studios at the e3 the new mode 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.489
 warzone revealed on the biggest halo 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:16.310
 map of all time play 24 players so 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.950
 12 against 12 the goal is relatively easy 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.930
 For a long time he was the first team to score 1,000 points 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.329
 or destroy the enemy energy 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.670
 Kern is the first of your base animals 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.040
 and free them from Catholics 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.840
 now there is domination, there are three 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.180
 building we try to take 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.590
 and keep it distributed at the same time 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.970
 on the map bosses ours 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.340
 bring critical points 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.410
 and so improve our arsenal 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.700
 before every respawn or at certain 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.609
 So we can do ours 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.530
 standard tires against a covenant carbon 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.639
 or my darling against a particle 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.919
 trade swords 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.780
 Incidentally, this increases during the match 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.940
 Whole team up and turns so heavy 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.010
 Sagittarius Free Halo is almost here 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.810
 to a battlefield next to election day 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.579
 and the benji is also the 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.389
 mendes as ground support to 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.160
 commitment 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.810
 new is that celebrities their companions 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.200
 Which makes you almost invincible 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.120
 feels 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.069
 One thing is clear the two matches the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.069
 each took about 15 minutes 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.230
 were anything but boring 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.750
 against the ki or against real opponents 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.579
 The main thing is to be the strong first 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.989
 to get weapons and vehicles and 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.990
 thus the map and the mode too 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.580
 check 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.930
 I would see high and actually 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.180
 gladly for a longer period 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.800
 play to check if it is 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.870
 still feels as good as 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.400
 in the first half hour on each 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.620
 case i have to for free studios 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.240
 props to speak because they dare 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.070
 with larsson something is very practical like 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.510
 a milestone in the halo 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.400
 multiplayer history there you can 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.870
 other developer studios respectively 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.620
 other publisher a slice of 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.780
 cut off 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.220
 now only has to work for 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.870
 start the servers to be stable 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.370
 matchmaking has to work 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.900
 that would be a pity if not 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.570
 Fold me now 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.220
 What do you care about without 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.360
 was to have played but you could 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.460
 yes, see a little bit 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.810
 I'll say two matches like that 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.170
 me there but your opinion in the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.170
