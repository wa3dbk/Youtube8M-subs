00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.180
 the people 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.800
 marie drucker hello to all but at the belvedere le figaro 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.650
 the arrival of animator journalists and from tomorrow so Saturday 27 of 12 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.159
 30 hours 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.859
 at 13.30 from the 30's 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.099
 the rtl's unexpected log commands so I'm enjoying it unexpectedly that's 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.929
 an institution bullying and dannenberg at 52 45 exactly how is this 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.899
 that you are going to approach that you sink into the mold at 45 years of existence 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.180
 here you have brought a new twist 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.559
 a first the others 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.400
 no i do not know i think annaba 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.710
 % but it's still very much this forbidden stop on my arrival 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.350
 finally it's a backpack a show like this is certain since their 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.430
 opening 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.350
 live on wii and on arte left to the extraordinary with her with a 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.180
 invited with complete freedom and to support him with a very good and 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.390
 a very strong reaction against already it is that it is formidable 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.800
 at night I arrive with humility abdelhak tixier teen that 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.310
 I was listening to RTL 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.510
 because women too when I arrived this morning at the train station but a 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.530
 peulh this case 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.900
 as for a meeting in black in the low neighborhoods plouha 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.890
 it's better europe 1 where you would not shock me but i do not 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.550
 directly from the inao what I do more radio to come close a season 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.140
 but also the trend there is no question of revolutionary 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.300
 so budget not because it's a very good show on Marc very 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.800
 strong rtl 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.479
 anne nevertheless 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.140
 at this very pretentious time to say yes but print my mark a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.020
 private something 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.340
 in what I really like sheikholeslami Newfoundland 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.580
 editor-in-chief of the unexpected newspaper is that that's it that's for sure and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.040
 then after what prints a mark we see there are rather ideas to 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.470
 a tone that harass everyone but she says it's marc lavoine it's 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.229
 marc lavoine singer marc lavoine 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.549
 comedians singers and then also in trÃ¨ves very involved in the world of 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 many causes is particularly concerned 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 autistic because it is very 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.960
 with the autistic and it's a cause that keeps him 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.880
 while unless 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.720
 we saw you commented princely wedding bill will have louis see in london and 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.399
 in Monaco you have 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.879
 you're still from Auxerre well 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.169
 the case from the beginning and jt de france 2 you have presented 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:18.910
 magazines 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.819
 magazine history magazine 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.010
 investigation of the fake you are a little bit everywhere a little touched 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.490
 all interested 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.290
 it's the info 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.259
 it's the pipole what's it 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.229
 so there even the pipole does not even understand the question because I never 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.759
 presented I'm absolutely not princely weddings it was still 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.569
 a very preppy paul event 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.659
 % maybe then but it is primarily because of the elements produced by the 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.059
 drafting of France 2 prepared by the programs 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:47.629
 % and it's mostly these are incredible story pages that technique 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.429
 of today and the ways that we talked about the retransmitting aude 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.669
 in the whole world 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.639
 so percent and that I think my comrade these women there we will agree 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.909
 with me tonight before any inconvenience of news story it 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.909
 is not ready and personalities and glamor the key 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.879
 because it's a timeline that's real but I've never animated anything 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.569
 it is ultimately only information 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.289
 from the magazine I did 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:18.909
 if you've seen the victories of music then playful music 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.599
 classic for some time m 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.680
 that of el of music last year had not been a very 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.719
 great memory 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.769
 it's not a bad memory will not go away from having done so but 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.489
 I always said uncomfortable pure animation the entertainment is 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.589
 something else 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.209
 it is very difficult besides it is a job that has nothing to do with 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.339
 that of journalist and these are from range of very different trades and very 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:39.109
 difficult 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.219
 and I always said that this concept a priori it was not necessarily my 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.059
 employment 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.229
 I'm patient and having done it but I think that 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.829
 I think that's all we can talk about can not do everything 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.619
 and all well be cold in the minitel and recognize 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.809
 he was he goes there and when do you have music 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:57.519
 and besides, it's quite funny because 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.530
 the function is about the same time you animate classical music 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.690
 or variety and yet it's not perceived the same way that's what 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:04.649
 is quite rare 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.339
 to milan alarcon aboard an election year 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:11.129
 of his electorate but what you would like to host a political program 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.599
 listen to politics first through donations from guests in newspapers 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.809
 and then in treasure 15 on sunday 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:22.029
 but here's a nice get all the nominees to nominate them has a strong 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.339
 necessarily political connotation% and politics - we really do 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.449
 in people in their ranks constantly 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.500
 % have a political program 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.870
 so i'll tell you i'm not at all i'm going to start tomorrow e a 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.110
 issue in 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.889
 I never dared to dream and that the expected journalists 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.050
 so I'm not saying in Chinese is expected it's great 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.650
 and why I'm not doing politics this year so it's an electorate 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.669
 not go at all things like that i go to hell sporadically on them on 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.910
 France 2 in the newspapers 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.630
 I think it's great like that and in the unexpected Henry's diary 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.279
 could have a political side where it stays 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.890
 in this agency not for obvious reasons in addition to world 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.720
 of he knew of speaking time and this farmer 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.949
 my biggest surprise and then I admit that I thought that 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.729
 political journalist it's a full-time job 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.069
 so that's for me I'm rather a generalist journalist who 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.120
 does the politics of economics 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.569
 of history but percent and to be a year after 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.340
 so I have no frustration of not having a show the policy is 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.999
 dedicated maybe someday I will do things because animated for the break for 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.850
 to practice while you read long Tuesday radio and television 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.340
 it's a little bit heavy do you have% at the same time you're on 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.990
 joe 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.690
 projects for France televisions the lnd obviously I will continue as I 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.479
 I have been for three years to have the special TD charge of their efforts in 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.580
 europe obviously for this year to you and your feet 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.790
 for princely weddings but also for them 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.220
 alomar people german soldiers in afghanistan in an email and all that stuff 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.420
 these are information things and news events that 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.719
 information 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.719
 Courbis knew r 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.240
 there are discussions on 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.039
 history magazine as did represent or not 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.309
 a little bit more 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.469
 I did and I believe six years of history finally on France televisions on 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:13.699
 France 3 at the helm and then on France 5 also this year 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.289
 but it's no longer a matter of history, we even signed 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.839
 for three numbers on France 5 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.739
 there is no question of history but in circles we discuss before the stop and then not 

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:27.399
 necessarily with a great regularity we are getting ready to 3 4 euros way that 

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.650
 would not be the first 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.850
 very well marie drucker I'm selling thank you good luck for the unexpected newspaper 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.430
