the<00:00:35.370> concave<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.380> 916<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:37.950> over

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100

the concave is 916 so a little bit over
half<00:00:38.430> an<00:00:38.579> inch<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.480> gets<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:40.040> aggressive

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
half an inch that gets more aggressive

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.520 
half an inch that gets more aggressive
as<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.610> towards<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.300> pocket<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.930> that's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
as you go towards the pocket and that's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.319 
as you go towards the pocket and that's
unique<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.309> board<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.030> micro

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
unique to this board because the micro

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.590 
unique to this board because the micro
drop<00:00:45.690> creates<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> pocket<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.700> half<00:00:48.390> an

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
drop creates a pocket it's about half an

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.930 
drop creates a pocket it's about half an
inch<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.829> does<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> allows<00:00:50.610> your

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
inch but what it does is it allows your

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
inch but what it does is it allows your
foot<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.360> locked<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.350> side<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.280> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
foot to be locked in on this side but so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.569 
foot to be locked in on this side but so
call<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> concave<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.379> carries<00:00:55.800> drop

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
call the concave actually carries drop

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
call the concave actually carries drop
unlike<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> lot<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.690> other<00:00:57.899> boards<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.129> what

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
unlike a lot of other boards so what

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.709 
unlike a lot of other boards so what
that<00:00:59.489> does<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.270> create<00:01:01.050> full<00:01:01.859> range<00:01:02.629> what<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that does is create full range what is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
that does is create full range what is
supported<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.409> four<00:01:04.979> sides<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
supported all four sides and what it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.660 
supported all four sides and what it
will<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.930> create<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.229> bowl

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
will actually do is create a bowl

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.920 
will actually do is create a bowl
according<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> Nelson<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.479> lacks<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.900> little

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
according to Nelson it lacks a little

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
according to Nelson it lacks a little
message<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.619> means<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.010> actually

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
message then so that means it's actually

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.800 
message then so that means it's actually
supporting<00:01:14.939> your<00:01:15.060> foot<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.600> four<00:01:15.780> sides

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
supporting your foot on all four sides

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.800 
supporting your foot on all four sides
like<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> bowl<00:01:17.130> instead<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.150> having<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
like a bowl instead of just having a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.499 
like a bowl instead of just having a
drop<00:01:21.409> just<00:01:22.409> fill<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> side<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
drop just fill out the side so this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780 
drop just fill out the side so this
allows<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.960> foot<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.439> support<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.070> 360

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
allows your foot to have support for 360

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390 
allows your foot to have support for 360
degrees<00:01:27.060> around<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.829> lets<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> get

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
degrees around and it also lets you get

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
degrees around and it also lets you get
really<00:01:29.640> locked<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.360> free<00:01:30.600> ride<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
really locked in for free ride and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.590 
really locked in for free ride and
downhill<00:01:31.490> right<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.820> there's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.420> bit

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
downhill right here there's a little bit

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
downhill right here there's a little bit
of<00:01:33.630> W<00:01:33.990> down<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> center<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> deck<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of W down the center of the deck it's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.560 
of W down the center of the deck it's
not<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.909> aggressive<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
not so aggressive that it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
not so aggressive that it's
uncomfortable<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.200> pushing<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:38.100> its

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
uncomfortable when pushing what its

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
uncomfortable when pushing what its
aggressive<00:01:38.460> enough<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.810> exactly

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
aggressive enough that you know exactly

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
aggressive enough that you know exactly
where<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.560> foot<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> support

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
where your foot is a support

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.999 
where your foot is a support
the<00:01:43.150> W<00:01:43.479> concave<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.080> also<00:01:44.470> great<00:01:44.680> for<00:01:44.860> creating

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
the W concave is also great for creating

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.520 
the W concave is also great for creating
little<00:01:45.369> pockets<00:01:45.970> on<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.240> side<00:01:46.540> right<00:01:47.320> about

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
little pockets on the side right about

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.200 
little pockets on the side right about
here<00:01:47.890> where<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.189> concave<00:01:48.580> flares<00:01:48.939> up<00:01:49.150> a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
here where the concave flares up a

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.999 
here where the concave flares up a
little<00:01:49.479> bit<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.840> perfect<00:01:50.590> for<00:01:50.740> putting<00:01:50.950> your

the most damage you can see is a little
bit<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.130> shipping<00:02:51.970> on<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> side<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:52.390> that's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
bit of shipping on the side and that's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.840 
bit of shipping on the side and that's
just<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.959> paint<00:02:53.200> wearing<00:02:53.530> off<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:54.430> these<00:02:54.549> tail

you've ever cryptid deck before you know
it's<00:02:58.329> not<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.600> fun<00:02:59.019> experience<00:02:59.130> it<00:03:00.130> usually

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's not a fun experience it usually

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.740 
it's not a fun experience it usually
takes<00:03:00.609> a<00:03:00.670> chunk<00:03:00.910> out<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.269> nose<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.660> your

deck what these do is it just gets

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.120 
deck what these do is it just gets
cuffed<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.510> these<00:03:05.049> take<00:03:05.290> all<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.680> impacts

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
cuffed and these take all of the impacts

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.650 
cuffed and these take all of the impacts
you<00:03:06.190> don't<00:03:06.370> even<00:03:06.459> have<00:03:06.609> to<00:03:06.670> worry<00:03:06.880> about<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
you don't even have to worry about the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.770 
you don't even have to worry about the
deck<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.280> basically<00:03:09.430> wraps<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.090> up<00:03:10.209> it's

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
deck so that basically wraps it up it's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.330 
deck so that basically wraps it up it's
a<00:03:10.810> very<00:03:11.019> stiff<00:03:11.410> deck<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.010> great<00:03:12.130> for

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
a very stiff deck so it's great for

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.580 
a very stiff deck so it's great for
downhill<00:03:12.549> as<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.329> nice<00:03:13.600> long<00:03:13.870> wheelbase<00:03:14.140> but

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
downhill as a nice long wheelbase but

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.449 
downhill as a nice long wheelbase but
it's<00:03:14.709> also<00:03:14.920> very<00:03:15.250> agile<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.890> that's<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:18.160> really

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
it's also very agile and that's a really

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.650 
it's also very agile and that's a really
great<00:03:18.700> deck<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.299> can't<00:03:19.840> recommend<00:03:20.109> it<00:03:20.350> enough

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660
