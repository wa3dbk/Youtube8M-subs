with these high-resolution monitors that
you're<00:00:16.770> seeing<00:00:17.039> today<00:00:17.190> these<00:00:17.340> 4k<00:00:17.910> monitors

even even the 1080i and 1080p monitors
there's<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.109> many<00:00:22.230> dots<00:00:22.710> per<00:00:23.160> inch<00:00:23.189> or<00:00:23.820> DPI

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
there's so many dots per inch or DPI

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.230 
there's so many dots per inch or DPI
it's<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.050> dense<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.010> text<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.640> often<00:00:26.970> appear

it's so dense the text can often appear

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
very very small on the screen so windows

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.279 
very very small on the screen so windows
does<00:00:29.820> DPI<00:00:30.210> scaling<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.869> actually<00:00:31.109> done<00:00:31.260> that

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
does DPI scaling it's actually done that

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
does DPI scaling it's actually done that
for<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> few<00:00:31.800> versions<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.399> that's<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.850> new

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
for a few versions now that's not new

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.959 
for a few versions now that's not new
but<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> new<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> past<00:00:35.640> your

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but what is new is that in the past your

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.209 
but what is new is that in the past your
dpi<00:00:36.329> scaling<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.020> done<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> global

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
dpi scaling was done as like a global

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.970 
dpi scaling was done as like a global
setting<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> had<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:40.050> big<00:00:40.469> monitor

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
setting so if you had one big monitor

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
setting so if you had one big monitor
and<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.610> small<00:00:42.030> monitor<00:00:42.450> they'd<00:00:42.750> scale<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and one small monitor they'd scale the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900 
and one small monitor they'd scale the
same<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.430> would<00:00:44.579> cause<00:00:44.760> problems

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
same way and that would cause problems

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
same way and that would cause problems
you<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.809> applications<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.710> look

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you get applications that will look

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
you get applications that will look
different<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.520> different<00:00:47.579> monitors<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
different on different monitors and it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
different on different monitors and it
was<00:00:48.840> oftentimes<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.620> difficult<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> read

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
was oftentimes really difficult to read

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
was oftentimes really difficult to read
in<00:00:50.520> Windows<00:00:51.420> 10<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.410> control<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
in Windows 10 we can control that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.729 
in Windows 10 we can control that
scaling<00:00:53.219> separately<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.239> each<00:00:54.270> monitor<00:00:55.140> let

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
scaling separately for each monitor let

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.380 
scaling separately for each monitor let
me<00:00:55.800> show<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> mean<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.300> my

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
me show you what I mean so here on my

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.590 
me show you what I mean so here on my
laptop<00:00:57.629> I've<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.699> fairly<00:00:59.699> high<00:00:59.850> resolution

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
laptop I've got a fairly high resolution

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
laptop I've got a fairly high resolution
screen<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.920> want<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.190> tweak<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.520> way

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
screen and if I want to tweak the way

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.969 
screen and if I want to tweak the way
that<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.030> text<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.629> being<00:01:03.660> rendered<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.559> can

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that this text is being rendered I can

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
that this text is being rendered I can
do<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> now<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.869> through<00:01:06.900> our

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
do that now we do that through our

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.719 
do that now we do that through our
display<00:01:07.799> settings<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.460> I'm<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.610> going

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
display settings and so I'm just going

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.100 
display settings and so I'm just going
to<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:08.939> click<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.479> desktop<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.900> go

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
to right click here on my desktop and go

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.899 
to right click here on my desktop and go
to<00:01:10.170> display<00:01:10.530> settings<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> I'll<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.790> my

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
to display settings and I'll see my

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.359 
to display settings and I'll see my
displays<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:12.960> got<00:01:13.320> two<00:01:13.530> monitors<00:01:13.860> but

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
displays now I've got two monitors but

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.280 
displays now I've got two monitors but
right<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:15.090> duplicating<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> displays

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
right now I'm duplicating the displays

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.280 
right now I'm duplicating the displays
and<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> change<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.090> DPI<00:01:18.509> scaling<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and so when I change my DPI scaling I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.960 
and so when I change my DPI scaling I
only<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:19.890> setting<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.610> where<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
only see one setting right here where it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
only see one setting right here where it
says<00:01:21.000> change<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.869> size<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.320> text<00:01:22.680> apps<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
says change the size of text apps and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
says change the size of text apps and
other<00:01:23.189> items<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.540> one

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
other items and right now I'm at one

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.929 
other items and right now I'm at one
hundred<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> fifty<00:01:25.320> percent<00:01:25.680> my<00:01:26.369> resolution

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
hundred and fifty percent my resolution

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840 
hundred and fifty percent my resolution
is<00:01:27.030> 1920<00:01:27.810> x<00:01:27.930> 1080<00:01:28.140> text<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.280> too<00:01:29.520> small

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
is 1920 x 1080 text would be too small

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
is 1920 x 1080 text would be too small
normally<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.170> boosting<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> by<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
normally so here it's boosting it by a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
normally so here it's boosting it by a
hundred<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.430> fifty<00:01:32.700> percent<00:01:32.970> making<00:01:33.270> things

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
hundred and fifty percent making things

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
hundred and fifty percent making things
a<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.110> bigger<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.979> easier<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
a little bit bigger so it's easier to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
a little bit bigger so it's easier to
read<00:01:35.909> well<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:37.650> monitors<00:01:38.189> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
read well if one of my other monitors is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.460 
read well if one of my other monitors is
smaller<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.000> might<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> big<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
smaller I might not want that big of a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
smaller I might not want that big of a
boost<00:01:40.710> text<00:01:41.189> might<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.430> too<00:01:41.670> big<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.090> other

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
boost text might be too big on the other

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.260 
boost text might be too big on the other
screen<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.710> i<00:01:44.070> switch<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> say<00:01:45.000> i<00:01:45.030> want

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
screen so if i switch here to say i want
