00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.240
 how about friends of uploading repubblica 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.280
 welcome one more week the immense ones 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.230
 wifi tips today we 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.700
 with doctor donald vega nutritionist 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.620
 and conditioning specialist 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.300
 integral for blue welcome donor 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.920
 thanks for the invitation to surf and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 republic and here we are to collaborate 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.930
 in helping people so that they can 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 improve your surfing out of the water on the day of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.289
 today where he will teach us a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 previous heating succession of surfing 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.760
 that will help you increase your 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 rotation in the back basically in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 rotation luck so that this 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.920
 week let's learn an exercise that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.720
 What you are looking for is to increase the ranges in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.210
 our column to be able to take them to 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.399
 the extremes 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.280
 before starting it starts with a 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.379
 test to know our range before 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.809
 of the exercise and check as after 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.550
 of the exercise the range has increased and 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.649
 basically consists of doing as if 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.440
 one was shooting leaving the feet 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.710
 fixed rotates to the right everything that 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 can point to where it was then what 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.840
 same to the left side point 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.210
 where it was and starts the exercise in 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
 exercise starts in this way party 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.890
 towards the front 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.689
 we move the thumb to where our 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.509
 field of vision detects it and when it 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.750
 lose we return to the front 10 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.630
 repetitions with the right arm 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.890
 10 repetitions with the left arm 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.690
 I repeat to the point where our 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.900
 field of vision lose the thumb and 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.510
 we return to the front the second phase in 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.370
 keep our eyes thumb 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.530
 new without moving the head and until the 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.530
 point where the field of vision is lost 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.470
 you lose sight of the field of vision and return 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.540
 10 times with the right arm 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.700
 ten times with left arm 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.320
 remember in the head it always stays 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.270
 looking forward the only thing that 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.720
 moves are the eyes and in the third phase 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.520
 is arm to the right and the 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.240
 head towards the left and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.410
 we follow the thumb with the eyes 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.620
 where I lose it from the field of vision 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.220
 I return ten repetitions for arm 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 straight 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.040
 has repetitions for left arm 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.330
 and the science behind this exercise 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.250
 basically is that when our body 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.830
 detects something in the field of vision in 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.510
 the extreme points quickly 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.400
 ready to try in that direction to 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.780
 detect if what is going on 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.610
 So if you practice this 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.020
 exercise before entering the water of 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.700
 sure it will increase your range of 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.040
 movement at the end check it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.409
 how much your range of motion increased 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.689
 and there you will realize that effectively 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.819
 has come longer this is because of this 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.709
 week this was the surfing tip segment 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.239
 of the week but serve them and help them 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.040
 Thank you very much for a vega thanks 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.049
 where you thank with the invitation and we 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.790
 we see in the next recall that if 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.629
 have questions or comments write us in 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.769
 the page on facebook 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.569
 equally there we will be going up 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.159
 the videos weekly the program 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.159
 good note see you next week
