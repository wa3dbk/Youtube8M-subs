00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.870
Today I'm going to talk to you about bonsai deadwood.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.640
What is dead wood? Dead wood is, all trees or trees of age have branches or trunks that have been,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.640
have died away, and they tend to look kind of gnarled and distorted in the way they appear.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.530

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:41.533
Dead wood adds a lot of character to trees and to the human mind, dead wood signifies age in a tree

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.090

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.040
so when we see trees with a lot of dead wood or decaying branches and dead branches and branches

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.080
that have bared the weather and what have you, we think of them as old trees,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.810
and in bonsais, one of the primary aims of bonsai is to try and make it look old.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:11.090
And while creating of dead wood is a more advanced technique, it's something that you can start off with

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:21.090
and build on your trees as you go along. The biggest problem with dead wood is that it has a certain shelf life.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.860

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.210
It does decay and and wear away so creating excessive amount of dead wood on a tree can deteriorate

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.810
or reduce the life span of a tree quite significantly so be aware of that before attempting to create dead wood.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:48.803
You can use techniques to stay off the decay of dead wood by treating it with perhaps lime sulphur

00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:49.810

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.980
or wood hardener or other kinds of conditioners but that's only delaying the inevitable.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.980
There are effectively three types of dead wood on a tree.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.630
The easiest and simplest to create are Jins.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.620
Jins are primary branches that have been broken away.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:18.200
and have been weathered by time and age and they are little stubs on the trunk and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.120
they look quite pleasing and interesting especially on some trees, especially conifers and junipers

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.270
where they tend to hang around for quite a long time.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.090
You also have branches of Shari which is perhaps a branch at the top of the tree has been hit by lightning

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.090
and with time, the leaves have fallen off, the bark has fallen off and what's left is

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.520
just the inner wood of the branch, and it weathers with the sun and the rain

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.620
and what have you and starts looking quite nice.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:01.613
We then have Ori which is these very same dead branches which have been attacked by insects or fungus

00:03:01.613 --> 00:03:03.170

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.660
or whatever else and it's made a hole that has progressed into the trunk of the tree.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.480
You finally have Shari which is just dead wood on the tree and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.340
usually that starts from the bottom of the tree and rises up to quite high into the tree,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:31.285
and it's common in Junipers and Pines where you have veins of a root that feed a particular branch.

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:33.820

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.720
The branch has died away or the root has died away in the soil and because of that, the branch has died away.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.100
And the Shari rises all the way up the tree and you can see with time, it ages with the Sun and weather

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:57.103
and it looks very very nice because eventually all the detailed structure of the trunk is exposed to nature.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.660

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.390
And that is a beginner's guide to bonsai, Shari and dead wood.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.100
