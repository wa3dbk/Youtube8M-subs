thought you Leslie had a good day today
you<00:02:01.899> know<00:02:02.020> he's<00:02:02.290> another<00:02:02.560> guy<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:03.130> think<00:02:03.729> you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
you know he's another guy I think you

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.700 
you know he's another guy I think you
can<00:02:04.030> play<00:02:04.210> two<00:02:04.270> positions<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.200> think<00:02:05.619> he

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
can play two positions I you think he

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.719 
can play two positions I you think he
could<00:02:05.860> play<00:02:05.950> two<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.399> three<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:08.729> they're

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
could play two and three but they're

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.670 
could play two and three but they're
they're<00:02:10.179> competing<00:02:10.600> out<00:02:10.869> there<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.410> think

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
they're competing out there and I think

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.350 
they're competing out there and I think
the<00:02:11.800> way<00:02:11.950> we're<00:02:12.190> trying<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.700> play<00:02:12.910> if<00:02:13.209> they

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
the way we're trying to play if they

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.229 
the way we're trying to play if they
learn<00:02:13.770> as<00:02:14.770> long<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.160> we<00:02:15.280> move<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.730> ball<00:02:15.940> we
