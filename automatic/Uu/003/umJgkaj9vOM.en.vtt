00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
chords with my thumb so when my fingers

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.620 
chords with my thumb so when my fingers
are<00:03:22.430> getting<00:03:22.490> pretty<00:03:22.820> tired<00:03:23.030> which<00:03:23.300> they<00:03:23.420> do

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
are getting pretty tired which they do

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.040 
are getting pretty tired which they do
for<00:03:24.380> this<00:03:24.500> done<00:03:24.680> because<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.100> Sony<00:03:25.280> bar<00:03:25.550> codes

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050

I<00:03:27.050> sort<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.680> switch<00:03:27.950> instead<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.880> using<00:03:29.030> my

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
I sort of switch instead of using my

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.240 
I sort of switch instead of using my
whole<00:03:29.600> finger<00:03:29.780> there<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.350> put<00:03:30.680> my<00:03:30.770> thumb<00:03:31.010> at<00:03:31.160> the

whole finger there I put my thumb at the
top<00:03:31.460> here<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:34.100> then<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.550> can<00:03:35.000> put<00:03:35.270> my<00:03:35.390> finger

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
relaxes my wrist a little bit that's why

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.960 
relaxes my wrist a little bit that's why
I'm<00:03:44.030> location<00:03:44.570> switching<00:03:45.550> okay<00:03:46.550> so<00:03:46.610> when<00:03:46.850> we

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
I'm location switching okay so when we

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.190 
I'm location switching okay so when we

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.500 

then<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:53.980> goes<00:03:54.069> the<00:03:54.520> harm<00:03:55.140> F<00:03:56.140> sharp<00:03:56.470> minor
