00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
while why don't you just put half blocks

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.890 
while why don't you just put half blocks
underneath<00:02:22.310> that's<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.210> great<00:02:23.450> idea

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
underneath that's a great idea

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.540 
underneath that's a great idea
all<00:02:24.050> those<00:02:24.200> people<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.590> suggested<00:02:24.860> put<00:02:25.340> half

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
all those people have suggested put half

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.160 
all those people have suggested put half
block<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.120> they<00:02:26.240> weren't<00:02:26.390> drowned<00:02:26.690> what<00:02:26.930> but

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
block so they weren't drowned what but

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.800 
block so they weren't drowned what but
is<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.500> possible<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:28.760> can't<00:02:29.000> physically<00:02:29.510> do

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
is it possible we can't physically do

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.050 
is it possible we can't physically do
that<00:02:30.050> because<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:33.530> put<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> half<00:02:34.190> put<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> half

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that because we put a half put a half

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.760 
that because we put a half put a half
block<00:02:35.330> down<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:35.810> put<00:02:35.870> water<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.440> top<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.620> it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
block down and we put water on top of it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.230 
block down and we put water on top of it
the<00:02:36.920> water<00:02:37.100> would<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.400> overflow<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:40.240> yeah

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
the water would just overflow so yeah

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.290 
the water would just overflow so yeah
always<00:02:41.450> able<00:02:41.840> flowed<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.170> outside<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.940> I'm

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
always able flowed the outside and I'm

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.980 
always able flowed the outside and I'm
wondering<00:02:44.570> actually<00:02:46.450> there<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.630> way<00:02:47.720> around

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
wondering actually there is a way around

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.560 
wondering actually there is a way around
that<00:02:48.440> actually<00:02:48.620> if<00:02:49.040> we<00:02:49.100> build<00:02:49.550> up<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:50.030> wall<00:02:50.060> high

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
that actually if we build up a wall high

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.470 
that actually if we build up a wall high
around<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> beach<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.580> we<00:02:52.850> place<00:02:53.180> half

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
around the beach and then we place half

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.740 
around the beach and then we place half
blocks<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.260> then<00:02:54.350> place<00:02:54.560> water<00:02:54.860> on<00:02:55.040> top<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.370> it

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
blocks and then place water on top of it

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.240 
blocks and then place water on top of it
the<00:02:56.750> clay<00:02:56.990> men<00:02:57.200> won't<00:02:57.410> be<00:02:57.530> able<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.800> drown<00:02:58.010> I

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
the clay men won't be able to drown I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.660 
the clay men won't be able to drown I
don't<00:02:58.430> think<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.530> don't<00:03:00.530> think<00:03:00.740> I'm<00:03:01.280> not<00:03:01.430> sure
