00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.919
 plane 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.600
 hello to all now you know that they are mysteries of 68 and this episode dedicated 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.369
 to machine movements 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.150
 but before continuing we reveal the test answers of the previous episode 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 I think there will be a few minutes 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.900
 a corpse 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.160
 enrico starting from corpse we have a shot that agreement 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 who is watching on mtv 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 looks behind her 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.030
 despite being shot at eye level as the face is tilted 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.370
 down cedar breast on Saturday 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.390
 start with a car movement that is not a car movement 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.530
 the detachment on the axle is a way to get closer, to move away suddenly 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.230
 to the action it is very different to use the broken cart a modelist click e 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.490
 you see. avigilon a spectator taking him by the hand, one notices explicitly 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.640
 which is another that is keeping you tied 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.970
 now that I'm approaching this speed 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.970
 now I'll show you this or that 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.940
 it is a movement that visually shows that the protagonist is aware of 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 something he could not love or listen to 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.200
 also visually show what happens when something afyacht all 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 sudden consciousness of the subject 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.880
 4 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.649
 I drive glue on if the director of the first alcohol campaign widens the field of vision 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.740
 in this way it softens posted on la7d 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.310
 last remark on detachment on la7 that although the impression of approaching - 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.049
 shooting must be done at a different angle 20 if the camera 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.400
 had not been moved there will be problems of visual continuity 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.760
 but it always depends on what we want to convey 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.730
 europe seed of machine movements 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.819
 view 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.349
 a general view of the surrounding space is called behind the wheel - yes 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.519
 a childbirth space starts again without a specific point of interest 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.159
 causing the camera on the stand now a shot in which 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.030
 the viewer guided by an inter movement of the frame is called 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.059
 overview follow we see some examples 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.189
 these shots begin with an illustrative overview but the tasks, but 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 he became a similar anime 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.859
 that interest only that at the end widens 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.209
 showing 2 while standing 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.209
 ambulance 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.179
 this is another suggestive follow overview 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.450
 here the character moves keeping the same distance from the black edges 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.389
 pruning 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.509
 the objects around the child are those that emphasize min. 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.669
 the speed of the overview is determined by the purpose to be invested 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:08.709
 an overview of 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.080
 at the beginning of a sequence it can mechanically suggest the viewer 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.299
 awaits you 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.899
 I ran something that must happen 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.190
 the viewer waiting 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.980
 at the end of a sequence, instead, a dental overview will fall out 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.000
 mechanical attention by moving to the opposite extreme can be done one 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.319
 overview so fast 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.189
 the image becomes a distinct machine this type of framing is called 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.169
 slap or mail overview and can serve as mailed to pass by 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.379
 place to the other 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.379
 in a slightly naive style 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.539
 and now let's move on to dolly is comparable amantadine 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:50.849
 that you can raise and lower to go left and right 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.539
 courses of a comment. accurate ebay 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.539
 dangerously of nothing as you owe it anyway 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.939
 since the machine has one end of the arm on which it is mounted e 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.439
 easy to think that movements up and down thanks to the invitation the oven weapon 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.659
 a cake some nights usually like in this case used in Italy 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.409
 play at 4 to register 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.719
 to move from a self-timer plan to rooms and travel 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.329
 Hi guys 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.749
 Hello 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:26.080
 in this other case we see from mario exaggerated as you have rightly 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.449
 that is, he seems to be the protagonist who sits 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.669
 thing 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.470
 eural singing rods is a device that allows the operator to walk 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.210
 jump up the stairs 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.680
 in fact, the camera also shows mood swings 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.330
 and this happens through the shock absorbers I now show you the first 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.979
 constipated also was built 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.139
 in this case we see that the operator as well as having the TV camps sitting on 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.260
 a wheelchair 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.880
 some replace the land with the filcams without realizing the 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.089
 obvious differences in the condominium 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.469
 the fundamental difference is that the attention that is with the filcams 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.659
 fluctuating so it is impossible to produce as with the covers 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.339
 in movement strictly works 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.339
 I say that here is the child who runs 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.889
 well 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.680
 in the people just seen, the fluctuating effect is published 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.990
 if you put them on the wheelchair you can also say that the effect of 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.040
 summer carrying shadow 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.840
 because it is unlikely to forget that there is someone running with 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.880
 The protagonist 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.880
 what a fruit together with him climbing the stairs 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.900
 and now we move on to the cart 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.139
 because it produces the descriptive October 4 that they discover very little 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.969
 something 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.479
 a cart how movement too precise and constant to be the motto of a 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.400
 person 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.520
 in the event that the movement is very slow and almost imperceptible 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.330
 internal allows the viewer's attention to grow without it 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.129
 necessarily this is noticed 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.040
 and now we conclude with the v the TV movement 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.119
 it is exactly comparable to that of an elevator 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:44.639
 ahahah top down not otherwise lateral 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.870
 it has no forward bunny movements this kind of hard online movement 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.870
 he can't do it 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.599
 sky site free crash 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:02.499
 no you won't have things 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.789
 on the karst the sleeping cards meet part of the cast 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:10.869
 verdict 

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:13.869
 10 and the city fox 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:17.589
 Dr. 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:19.229
 I understood perfectly 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:23.569
 well for today it is all I apologize for the brevity I am sorry that today there is not 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:27.610
 text for any question regarding the lesson sent a video of 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.919
 answer below 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.629
 during the next installments I will publish of destination and as usual if 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:36.050
 you want you can send me something with a private message hello to everyone from 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.909
