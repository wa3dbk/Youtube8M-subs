family resemblance because it's tailed

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.850

almost<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.390> same<00:00:49.600> that's<00:00:50.110> up<00:00:50.320> not<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.680> draw

almost the same that's up not to draw

you're<00:00:52.540> looking<00:00:52.780> at<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.960> 19<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:53.530> let's<00:00:53.710> look

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
you're looking at the 19 so let's look

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.189 
you're looking at the 19 so let's look
at<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.070> differences<00:00:54.629> wheelbase<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.809> sixteen

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
at the differences wheelbase is sixteen

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.840 
at the differences wheelbase is sixteen
ninety<00:00:56.530> millimeters<00:00:56.710> which<00:00:57.220> is<00:00:57.370> 20<00:00:57.699> ml

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
ninety millimeters which is 20 ml

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.380 
ninety millimeters which is 20 ml
shorter<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:59.019> seat<00:00:59.290> height<00:00:59.699> 716<00:01:00.699> millimeters

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
shorter the seat height 716 millimeters

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.900 
shorter the seat height 716 millimeters
namely<00:01:01.780> millimeters<00:01:02.260> shorter<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:03.250> bias<00:01:03.489> here

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
namely millimeters shorter the bias here

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.420 
namely millimeters shorter the bias here
of<00:01:04.330> 20<00:01:04.690> miles<00:01:04.869> closer<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.619> seat<00:01:05.860> which<00:01:06.220> in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
of 20 miles closer to the seat which in

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.600 
of 20 miles closer to the seat which in
ton<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:07.119> 20<00:01:07.570> mils<00:01:07.900> closer<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.530> pig<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.520> the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
ton is 20 mils closer to the pig so the

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.460 
ton is 20 mils closer to the pig so the
rating<00:01:09.880> positions<00:01:10.300> a<00:01:10.420> lot<00:01:10.630> more<00:01:10.810> compact<00:01:11.289> than

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
rating positions a lot more compact than

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.830 
rating positions a lot more compact than
the<00:01:11.530> 109<00:01:12.070> but<00:01:12.759> because<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> sapelo<00:01:13.479> cruiser

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
the 109 but because the sapelo cruiser

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.020 
the 109 but because the sapelo cruiser
still<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.560> bit<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.890> stretch<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.490> bar<00:01:15.670> so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
still a bit of a stretch to the bar so

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.430 
still a bit of a stretch to the bar so
shorter<00:01:16.360> riders<00:01:16.660> may<00:01:16.780> want<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.050> look<00:01:17.170> at<00:01:17.320> that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
shorter riders may want to look at that

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.260 
shorter riders may want to look at that
before<00:01:17.800> they<00:01:17.920> buy<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.789> first<00:01:19.000> thing<00:01:19.180> you'll

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
before they buy the first thing you'll

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.730 
before they buy the first thing you'll
notice<00:01:19.390> when<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.750> come<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.050> staffer<00:01:20.470> on<00:01:20.560> in

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
notice when you come the staffer on in

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.270 
notice when you come the staffer on in
90

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
90

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.850 
90
so<00:01:21.520> quite<00:01:21.850> at<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.210> for<00:01:22.660> a<00:01:22.690> v-twin<00:01:23.110> cruiser<00:01:23.410> it's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
so quite at it for a v-twin cruiser it's

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.639 
so quite at it for a v-twin cruiser it's
really<00:01:24.430> quiet<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:25.030> may<00:01:25.509> appeal<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.960> some<00:01:26.229> but

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
really quiet that may appeal to some but

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.499 
really quiet that may appeal to some but
most<00:01:26.860> trees<00:01:27.100> are<00:01:27.220> on<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.340> zonal<00:01:27.820> like<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.300> beach

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
most trees are on a zonal like the beach

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.300 
most trees are on a zonal like the beach
one<00:01:28.690> normal<00:01:29.050> low<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.770> these<00:01:29.860> stands<00:01:30.220> will

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
one normal low and these stands will

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.969 
one normal low and these stands will
probably<00:01:30.640> get<00:01:30.729> replaced<00:01:31.289> now<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.350> name<00:01:32.590> 90

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
probably get replaced now the name 90

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
probably get replaced now the name 90
here<00:01:33.220> at<00:01:33.550> runs<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:34.200> 1462<00:01:35.200> CC<00:01:35.770> liquid-cooled

almost<00:01:40.149> 20<00:01:40.479> kgs<00:01:40.869> later<00:01:41.140> than<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.470> 109<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.790> it's

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
almost 20 kgs later than the 109 so it's

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.020 
almost 20 kgs later than the 109 so it's
much<00:01:43.180> more<00:01:43.210> maneuverable<00:01:43.750> at<00:01:44.140> lower<00:01:44.290> speeds

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
much more maneuverable at lower speeds

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.700 
much more maneuverable at lower speeds
helping<00:01:46.030> out<00:01:46.180> there<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.689> at<00:01:47.170> higher<00:01:47.320> speeds

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
helping out there and at higher speeds

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.249 
helping out there and at higher speeds
is<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.159> rear<00:01:48.310> tire<00:01:48.630> 200<00:01:49.630> mil<00:01:49.780> wave<00:01:50.020> rear

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.490 
on nine and that makes the handling so
