00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.559 
get this into its parking place here and
maneuver<00:02:34.360> around<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.780> Christ<00:02:35.110> there

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.740 

yeah<00:02:45.010> very<00:02:45.340> good<00:02:45.610> oil<00:02:45.850> pressure<00:02:45.970> still<00:02:48.750> but

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
yeah very good oil pressure still but

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.780 
yeah very good oil pressure still but
this<00:02:49.900> engine<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.740> such<00:02:51.070> good<00:02:51.310> shape<00:02:51.370> in

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
this engine is in such good shape in

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.060 
this engine is in such good shape in
spite<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.270> car<00:02:52.630> bein<00:02:53.070> physically

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
spite of this car bein physically

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.450 
spite of this car bein physically
battered<00:02:54.400> before<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.060> got<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.800> engine<00:02:57.280> is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
battered before I got it the engine is

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.790 
battered before I got it the engine is
in<00:02:57.640> great<00:02:58.180> great<00:02:58.660> shape<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.320> think<00:02:59.590> that's

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
in great great shape and I think that's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.320 
in great great shape and I think that's
actually<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.430> don't<00:03:00.490> know<00:03:00.640> if<00:03:00.670> that's<00:03:00.910> actual

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
actually I don't know if that's actual

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.780 
actually I don't know if that's actual
mileage<00:03:01.570> or<00:03:01.960> offence<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.770> that's<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
mileage or offence if that's in the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.460 
mileage or offence if that's in the
hundreds<00:03:06.450> hundreds<00:03:07.450> hundred<00:03:07.930> thousands

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
hundreds hundreds hundred thousands

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.890 
hundreds hundreds hundred thousands
rather<00:03:09.840> okay<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:11.410> got<00:03:12.330> got<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.570> car

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
rather okay so we got got that car

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.950 
rather okay so we got got that car
that's<00:03:14.110> parking<00:03:14.680> space<00:03:15.010> now<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.550> time<00:03:15.850> to

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
that's parking space now it's time to

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.900 
that's parking space now it's time to
start<00:03:16.960> up<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.170> Grand<00:03:17.410> Marquis<00:03:17.890> yeah

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.190 

and<00:03:21.910> I'm<00:03:22.120> trying<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.450> think<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.780> when<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:22.960> did

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
and I'm trying to think of when I did

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.470 
and I'm trying to think of when I did
the<00:03:23.350> carburetor<00:03:23.860> rebuild<00:03:24.400> job<00:03:24.670> on<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:25.120> it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the carburetor rebuild job on this it

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.730 
the carburetor rebuild job on this it
was<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:28.330> was<00:03:28.480> not<00:03:28.660> too<00:03:28.930> long<00:03:29.140> ago<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:34.230> need<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.470> I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
was it was not too long ago I need to I

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.680 
was it was not too long ago I need to I
have<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.400> blanket<00:03:36.880> on<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.060> seat<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.660> I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
have this blanket on the seat here I

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.330 
have this blanket on the seat here I
have<00:03:37.960> to<00:03:38.080> readjust<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:41.190> all<00:03:42.190> right<00:03:43.170> almost

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
have to readjust it all right almost

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.860 
have to readjust it all right almost
300,000<00:03:45.340> miles<00:03:45.490> two<00:03:46.030> hundred<00:03:46.360> ninety<00:03:46.660> seven

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
300,000 miles two hundred ninety seven

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.890 
300,000 miles two hundred ninety seven
thousand<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:49.420> it's<00:03:49.840> about<00:03:50.170> 49<00:03:51.570> degrees<00:03:52.570> out

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
thousand and it's about 49 degrees out

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.860 
thousand and it's about 49 degrees out
here<00:03:54.120> I'm<00:03:55.120> going<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.420> set<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.750> choke<00:03:57.630> see<00:03:58.630> if<00:03:58.720> I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
here I'm going to set the choke see if I

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.320 
here I'm going to set the choke see if I
can<00:03:59.080> get<00:03:59.950> some<00:04:00.160> gas<00:04:00.340> into<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.790> float<00:04:01.120> ball

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
can get some gas into the float ball

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.960 
can get some gas into the float ball
this<00:04:02.290> may<00:04:02.560> start<00:04:02.950> on<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.280> first<00:04:03.489> turn<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
this may start on the first turn of the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.600 
this may start on the first turn of the
key<00:04:04.270> I<00:04:04.480> don't<00:04:04.720> know

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.660 

now<00:04:09.210> it's<00:04:09.480> going<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.720> take<00:04:09.960> a<00:04:09.990> little<00:04:10.230> bit

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
now it's going to take a little bit

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:20.959 
now it's going to take a little bit
better<00:04:11.670> fill<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.090> float<00:04:12.360> ball

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.610 

okay<00:04:21.969> hopefully<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.689> didn't<00:04:22.960> end<00:04:23.080> up<00:04:23.169> flooding

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
okay hopefully I didn't end up flooding

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.240 
okay hopefully I didn't end up flooding
it<00:04:24.900> sometimes<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.229> just<00:04:26.439> unfortunate<00:04:27.219> a

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
it sometimes it's just unfortunate a

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.839 
it sometimes it's just unfortunate a
little<00:04:27.490> bit<00:04:27.639> difficult<00:04:27.879> to<00:04:28.270> start<00:04:29.280> here<00:04:30.280> we<00:04:30.430> go

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
little bit difficult to start here we go

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:40.520 
little bit difficult to start here we go
now<00:04:31.539> it's<00:04:31.780> tried<00:04:36.030> there<00:04:37.030> we<00:04:37.150> go<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:39.180> need<00:04:40.180> to

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
now it's tried there we go I need to

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.320 
now it's tried there we go I need to
adjust<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.979> choke<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.520> optimize<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:45.180> do<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.270> a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
adjust the choke to optimize it do it a

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.070 
adjust the choke to optimize it do it a
little<00:04:46.509> bit<00:04:46.689> of<00:04:46.780> gas<00:04:46.990> here<00:04:47.939> just<00:04:48.939> let<00:04:49.780> off<00:04:49.930> the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
little bit of gas here just let off the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:05:00.119 
little bit of gas here just let off the
choke<00:04:50.319> just<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.770> touch

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:00.129 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.570 

okay<00:05:00.759> so<00:05:00.819> I've<00:05:01.479> got<00:05:01.659> it<00:05:01.839> got<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.110> running<00:05:02.439> it's

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.209 

it<00:05:06.580> does<00:05:07.149> it<00:05:07.749> has<00:05:07.959> never<00:05:08.259> let<00:05:08.619> me<00:05:08.649> down<00:05:08.769> not

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
it does it has never let me down not

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.309 
it does it has never let me down not
starting<00:05:09.729> up<00:05:09.909> but<00:05:10.239> unfortunately<00:05:11.019> when<00:05:11.169> it's

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
starting up but unfortunately when it's

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.909 
starting up but unfortunately when it's
cold<00:05:12.089> it<00:05:13.089> can<00:05:13.209> be<00:05:13.389> a<00:05:13.419> little<00:05:13.599> persnickety<00:05:13.929> but

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
cold it can be a little persnickety but

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.439 
cold it can be a little persnickety but
I<00:05:14.949> don't<00:05:15.279> care<00:05:15.519> just<00:05:15.699> as<00:05:15.879> long<00:05:16.089> as<00:05:16.300> it

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
I don't care just as long as it

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.899 
I don't care just as long as it
eventually<00:05:16.719> starts<00:05:17.289> up<00:05:17.499> and<00:05:17.679> it<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:18.339> is<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> lot

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
eventually starts up and it it is a lot

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.519 
eventually starts up and it it is a lot
better<00:05:19.179> than<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:19.509> has<00:05:19.719> been<00:05:20.019> at<00:05:20.080> some<00:05:20.439> times

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
better than it has been at some times

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.559 
better than it has been at some times
that<00:05:23.529> Chrysler<00:05:23.949> where<00:05:24.339> this<00:05:24.429> new<00:05:24.639> carter<00:05:25.029> BBD

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
that Chrysler where this new carter BBD

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.839 
that Chrysler where this new carter BBD
is<00:05:25.719> really<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.199> cold<00:05:26.469> starting<00:05:27.009> champion<00:05:27.610> it

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
is really the cold starting champion it

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.290 
is really the cold starting champion it
will<00:05:28.179> start<00:05:28.479> up<00:05:28.659> in<00:05:28.889> 20-degree<00:05:29.889> weather<00:05:30.300> just

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
will start up in 20-degree weather just

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.969 
will start up in 20-degree weather just
with<00:05:31.449> a<00:05:31.479> press<00:05:31.809> of<00:05:32.019> the<00:05:32.110> accelerator<00:05:32.769> and

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
with a press of the accelerator and

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.499 
with a press of the accelerator and
setting<00:05:33.309> the<00:05:33.459> automatic<00:05:33.969> choke<00:05:34.209> and<00:05:34.449> the

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
setting the automatic choke and the

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.159 
setting the automatic choke and the
automatic<00:05:34.869> choke<00:05:35.229> keeps<00:05:35.529> it<00:05:35.679> running<00:05:35.769> great

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
automatic choke keeps it running great

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.859 
automatic choke keeps it running great
but<00:05:38.169> it's<00:05:38.349> it's<00:05:38.649> a<00:05:38.800> lot<00:05:39.039> it's<00:05:39.939> got<00:05:40.179> a<00:05:40.209> lot<00:05:40.569> fewer

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:40.869 
but it's it's a lot it's got a lot fewer

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:44.159 
but it's it's a lot it's got a lot fewer
miles<00:05:41.199> on<00:05:41.559> it<00:05:41.589> only<00:05:41.830> about<00:05:42.719> 87,000<00:05:43.719> actual

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
miles on it only about 87,000 actual

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.959 
miles on it only about 87,000 actual
miles<00:05:44.649> this<00:05:44.769> one's<00:05:45.039> nearly<00:05:46.319> 300,000<00:05:47.789> but<00:05:48.789> this

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
miles this one's nearly 300,000 but this

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.839 
miles this one's nearly 300,000 but this
still<00:05:49.330> really<00:05:50.050> does<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.409> job<00:05:50.679> and<00:05:51.129> it's

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
still really does the job and it's

00:05:51.849 --> 00:06:07.490 
still really does the job and it's
running<00:05:52.059> smooth

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.790 

so<00:06:08.500> I'll<00:06:08.650> just<00:06:08.860> let<00:06:09.040> it<00:06:09.190> warm<00:06:09.400> up<00:06:09.640> here<00:06:10.620> push<00:06:11.620> it

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
so I'll just let it warm up here push it

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.510 
so I'll just let it warm up here push it
in<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.950> choke<00:06:12.220> just<00:06:12.520> a<00:06:12.700> touch<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.710> it<00:06:18.160> needs<00:06:18.370> a

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
in the choke just a touch and it needs a

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.360 
in the choke just a touch and it needs a
good<00:06:18.700> vacuuming<00:06:19.360> out<00:06:19.600> but<00:06:19.930> at<00:06:20.020> least<00:06:20.140> I<00:06:20.410> got<00:06:21.310> it

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
good vacuuming out but at least I got it

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.110 
good vacuuming out but at least I got it
pretty<00:06:21.670> well<00:06:21.790> cleaned<00:06:22.240> out<00:06:22.510> of<00:06:22.690> junk

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
pretty well cleaned out of junk

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.030 
pretty well cleaned out of junk
so<00:06:25.120> it'll<00:06:26.460> and<00:06:27.460> it's<00:06:28.180> it's<00:06:29.020> not<00:06:29.260> it's<00:06:29.800> not

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
so it'll and it's it's not it's not

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.360 
so it'll and it's it's not it's not

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
kind of boost it up a little bit I'll

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.590 
kind of boost it up a little bit I'll
know<00:07:13.530> it's<00:07:13.740> time<00:07:14.010> for<00:07:14.430> getting<00:07:15.030> around<00:07:15.180> time

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
for a new engine because the bearings

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.150 
for a new engine because the bearings
are<00:07:17.580> just<00:07:17.760> so<00:07:17.940> worn<00:07:18.240> out<00:07:18.590> but<00:07:19.590> I<00:07:19.680> might<00:07:19.890> try<00:07:20.070> to

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
are just so worn out but I might try to

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.250 
are just so worn out but I might try to
see<00:07:20.430> if<00:07:20.550> I<00:07:20.670> can<00:07:20.850> put<00:07:21.030> a<00:07:21.060> 460<00:07:21.870> in<00:07:22.020> this

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.260 
see if I can put a 460 in this

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.340 
see if I can put a 460 in this
eventually<00:07:23.190> but<00:07:23.790> we'll<00:07:24.180> just<00:07:24.210> as<00:07:24.900> long<00:07:25.110> as

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.350 
eventually but we'll just as long as

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.800 
eventually but we'll just as long as
it'll<00:07:25.590> keep<00:07:25.770> on<00:07:26.010> running

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.320 

I'll<00:07:29.320> just<00:07:29.500> keep<00:07:29.710> keep<00:07:30.250> the<00:07:30.400> old<00:07:30.520> engine<00:07:30.760> going

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.330 
I'll just keep keep the old engine going

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.020 
I'll just keep keep the old engine going
so<00:07:31.780> there's<00:07:32.140> the<00:07:32.440> Grand<00:07:33.160> Marquis<00:07:33.670> and<00:07:33.940> the

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
so there's the Grand Marquis and the

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.510 
so there's the Grand Marquis and the
Lincoln
