00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.320
 and 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.460
 very good to all beings and boys and 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.890
 minus another new video of gta 5 and this 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.540
 once I bring you another new vehicle is 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.150
 success because we are you can call me 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.920
 car is a rustic tractor that 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.290
 The truth is that I found it very very 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.790
 curious not the subject of part that is 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.140
 made of wood that I actually think that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.670
 It is made of wood when we see well 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.620
 Well, we'll see it, not what it's made of 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.040
 but it's very funny I dad very at 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.170
 leakage 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.340
 first everything as always I put it 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.980
 the location that I have already marked 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.930
 It is located right near the point where 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.610
 you also find the murderer 's 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.710
 8 Freddy Krueger to know him 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.879
 better and is looking at the state part 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.470
 up here here would be freddy theme 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.780
 krueger for this part of here and 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.879
 we are still like annoying road and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.799
 it's around here and we have to go up 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.970
 go up and deviate us along paths that 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.589
 there's here I 'm going to continue marking 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.089
 so you can see it better for this 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.650
 sort of way to the right and 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.840
 we have to take the road also that 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.920
 it takes us above must not there 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.560
 go more or less until this point is 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 find like a rustic tractor tucked 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.590
 in some weeds without very very rare but 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.360
 good guys I hope you like it we are going to 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.850
 go there to see that your street goes to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.280
 tractor 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.600
 we finally got this tractor the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.400
 truth is that it has cost me a lot 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.810
 get to him because he appears 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.640
 totally random so if you want 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 coming for him is going to cost you a little 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.159
 because I have gone to the third 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.619
 time the metric that official three times 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.060
 but finally here it is to put right in 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.040
 front of the box that I'm going to 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.520
 teach this location again just 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.659
 here in the tree 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.299
 we have our little tractor 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.909
 specialized is made of wood said 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.369
 I that is a yes yes and has wheels of 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.920
 wood is a scary rustic tractor that 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.230
 escape and take a little the course has a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.940
 cradle 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.830
 and the speed very well you are seeing 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.220
 with the wooden wheels and surely 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.510
 the engine is made with two mice 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.970
 running on a wheel so that these 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.100
 move the axle of the wheel and you can 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.130
 look we need sugar I put an 8 with 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.690
 the one that you have a little trick a 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.250
 small secret car with if you want 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.520
 come to do a little mill with a 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.080
 says look that you drive a tractor 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.760
 iron roll diva fuck I'm going with the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.200
 tractor out there while screwing 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.390
 a kind of dogs nothing has not 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.800
 animal knowledge we stretch the truth 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.600
 is that we are going to do this this runs 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.400
 this correntinos 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.319
 this goes like shit 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.439
 and if we take anything so what we're going to 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.450
 do let's go for good 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.090
 partially second of the kilos the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.470
 wheel and how it moves not the speed is 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.700
 lousy expected something more speed not 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.739
 what we are going to do suicide we are not going to 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.420
 throw us by the lighthouse does not stop it 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.950
 conversation four times there the good 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.780
 that we get the tractor which local 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.890
 to kill myself and I tell you if you come to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.090
 equally does not appear the first we 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.489
 will appear the second but the third 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.900
 because it's besides being a weird car 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.879
 will appear theoretically but right in that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.409
 point so good here I say goodbye 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.939

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.530
 very much to the channel that we see ourselves a 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.040
 big hug I got tractor and 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.040

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.220
 more than tractor 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.220
