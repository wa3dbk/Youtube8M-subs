just<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.360> time<00:02:15.510> such

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
just like that it's about the time such

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.910 
just like that it's about the time such
have<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.230> get<00:02:16.470> pretty<00:02:17.160> flex<00:02:18.350> which<00:02:19.350> I'm<00:02:19.500> having

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
have to get pretty flex which I'm having

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.820 
have to get pretty flex which I'm having
right<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.280> when<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
right now when you can have to do so the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.309 
right now when you can have to do so the
gag<00:02:23.069> reflex<00:02:23.720> happens<00:02:24.720> when<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.930> approach<00:02:25.290> it

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
gag reflex happens when you approach it

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.680 
gag reflex happens when you approach it
from<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.890> outer<00:02:26.100> perimeter<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:27.300> want<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.569> keep

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
from the outer perimeter we want to keep

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.479 
from the outer perimeter we want to keep
it<00:02:27.840> away<00:02:27.989> from<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.260> door<00:02:28.500> now<00:02:29.130> probably

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
it away from the door now probably

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.970 
it away from the door now probably
because<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.269> throwing<00:02:30.510> over<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.900> by<00:02:31.680> some

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
because it's throwing over it by some

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.880 
because it's throwing over it by some
under<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.700> door<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.870> I'm<00:02:34.230> thinking<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.650> try

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
under the door so I'm thinking we try

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.400 
under the door so I'm thinking we try
need<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> get<00:02:35.280> some<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.610> bag<00:02:36.320> under<00:02:37.320> the
