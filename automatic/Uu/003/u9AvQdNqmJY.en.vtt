00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I would say the soldier class is your

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.300 
I would say the soldier class is your
most<00:00:18.660> basic<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.350> well-rounded<00:00:19.949> character

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
class had a volume in the game and I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
class had a volume in the game and I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
that's mostly because we make him equip

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.439 
that's mostly because we make him equip
a<00:01:00.800> +8<00:01:01.800> ammo<00:01:02.129> regeneration<00:01:02.609> class<00:01:03.000> mileage
