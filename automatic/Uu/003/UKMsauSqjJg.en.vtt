 that I had been selected already 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.710

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.980
 they can give me and behind all of that 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.260
 that we see on the screen, because all the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.240

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.430
 full of people good talent 2 is hugo 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.550
 Devana then I think that for me 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.080
 program was the best school the best 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.390
 university I studied every 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.950
 social communication in the Catholic and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.160
 then I left and I could not could not 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.860
 finish it and 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.710
 I started studying that performance I came to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.840
 Miami and I went to the academy in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.970
 adriana barraza who is an actress 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.309
 Mexican very well known nominated to the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.970
 Oscar and when he saw me acting he told me 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.070
 Wow 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.750
 I want you to be in my academy but 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 you're going to be a scholarship and for me it was something 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 incredible I said wow this is the honor 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.400
 largest in the world and study with her 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 I finished my studies with her and now 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.420
 I'm with hector zabaleta if I continue 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.840
 studying to continue studying until 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.610
 when you can because here I think 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.369
 that this is a race to prepare 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 every day of not falling asleep because if not the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.990
 that was a little bit further back well and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.119
 happens to you in this race, nothing is easy 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 I did modeling as I mentioned here 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.619
 in venezuela but 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.570
 I think that is not worth much does not tell you 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.090
 nothing but show now what you can 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.250
 do here there is so much competition and there 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.189
 we face less we face 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.610
 all nationalities to a subject of 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.409
 accent that they demand that they look at I think that 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.670
 what you could have done here I 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.650
 I think it's for you it gives you the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.470
 tools to you 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.680
 I miss everything 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.680
 venezuela is 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.060
 well in my country and never the same in another 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.340
 place 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.520
 but I would like to go back to school 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.069
 where I grew up I do not lose faith I do not 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.690
 lose faith I do not lose hope 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.200
 I always say it, I left for a little while 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.660
 but my heart is still here and my fight 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.709
 Follow my fight, follow me, not me, though 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.110
 be there I do not fall asleep I'm not one of these 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.410
 people who say and I say it with all 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.410
 responsibility 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.409
 I am an artist, I do not have why 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.140
 talk about politics that answer me 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.510
 it seems the most absurd thing in the world we are 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.519
 Venezuelans are already going through something 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.920
 very complicated and I think we should all 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.150
 have a clear position is the one that 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.000
 you are from a perfect side defends what 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.750
 you are the other defends what I am not my 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.659
 inside I do not wear that I always have 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.939
 been more model commercial model is from 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.859
 My passion since I was a little girl 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.859
 who dream of being in this environment 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.650
 fight fight fight fight in everything 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.010
 achieve with perseverance focus 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.120
 I'm short and I get to do things 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.560
 wonderful in my career that I in 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.689
 some time I did not expect it and that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.639
 Many people told me you will not be able to 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.590
 you have the size has nothing to do 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.780
 when when you do what you do with 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.900
 love with passion look at things come to 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.900
 you
