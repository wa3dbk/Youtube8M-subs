hi guys I've noticed that from this
video<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.719> my<00:00:10.050> unboxing<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.490> overlook<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
video of my unboxing and overlook of the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.150 
video of my unboxing and overlook of the
HP<00:00:13.259> pavilion<00:00:14.009> dv6<00:00:15.080> that<00:00:16.080> I've<00:00:16.470> had<00:00:16.740> quite<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
HP pavilion dv6 that I've had quite a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.420 
HP pavilion dv6 that I've had quite a
few<00:00:17.520> views<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.779> know<00:00:18.900> not<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> huge

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
few views you know not not at a huge

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.970 
few views you know not not at a huge
amount<00:00:22.070> 1745<00:00:23.070> as<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> time<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.570> video

but<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.760> I've<00:00:26.880> been<00:00:27.090> getting<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.349> of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
but what I've been getting are a lot of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.730 
but what I've been getting are a lot of
questions<00:00:29.220> about<00:00:29.640> how<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.960> how<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> works

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
questions about how it's how it works

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.360 
questions about how it's how it works
does<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> play<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.390> HD<00:00:33.870> video<00:00:34.250> has<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
does it play you know HD video has it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.950 
does it play you know HD video has it
given<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.670> any<00:00:35.850> problem<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.590> must<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
given you any problem so there must be a

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.470 
given you any problem so there must be a
lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> these<00:00:40.200> core<00:00:40.710> 2<00:00:41.010> duo<00:00:41.059> machines<00:00:42.059> still

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
lot of these core 2 duo machines still

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.500 
lot of these core 2 duo machines still
around<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.399> they're<00:00:44.399> probably<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:45.149> for

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
around and they're probably going for

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.750 
around and they're probably going for
good<00:00:45.660> prices<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.379> should<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.890> researched<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
good prices I should have researched the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.869 
good prices I should have researched the
prices<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.510> guess<00:00:49.350> before<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.860> did<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
prices I guess before I did this but I

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.060 
prices I guess before I did this but I
thought<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.539> would<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> quick<00:00:52.320> video<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
thought I would do a quick video and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.110 
thought I would do a quick video and
just<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.120> reiterate<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.350> specs<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
just to reiterate the specs of this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.070 
just to reiterate the specs of this
machine<00:00:58.489> it's<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.789> four<00:01:00.420> gigabytes<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.520> ddr3

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
machine it's got four gigabytes of ddr3

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
machine it's got four gigabytes of ddr3
1066<00:01:05.450> which<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.140> very<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.070> know

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
1066 which is but you know very you know

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940 
1066 which is but you know very you know
pretty<00:01:08.820> good<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> six-hundred-dollar

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pretty good for a six-hundred-dollar

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.789 
pretty good for a six-hundred-dollar
laptop<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> time<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> got<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.619> laptop

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
laptop at the time I got it the laptop

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.359 
laptop at the time I got it the laptop
probably<00:01:14.670> goes<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.320> quite<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> bit<00:01:16.590> less<00:01:16.920> now

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
probably goes for quite a bit less now

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940 
probably goes for quite a bit less now
or<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.689> less<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.320> imagine<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> could

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
or a little less I imagine you could

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
or a little less I imagine you could
pick<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.520> five<00:01:20.909> hundred<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pick one up for five hundred or so the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.749 
pick one up for five hundred or so the
quick<00:01:25.229> answer<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> haven't<00:01:26.340> had<00:01:26.610> any

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
quick answer is I haven't had any

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.590 
quick answer is I haven't had any
problems<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.869> fact<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.250> over<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
problems with it in fact it's over it's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
problems with it in fact it's over it's
a<00:01:31.369> it's<00:01:32.369> done<00:01:32.670> far<00:01:33.090> over<00:01:33.600> what<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> expected<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
a it's done far over what I expected it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.359 
a it's done far over what I expected it
to<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:36.170> as<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.250> an

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
to do as you can see there it's got an

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.270 
to do as you can see there it's got an
HDMI<00:01:39.090> two<00:01:39.810> USB<00:01:40.530> ports<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.290> doubles

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
HDMI two USB ports this one here doubles

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.080 
HDMI two USB ports this one here doubles
as<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> II<00:01:45.470> SATA<00:01:46.470> port<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.490> VGA<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
as a II SATA port you know your VGA you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.399 
as a II SATA port you know your VGA you
can<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> monitor<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.840> does<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.380> a

the core 2 duo t6600 in this one is

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.850 
the core 2 duo t6600 in this one is
probably<00:02:17.980> its<00:02:18.370> weak<00:02:18.610> point<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.260> have

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
probably its weak point but I have

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.570 
probably its weak point but I have
