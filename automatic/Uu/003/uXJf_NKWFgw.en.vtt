00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.720 
except for where you get the file from
this<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.230> little<00:03:29.470> bit<00:03:29.620> more<00:03:29.769> harder<00:03:30.220> instead

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
this is a little bit more harder instead

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.250 
this is a little bit more harder instead
of<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:31.000> doing<00:03:31.090> this<00:03:31.360> which<00:03:31.570> spokes<00:03:31.870> people

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
of just doing this which spokes people

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:41.340 
of just doing this which spokes people
do<00:03:32.560> they<00:03:33.400> do<00:03:34.170> %<00:03:35.170> app<00:03:35.910> data<00:03:37.680> percent<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:40.350> click

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
do they do % app data percent and click

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.840 
do they do % app data percent and click
on<00:03:41.470> minecraft<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.100> then<00:03:42.190> click<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.459> saves

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
on minecraft and then click on saves

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.880 
on minecraft and then click on saves
which<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.780> that's<00:03:43.900> an<00:03:44.080> easy<00:03:44.380> weight<00:03:44.620> but

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
which is that's an easy weight but

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.370 
which is that's an easy weight but
instead<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.780> actually<00:03:46.930> go

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
instead of this you have to actually go

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.650 
instead of this you have to actually go
through<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:48.820> ton<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.060> stuff<00:03:49.330> like<00:03:49.540> you

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
through a ton of stuff like you

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.270 
through a ton of stuff like you
