at the bottom very nice examples with

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.999 
at the bottom very nice examples with
almost<00:01:14.479> proof<00:01:14.810> like<00:01:15.080> services<00:01:15.679> of<00:01:15.859> these

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
almost proof like services of these

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.029 
almost proof like services of these
small<00:01:17.020> coins<00:01:18.020> here<00:01:19.030> very<00:01:20.030> very<00:01:20.119> nice<00:01:20.950> but<00:01:21.950> an

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
small coins here very very nice but an

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.359 
small coins here very very nice but an
interesting<00:01:22.219> story<00:01:22.700> about<00:01:22.909> these<00:01:23.299> pieces<00:01:23.689> is

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
interesting story about these pieces is

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.370 
interesting story about these pieces is
that<00:01:25.369> they<00:01:25.549> were<00:01:25.609> sanctioned<00:01:26.329> and<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:27.170> guess

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
that they were sanctioned and I guess

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.260 
that they were sanctioned and I guess
they<00:01:27.560> were<00:01:27.619> tested<00:01:28.249> essayed<00:01:28.880> by<00:01:28.909> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
they were tested essayed by the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.910 
they were tested essayed by the

cent<00:02:19.740> very<00:02:20.740> very<00:02:20.980> interesting<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.880> proof

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
cent very very interesting it's a proof

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.290 
cent very very interesting it's a proof
like<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.750> silver-plated<00:02:25.750> copper

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
like but this is silver-plated copper

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.640 
like but this is silver-plated copper
which<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.540> fastening<00:02:29.020> when<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.200> say<00:02:29.380> well<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
which is fastening when you say well it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
which is fastening when you say well it
looks<00:02:29.830> golden<00:02:30.250> color<00:02:30.520> well<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.150> because

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
looks golden color well that's because

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.610 
looks golden color well that's because
after<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.730> was<00:02:33.880> silver<00:02:34.180> plated<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.750> was<00:02:34.930> plated

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
after it was silver plated it was plated

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.790 
after it was silver plated it was plated
with<00:02:35.740> gold<00:02:36.510> very<00:02:37.510> interesting<00:02:38.230> very
