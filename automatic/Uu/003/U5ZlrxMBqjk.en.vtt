piano<00:02:19.370> wire<00:02:19.640> kills<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.510> playthrough<00:02:21.130> but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
piano wire kills in this playthrough but

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.530 
piano wire kills in this playthrough but
that's<00:02:22.520> one<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> things<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.450> really

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
that's one of the things that is really

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.240 
that's one of the things that is really
a<00:02:25.060> pillar<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.140> look<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.650> image<00:02:28.040> of

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
a pillar of the of the look and image of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.270 
a pillar of the of the look and image of
47<00:02:29.120> when<00:02:30.110> we<00:02:30.200> started<00:02:30.500> with<00:02:30.709> developing<00:02:31.130> this

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
47 when we started with developing this

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.680 
47 when we started with developing this
game<00:02:31.520> we<00:02:31.730> were<00:02:31.850> given<00:02:32.120> carte<00:02:32.300> blanche<00:02:32.540> to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
game we were given carte blanche to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.170 
game we were given carte blanche to
basically<00:02:33.050> push<00:02:33.470> all<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.920> limits<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
basically push all the limits of the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.920 
basically push all the limits of the
game<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:36.050> one<00:02:36.380> things<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.800> we've<00:02:36.920> really

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
game but one things that we've really

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.030 
game but one things that we've really
came<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.050> inclusion<00:02:39.380> really<00:02:39.620> fast<00:02:39.830> was<00:02:40.010> that

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
came to inclusion really fast was that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.760 
came to inclusion really fast was that
the<00:02:40.340> look<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:40.760> 47<00:02:41.450> should<00:02:42.050> stay<00:02:42.320> more<00:02:42.590> or<00:02:42.620> less

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
the look of 47 should stay more or less

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.570 
the look of 47 should stay more or less
iconic<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.820> red<00:02:44.000> tie<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.330> black<00:02:44.920> suit<00:02:45.920> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
iconic the red tie the black suit the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.160 
iconic the red tie the black suit the
silver<00:02:47.510> borders<00:02:47.920> those<00:02:48.920> things<00:02:49.130> are<00:02:49.489> are<00:02:50.120> are

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
silver borders those things are are are

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.510 
silver borders those things are are are
iron<00:02:51.170> touched<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.920> course<00:02:52.130> we're<00:02:52.310> going<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
iron touched of course we're going to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.449 
iron touched of course we're going to
push<00:02:53.000> his<00:02:53.330> boundaries<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:54.050> low<00:02:54.709> context<00:02:55.130> so

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
push his boundaries in low context so

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.460 
push his boundaries in low context so
when<00:02:56.239> tech<00:02:56.510> becomes<00:02:56.840> better<00:02:56.989> you're<00:02:57.200> going<00:02:57.350> to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
when tech becomes better you're going to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.500 
when tech becomes better you're going to
have<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> more<00:02:58.160> detailed<00:02:58.610> phase<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.209> better

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
have a more detailed phase and better

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.900 
have a more detailed phase and better
shaders<00:03:00.020> but<00:03:00.920> fundamentally<00:03:01.730> that's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
shaders but fundamentally that's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.540 
shaders but fundamentally that's
untouched<00:03:02.360> also<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.410> piano<00:03:03.739> wire<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.220> as

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
untouched also and the piano wire is as

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.610 
untouched also and the piano wire is as
much<00:03:04.910> an<00:03:05.180> iconic<00:03:05.630> thing<00:03:05.840> as<00:03:06.020> anything<00:03:06.380> else

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
much an iconic thing as anything else

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.130 
much an iconic thing as anything else
especially<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.670> character<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.989> is

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
especially for this character so that is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.010 
especially for this character so that is
in<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.410> game<00:03:09.790> amazing<00:03:10.790> all<00:03:10.940> right<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.690> from<00:03:11.900> an

what is the thing that you're most proud
of<00:03:16.430> for<00:03:16.640> this<00:03:16.790> game<00:03:17.030> from<00:03:17.540> an<00:03:17.720> art<00:03:17.870> standpoint

of for this game from an art standpoint
I<00:03:18.700> am<00:03:19.700> well<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.750> very<00:03:21.350> first<00:03:21.739> out<00:03:22.130> around<00:03:22.760> said

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
I am well the very first out around said

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.250 
I am well the very first out around said
when<00:03:23.299> we<00:03:23.330> started<00:03:23.660> doing<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:23.959> game<00:03:24.170> we

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
when we started doing this game we

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
when we started doing this game we
wanted<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.590> make<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:26.560> hyper-realistic<00:03:27.560> game

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
wanted to make a hyper-realistic game

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.170 
wanted to make a hyper-realistic game
with<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.330> touch<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:29.959> noir<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.970> most

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
with the touch of noir and the most

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.080 
with the touch of noir and the most
important<00:03:32.510> thing<00:03:32.660> for<00:03:32.690> us<00:03:33.049> was<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.680> high

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
important thing for us was that the high

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.570 
important thing for us was that the high
production<00:03:35.090> value<00:03:35.540> felt<00:03:35.840> really<00:03:36.080> high<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.580> I

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
production value felt really high and I

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.090 
production value felt really high and I
think<00:03:37.790> we<00:03:37.910> achieved<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.450> by<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:39.560> combination

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
think we achieved that by a combination

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.470 
think we achieved that by a combination
of<00:03:40.640> extremely<00:03:41.209> high<00:03:41.510> detailed<00:03:41.900> models<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
of extremely high detailed models and a

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.270 
of extremely high detailed models and a
location<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.769> looks<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:45.890> part<00:03:46.040> with

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
location that looks the part with

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.190 
location that looks the part with
beautiful<00:03:46.730> lighting<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.360> textures<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:47.989> are

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
beautiful lighting and textures that are

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.190 
beautiful lighting and textures that are
