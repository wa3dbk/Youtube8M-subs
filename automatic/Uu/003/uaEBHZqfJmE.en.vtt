00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
green you fill the grain in with a

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.629 
green you fill the grain in with a
waterproof<00:04:53.300> resin<00:04:54.300> like<00:04:54.479> this<00:04:55.280> it's<00:04:56.280> not

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
waterproof resin like this it's not

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.670 
waterproof resin like this it's not
going<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:59.419> open<00:05:00.419> up<00:05:00.539> and<00:05:01.110> you're<00:05:01.260> not<00:05:01.410> going<00:05:01.620> to
