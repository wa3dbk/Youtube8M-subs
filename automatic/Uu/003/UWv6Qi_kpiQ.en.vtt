00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.969
 that explains 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.570
 this molecule is called lysine 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.769
 they are apart from a protein it looks a bit complex true 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 that molecule for those who have children 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.400
 I like to ask is a question that you prefer to have 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 a handsome son or a smart son 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.239
 smart 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.239
 smart 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.350
 but why limit 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 why not a handsome and intelligent not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.300
 the degree of intelligence that our children have when they are adults 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.920
 depends on this molecule 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.120
 It does not depend on the school or what we pay at school depends 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.610
 of the substance and the molecule by 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.680
 every time our children go to school and their teacher asks them 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.590
 how much is two plus two 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.890
 Many times our children are asking for tacos 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.370
 87% solid nutrients because you see 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.980
 more than 25 percent the daily energy 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 kilo 300 grams 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.960
 of encephalic mass that we have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.140
 it takes 25 to 27 percent of that value 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.330
 the importance of black nutrients logically is striking 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 this particular substance is very related to children intelligence 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730
 and you know what 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.160
 It is complex 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.070
 It is very difficult for a person 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.400
 be able to unfold 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.280
 but if that molecule other 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.330
 let's suppose 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.910
 that your kids when they get to school I'm sure all the kids that 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.060
 they go to school here 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 they arrive at the time of the store and they say 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.790
 to the lady who prepares and the food lady can prepare me a room 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 Beet with carrot 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.530
 Why are you laughing 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 do not tell me that there are no normal children here 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.510
 what their children would ask 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.670
 all is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.490
 let's suppose here comes an exercise 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.790
 you suppose that exactly not in the sip and carrot 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.350
 the dawn betacarotene 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.720
 what good god is 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.010
 well I want to tell you 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.909
 what are they putting each of their products 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.599
 had lysine 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.949
 assuming 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.959
 sadly to tell you that none contains it on the contrary 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.579
 but let's suppose they had it 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.690
 or worse yet 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.599
 that you and your children gave them at home 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.539
 and give them those other substances 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.929
 they wanted it is to make it more complex still moves 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:33.359
 someone so complex that molecule that your child will never be able to have it 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.569
 available 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.109
 in other words 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.679
 we could generate 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.089
 decisive pressure 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.599
 Iter activity because the biochemical process of trying to generate 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.699
 are forced or so complicated 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.919
 that the child has to find a way out 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.139
 and maybe that could be a theory to have a child with dexia attention 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.179
 hyperactivity later a bipolar 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.399
 today an autism or any other amount of things 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.399
 so simple this topic 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.049
 what we did in the project of the day 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.729
 was to take that molecule from a fish 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.269
 that finally on the subject of JosÃ© AndrÃ©s, my son could not unfold it 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.039
 he was even worse than children who do not have it 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.139
 and what we did 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.359
 was to take that molecule look very good in it and was to make it a molecule 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.309
 as simple as it is 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.309
 oxygen molecules carbon nitrogen hydrogen 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.209
 for many fish or they are not going or comes to them but it was not like that 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.899
 Our organism 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.939
 to 56 million times per second 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.529
 the one of our children 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.769
 newborn 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.489
 or 105 years old 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.029
 That boy 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:43.369
 finally works with those molecules at 56 million times per second 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.099
 making skin hair memory intelligence feels a bug out 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.759
 through those molecules he falls in love 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.849
 it would be worth it to be 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.699
 very good quality 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:55.989
 the topic 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.059
 that's part of what we do in chile 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.059
 this project many people think that it was fast it was not 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.339
 a project that was costly painful 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.349
 is a project that cost more than millions of dollars in many aspects 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:11.759
 and what we finally got was because they see a project that in response has been 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.989
 very intense 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.599
 This project took more than six years of research and thousands of 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.459
 criminal investigation checkpoints 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.130
 this project finally concluded 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.409
 with a concept that is now called protected 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.659
 that is the procedure if we have protected is a patented procedure 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:29.490
 even 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.830
 but that they explode and 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.569
 tote in day is not more than a protein phase com 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.279
 is to explain it very simple 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.210
 many people say but 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.159
 well nutrients protein that has to do 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.199
 I would like to be the example because many people do not believe in usp 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.659
 nutrients 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.229
 we go because they do not trust him adducing a very important weight that is what we are 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.259
 Finally 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.479
 but suddenly especially king jalisco have been deceived 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.429
 because they have sold a product that removes the foolish the ugly the lazy 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.569
 and usually better 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.539
 I sadly want 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.349
 I want to tell you that 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.419
 that does not happen 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.270
 but not because nutrition is important maybe it's because it's the 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.389
 wrong nutrient 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.550
 or worse yet 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.509
 because most of their products are perhaps phases 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.759
 multivitamin ace the whites with caffeine stimulates 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.800
 that literally becomes short-term energy sources, I take them 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.300
 and I feel good or active and it's over 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.490
 tomorrow I have nothing 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.919
 caffeine in fact and if you want nutrients a stimulant 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.060
 in rough labors that's the reason why many are not serving 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.680
 the concept of protection 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.780
 every moment of our body is what is that cÃ©rÃ© pass that is 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.979
 keep us 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.090
 on average from 8 to 14 years 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.710
 even in the neurological topic all life 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.780
 therefore imagine the importance of a protein phase that reconstitutes 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.780
 what you see in the mirror that is what they are 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.289
 in other words this product has two important characteristics one is 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.009
 flame gave assimilation 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.539
 and another is called 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:01.650
 gave address
