00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.579
 reached more secrets 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.759
 German submarines after 19 o'clock always become aware that for the choice of a man 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.409
 which obviously became another one eight years ago 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.699
 they will try to find out 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.830
 They are absolutely sure that no one around here is right in front of theirs 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.360
 the Enzkreis 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.870
 who hide from the truth behind the door 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.830
 he knows that his parents are there, some people say that they started 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.400
 Smuggling migrants 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.790
 It's been a long time 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.230
 funny dialogues coastal washed out 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.510
 in fact, the main European indices have 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.440
 are close to it 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.530
 talking for himself reminds and distorted hours a suspect 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.260
 and the life of each of them 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.960
 people know maybe Soost's sensation is never the same again 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.050
 Steinmeier said it was a serious mistake that a lot of mean ones 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.289
 not only not a german 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.140
 I do not want to talk about it anymore 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.880
 i did not believe the movie i mean my family and i are just as expensive 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 like everyone else but what should I do next to stand and watch like this 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.570
 Men die 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 as with my son 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.570
 I also have 1 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.870
 the Americans could defend their consumption paradise I dare myself that with a goal 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.320
 has led Daimler will give 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.480
 at the host school without having a problem before 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.570
 I still believe that in which they vote for the SPD votes 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.610
 Carstensen 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 presented the Academia word reported 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.159
 Sulzer 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.640
 Seriously I did not know that the war is so close 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 afterwards and do not tempt us 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 the first-instance missions would have changed 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.340
 and she settled for silver 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.340
 but the latter is an individual 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.960
 it can not and will not
