00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
actually have falsies flared the brush

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
actually have falsies flared the brush
is<00:01:49.950> shaped<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.549> scoop<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.259> gonna

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
is shaped like a scoop so that's gonna

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
is shaped like a scoop so that's gonna
scoop<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.829> eyelashes<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.729> give<00:01:53.850> them

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
scoop your eyelashes up to give them

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.410 
scoop your eyelashes up to give them
curl<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:56.219> way<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.850> rounded<00:01:57.270> at

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
curl and the way that it's rounded at

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
curl and the way that it's rounded at
the<00:01:57.540> end<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.110> gonna<00:01:58.320> give<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.560> more<00:01:58.740> volume<00:01:58.860> at

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the end is gonna give you more volume at

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.429 
the end is gonna give you more volume at
the<00:01:59.250> end<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.640> that's<00:01:59.729> why<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.090> flared<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the end so that's why it's flared so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.620 
the end so that's why it's flared so
basically<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> said<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.030> begin<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
basically what I said to begin way the

really<00:02:24.450> doesn't<00:02:24.780> matter<00:02:24.840> alright<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.530> this

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
really doesn't matter alright so this

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.960 
really doesn't matter alright so this
might<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.130> kind<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.370> weird<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:26.820> actually

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
might be kind of weird but I'm actually

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.610 
might be kind of weird but I'm actually
going<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.420> start<00:02:27.750> by<00:02:27.870> doing<00:02:27.930> my<00:02:28.260> bottom

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
going to start by doing my bottom

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.800 
going to start by doing my bottom
eyelashes<00:02:29.130> only<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.180> for<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> bottom

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
eyelashes only so for the bottom

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.290 
eyelashes only so for the bottom
eyelashes<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.440> usually<00:02:32.400> much<00:02:32.790> easy<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.180> bend

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
eyelashes it's usually much easy to bend

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.120 
eyelashes it's usually much easy to bend
the<00:02:33.420> top<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:33.990> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.320> open<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:34.980> eyes

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the top you just kind of open your eyes

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.260 
the top you just kind of open your eyes
and<00:02:36.530> comb<00:02:37.530> them<00:02:37.680> side<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:37.980> side<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.580> usually

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
and comb them side to side I usually

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.500 
and comb them side to side I usually
only<00:02:39.480> comb<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.620> roots<00:02:40.970> because<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.210> do<00:02:42.270> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
only comb the roots because if I do the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.350 
only comb the roots because if I do the
ends<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.050> my<00:02:43.140> eyelashes<00:02:43.650> look<00:02:43.680> too<00:02:44.100> long<00:02:44.430> but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
ends and my eyelashes look too long but

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.120 
ends and my eyelashes look too long but
if<00:02:45.480> your<00:02:45.630> eyelashes<00:02:46.140> aren't<00:02:46.320> like<00:02:46.560> half<00:02:46.950> an

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
if your eyelashes aren't like half an

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.330 
if your eyelashes aren't like half an
inch<00:02:47.340> long<00:02:47.490> then<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.090> probably<00:02:49.160> won't<00:02:50.160> look

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
inch long then it probably won't look

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.670 
inch long then it probably won't look
too<00:02:50.760> bad<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.630> comb<00:02:52.110> through<00:02:52.380> them<00:02:52.500> all

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
too bad so you can comb through them all

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.580 
too bad so you can comb through them all
the<00:02:52.800> way<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.570> don't<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.990> put<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> law<00:02:55.350> at

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.860 
all I just like to really lightly kind
of<00:02:57.600> top<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.320> on<00:02:58.440> now<00:02:58.980> for<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> top<00:02:59.640> lashes<00:02:59.940> um

of top it on now for the top lashes um
you<00:03:01.140> can<00:03:01.320> actually<00:03:01.530> curl<00:03:02.040> your<00:03:02.190> eyelashes

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
you can actually curl your eyelashes

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.460 
you can actually curl your eyelashes
before<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.320> can

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
before you do this just so that you can

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.770 
before you do this just so that you can
get<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.740> like<00:03:04.920> extreme<00:03:05.850> curl<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.510> don't

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
get that like extreme curl but I don't

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.840 
get that like extreme curl but I don't
usually<00:03:06.990> because<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.310> way<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.730> my

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
usually because the way that I do my

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.020 
usually because the way that I do my
mascara<00:03:09.150> curls<00:03:09.690> my<00:03:09.810> eyelashes<00:03:10.230> for<00:03:10.740> me<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:11.490> for

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.220 
their eyes and the reason for this is
because<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.459> mascara<00:03:24.000> isn't<00:03:24.360> gonna<00:03:24.450> touch<00:03:24.810> my

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
because I mascara isn't gonna touch my

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.170 
because I mascara isn't gonna touch my
eyelid<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.370> ensures<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.000> don't

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
eyelid this just ensures so you don't

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.390 
eyelid this just ensures so you don't
get<00:03:27.300> mascara<00:03:27.750> everywhere<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.650> really<00:03:29.220> keeps

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
get mascara everywhere it really keeps

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.040 
get mascara everywhere it really keeps
it<00:03:29.580> away<00:03:29.820> from<00:03:30.030> your<00:03:30.180> eye<00:03:30.209> shadow<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:30.690> then

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
it away from your eye shadow so then

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.860 
it away from your eye shadow so then
it's<00:03:31.260> like<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.920> complete<00:03:32.430> final<00:03:33.090> step<00:03:33.570> and

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
it's like the complete final step and

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.870 
it's like the complete final step and
you<00:03:34.290> don't<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.709> worry<00:03:34.890> about<00:03:35.010> touch-ups

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
you don't have to worry about touch-ups

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.120 
you don't have to worry about touch-ups
after<00:03:36.240> so<00:03:36.870> I'm<00:03:37.140> going<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> be<00:03:37.650> using<00:03:37.770> my

put<00:03:43.860> on<00:03:43.890> three<00:03:44.580> coats<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.110> start<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:46.980> this

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
put on three coats so I start like this

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.930 
put on three coats so I start like this
my<00:03:48.209> head<00:03:48.420> back<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.959> my<00:03:49.230> eyes<00:03:49.380> down<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.700> comb

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
my head back and my eyes down and I comb

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.960 
my head back and my eyes down and I comb
through<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.420> ends<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.930> my<00:03:52.080> eyelashes<00:03:52.970> only

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
through the ends of my eyelashes only

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.790 
through the ends of my eyelashes only
the<00:03:54.270> ends<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:55.020> really<00:03:55.350> important

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
the ends this is really important

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.470 
the ends this is really important
because<00:03:55.830> if<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.250> really<00:03:56.550> want<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.880> curl<00:03:57.090> or<00:03:57.390> if

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
because if you really want to curl or if

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.570 
because if you really want to curl or if
you<00:03:57.570> want<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> keep<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.230> curl<00:03:58.500> then<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.250> can't

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
you want to keep the curl then you can't

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:09.830 
you want to keep the curl then you can't
apply<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.390> roots<00:04:00.660> first

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.979 

so<00:04:10.410> that's<00:04:10.860> one<00:04:11.160> coat<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.760> then<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.599> let<00:04:12.810> this

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
so that's one coat and then I let this

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.069 
so that's one coat and then I let this
one<00:04:13.319> dry<00:04:13.770> for<00:04:14.220> however<00:04:15.030> long<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.630> takes<00:04:15.690> me<00:04:15.959> to

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
one dry for however long it takes me to

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.710 
one dry for however long it takes me to
do<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.669> won't<00:04:17.880> let<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.060> dry<00:04:18.329> for<00:04:18.389> any

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
do this I and I won't let it dry for any

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.900 
do this I and I won't let it dry for any
longer<00:04:18.989> because<00:04:19.230> if<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:20.160> let<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.489> mascara

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
longer because if you let the mascara

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.280 
longer because if you let the mascara
Drive<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.630> won't<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:21.900> able<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.079> comb

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
Drive and you won't be able to comb

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.670 
Drive and you won't be able to comb
through<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.590> anymore<00:04:23.010> it'll<00:04:23.250> flake<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:24.680> it

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
through it anymore it'll flake and it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.879 
through it anymore it'll flake and it
will<00:04:26.010> leave<00:04:26.280> your<00:04:26.550> lashes<00:04:27.000> looking<00:04:27.300> like<00:04:27.450> that

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
will leave your lashes looking like that

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.560 
will leave your lashes looking like that
there's<00:04:28.889> no<00:04:29.070> going<00:04:29.400> back<00:04:29.430> after<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.120> dries<00:04:30.389> so

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
there's no going back after it dries so

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.960 
there's no going back after it dries so
now<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.600> would<00:04:33.990> do<00:04:34.290> one<00:04:34.620> more<00:04:34.860> coat<00:04:35.160> just<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.850> the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
now I would do one more coat just on the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.440 
now I would do one more coat just on the
ends<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.330> my<00:04:36.450> lashes<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:40.080> notice<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.740> first<00:04:41.460> put

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
ends of my lashes and notice I first put

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.629 
ends of my lashes and notice I first put
the<00:04:42.570> mascara<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.320> sideways<00:04:43.740> motion<00:04:43.979> towards

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
the mascara in a sideways motion towards

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.990 
the mascara in a sideways motion towards
the<00:04:45.419> inner<00:04:45.600> corner<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.020> my<00:04:46.290> eye<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.770> then<00:04:47.669> I<00:04:47.729> go

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
the inner corner of my eye and then I go

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.710 
the inner corner of my eye and then I go
outward<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:49.130> I<00:04:50.130> only<00:04:50.340> really<00:04:50.729> use<00:04:51.090> sideways

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
outward and I only really use sideways

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.020 
outward and I only really use sideways
motions<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.880> just<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.479> back<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:54.990> forth<00:04:56.030> this

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
motions so just like back and forth this

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.560 
motions so just like back and forth this
gets<00:04:57.300> them<00:04:57.419> kind<00:04:57.690> of<00:04:57.750> thick<00:04:58.080> rather<00:04:58.560> than<00:04:58.889> long

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
gets them kind of thick rather than long

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.240 
gets them kind of thick rather than long
and<00:05:00.570> same<00:05:00.930> for<00:05:00.960> this<00:05:01.260> one<00:05:01.440> just<00:05:01.470> on<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.919> ends

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
and same for this one just on the ends

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.040 
and same for this one just on the ends
again<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.729> obviously<00:05:03.240> what<00:05:03.450> I'm<00:05:03.570> doing<00:05:03.900> the

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
again and obviously what I'm doing the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.780 
again and obviously what I'm doing the
ends<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.440> my<00:05:04.470> eyelash<00:05:04.919> is<00:05:05.070> it<00:05:05.190> gets<00:05:05.370> on<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
ends of my eyelash is it gets on the

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.810 
ends of my eyelash is it gets on the
middle<00:05:06.120> on<00:05:06.360> my<00:05:06.840> eyelashes<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.290> little<00:05:07.680> it's<00:05:08.550> not

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
middle on my eyelashes a little it's not

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.930 
middle on my eyelashes a little it's not
strictly<00:05:09.600> on<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.050> ends<00:05:10.580> but<00:05:11.580> I'm<00:05:11.729> not

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
strictly on the ends but I'm not

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.909 
strictly on the ends but I'm not
concentrating<00:05:12.840> at<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.139> roots<00:05:13.380> yet<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.590> those

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
concentrating at the roots yet so those

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.070 
concentrating at the roots yet so those
are<00:05:17.130> just<00:05:17.190> my<00:05:17.460> first<00:05:17.640> two<00:05:17.940> coats<00:05:18.150> I'm<00:05:18.810> now

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
are just my first two coats I'm now

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.840 
are just my first two coats I'm now
going<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.470> do<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.890> third<00:05:20.100> coat<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.640> I'm<00:05:20.729> going

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
going to do the third coat and I'm going

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.640 
going to do the third coat and I'm going
to<00:05:20.910> concentrate<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.600> all<00:05:21.780> at<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.140> roots<00:05:22.320> so

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
to concentrate that all at the roots so

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.830 
to concentrate that all at the roots so
what<00:05:22.919> this<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.220> going<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.400> do<00:05:23.610> is<00:05:23.850> lift<00:05:24.539> and

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
what this is going to do is lift and

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.560 
what this is going to do is lift and
separate<00:05:25.410> so<00:05:26.130> this<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.460> gonna<00:05:26.610> add<00:05:26.820> length<00:05:27.180> and

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
separate so this is gonna add length and

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.390 
separate so this is gonna add length and
it's<00:05:28.140> gonna<00:05:28.260> make<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.560> look<00:05:28.650> like<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.950> have<00:05:29.100> more

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
it's gonna make it look like I have more

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.960 
it's gonna make it look like I have more
eyelashes<00:05:30.030> than<00:05:30.180> just<00:05:30.390> five<00:05:30.660> clumpy<00:05:31.320> lashes

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
eyelashes than just five clumpy lashes

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.260 
eyelashes than just five clumpy lashes
so<00:05:32.970> I'll<00:05:33.210> go<00:05:33.390> really<00:05:33.900> close<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.530> roots<00:05:34.800> and

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
so I'll go really close to the roots and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.020 
so I'll go really close to the roots and
I'm<00:05:36.270> combing<00:05:36.539> side<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.140> side<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:38.370> now<00:05:38.970> the

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
little and this allows it to keep that

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.110

and<00:05:52.560> now<00:05:53.400> when<00:05:53.700> I'm<00:05:53.820> doing<00:05:54.090> this<00:05:54.240> up<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.690> I'll

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
and now when I'm doing this up to I'll

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.200 
and now when I'm doing this up to I'll
go<00:05:55.260> behind<00:05:55.530> my<00:05:56.070> top<00:05:56.280> eyelashes<00:05:56.789> and<00:05:56.910> kind<00:05:57.120> of

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
go behind my top eyelashes and kind of

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.600 
go behind my top eyelashes and kind of
push<00:05:57.360> them<00:05:57.510> down<00:05:57.539> a<00:05:57.750> bit<00:05:58.050> just<00:05:58.320> on<00:05:59.220> this<00:05:59.370> outer

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
push them down a bit just on this outer

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.360 
push them down a bit just on this outer
corner<00:06:00.410> so<00:06:01.410> that<00:06:01.560> gives<00:06:01.680> me<00:06:01.800> like<00:06:01.950> a<00:06:01.979> feathered

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
corner so that gives me like a feathered

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.510 
corner so that gives me like a feathered
out<00:06:02.490> look<00:06:02.760> and<00:06:03.060> same<00:06:03.930> for<00:06:03.960> this<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.560> know<00:06:04.620> only<00:06:05.160> a

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
all right so I've got that and then the

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.600 
all right so I've got that and then the
very<00:06:25.020> last<00:06:25.139> step<00:06:25.620> that<00:06:25.680> I<00:06:25.919> do<00:06:26.009> just<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.460> finish

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
very last step that I do just to finish

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.189 
very last step that I do just to finish
off<00:06:26.789> my<00:06:26.939> eyelashes<00:06:27.389> is<00:06:27.539> I<00:06:27.629> actually<00:06:27.810> use

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
off my eyelashes is I actually use

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.550 
off my eyelashes is I actually use
falsies<00:06:28.740> though<00:06:29.099> this<00:06:29.430> brush<00:06:29.819> is<00:06:30.560> like

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
falsies though this brush is like

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.129 
falsies though this brush is like
rounded<00:06:32.370> and<00:06:32.819> just<00:06:33.029> use<00:06:33.150> it<00:06:33.300> to<00:06:33.330> comb<00:06:33.629> them<00:06:33.900> and

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
rounded and just use it to comb them and

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.040 
rounded and just use it to comb them and
I<00:06:35.129> do<00:06:35.249> this<00:06:35.550> in<00:06:35.879> a<00:06:36.060> side-to-side<00:06:36.419> motion<00:06:36.779> at

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
I do this in a side-to-side motion at

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.670 
I do this in a side-to-side motion at
the<00:06:37.199> very<00:06:37.439> roots<00:06:37.800> to<00:06:38.610> separate<00:06:38.999> my<00:06:39.150> eyelashes

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
the very roots to separate my eyelashes

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.230 
the very roots to separate my eyelashes
completely<00:06:40.680> and<00:06:40.979> make<00:06:41.370> them<00:06:41.550> look<00:06:41.699> really

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
completely and make them look really

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.920 
completely and make them look really
full<00:06:43.550> this<00:06:44.550> just<00:06:44.819> combs<00:06:45.120> through<00:06:45.449> them<00:06:45.659> really

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
full this just combs through them really

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.350 
full this just combs through them really
well<00:06:46.129> so<00:06:47.129> then<00:06:47.340> they<00:06:47.430> don't<00:06:47.580> look<00:06:47.759> clumpy<00:06:48.150> at

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
well so then they don't look clumpy at

00:06:48.360 --> 00:07:04.690 
well so then they don't look clumpy at
all

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.730
