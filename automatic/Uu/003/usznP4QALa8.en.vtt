00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
to pretty much build buildings without

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
to pretty much build buildings without
actually<00:00:09.360> having<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.599> build<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.080> but<00:00:10.440> they

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
actually having to build it but they

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.749 
actually having to build it but they
make<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.980> little<00:00:11.190> bit<00:00:11.400> harder<00:00:11.730> than

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
make it a little bit harder than

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.910 
make it a little bit harder than
expected<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.719> will<00:00:12.929> tell<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
crafting recipes now everything works in

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.290 
crafting recipes now everything works in
a<00:00:16.199> second<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.770> first<00:00:17.310> web<00:00:17.670> construction

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
a second and first web construction

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.900 
a second and first web construction
block<00:00:18.510> which<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> hardest<00:00:19.320> item<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.730> make

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
block which is the hardest item to make

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.849 
block which is the hardest item to make
in<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.240> mod<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:22.080> mostly<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
in this mod but mostly because it

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.250 
in this mod but mostly because it
requires<00:00:23.160> four<00:00:23.550> diamonds<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
requires four diamonds but this is a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.160 
requires four diamonds but this is a
pretty<00:00:25.529> important<00:00:26.430> piece<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.599> mod<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
pretty important piece of the mod and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.179 
pretty important piece of the mod and
next<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.429> planning<00:00:29.910> table<00:00:30.949> which<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
next we have the planning table which is

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
next we have the planning table which is
not<00:00:32.369> hard<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> craft<00:00:32.969> at<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> crafting

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
not hard to craft at all it's a crafting

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
not hard to craft at all it's a crafting
table<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:35.250> logs<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> some<00:00:36.030> wooden<00:00:36.300> planks

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
table some logs and some wooden planks

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
table some logs and some wooden planks
so<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:37.020> pretty<00:00:37.170> easy<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.680> get<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> could<00:00:38.100> get

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so I'm pretty easy to get you could get

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.860 
so I'm pretty easy to get you could get
that<00:00:38.399> right<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.760> bat<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.390> next<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.750> have

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that right off the bat and next we have

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
that right off the bat and next we have
a<00:00:39.930> blueprint<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.739> paper<00:00:41.010> all

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
a blueprint which is just paper all

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.270 
a blueprint which is just paper all
along<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.390> along<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.320> crafting<00:00:43.649> table<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
along the along the crafting table and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
along the along the crafting table and
it's<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.670> even<00:00:44.700> blue<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.629> don't<00:00:46.320> even<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.649> how

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
it's not even blue I don't even know how
this<00:00:46.920> works<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> anyway<00:00:48.510> next<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this works and anyway next we have the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
this works and anyway next we have the
hammer<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.940> expensive<00:00:51.420> it's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
hammer which is I'm not expensive it's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
hammer which is I'm not expensive it's
pretty<00:00:51.960> much<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.170> an<00:00:52.590> axe<00:00:52.860> except<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> add

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
pretty much just an axe except you add

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.910 
pretty much just an axe except you add
an<00:00:53.820> extra<00:00:54.030> piece<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.239> cobblestone<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.230> next

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
an extra piece of cobblestone and next

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.049 
an extra piece of cobblestone and next
year<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> construction<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:56.940> is

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
year at the construction now which is

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
year at the construction now which is
not<00:00:57.449> needed<00:00:57.809> at<00:00:58.079> oh<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> don't<00:00:58.710> even<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.190> why

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
get one of every block so I could show

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469 
get one of every block so I could show
you<00:01:43.079> how<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.470> works<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.100> I'm<00:01:44.820> let<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.119> again

cool little half crafting table

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
cool little half crafting table
structure<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.560> click<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.610> can

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
structure you right click it as you can

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
structure you right click it as you can
see<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:55.079> different<00:01:55.380> houses

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
see we have all these different houses

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.590 
see we have all these different houses
that<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.850> make<00:01:56.969> all<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.299> different

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that we can make all these different

that we can make all these different
things<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:59.009> yeah<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.549> did<00:01:59.820> test<00:02:00.060> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
things and I'm yeah and I did test this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.649 
things and I'm yeah and I did test this
out<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.600> another<00:02:00.990> world<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.640> stays<00:02:03.060> until

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
out on another world and it stays until

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.260 
out on another world and it stays until
you<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:03.960> rid<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.219> let's<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you get rid of it so let's just do the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
you get rid of it so let's just do the
medieval<00:02:06.960> windmill<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:08.039> put<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
medieval windmill and we put in the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.550 
medieval windmill and we put in the
blueprint<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.750> normally<00:02:10.379> you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
blueprint right here and normally you

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.890 
blueprint right here and normally you
need<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.129> amount<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.520> ink<00:02:11.730> sacs<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.360> draw<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
need the amount of ink sacs to draw it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.640 
need the amount of ink sacs to draw it
but<00:02:13.080> since<00:02:13.290> I'm

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
but since I'm

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.559 
but since I'm
I<00:02:14.040> don't<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.579> so<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:14.849> could<00:02:15.090> draw<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
I don't have to so I could draw it and

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.839 
I don't have to so I could draw it and
as<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.019> see<00:02:16.049> Susan<00:02:16.500> medieval<00:02:17.129> one<00:02:17.640> male

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
construction block home which is the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.850 
construction block home which is the
expensive<00:02:21.569> one<00:02:21.780> all<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.439> want<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.739> is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
right click it you put in the blueprint

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.940 
right click it you put in the blueprint
and<00:02:24.659> here's<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.230> part<00:02:25.409> that<00:02:25.530> makes<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.799> little

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and here's the part that makes a little

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.710 
and here's the part that makes a little
harder<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.430> click<00:02:26.640> materials<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.540> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
harder you click materials you have to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.869 
harder you click materials you have to
collect<00:02:27.989> every<00:02:28.349> single<00:02:28.709> block<00:02:29.069> an<00:02:29.280> item<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
collect every single block an item that

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.530 
collect every single block an item that
is<00:02:30.269> required<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.409> make<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.159> item<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.819> but

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
is required to make the item and but

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.360 
is required to make the item and but
since<00:02:33.720> I'm<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:33.900> creative<00:02:34.409> mode<00:02:34.439> I<00:02:34.769> don't<00:02:35.099> need

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
since I'm in creative mode I don't need

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.020 
since I'm in creative mode I don't need
to<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.840> hit<00:02:37.049> starts<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.799> only<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.640> need<00:02:38.939> to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
to and I hit starts and only you need to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.509 
to and I hit starts and only you need to
use<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.150> hammer<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:40.140> craft<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.739> um<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
use the hammer to craft it um to

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.670 
use the hammer to craft it um to
actually<00:02:41.909> make<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.359> but<00:02:43.349> since<00:02:43.500> I'm<00:02:43.650> in

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
actually make it but since I'm in

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
actually make it but since I'm in
creative<00:02:44.069> mode<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.340> don't<00:02:44.519> have<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.909> and<00:02:45.239> as<00:02:45.690> you

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
creative mode I don't have to and as you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.270 
creative mode I don't have to and as you
can<00:02:45.989> see<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.409> a<00:02:46.440> nice<00:02:46.650> little<00:02:46.829> structure

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
can see we have a nice little structure

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.449 
can see we have a nice little structure
let<00:02:47.430> me<00:02:47.519> show<00:02:47.639> you<00:02:47.730> inside<00:02:48.139> and<00:02:49.139> it's<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:50.340> a

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
let me show you inside and it's a it's a

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.220 
let me show you inside and it's a it's a
vertical<00:02:50.879> structure<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.810> saves<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.139> all

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
vertical structure and it saves you all

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.710 
vertical structure and it saves you all
the<00:02:52.319> time<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.769> making<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.519> but<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.180> still<00:02:54.480> have

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the time of making it but you still have

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.640 
the time of making it but you still have
to<00:02:54.750> UM<00:02:55.109> get<00:02:55.889> all<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.340> other<00:02:57.139> materials<00:02:58.139> which

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
to UM get all the other materials which

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.289 
to UM get all the other materials which
is<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.950> low<00:02:59.099> place<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.819> but<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.120> only

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
is the low place to it but it's only

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.050 
is the low place to it but it's only
fair<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.439> like<00:03:02.400> too

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
fair you know it's not that like too

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.660 
fair you know it's not that like too
much<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.269> ruining<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.810> game<00:03:04.340> which<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.489> pretty

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
much of ruining the game which is pretty

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.119 
much of ruining the game which is pretty
cool<00:03:05.939> and<00:03:06.349> yeah<00:03:07.349> so<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:07.980> make<00:03:08.099> a

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
cool and yeah so you can make a

put this away from that structure that

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.090 
put this away from that structure that
the<00:05:15.490> block<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.090> right<00:05:16.630> over<00:05:16.960> here<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.620> if<00:05:17.830> you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
that the structure built from the very

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.740 
that the structure built from the very
left<00:05:23.620> of<00:05:23.920> leg<00:05:24.520> where<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.790> starts<00:05:25.210> like<00:05:25.420> as<00:05:25.600> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750

block is right here the most left

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.820 
block is right here the most left
structure<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.270> right<00:05:28.570> here<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.110> matches<00:05:29.680> up

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
structure is right here so matches up

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.980 
structure is right here so matches up
with<00:05:29.950> that<00:05:30.160> so<00:05:30.760> take<00:05:31.030> note<00:05:31.060> that<00:05:31.330> everything

with that so take note that everything
will<00:05:32.140> go<00:05:32.380> out<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.860> right<00:05:33.040> which<00:05:33.730> is<00:05:33.760> pretty

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180
