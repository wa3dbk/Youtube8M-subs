00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.520
 hello the loulous seine-nord 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.519
 welcome to the christmas tricks I 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.869
 think number 2 today we will talk 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.160
 briefly from what I call them 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.810
 cascading harmonics 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.390
 so I was asked a lot of questions 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.770
 on this little thing that does not come from 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.329
 this is the first time I've seen 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.489
 this is yannick girl made in he 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.640
 had done so it actually consists of 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.129
 what is it all about doing 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.870
 chickens of anyway in that 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.030
 regards I do them like that doing things 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.829
 hens talking without the ground rope to 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.490
 15.4 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:58.100
 wait a little volume 2 and 0 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.100
 so we will always do 4 2 0 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.020
 ok let's do that permanently at the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.210
 left hand while the right hand 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.270
 will go along the ground rope of 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
 the same rope a course will pass 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 along the ground rope to make 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.690
 cascade overtones so 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.690
 without the finger that passes it gives that 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:31.670
 and with that gives that you saw is 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.710
 rather heard of them 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.390
 you have eyes and ears at 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.780
 as I pass the finger 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.840
 on the string that harmonic general 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.040
 so switch from vegetables to serious or 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.900
 from bass to treble if you want a 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.070
 reverse effect I can do exactly 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.330
 a thing for example on the rope 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.330
 I would try immediately 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.050
 that's pretty nice it's this 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 so we call harmonics in 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.930
 cascade inserted inside a solo 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.930
 it can be quite nice 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 no 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.650
 I hope these tips have you 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.900
 been useful you can decorate your 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 solo of this kind of little harmonic in 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.540
 cascade like there is not really 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.060
 of tone really you can 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.170
 use it in all tones 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.450
 so that's cool 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 ok had cost nice weekend to you and to 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.750
 all
