elemental plane which is their native

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.999 
elemental plane which is their native
home<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> air<00:01:26.310> pfleger<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.790> return<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
home so a air pfleger will return to a

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.160 
home so a air pfleger will return to a
the<00:01:29.009> airplane<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> earth<00:01:30.689> flickers<00:01:31.020> will

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the airplane and the earth flickers will

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
the airplane and the earth flickers will
return<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> earth<00:01:31.590> plane<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> we've

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
return to the earth plane so we've

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.719 
return to the earth plane so we've
prepared<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:34.290> demo<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> guys<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
prepared a little demo for you guys to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
prepared a little demo for you guys to
show<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> how<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.570> interact<00:01:36.900> with

show you how you can interact with

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.990 
show you how you can interact with
flickers<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.950> few<00:01:38.130> different<00:01:38.280> ways<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
flickers in a few different ways and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
flickers in a few different ways and
even<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> couple<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> ways<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.619> might<00:01:40.710> be

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
even a couple of ways that you might be

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.830 
even a couple of ways that you might be
able<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> catch<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.150> 0<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> take

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
able to catch them so 0 is going to take

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
able to catch them so 0 is going to take
the<00:01:42.990> lead<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.530> he's<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> show<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the lead here and he's going to show you

away<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:29.209> get<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> flicker<00:02:29.630> lure<00:02:29.840> by<00:02:30.080> using<00:02:30.320> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
away you get the flicker lure by using a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.550 
away you get the flicker lure by using a
new<00:02:31.760> armor<00:02:32.300> infusion<00:02:32.720> system<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.320> are

crystal turns green first off that
allows<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.699> wrench<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.270> remember<00:05:59.900> where

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
allows the wrench to remember where

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420 
also three types of power above and what

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.090 
also three types of power above and what
that<00:06:35.600> means<00:06:35.840> is<00:06:36.490> I<00:06:37.720> can<00:06:38.720> have<00:06:38.960> multiple<00:06:39.680> types
