00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.090
 hello to all are today in 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.430
 a beautiful setting in this case 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.090
 it's a small piece of land that has 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.920
 shaved lends me to do experiments 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 today I'm going to show 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.850
 a potato crop of a 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.250
 way a little peculiar to small or 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.659
 from the magnificent view of this superb 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:41.890
 garden so the starting weight is 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:44.920
 just a meadow that I stretched and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.319
 based on this meadow we go 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.319
 grow potatoes without 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:53.350
 plowing the ground then not said 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:55.300
 explanations in pictures 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.460
 the first step is the laying of the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:05.320
 cord so it's just a rope 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.950
 every gardener comes with my cord who 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.530
 is going to be there that will help me to simply 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.230
 place the potatoes on the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.720
 meadow the next step is all 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:24.490
 simply to deposit on the ground the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.820
 potatoes that are on vacation 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.820
 nation 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 I see 30 cm from each other as we 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.259
 could do it in a plantation 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.689
 classic except that in the plantation 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.079
 classic then what we do we plow 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.289
 the ground preferably kliment and one 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.219
 bury the potatoes here I the 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.799
 laying on the meadow the next step or 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:59.039
 it is an art that it is it is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.729
 simply to cover but line of 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:09.530
 potatoes by a small word of 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:13.950
 compost mound here it's a 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.630
 horticultural compost that I bought 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.940
 now we were called tra composed of 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.660
 garden I bought a trailer from 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.190
 compost because if I still had 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.560
 an appreciable amount of apples 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.670
 land to cover 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.670
 so I needed a lot 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:42.960
 for this small plot of 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:42.960
 finish the small mounds of compost 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.950
 just have to wait for all that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.780
 shoot 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.780
 and then we will see the sequence of events 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.960
 for growing potatoes on 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.210
 no-till meadow soil which again 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.360
 other iron operations that go 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.360
 come 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:16.000
 here is the same ground month two months and 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.680
 half later so like just showing 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.220
 before the potatoes were laid 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.220
 on the ground on the meadow on March 6 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.100
 today is the 25th of May so 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.330
 we can see that the potatoes the 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.110
 potato plants were well 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.730
 developed and I started my 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.260
 business but stumbles around the three 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.920
 potatoes only with 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.920
 grass clippings 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.120
 to have that at harvest 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.220
 grow potato plants from 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:10.190
 this way requires less work 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:15.680
 and just as profitable with the advantage 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:19.400
 to have after the harvest a piece of land 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.670
 which will be prepared by this component the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.520
 lawn mowing on the ground we attract 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.030
 naturally the ebit composer who 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.630
 prepare the floor for me for the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.630
 next culture 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.460
 here is the potato harvest on 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.460
 meadow 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:04.740
 we see that this method of cultivation has 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:06.050
 nothing to envy to classical culture on 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.190
 goal 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.410
 not only is the harvest very 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.930
 prolific but at the same time apples 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.750
 of land are almost clean they do not 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.170
 are not full of you it's up to these 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.170
 miraculously 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.199
 and pretty bulky them when I see 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.389
 the potatoes that I have here by 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.490
 compared to a classic hillock that I 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:45.650
 have just reaped my potatoes 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.650
 here are more numerous and bigger
