hey<00:00:00.570> so<00:00:01.669> you<00:00:02.669> know<00:00:02.700> it's<00:00:03.000> been<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.240> while<00:00:03.540> since

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
hey so you know it's been a while since

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.800 
hey so you know it's been a while since
I<00:00:04.049> came<00:00:04.110> up<00:00:04.410> with<00:00:04.440> this<00:00:04.740> idea<00:00:05.210> of<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.509> steampunk

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
I came up with this idea of a steampunk

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.070 
I came up with this idea of a steampunk
hot<00:00:07.410> tub<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.730> I've<00:00:09.330> come<00:00:09.599> up<00:00:09.630> with<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.870> new

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
hot tub and I've come up with a new

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.910 
hot tub and I've come up with a new
solution<00:00:10.469> which<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.570> might<00:00:12.570> work<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:13.230> lot

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
solution which I think might work a lot

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.609 
solution which I think might work a lot
better<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.910> good<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.630> lot<00:00:15.809> safer<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
better it's good it's a lot safer I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.630 
better it's good it's a lot safer I
think<00:00:17.010> um<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:18.680> variabilities<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.310> having

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
think um the variabilities of having

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.620 
think um the variabilities of having
really<00:00:20.910> hot<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.359> cold<00:00:21.720> water<00:00:22.609> are<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:24.060> lot<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
really hot really cold water are a lot a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.620 
really hot really cold water are a lot a
lot<00:00:25.550> well<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:26.789> takes<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
lot well it just takes out a lot of the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.839 
lot well it just takes out a lot of the
variables<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.859> I've<00:00:29.250> been<00:00:29.429> doing<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> lot<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
variables so I've been doing a lot of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
variables so I've been doing a lot of
studying<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.570> rocket<00:00:31.170> stoves<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> came

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
studying up on rocket stoves and I came

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.090 
studying up on rocket stoves and I came
up<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.520> idea<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.960> basic<00:00:34.440> rocket

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
up with this idea of a basic rocket

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.450 
up with this idea of a basic rocket
stove<00:00:35.460> um<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.590> look<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> link

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
stove um and you can look at the link

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
stove um and you can look at the link
that<00:00:38.579> I've<00:00:38.850> posted<00:00:39.090> right<00:00:39.950> here<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.899> um<00:00:42.920> check

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
that I've posted right here and um check

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.459 
that I've posted right here and um check
out<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.100> video<00:00:44.629> too<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.289> don't

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.369 
out that video too if you don't
understand<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.160> getting<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.550> but

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
understand what I'm getting at but

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.560 
understand what I'm getting at but
basically<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.160> idea<00:00:50.190> behind<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.210> newest<00:00:51.480> one

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
basically the idea behind the newest one

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.860 
basically the idea behind the newest one
is<00:00:52.579> on<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:54.449> rocket<00:00:54.899> stove<00:00:56.210> is<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.690> it's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
is on this rocket stove is how it's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020 
is on this rocket stove is how it's
going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> warm<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> hot<00:00:58.530> tub<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.789> i'm

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
going to warm the hot tub is your i'm

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.630 
going to warm the hot tub is your i'm
going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.510> well<00:01:01.379> hopefully<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.370> this

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
going to use well hopefully if I do this

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.690 
going to use well hopefully if I do this
I'm<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:03.719> insulation<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.280> made

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I'm going to use insulation that's made

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.590 
I'm going to use insulation that's made
basically<00:01:06.240> sand<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:07.369> gravel<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.820> something<00:01:09.479> of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
basically sand or gravel or something of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.520 
basically sand or gravel or something of
the<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.720> something<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the like something that's going to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.149 
the like something that's going to
retain<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> heat<00:01:11.939> when<00:01:12.689> i<00:01:13.049> run<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
retain a lot of heat when i run the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.090 
retain a lot of heat when i run the
rocket<00:01:14.549> stove<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.200> use<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> container<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
rocket stove and use a container like a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
rocket stove and use a container like a
giant<00:01:18.770> planter<00:01:19.770> ceramic<00:01:20.490> planter<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
giant planter ceramic planter that is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.850 
giant planter ceramic planter that is
also<00:01:22.470> made<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.799> stone<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:24.560> what<00:01:25.560> i'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.799> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
also made of stone and what i'm going to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
also made of stone and what i'm going to
do<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:27.439> put<00:01:28.439> hopefully<00:01:30.680> coil<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.210> copper<00:01:33.210> copper

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
do is put hopefully coil a copper copper

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.190 
do is put hopefully coil a copper copper
piping<00:01:34.290> through<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.979> thing<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:36.180> collect<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
piping through this thing to collect the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.359 
piping through this thing to collect the
heat<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:39.509> course<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.110> push<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.860> hot

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
heat and of course you know push the hot

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.569 
heat and of course you know push the hot
water<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.909> into<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.990> tub<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:44.189> i<00:01:44.220> figured

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
water out into the tub but i figured

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.100 
water out into the tub but i figured
even<00:01:44.850> after<00:01:45.420> running<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.439> stove<00:01:47.570> there<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
even after running the stove there the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.499 
even after running the stove there the
this<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> insulation<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.360> going

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
this is going to the insulation is going

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.420 
this is going to the insulation is going
to<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:51.720> longer<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:53.369> heat<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:56.130> also

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to take longer to heat up and it's also

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.630 
to take longer to heat up and it's also
going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> take<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.240> long<00:01:57.509> time<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> cool<00:01:58.229> down

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
going to take a long time to cool down

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.270 
going to take a long time to cool down
there<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.969> making<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.840> temperature<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
there for making the temperature of the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
there for making the temperature of the
water<00:02:02.310> running<00:02:02.909> through<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.540> little<00:02:04.170> bit

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
water running through here a little bit

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.100 
water running through here a little bit
more<00:02:04.530> stable<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:06.270> running<00:02:06.659> into<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
more stable and then running into the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.529 
more stable and then running into the
hot<00:02:07.259> tub<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.610> will<00:02:08.729> keep<00:02:08.940> it'll<00:02:09.420> keep

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
hot tub and then it will keep it'll keep

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.410 
hot tub and then it will keep it'll keep
it<00:02:09.660> warm<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.170> longer<00:02:10.379> time<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.420> use

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it warm for a longer time to and use

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
it warm for a longer time to and use
less<00:02:12.660> fuel<00:02:12.959> Lessig's

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
