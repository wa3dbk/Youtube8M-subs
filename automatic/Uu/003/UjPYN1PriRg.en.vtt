00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 well this is the band techno channel and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.519
 today we are going to learn how to connect 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.630
 our playstation control to our 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.190
 device with ios in this case an ipad 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.430
 7.0 4 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.910
 and then if I want to concentrate some 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.710
 playstation 4 control in this case to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.270
 your device with them obviously 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 you know how to jailbreak if you do not 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.400
 You can watch a video tutorial learn 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.950
 how to do it and in less than five minutes 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.180
 you will see that you can have this package 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.690
 installed ok that is although we're going to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.660
 cydia 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.519
 to download the tweet that is going to 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.539
 allow to do this in this case what 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.890
 can see on screen is called 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.320
 controls 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.739
 and basically what it allows you is 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 connect your playstation control to your 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.100
 with them 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 Once installed, it will be installed 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.560
 bluetooth tax control and are some 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.210
 tools some libraries access 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.720
 to the spring board 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.090
 and the uruguay of gender iron 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.590
 once this is done you confirm the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.040
 installation obviously I already have it 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.200
 installed 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.950
 let's go to the configurations of the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.950
 configurations 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.210
 Well, we can see that it is installed 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.390
 bluetooth taxi controls obviously 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.240
 before you start 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.950
 so manipulate these reynish tweets in 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.729
 your device turn it on and turn it off 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.570
 give him a break it would be perfect the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.570
 bluetooth has to be 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.610
 off for this to work so that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.200
 you can teach the tac virus 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.990
 indispensable that the bluetooth is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.540
 off when bluetooth bluetooth 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.130
 tax is on you can see 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.310
 this 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.420
 this icon that is a glute logo 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.250
 inverted and it tells us that it is already 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.979
 active rite stack now let's go to the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.219
 application controls from this is the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.590
 configuration interface says is 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.690
 enabled in it now says assumption 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.400
 notifications please stop is all 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.200
 just as it is and otherwise is not going 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.610
 to know when they should connect their 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.370
 control when they should press the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.700
 play station button to synchronize it 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.080
 if we use a playstation 3 control 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.500
 click on the description of the video 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.200
 connect your playstation 3 control to 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.860
 the computer and good 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.049
 the program is called six pack six pertur 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.680
 and what this allows us is to modify 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.209
 the physical address of bluetooth to the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.760
 that would regularly connect our 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.099
 device and that direction that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.900
 appears there we are going to replace it with the 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.660
 bluetooth address of our 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.819
 device with them in this case it 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.910
 You can see from the menu 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.480
 configurations 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.370
 and general of you will click on the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.560
 close and ready 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.310
 ok now we continue with the configuration 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.310
 of controls 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.560
 we were in general remember they have 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.400
 to click on nothing 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.960
 and there they search for the physical address of their 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.850
 bluetooth 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.100
 that is the direction of marc bluetooth 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.350
 tag 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.800
 bluetooth off gross is on 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.050
 football controls enabled with 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.400
 notifications as is and is so good 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.990
 I told them that in this case we are going to 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.990
 connect precision control 4 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.090
 and we're going to give it control 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.980
 we have to do is press the button 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.940
 of share and the button 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.819
 playstation for about 5 seconds 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.450
 and this will allow us 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.819
 put it in share mode and it's good 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.049
 it was that simple 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.040
 once this is done, everything must be 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.690
 ready to use 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.490
 and it is 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.490
 then now let's see 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:21.870
 let's test with grand theft auto san andrÃ©s 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.870
 and let's see how this tweet works 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.490
 good as I'm just recording the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.570
 screen and audio as the values 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.570
 appear at the top 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.400
 says press the control button 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.020
 the button of this playstation logo 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.409
 which is right in the middle of the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:49.559
 analog joysticks and good 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.559
 as I had shared before then 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.960
 we are only recording video and audio 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.070
 and obviously all the touches that 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.410
 we make on the screen they see with a 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.600
 small point now they are going to 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.650
 disappear the touch controls that 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.460
 regularly have this application 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:14.080
 when you execute if you are not 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.080
 application without this controls tweet or 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.080
 iguana 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.449
 it seems that we are in a situation 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:27.939
 inconvenient but it does not matter 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.939
 you can see that we control 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.830
 change weapons with the r1 button 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.360
 It seems good to me 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:47.090
 absolutely nothing finish killing me 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.520
 but this is basically 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.560
 this this application allows us 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.990
 connect our price point are 3 and 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.710
 playstation 4 on our device with 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.449
 goodbye the gameplay gets better 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.800
 incredibly improved because then the 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.150
 precision has been increased by the 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.540
 controls and good honestly be the 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:11.139
 I recommend the r2 button the button 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.139
 radio is accelerating 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.670
 and l2 button slows 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:28.600
 not only the functions that they give me 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.600
 the controls 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.570
 I'm sorry for that but good is 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.970
 proven that they can connect their 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.650
 control and when they disconnect 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.000
 the banner disappears in the part of 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.550
 above which control has been disconnected 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.220
 I hope you find this video useful 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.400
 have any doubt then leave some 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:55.150
 comment and then I will answer them 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.390
 and thanks for watching this video happens in the 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.390
 Chinese
