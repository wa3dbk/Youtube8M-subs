00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.209 

well<00:03:15.739> looks<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.129> that<00:03:16.340> thing<00:03:16.639> dissolved

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:18.219 
well looks like that thing dissolved

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.309 
well looks like that thing dissolved
these<00:03:19.219> balloons<00:03:19.609> don't<00:03:19.819> last<00:03:20.090> too<00:03:20.389> long<00:03:20.419> as

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
these balloons don't last too long as

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.979 
these balloons don't last too long as
soon<00:03:21.560> as<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.769> pill<00:03:22.069> inside<00:03:22.489> dissolves<00:03:23.269> this

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
soon as that pill inside dissolves this

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:24.929 
soon as that pill inside dissolves this
is<00:03:24.139> what<00:03:24.290> happens

do a whole bucket not possible with
these<00:03:39.939> these<00:03:40.939> look<00:03:41.269> at<00:03:41.359> that<00:03:41.980> they'll<00:03:42.980> stay<00:03:43.310> in
