00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.570
 the kids while I wait for you to give me 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.640
 loading the 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.020
 by the cabin with the first what is 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.980
 the part of the controls and we are worth 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.970
 so you can see what a truck looks like 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.970
 american inside 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 I am here back to the homeland 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.070
 this is here oil pressure is without 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.000
 temperature of the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.090
 in the water the cost revolutions the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.860
 Speedometer with white scales for 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.350
 kilometers per hour and orange to 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.309
 miles per hour 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 here is the scale of needles is the level 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.340
 of fuel and the scales described 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.770
 that's the vital character of f1 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.920
 vale is an additive that takes fuel 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.579
 to reduce emissions all clock in 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.559
 here are this 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.350
 ok is the one air tank and this is 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.109
 the tank or air what is charged 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.839
 these shadow airs are air tanks 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.670
 like the air for the brakes when you 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.710
 stepping on the brake as low a little low 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.340
 a little bit more when it reaches 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.680
 a minimum that is around 90 psi me 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 Over there 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 jump the compressor and fill them 130 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.690
 this always has to be in the area 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.050
 white if the red zone is not braking 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.050
 contrary 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.840
 the crappy radio does not work this from here 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 are the brakes this here the for 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.860
 which is used to supply air to the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.130
 trailer silo was pulled from him the trailer was 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.350
 it is without air and it remains braked which 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 so it is very important not to 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.210
 inside I'm here in the parking break 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.510
 ok it works the same if you pull towards 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510
 outside 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.500
 if I pull out towards the brakes not 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.720
 but only from the trailer not from the trailer or 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.720
 be just the truck trailer 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.569
 is here the trailer break is worth this 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.670
 usually use it unless it is necessary 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.410
 slide the axles of the trailer 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.209
 because there are good people who use 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.550
 lower the slopes to brake before the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.630
 trailer than this but it's a way 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.630
 very nice to make you 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.740
 the relax with alarm and heck 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.300
 this here is the control of the satellite 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.300
 it's worth the satellite 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.840
 the satelite 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.840
 we have it down here 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.450
 this is elite, it is worth knowing how to communicate 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.079
 with the julián activity this company 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.079
 medicine 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.720
 this here is to regenerate the 30 the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.010
 30 what is the role we have in the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.010
 supply current 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.030
 automatic Extremadura on this screen 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.400
 from here it would appear the march in the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.740
 what are we doing here is the pressure 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.740
 of air in the suspension of 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.260
 of the road or the weight that the weight that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.540
 is supporting the truck in this 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.470
 moment in the two tractor axles is worth 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.099
 if it happens of 60 we go badly of weight we go 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.099
 overweight 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.180
 and this here is to move the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.440
 fifth wheel which is where the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.910
 trailer to the power plants for 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.580
 distribute the weight 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.870
 this here the traction control is worth 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.280
 the total differential 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.379
 you are here is to lower or raise the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.360
 tractor air suspension voucher sale 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.849
 the truck stops when the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.440
 trailer triggers gesture later and so 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.950
 does not touch anything 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.570
 and this one here is worth it to make 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.340
 the two extractors work at the same time 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.730
 again only the butt works 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.849
 this applies to both 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:08.110
 well these are cons of picking up the 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.239
 cars of things we have this what 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.549
 is this here is the utility that are 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.379
 some streets of fire that we have in the 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.549
 back of the truck is worth to light 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.049
 towards the trailer if you're giving 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.199
 back off at night or you're hooked 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.040
 trailer see this here is 2 the 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:26.139
 dome is a light that is up here in 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.120
 the center is worth giving to light 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.889
 the inner part the creed this is the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.720
 brake the motor brake is valid or the delay 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.010
 in late to take whom to 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.930
 gave him a compression holiday with what 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.930
 which will be more than a delay 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.560
 has three positions in the city always 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.920
 we use it minimum and when road of 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.920
 maximum use 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.910
 here we have good the performance of the 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.880
 Mirrors 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.080
 the counted anticípate nor lie 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.080
 yang chung 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.980
 and how to explain it 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.510
 here in the us a lot of habit of 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.150
 to keep all the had with the 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.850
 this can be done at 3 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.320
 minutes go off that it happens that if you 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.640
 it's needed because it turns out that it's been a long time 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.670
 cold you could keep warm engine 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.720
 whatever it expels you to that button 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.580
 and it does not work anymore we're still here that 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.660
 it looks like the super post 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:35.820
 actually so we expect in general 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:39.110
 It is for filling the exhaust pipe 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.110
 This serves to 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.259
 when he has a lot of truck he had escape 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.139
 then jumped the dashboard you have 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.419
 to stop putting the deadlock and from 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.520
 the point except in what is called the 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.310
 maximum revolutions for 15 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.380
 minutes and burns all the char all 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:03.480
 everything burns 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:05.640
 after this football is worth a magnifying glass 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.790
 it lights up in red to cause us 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.650
 a lot of damage when you're worth the light is the 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.450
 warning and this happened takes the intensity 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.139
 the need for it 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.700
 after we have here 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:23.010
 this is to control the menu of the 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.569
 in the truck menu that appears here 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.169
 in this little screen 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.129
 ok this I do not know what it is worth the 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.879
 marketing 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:34.349
 and this from james blake in this button 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.679
 here select the position but with 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:40.139
 this one as active or disable it 

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:42.809
 I repeat complicated maricona I have here 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.330
 another here is the real one or water 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:47.230
 no pain that you accept Pakistan 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.930
 control of 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.020
 will control with this active and with this 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.529
 everything regular and I think that nothing else 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.559
 I forgot nothing 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:00.679
 well yes there is a lot of cheek 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:01.399
 this one put here to the station these 

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:02.899
 other doors 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:04.549
 there is another door here there is another 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.749
 pots up there and grids by 

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.549
 all sides up here and grids by 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:09.709
 all sides on the one hand for all this is 

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:11.299
 the one that supports more grid more space 

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:13.069
 this impressive 

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:16.609
 these are curtains that is cast palante 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:20.089
 ok and they stay all this collected without 

00:07:16.609 --> 00:07:23.089
 that you're welcome and there back if you do not see it 

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:25.969
 You see my little bed is worth more 

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:29.409
 real estate furniture and furniture that said a 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:34.709
 berth and more furniture and more furniture 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:37.709
 a loader that's that's all 

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:37.709
 nothing 

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:45.759
 why 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.280
 mine took me through places 

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.280
 unsuspected in the end nothing that 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.580
 that nothing kids here we are waiting 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.810
 to download to see if they call prontito that 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.810
 we have an hour and a half operating 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.319
 has been first video is not going to be the 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.050
 last, let's hope that the teeth 

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:07.379
 be with better quality 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.500
 and nothing gave to take care, come on 

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:09.500
 then
