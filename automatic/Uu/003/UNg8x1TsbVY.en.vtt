rumored a while back I think full purse
is<00:01:23.520> real<00:01:23.750> ok<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> be

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
is real ok I think that it's going to be

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.819 
is real ok I think that it's going to be
a<00:01:25.979> disk<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.549> contains<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> dlc

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
a disk that contains all the dlc

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.410 
a disk that contains all the dlc
including<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.070> story<00:01:29.490> mode<00:01:29.670> DLC<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.210> well

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
including this story mode DLC as well

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.319 
including this story mode DLC as well
and<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.909> come<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.150> on

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and I think it's going to come out on

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.710 
and I think it's going to come out on
ps3<00:01:33.780> xbox<00:01:34.439> 360<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.009> PC<00:01:35.759> because<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.570> what

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
ps3 xbox 360 and PC because that's what

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450 
ps3 xbox 360 and PC because that's what
it's<00:01:36.840> rude<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> come<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.220> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it's rude to come out on so I think it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.740 
it's rude to come out on so I think it's
really<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:38.850> full<00:01:39.329> Brooks<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:39.659> be

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
