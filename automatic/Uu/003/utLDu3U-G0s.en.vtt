00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.650 

when<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:34.350> hair<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.920> straight<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.660> have

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
when my hair is not straight I have

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.850 
when my hair is not straight I have
combination<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.680> sno<00:00:38.399> strands<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.860> some

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
combination of sno strands and some

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.600 
combination of sno strands and some
fairly<00:00:41.550> fine<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.589> fairly<00:00:43.589> textured<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
fairly fine some fairly textured so I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 
fairly fine some fairly textured so I
think<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.059> mixed<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:46.260> throughout<00:00:46.769> so

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
think I'm just mixed all throughout so

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.450 
think I'm just mixed all throughout so
I'll<00:00:48.210> let<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> pictures<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> let

I'll let you see the pictures and let
you<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.729> the<00:00:50.850> judge<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.750> i<00:00:51.780> wanted<00:00:52.140> i<00:00:52.290> saw<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you be the judge but i wanted i saw a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.479 
you be the judge but i wanted i saw a
few<00:00:53.040> YouTube<00:00:53.640> videos<00:00:53.970> about<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:55.489> different

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
few YouTube videos about how different

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.219 
few YouTube videos about how different
people<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.970> their<00:00:57.210> techniques<00:00:57.720> on<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:57.960> they

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
people and their techniques on how they

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.600 
people and their techniques on how they
straighten<00:00:58.589> your<00:00:58.649> hair<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.100> i<00:00:59.159> figured<00:00:59.519> i

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
straighten your hair so i figured i

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.979 
straighten your hair so i figured i
would<00:00:59.790> throw<00:00:59.909> mine<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> game

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
would throw mine out there in the game

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.399 
would throw mine out there in the game
since<00:01:01.589> a<00:01:01.710> lot<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> people<00:01:02.129> ask<00:01:02.460> me<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:03.329> i<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.080> do

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
since a lot of people ask me how i do do

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.969 
since a lot of people ask me how i do do
my<00:01:04.559> hair<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.720> start<00:01:06.720> off<00:01:07.050> it's<00:01:07.500> really

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
my hair so i start off it's really

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
my hair so i start off it's really
important<00:01:08.550> especially<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.420> me

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
important especially if you're like me

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.570 
important especially if you're like me
and<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.810> strain<00:01:10.289> your<00:01:10.470> hair<00:01:10.649> often<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and don't strain your hair often you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.310 
and don't strain your hair often you
probably<00:01:11.910> have<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.179> lot<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.420> buildup<00:01:12.929> on<00:01:13.110> your

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

scalp<00:01:13.679> and<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.640> hair<00:01:14.910> so<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.360> really

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
scalp and on your hair so it's really

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.919 
scalp and on your hair so it's really
important<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.289> at<00:01:16.470> least<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
important for me at least to use a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.160 
important for me at least to use a
cleansing<00:01:18.950> clarifying<00:01:19.950> shampoo<00:01:20.670> first<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.450> i

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cleansing clarifying shampoo first and i

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.010 
cleansing clarifying shampoo first and i
know<00:01:22.229> there's<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.800> controversy<00:01:23.580> about

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
know there's a little controversy about

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.590 
know there's a little controversy about
shampoos<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.050> contain<00:01:25.619> sulfates<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.700> i<00:01:26.970> am

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
shampoos that contain sulfates but i am

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.090 
shampoos that contain sulfates but i am
in<00:01:27.780> fact<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.289> those<00:01:28.440> people<00:01:28.740> who<00:01:28.860> still

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
in fact one of those people who still

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.889 
in fact one of those people who still
use<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.970> i<00:01:30.060> haven't<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.690> had<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
use them and i haven't really had a

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.740 
use them and i haven't really had a
problem<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.800> i<00:01:32.069> guess<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.030> depends<00:01:33.539> on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
problem so i guess it just depends on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.649 
problem so i guess it just depends on
your<00:01:33.899> frequency<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:35.670> which<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.030> use<00:01:36.270> these

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
your frequency in which you use these

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.559 
your frequency in which you use these
products<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.770> contain<00:01:38.039> sulfates<00:01:38.849> and<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.270> use

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
products that contain sulfates and i use

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.150 
products that contain sulfates and i use
them<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.989> infrequently<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.800> i<00:01:40.830> don't<00:01:41.069> think

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
them so infrequently that i don't think

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.760 
them so infrequently that i don't think
that<00:01:41.429> it's<00:01:41.750> it's<00:01:42.750> really<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.050> problem<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.679> me

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that it's it's really a problem for me

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440 
that it's it's really a problem for me
because<00:01:43.920> normally<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.610> i<00:01:44.670> wear<00:01:44.880> my<00:01:44.970> hair<00:01:45.209> not
