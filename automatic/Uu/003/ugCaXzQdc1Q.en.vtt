00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.549
 I'm going to make and John 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.480
 very nice that you look for new ones 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.370
 beds fill through live commentary and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.640
 indeed just like yesterday and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 the day before yesterday again no facebook and it 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.289
 is because it is all in succession 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 and I have thought about it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.220
 I think I'll do a few more episodes 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:33.349
 and then i go one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.349
 make a decision and this is a decision 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.410
 holy shit and then my decision gets in the way 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.960
 to sit 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.250
 but I have and I have thought about and 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.030
 I'm going to stop citizens coming live 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.790
 I expected much more from I want 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.059
 not really much anymore 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.730
 but it's not for me 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.140
 the game i like picture a lot 3 i like 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.809
 much nicer 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.890
 I'm not much nicer to call foot 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.170
 I like younger various play and I 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.280
 just don't have that much fun and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.200
 bubble flood 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.210
 here as a plan i always had in 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.580
 battlefield 3 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.479
 while I had always had a lot so here 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.899
 in film roll 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.520
 and yes i know battlefield 4 is just 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.660
 not laid out for me and I still have 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.580
 just looked if something might come 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.880
 which thought yes neys 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.550
 Now I'm going on too little less often 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.550
 but that did not come 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.970
 I think I can already know with it 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.100
 because I don't do it with 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.100
 all officers is positive 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.000
 very well 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.590
 where the fuck was so i do n't do it then 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 with pleasure and then notice that too 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.520
 the videos are different and you must 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 Of course do naturally if 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.069
 have fun and I like to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.069
 to play but not fun enough 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.700
 already had my social see because we like it 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.460

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.160
