but you're definitely going to want to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.990 
but you're definitely going to want to
go<00:00:27.079> for<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.470> -<00:00:27.680> for<00:00:27.950> Unforgiven<00:00:28.640> which<00:00:28.820> will

go for the - for Unforgiven which will

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.819 
go for the - for Unforgiven which will
give<00:00:29.149> it<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.390> damage<00:00:29.809> times<00:00:30.140> -<00:00:30.439> and<00:00:30.680> this

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
give it the damage times - and this

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.370 
give it the damage times - and this
pistol<00:00:31.309> already<00:00:31.700> has<00:00:32.300> an<00:00:32.509> insane<00:00:32.960> amount<00:00:33.290> of

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
pistol already has an insane amount of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.830 
pistol already has an insane amount of
percentage<00:00:33.860> like<00:00:34.399> whenever<00:00:35.210> you're<00:00:35.510> shooting

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
percentage like whenever you're shooting

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.690 
percentage like whenever you're shooting
this<00:00:35.930> you<00:00:36.110> have<00:00:36.230> 500%<00:00:37.100> critical<00:00:37.550> hit<00:00:37.670> damage

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
this you have 500% critical hit damage

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.420 
this you have 500% critical hit damage
so<00:00:38.480> if<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.690> take<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.050> damage<00:00:39.440> times<00:00:39.710> -<00:00:40.010> like

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
so if you take that damage times - like

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.090 
so if you take that damage times - like
my<00:00:40.610> case<00:00:40.870> 76,000<00:00:41.870> or<00:00:41.930> stuff<00:00:42.080> like<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.440> times

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
my case 76,000 or stuff like that times

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.160 
my case 76,000 or stuff like that times
-<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:43.490> add<00:00:43.610> on<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:43.880> 500%<00:00:44.660> critical<00:00:45.050> hit

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
- and add on that 500% critical hit

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.750 
- and add on that 500% critical hit
damage<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.620> can<00:00:45.800> see<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.220> this<00:00:46.340> gun<00:00:46.580> would

2 of my pro lesson weapons guide tonight

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.459 
2 of my pro lesson weapons guide tonight
I'll<00:06:34.909> try<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.300> get<00:06:35.479> the<00:06:35.569> storm<00:06:35.870> for<00:06:36.139> you<00:06:36.259> guys

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.790 
I'll try to get the storm for you guys
and<00:06:36.860> then<00:06:36.949> maybe<00:06:37.159> I<00:06:37.279> guess<00:06:37.550> I<00:06:37.729> could<00:06:37.909> do<00:06:38.060> the

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
and then maybe I guess I could do the

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.510 
and then maybe I guess I could do the
what<00:06:39.800> was<00:06:39.949> it<00:06:40.159> the<00:06:40.430> butcher<00:06:40.820> again

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
what was it the butcher again

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.450 
what was it the butcher again
get<00:06:41.699> that<00:06:41.819> out<00:06:42.030> there<00:06:42.270> but<00:06:42.479> there's<00:06:42.690> only<00:06:42.840> like

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
get that out there but there's only like

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.439 
get that out there but there's only like
there's<00:06:44.460> actually<00:06:44.669> eight<00:06:45.060> of<00:06:45.360> these

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
there's actually eight of these

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.089 
there's actually eight of these
pearlescent<00:06:46.139> weapons<00:06:46.500> so<00:06:46.620> it's<00:06:46.770> not<00:06:46.889> going<00:06:47.039> to

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
pearlescent weapons so it's not going to

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:49.100 
pearlescent weapons so it's not going to
be<00:06:47.220> a<00:06:47.250> very<00:06:47.550> long<00:06:47.759> series<00:06:48.180> but<00:06:48.539> nonetheless<00:06:48.690> I

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
be a very long series but nonetheless I

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.140 
be a very long series but nonetheless I
will<00:06:49.259> bring<00:06:49.440> those<00:06:49.650> to<00:06:49.830> you<00:06:49.860> I've<00:06:50.370> also<00:06:50.669> got<00:06:51.000> an

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
will bring those to you I've also got an

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.480 
will bring those to you I've also got an
idea<00:06:51.539> for<00:06:51.599> a<00:06:51.840> legendary<00:06:52.379> weapon<00:06:52.680> series<00:06:53.250> ultra

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
idea for a legendary weapon series ultra

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.939 
idea for a legendary weapon series ultra
vault<00:06:54.240> hunter<00:06:54.569> mode<00:06:54.629> where<00:06:55.319> I<00:06:55.349> actually<00:06:55.500> get

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
vault hunter mode where I actually get

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.520 
vault hunter mode where I actually get
all<00:06:56.129> the<00:06:56.250> legendaries<00:06:56.849> again<00:06:57.240> as<00:06:57.449> level<00:06:57.780> 61's

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
and I do a series comparing them to the

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.740 
and I do a series comparing them to the
level<00:07:00.990> 50s<00:07:01.560> to<00:07:02.400> the<00:07:02.430> level<00:07:02.819> 61<00:07:03.270> so<00:07:03.449> leave<00:07:03.599> in

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
level 50s to the level 61 so leave in
