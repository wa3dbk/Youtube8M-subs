00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.629
 I wanted to introduce you to the last born 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.080
 tasting glasses that is the opposite 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.490
 100% French hears its design and 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.680
 in his achievement for one is on a 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.820
 product that is organic I want to 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.410
 point out since there is no lead to 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.860
 inside that is to say we are on 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.910
 a material called quartz that 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.950
 resists the shocks of life 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.050
 as you can see so that 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.750
 it's very interesting for both 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.339
 professionals and individuals 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.320
 withstands 2000 washing without water not cited 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.940
 glass without whitish wig and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.079
 on the other hand it will remain unalterable 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.789
 in time that is to say that until 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.719
 moment when to bother as a day he goes 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.929
 break that yourself 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.649
 well he will stay in this 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.089
 characteristic so in this 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.359
 shine and in and in this 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.249
 whiteness so that's the material side 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.469
 now as regards the process 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:59.569
 elysium of which is single green world 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.870
 since it is patented it was patented on 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.859
 a little over 60 countries on the inside 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.680
 so a wind turbine 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.940
 then to do a little bit of a return 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.220
 about this product 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.810
 Well, it's a little country 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.370
 since I discovered during a ride 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.130
 pedestrian on the heights of the mountain 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.150
 black so on the bottom of the Cevennes so 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.770
 the border between languedoc 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.020
 roussillon and midi pyrénées 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.060
 a small village called murat on 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.890
 vèbre or there actually I discovered 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.520
 a wind farm so far nothing 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.730
 exceptional 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.260
 on the other hand the interesting side and well 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.360
 is that you have multitude of 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.160
 scents that came to my nose 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.910
 since I have a training at the school of 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.230
 logis de bordeaux and so I said yesterday 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.060
 these are interesting transform 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.340
 the wind energy in mechanics of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
 fluids in a glass in which case m 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.360
 a wind turbine as you can see 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.620
 a wind turbine in a glass inside 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.140
 you have a dom 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.550
 which is the nose of the wind turbine that is going 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.590
 when you go to turn the wine goes 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.910
 to lay the wine on the walls 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.860
 inside the glass on 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.780
 microcracks of the glass to excite a 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.950
 little bit the wine molecules and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.370
 then inside you have some 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.870
 blades that are two different heights 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.670
 since they are gauged calibrated for 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.410
 fully respect the legislation 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.649
 French that binds to drink less but 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.510
 better 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.740
 and especially if you want I'll 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.780
 work the three aromatic layers 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.800
 from my father since in a glass like 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.270
 in wine you have layers 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.440
 aromatic 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.610
 the first aromatic layer is 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.920
 when I'm going to serve my wine by 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.110
 example the first palissy between the goal 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.040
 wind and the height of 20 eh well I have 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.590
 when we call the primary flavors 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.540
 in the volatile weapons in the middle of the wine 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.040
 you are especially what is fruit and r 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.720
 and at the bottom of the glass you are on the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.090
 wood and alcohol when I'm going to turn 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.350
 my my glass mechanically and well 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.750
 automatically I will work my 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.300
 three aromatic layers of wine and so 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.770
 well I'll have a real one for 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.430
 popularize the speech a real 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.140
 fruit basket 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.450
 that is to say that I really will go 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.460
 look for the side we are going to say fruity 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.540
 my wine and I will often mitigate 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.670
 tannins what makes you gonna have 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.930
 something quite flattering so in 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.790
 this collection you have four glasses 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.470
 you have the green so I do not you 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.060
 Presented as the most opulent breeder 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.459
 for very powerful wines very mature 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.739
 which can be red and white is 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.820
 certainly a vinous rosé why not you 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.380
 have green a little bit more 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.570
 tasters who is smaller does not 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.610
 takes the same concept or there I can 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.980
 all tasted the same from the bubbly 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.910
 why not 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.590
 here so we have the green 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.480
 effervescence since there when we go 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.770
 drink we will be able to put the nose so 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.370
 I will have the nasal retro that goes 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.750
 operate and here the dom and concave to 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.040
 inside this dogma I got 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.720
 supported by liger-belair liger-belair 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.940
 it's a researcher on the bubble of 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.680
 champagne that says that the more there are 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.400
 more missions there is development 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 organoleptic 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.380
 in which case I did the tests between 10 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.990
 and 80 moss point that are made at 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.380
 laser at the bottom of the glass to make me 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.090
 account 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.330
 well if you want what was going 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.800
 happen in this case here I'm 30 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.600
 for a year and is between 10 and 80 I 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.970
 I realized that 30 was the best 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.200
 okay so here I had a real 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.720
 rising bubbles in the center of the glass 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.010
 a real chimney to arrive at the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.840
 periphery of the fluid javert a 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.310
 real foam crown is here for 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.080
 once I can get away without 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.930
 m'moustille and the nose since when I 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.490
 go healthy and well the bubbles that 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.530
 goes back homogeneously to sales 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.570
 of winter they will say break up on the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.680
 before here and not on the back which 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.710
 I did not feel embarrassed to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.109
 quiet impeccable the last pale 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.609
 which is the highest here is calibrated to 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.570
 12 5 centilitres so that I have 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.270
 six glasses in a bottle 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.070
 so at home nobody will be wronged and 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.240
 for the professional glass wine 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.350
 for example is pretty interesting 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.600
 since there we will really have 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.180
 gauge thing by its shape see 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.260
 which is pretty tulips and back 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.850
 I worked there on 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.830
 taste buds of the tongue as 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.250
 you know we have taste buds and 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.540
 happily on the tongue which are the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.760
 sugar is at the end of the tongue 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.919
 the salty acidity on the sides and 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.660
 astringency are hungry for language than that 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.640
 is that when you drink a sweet wine 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.250
 natural or a syrupy that is already 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.140
 sugar is naturally it tends 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.400
 in a glass that is not suitable for 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.140
 come on you tap on the tip of your 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.570
 long being without you realizing it 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.690
 you will notice that there is 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.490
 how to say a single certain one 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.470
 some heaviness in this bath since 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.090
 is there is a sugar addition to the 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.380
 times the wine is naturally sugar is 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.890
 in addition he comes to hit the end of 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.440
 your language 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.170
 while here as he goes back 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.180
 there is behind that which I keep 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.910
 my the naturalness of my wine that and 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.370
 sweet which is sweet without tapping 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.250
 directly on the taste buds of the 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.750
 language so the latest born is the worm 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.680
 goblet so it's fine for 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.470
 water but it has other virtues 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.880
 luckily his share one is very fine this 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.920
 which will allow me to taste 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.420
 Alcohol rather than alcohol Alcohol strand 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.850
 white so stranded alcohol that can be all 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.890
 why not Armagnac 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.780
 can be bad you can be so 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.190
 yes what interests him is like the 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.110
 walls and fine when I'm going to taste 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.040
 I positioned my glass in the palm 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.510
 from the hand 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.640
 the body temperature was in 37 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.590
 degrees I quickly alcohol that goes 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.410
 ride because with the heat the 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.240
 alcohols goes up then i turned what 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.650
 means that by turning automatically 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.570
 thanks to the pages I will evacuate 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.270
 head alcohols what makes I go 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.100
 to have all the fruit and not the alcohol 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.510
 which makes it pretty awesome 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.090
 since they automatically and well 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.290
 listen to the the green will allow me so 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.840
 to taste more my fruity side at 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.250
 level of my alcohol and wine what we 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.530
 can drink wine as well in there as the 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.720
 alcohol side on the show I do them 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.790
 test a number of people 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.110
 including a gentleman who does 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.500
 the armagnac that told me it's a pure 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.000
 wonder 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.530
 because automatically we will go 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.710
 look for all the material and not 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.710
 the alcohol
