00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello to youtube today we present 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.419
 adrenaline this is a song that can 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.790
 be very simple or very difficult according to 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.510
 how do you touch it today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.610
 very easy version 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.590
 for strumming in this easy version 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.890
 let's just do two traits towards 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.890
 down 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.770
 and we do silences 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.579
 12 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.429
 1 silence 2 silence 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.109
 for the chords we have two parts and it's 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.379
 very easy because the part that sings 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:48.109
 wisin is always less then 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:52.670
 We started in D minor me all the time 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:57.949
 like when it's done, you hit me 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.239
 seduction at the time of dancing that fire 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:05.690
 that has on your hips to any 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.080
 man puts to delirium 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:13.580
 only minor for the chorus mocks greater 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 and that is that your body is pure adrenaline what 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 that inside me catches me I'm younger 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.590
 has on the verge of madness is that you 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.430
 body fa we repeat is pure adrenaline 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:35.810
 that inside me catches me has me 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.950
 edge of madness and we repeat low ups 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.930
 the adrenaline goes up the adrenaline I am 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.130
 less 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.900
 it goes up the drainage very simple then it comes 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.220
 a part where wisin speaks again 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.920
 only re minor that is ok there is a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.110
 rare feeling and so on 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.660
 and then comes another part in which 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.869
 sings jennifer lópez that is the same 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:07.430
 only part in which she is lesser ' 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:10.850
