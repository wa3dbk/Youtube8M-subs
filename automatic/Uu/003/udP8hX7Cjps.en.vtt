 need to bring mechanic to be 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.369
 charging the battery is a very 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.790
 simple to make're a lamp 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.170

 I have a bottle here in the negative 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 the battery was discharged 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.500
 I carried a little and it should be 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.539
 carrying the coach with the car 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.410
 connected is not good 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.300
 Now it's loaded on the battery, you see. 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.969
 is running when the engine is running on the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.829

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.829
 Now I'm going to turn on the car. 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.110
 the connected car and semen 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.560
 strip the battery cable 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.130
 the car is still on 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.930
 Now you come here and pay me. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.189
 by battery positive also want 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.960
 Tell which coach is carrying 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.960
 fair arrives 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.090
 turn off the car 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.710
 the cable is still off the battery 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.700
 Now the lamp does not care 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.130
 coach is not charging you 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.780
 here is a load that is on the positive 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:19.390
 battery and here we will not call put the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.990
 cable connect the car to new v6 engine 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.990
 again 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.400
 take the car 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:44.980
 saw the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:47.439
 very simple a very 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.519
 simple but can not do is not 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:54.670
 You need to take a mechanic to see if you 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:58.030
 charging even if it does not turn on if the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.189
 Neither lamp with the cable out of the battery 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.019
 this means that the other side does not 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.010
 was charging the battery of the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.769
 species 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 if you are not aware of how 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.549
 the coach works 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.450
 Then you take the mechanic if the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:21.189
 alternator has been loading and even 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.680
 anyway so you do not have the burden 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:27.099
 battery means that the battery tap 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.010
 I miss you, Rio dried up, it's on time. 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.400
 replacing the battery okay 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.560
 I hope it helped you, that's it. 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.560
