00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
20 20 20 sensitivity I don't know why

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.479 
20 20 20 sensitivity I don't know why
I've<00:00:54.570> never<00:00:54.600> done<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.590> decided<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I've never done it but I decided that it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.340 
I've never done it but I decided that it
is<00:00:56.610> probably<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.059> time<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.719> switch<00:00:57.989> over

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
is probably now time that I switch over

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.690 
is probably now time that I switch over
do<00:00:58.829> something<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.489> more

advanced<00:01:02.969> warfare<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.259> easy<00:01:04.440> to<00:01:04.619> hit

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
advanced warfare is pretty easy to hit

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.320 
advanced warfare is pretty easy to hit
clips<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.160> stuff<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.550> thought<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.030> might<00:01:06.060> as

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

challenge myself at least a little bit
if<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> guys<00:01:11.130> didn't<00:01:11.459> know<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.910> played<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.569> 10

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
if you guys didn't know I played on 10

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.529 
if you guys didn't know I played on 10
sensitivity<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> past<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.580> 3-4

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
sensitivity for like the past like 3-4

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.150 
sensitivity for like the past like 3-4
months<00:01:15.750> something<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.649> ever<00:01:17.009> since

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
months something like that ever since

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.669 
months something like that ever since
the<00:01:17.550> game<00:01:17.850> came<00:01:18.209> out<00:01:18.420> I've<00:01:18.750> been<00:01:19.259> playing<00:01:19.500> on

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
the game came out I've been playing on

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.210 
the game came out I've been playing on
10<00:01:19.920> sensitivity<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.209> yeah<00:01:22.050> I<00:01:22.410> think<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.800> just<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
10 sensitivity so yeah I think I just I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
10 sensitivity so yeah I think I just I
need<00:01:23.459> to<00:01:23.550> switch<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> over<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:24.929> we

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
need to switch it over I just think we

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.499 
need to switch it over I just think we
can<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:25.649> can<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.819> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.240> cooler

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
can I can go for like a lot more cooler

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.809 
can I can go for like a lot more cooler
shots<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> stuff<00:01:28.289> if<00:01:28.530> i<00:01:28.950> switch<00:01:29.220> over<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
shots and stuff if i switch over to the

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.779 
shots and stuff if i switch over to the
to<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.440> newer<00:01:31.440> kind<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.830> sensitivity<00:01:32.490> our

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
to the newer kind of sensitivity our

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.400 
to the newer kind of sensitivity our
like<00:01:33.660> so<00:01:34.619> i<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.880> split<00:01:36.179> in<00:01:36.270> everyone<00:01:36.539> was<00:01:36.780> that

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
like so i was split in everyone was that

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.859 
like so i was split in everyone was that
guy<00:01:37.530> saying<00:01:37.709> split<00:01:38.099> my<00:01:38.220> quad<00:01:38.490> I'd<00:01:39.479> say<00:01:39.750> he

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
guy saying split my quad I'd say he

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.240 
guy saying split my quad I'd say he
almost<00:01:40.140> split<00:01:40.319> my<00:01:40.440> quad<00:01:40.679> that's<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.039> he<00:01:41.130> did

new<00:03:01.490> stuff<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.090> channel<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.660> think

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
new stuff for the channel and I think

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.380 
new stuff for the channel and I think
that<00:03:03.080> changing<00:03:03.560> up<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.090> sensitivity<00:03:05.090> kind<00:03:05.300> of

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
that changing up the sensitivity kind of

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.550 
that changing up the sensitivity kind of
thing<00:03:05.600> would<00:03:05.810> kind<00:03:06.019> of<00:03:06.080> be<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> little<00:03:06.290> bit

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
thing would kind of be a little bit

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.020 
thing would kind of be a little bit
interesting<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.160> kind<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.459> want<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.670> go<00:03:07.790> for

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
getting used to this new sensitivity

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.479 
getting used to this new sensitivity
like<00:03:14.690> I'm<00:03:14.810> gonna<00:03:14.930> go<00:03:15.080> for<00:03:15.260> like<00:03:15.320> 7<00:03:15.709> 20<00:03:16.040> s<00:03:16.100> like

like I'm gonna go for like 7 20 s like

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.070 
like I'm gonna go for like 7 20 s like
at<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.760> very<00:03:16.970> end<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.330> clip<00:03:17.660> or<00:03:17.810> something

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
at the very end of the clip or something

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.390 
at the very end of the clip or something
like<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.230> or<00:03:18.410> maybe<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.950> legitimate

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
like that or maybe like a legitimate

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.910 
like that or maybe like a legitimate
trickshot<00:03:19.970> like<00:03:20.209> get<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.390> 3<00:03:20.660> b's<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.080> then<00:03:21.680> go

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
trickshot like get a 3 b's and then go

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.470 
trickshot like get a 3 b's and then go
for<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.610> mean<00:03:22.970> technically<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.390> would

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
for like I mean technically it would

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.790 
for like I mean technically it would
just<00:03:23.630> be<00:03:23.810> called<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.050> four-piece<00:03:24.410> but<00:03:24.590> like<00:03:24.709> I

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
just be called a four-piece but like I

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.590 
just be called a four-piece but like I
would<00:03:24.860> try<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.130> hit<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> quad<00:03:25.670> feed<00:03:25.940> like

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
would try to hit the quad feed like

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.390 
would try to hit the quad feed like
because<00:03:27.350> that's<00:03:27.620> like<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.950> thing<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.250> can

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400
