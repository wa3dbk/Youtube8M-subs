hi<00:00:26.790> I'm<00:00:26.970> Don<00:00:27.210> car<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.690> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.020> boss<00:00:28.260> DD<00:00:28.890> 7

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
hi I'm Don car and this is the boss DD 7

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.760 
hi I'm Don car and this is the boss DD 7
digital<00:00:29.850> delay<00:00:30.180> as<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.050> heard<00:00:31.200> in<00:00:31.290> the<00:00:31.320> intro

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
digital delay as you heard in the intro

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.850 
digital delay as you heard in the intro
this<00:00:32.190> is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.880> pristine<00:00:33.330> clean<00:00:33.660> delay<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
this is a really pristine clean delay I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.549 
this is a really pristine clean delay I
had<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.640> lot<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:35.970> delay<00:00:36.330> time<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.900> I<00:00:37.140> had<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> lot

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
had a lot of delay time and I had a lot

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
had a lot of delay time and I had a lot
of<00:00:37.590> repeats<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.220> it<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.640> hung<00:00:38.820> together

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
of repeats and it really hung together

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.950 
of repeats and it really hung together
really<00:00:39.510> stayed<00:00:39.870> clean<00:00:41.000> it's<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
really stayed clean it's it's got up to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960 
really stayed clean it's it's got up to
6<00:00:43.290> seconds<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.830> delay<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.250> 6<00:00:44.489> point<00:00:44.730> 4

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
6 seconds of delay time 6 point 4

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.330 
6 seconds of delay time 6 point 4
seconds<00:00:45.480> actually<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:47.129> probably

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
seconds actually and that was probably

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.500 
seconds actually and that was probably
that<00:00:48.270> was<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.080> longer<00:00:49.830> range<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.910> as

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that was in the longer range that was as

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
that was in the longer range that was as
you<00:00:51.900> can<00:00:52.020> see<00:00:52.170> there's<00:00:52.350> different<00:00:52.410> modes<00:00:53.010> here

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
you can see there's different modes here

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.790 
you can see there's different modes here
that<00:00:54.150> was<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.540> longest<00:00:55.020> mode<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.710> then

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that was in the longest mode and then

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.290 
that was in the longest mode and then
you<00:00:55.950> can<00:00:56.160> tweak<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> delay<00:00:56.790> time<00:00:57.000> through

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you can tweak the delay time through

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
you can tweak the delay time through
that<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.380> also<00:00:58.620> tweak<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.310> delay<00:00:59.579> time

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that you can also tweak the delay time

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.240 
that you can also tweak the delay time
by<00:01:00.450> tapping<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.290> we'll<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:01.890> into<00:01:02.070> some<00:01:02.220> of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
by tapping it and we'll get into some of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.500 
by tapping it and we'll get into some of
the<00:01:02.370> features<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.700> this<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.060> a<00:01:03.120> minute

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the features of this in a minute

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.290 
the features of this in a minute
so<00:01:03.809> today<00:01:04.050> I'm<00:01:04.140> playing<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.530> PRS<00:01:04.979> 5:13<00:01:05.700> through

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
so today I'm playing a PRS 5:13 through

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.210 
so today I'm playing a PRS 5:13 through
a<00:01:06.330> Fender<00:01:06.780> Deluxe<00:01:06.810> reverb<00:01:07.410> amp<00:01:07.680> actually<00:01:08.100> have

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
a Fender Deluxe reverb amp actually have

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
a Fender Deluxe reverb amp actually have
the<00:01:08.310> verb<00:01:08.520> off<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.540> hear<00:01:09.690> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the verb off so you can really hear the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.320 
the verb off so you can really hear the
delay<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.160> unaffected<00:01:11.759> reference

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
delay here is the unaffected reference

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.260 
delay here is the unaffected reference
with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.570> D<00:01:12.750> d7<00:01:13.170> off

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:29.380 

and<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.009> with<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.220> current<00:01:21.490> settings

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.249 

you

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.660 

boss<00:01:33.259> does<00:01:33.469> a<00:01:33.500> great<00:01:33.770> job<00:01:33.829> of<00:01:34.100> putting<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.460> lot

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
boss does a great job of putting a lot

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.969 
boss does a great job of putting a lot
of<00:01:34.700> features<00:01:34.969> in<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.630> little<00:01:35.990> bitty<00:01:36.140> pedal<00:01:36.560> that

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
of features in a little bitty pedal that

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.319 
of features in a little bitty pedal that
same<00:01:37.219> pedal<00:01:37.549> size<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:38.030> they've<00:01:38.149> been<00:01:38.270> making

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
same pedal size that they've been making

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.319 
same pedal size that they've been making
for<00:01:38.780> decades<00:01:39.469> they<00:01:40.039> managed<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.850> put<00:01:41.030> more<00:01:41.299> and

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
for decades they managed to put more and

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.639 
for decades they managed to put more and
more<00:01:41.479> stuff<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.049> it

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
more stuff in it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.529 
more stuff in it
for<00:01:43.039> example<00:01:43.399> this<00:01:43.520> has<00:01:43.670> only<00:01:43.759> got<00:01:44.000> four<00:01:44.299> knobs

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
for example this has only got four knobs

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.260 
for example this has only got four knobs
on<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.810> it's<00:01:45.619> got<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.009> effect<00:01:46.310> level<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.819> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
on it it's got the effect level and the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.410 
on it it's got the effect level and the
feedback<00:01:47.719> and<00:01:47.990> you're<00:01:48.709> fine<00:01:49.700> delay<00:01:50.149> time

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
feedback and you're fine delay time

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.389 
feedback and you're fine delay time
adjustment<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:51.409> this<00:01:51.590> mode<00:01:51.860> knob<00:01:52.100> over<00:01:52.280> here

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
adjustment but this mode knob over here

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.649 
adjustment but this mode knob over here
is<00:01:52.640> kind<00:01:52.819> of<00:01:52.850> where<00:01:52.969> all<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.209> action<00:01:53.569> is

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
is kind of where all the action is

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.840 
is kind of where all the action is
really<00:01:54.039> right<00:01:55.039> now<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:55.429> see<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.789> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
really right now you can see it's in the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.359 
really right now you can see it's in the
long<00:01:56.030> delay<00:01:56.329> mode<00:01:56.569> there<00:01:57.259> are<00:01:57.560> shorter<00:01:58.100> delay

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
long delay mode there are shorter delay

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.740 
long delay mode there are shorter delay
modes<00:01:58.640> all<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.000> way<00:01:59.119> down<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.450> 50

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
modes all the way down to 50

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.510 
modes all the way down to 50
milliseconds<00:02:00.439> which<00:02:00.950> will<00:02:01.100> give<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:01.310> more<00:02:01.459> of

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
milliseconds which will give you more of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.740 
milliseconds which will give you more of
a<00:02:02.619> gosh<00:02:03.619> almost<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.360> flange<00:02:05.360> encountered

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
a gosh almost a flange encountered

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.289 
a gosh almost a flange encountered
almost<00:02:06.349> a<00:02:06.739> doubling<00:02:07.159> sound<00:02:07.459> for<00:02:07.640> sure<00:02:07.670> there's

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
almost a doubling sound for sure there's

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.080 
almost a doubling sound for sure there's
a<00:02:08.360> hold<00:02:08.720> mode<00:02:09.140> which<00:02:10.069> basically<00:02:10.099> turns<00:02:10.940> it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
a hold mode which basically turns it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.910 
a hold mode which basically turns it
into<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.299> looper<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.230> single<00:02:12.590> loop<00:02:12.739> but

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
into a looper it's a single loop but

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.380 
into a looper it's a single loop but
it's<00:02:13.040> 40<00:02:13.280> seconds<00:02:13.730> worth<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:13.970> loop<00:02:14.150> time

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
it's 40 seconds worth of loop time

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.530 
it's 40 seconds worth of loop time
there's<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.410> reverse<00:02:15.769> mode<00:02:16.040> an<00:02:16.370> analogue<00:02:17.299> mode

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
there's a reverse mode an analogue mode

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.470 
there's a reverse mode an analogue mode
which<00:02:17.780> simulates<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.010> dm2<00:02:19.879> it's<00:02:20.090> nice<00:02:20.269> and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
which simulates the dm2 it's nice and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.050 
which simulates the dm2 it's nice and
warm<00:02:20.599> sounding<00:02:21.079> and<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.440> modulate<00:02:22.190> mode<00:02:22.459> which

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
warm sounding and a modulate mode which

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.500 
warm sounding and a modulate mode which
is<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.660> modulated<00:02:24.560> delay<00:02:24.590> sound<00:02:25.299> okay<00:02:26.299> let's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
is a modulated delay sound okay let's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.910 
is a modulated delay sound okay let's
take<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.690> listen<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.049> some<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.440> features<00:02:27.590> on

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
take a listen to some of the features on

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:47.570 
take a listen to some of the features on
this<00:02:28.069> thing

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.890 

now<00:02:48.580> we're<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.820> module<00:02:49.180> 8<00:02:49.270> mode<00:02:49.510> which

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
now we're in module 8 mode which

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.690 
now we're in module 8 mode which
actually<00:02:50.260> has<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.410> pitch<00:02:50.710> shifted<00:02:51.220> signal<00:02:51.580> so

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
actually has a pitch shifted signal so

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.420 
actually has a pitch shifted signal so
it<00:02:51.820> has<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> course<00:02:52.420> e<00:02:52.570> type<00:02:52.780> effect<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it has a course e type effect on the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.760 
it has a course e type effect on the
delays<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.570> course<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.990> more<00:02:56.170> feedback

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
delays and of course the more feedback

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.530 
delays and of course the more feedback
and<00:02:57.040> more<00:02:57.220> regeneration<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.180> kind<00:02:58.450> of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
and more regeneration the kind of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.720 
and more regeneration the kind of
wackier<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.170> crazier<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.680> gets<00:02:59.740> so<00:03:00.190> I'm<00:03:00.580> going

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
wackier and crazier it gets so I'm going

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.040 
wackier and crazier it gets so I'm going
to<00:03:00.820> do<00:03:00.910> some<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.210> stuff<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:01.720> check<00:03:01.750> this

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
to do some of that stuff so check this

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:24.580 
to do some of that stuff so check this
out

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.229 

now<00:03:25.590> I'm<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:25.829> analog<00:03:26.249> mode<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.909> don't<00:03:27.060> get<00:03:27.150> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
now I'm in analog mode you don't get the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.390 
now I'm in analog mode you don't get the
full<00:03:27.389> six<00:03:27.749> point<00:03:27.989> four<00:03:28.230> seconds<00:03:28.829> worth<00:03:29.280> of

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
full six point four seconds worth of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.699 
full six point four seconds worth of
delay<00:03:29.639> time<00:03:29.879> in<00:03:30.060> analog<00:03:30.420> mode<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.530> is

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
delay time in analog mode but this is

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.199 
delay time in analog mode but this is
the<00:03:31.859> sound<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.639> actually<00:03:32.939> the<00:03:33.030> max

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
the sound and this is actually the max

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.000 
the sound and this is actually the max
time<00:03:33.480> right<00:03:33.659> here<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:33.989> it's<00:03:34.139> definitely<00:03:34.950> you

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
time right here but it's definitely you

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.259 
time right here but it's definitely you
can<00:03:35.099> hear<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.370> warmth<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.939> hear<00:03:36.090> that

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
can hear the warmth you can hear that

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:43.860 
can hear the warmth you can hear that
dm2<00:03:37.079> sound

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.850 

you

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.490 

you

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.860 

analog<00:03:51.370> mode<00:03:51.550> is<00:03:51.760> really<00:03:52.360> good<00:03:52.540> for<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
analog mode is really good for the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.720 
analog mode is really good for the
slapback<00:03:53.440> kind<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.770> rockabilly<00:03:54.070> sound<00:03:54.520> too

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
slapback kind of rockabilly sound too

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:06.240 
slapback kind of rockabilly sound too
like<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.420> know<00:04:04.830> another<00:04:05.830> nice<00:04:06.070> feature

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
like this you know another nice feature

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.120 
like this you know another nice feature
on<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.580> DD<00:04:06.820> 7<00:04:07.000> is<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.420> complete<00:04:07.930> dry<00:04:08.320> kill<00:04:08.830> if

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
on the DD 7 is the complete dry kill if

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.520 
on the DD 7 is the complete dry kill if
you<00:04:09.550> turn<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.090> effect<00:04:10.570> level<00:04:10.780> all<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.110> way<00:04:11.410> up

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
you turn the effect level all the way up

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.000 
you turn the effect level all the way up
you<00:04:12.270> essentially<00:04:13.270> kill<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.780> dry<00:04:14.170> signal<00:04:14.230> so

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
you essentially kill the dry signal so

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.289 
you essentially kill the dry signal so
I'm<00:04:15.160> going<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.340> do<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:15.700> Reverse<00:04:16.000> modes

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
I'm going to do that in Reverse modes

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:29.370 
I'm going to do that in Reverse modes
kind<00:04:16.540> of<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.630> cool<00:04:16.810> effect<00:04:28.260> there's<00:04:29.260> an

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
kind of a cool effect there's an

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.590 
kind of a cool effect there's an
expression<00:04:29.860> pedal<00:04:29.890> input<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.670> with<00:04:31.480> an

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
expression pedal input and with an

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.790 
expression pedal input and with an
expression<00:04:32.050> pedal<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.470> can<00:04:32.620> actually

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
expression pedal you can actually

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.150 
expression pedal you can actually
control<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.730> delay<00:04:34.090> time<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:35.230> regeneration

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
control the delay time the regeneration

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.130 
control the delay time the regeneration
and<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:37.800> effect<00:04:38.800> level<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.330> also<00:04:40.360> put<00:04:40.960> a

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
and the effect level you can also put a

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.900 
and the effect level you can also put a
momentary<00:04:41.620> switch<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.340> do<00:04:42.430> tap<00:04:42.670> tempo

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
momentary switch in and do tap tempo

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.390 
momentary switch in and do tap tempo
with<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.330> as<00:04:43.420> well<00:04:43.600> but<00:04:44.560> another<00:04:45.010> nice<00:04:45.220> feature

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
with it as well but another nice feature

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.880 
with it as well but another nice feature
is<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:45.790> can<00:04:45.880> do<00:04:46.240> tap<00:04:46.570> tempo<00:04:46.840> with<00:04:47.740> the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
is that you can do tap tempo with the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.740 
is that you can do tap tempo with the
included<00:04:48.340> switch<00:04:48.670> all<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.360> got<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.570> do<00:04:49.630> is

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
included switch all you got to do is

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.870 
included switch all you got to do is
hold<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.110> down<00:04:50.260> alright<00:04:50.920> 2<00:04:51.790> seconds<00:04:53.700> now<00:04:54.700> this

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
hold it down alright 2 seconds now this

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.880 
hold it down alright 2 seconds now this
is<00:04:54.970> our<00:04:55.090> current<00:04:55.419> tempo<00:04:55.780> right<00:04:56.320> I'm<00:04:56.590> going<00:04:56.830> to

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
is our current tempo right I'm going to

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:10.050 
is our current tempo right I'm going to
tap<00:04:57.070> in<00:04:57.220> a<00:04:57.310> new<00:04:57.430> one<00:05:08.220> or<00:05:09.220> you<00:05:09.610> can<00:05:09.730> tap<00:05:09.880> into

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
tap in a new one or you can tap into

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:22.130 
tap in a new one or you can tap into
another<00:05:10.240> tempo<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:17.440> then<00:05:17.890> to<00:05:18.010> get<00:05:18.130> out<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.400> it
