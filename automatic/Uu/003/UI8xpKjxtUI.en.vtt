00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
than black ops 2 because

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.869 
than black ops 2 because
I've<00:02:48.900> tried<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> few<00:02:50.099> Kimbrough<00:02:50.550> souls

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
I've tried to do a few Kimbrough souls

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.880 
I've tried to do a few Kimbrough souls
by<00:02:51.000> myself<00:02:51.390> playing<00:02:51.599> black<00:02:51.780> ops<00:02:51.930> 2<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.830> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
by myself playing black ops 2 and I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.309 
by myself playing black ops 2 and I
gotta<00:02:53.069> say<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.550> wasn't<00:02:53.879> as<00:02:53.970> much<00:02:54.120> fun

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
gotta say it just wasn't as much fun

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.660 
gotta say it just wasn't as much fun
because<00:02:55.319> once<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.650> get<00:02:55.769> specialists<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.519> this

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
because once you get specialists in this

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.410 
because once you get specialists in this
game<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> whole<00:02:57.810> nother<00:02:58.170> game<00:02:58.590> and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
game it's like a whole nother game and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.030 
game it's like a whole nother game and
especially<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.379> know<00:03:01.500> your<00:03:01.769> akimbo

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
especially with you know your akimbo

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.400 
especially with you know your akimbo
weapons<00:03:02.550> or<00:03:02.760> you're<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.300> keen<00:03:03.660> Braille<00:03:03.930> weapons

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
weapons or you're a keen Braille weapons

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.710 
weapons or you're a keen Braille weapons
it's<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:05.099> your<00:03:05.340> Opie<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.970> that's<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.330> that's

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
it's just your Opie and that's so that's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720 
it's just your Opie and that's so that's
the<00:03:06.810> whole<00:03:06.930> point<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.319> it's<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.620> fun<00:03:07.799> point

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the whole point of it it's the fun point

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.789 
the whole point of it it's the fun point
of<00:03:08.849> playing<00:03:09.480> at<00:03:09.780> Kimber<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.080> doing<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.440> Syria

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
of playing at Kimber on doing that Syria

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.860 
of playing at Kimber on doing that Syria
it's<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.099> being<00:03:11.280> 0<00:03:11.459> pee<00:03:11.670> pissing<00:03:12.420> people<00:03:12.750> off

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
it's just being 0 pee pissing people off

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's just being 0 pee pissing people off
and<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:13.860> don't<00:03:14.700> think<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
and you just don't think you can do the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.199 
and you just don't think you can do the
same<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:15.720> black<00:03:15.870> ops<00:03:16.080> 2<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.670> that's<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.940> plan

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
same in black ops 2 so that's the plan

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.990 
same in black ops 2 so that's the plan
that'll<00:03:18.480> happen<00:03:18.750> soon<00:03:19.579> ever<00:03:20.579> since<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.940> started
