00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.690
 very good these kids as you are 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.649
 today I'm not sorry I'm look coat because 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.120
 it is true that you have done it because 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.800
 none afterwards is true you have to talk 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.570
 well you have to speak well not to say 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.250
 swear words I will tell you from 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.490
 now very good all kids like that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.830
 how are you today look code and then if 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 you are watching the video and a 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.359
 bit weird no no no no intro I would like 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 that you told me in the comments by 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.920
 please if you want me to keep putting intro 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.480
 I do not think it's a symbol 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.640
 identifying my channel and I think that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 it's okay another thing is that we like it 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 I'll change it because I'll change it with the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.370
 do not worry about time 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 good everything with patience 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 today we have to talk about many things 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.030
 but first of all tell us that this is the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 departure of the nuclear with the cmr to take 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 for but with the word take for ass 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.800
 with the sdr and let's move on to something else 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.019
 on Thursdays I will upload warriors videos 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.610
 how they read videos that are cool that 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.839
 with this building time take them out 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.059
 because at least once a week 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.829
 just being lucky I usually touch a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.329
 Decent lobby or just play well without 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.670
 tarnish me a lot and I leave games 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.920
 curious why you have this here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.750
 nuclear with the week playing in raid in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.700
 Domino mode as usual and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 true that with enough allies that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.440
 I feel that many times they go out to throw 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.479
 whatsapp but you have to stress that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.210
 also many others remove the casualties 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.060
 of the sad v I team game guys for 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 that you know it just so you do not know 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.190
 finish the game before and the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.679
 enemies are not going to be taken with axial or 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.360
 with the games so that they earn more and 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.009
 obviously you can pull more 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.710
 perfect as you upload but I never sought 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.090
 support or nothing of that simply 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.159
 I'm very close in a low 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.560
 better ask for help but nothing more and it's 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.610
 true that many times it helps to throw a 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.020
 month to a 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.670
 to the liver but also not harm 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 when I have mine because I do not 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.820
 I can make two casualties in a row because 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.460
 the colors are the ones playing my mind are 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.610
 hands then kill the same as 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.530
 me or the same a little less and kill more 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 that normally allies that do not usually 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.050
 touch me who usually touches me 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.120
 games that go as a team that is usually 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.410
 pretty malillos then one of the 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.490
 things that I wanted to say is that 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.380
 from now what I'm going to do 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.660
 surely it will be playing at the most 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.340
 group of three play then with friends 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.900
 always because lately invited to 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.940
 many subscribers but it seems that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.070
 good that there are people who do not like that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.510
 play with allies and as is because 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.860
 they say they lose merit the games 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.540
 then nothing happens to me I do not care 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.190
 I really like it even more 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.200
 easy to take games only to take them out 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.850
 with a team not because people are leaving 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 more of the games when you go as a team 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.959
 not so so the first thing that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.200
 I wanted to tell you is that one that surely 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.580
 now play as much in group of 3 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.450
 that I will try to get better games and 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.730
 I'm sure they will come out 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.860
 nothing because he is hurting the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.720
 comments of the latest videos in the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.550
 comments of the sv video that I was the 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.349
 that went up yesterday that I hope you like 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.560
 be and at the beginning of the video as a 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.870
 comment saying that the comment 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.400
 of the live live that I made was not 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.230
 something different because I was 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.880
 commenting on helmets and that's why 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.739
 you could hear the noise of command of 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.420
 joysticks when running I've gone back to 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.819
 listen again and it turns out then if 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.680
 can receive a can result somewhat 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.450
 annoying then do not worry because 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.709
 for those who did not like you because it's not going to 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.450
 come back to happen I will not go back to 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.180
 comment again in that way then 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.190
 is solved the issue is resolved 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.680
 You are probéis for those who say that you hear 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.970
 a background noise in the video is that 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.190
 because I do not know what happened lately to 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.420
 micro that goes pretty bad but I'm 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.920
 trying to fix you already know that 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.470
 whenever I'm interested in anything and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.329
 I try to improve it because obviously it's 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.799
 what it is about I do not remember 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.390
 when I had 100 subscribers that 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.739
 I said little by little I will improve the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.870
 things keep putting intro still 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.060
 putting others and I will be improving 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.769
 the quality of the videos the audio the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.510
 quality of the games and little by little I have 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.639
 I been doing all this and gradually as 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.450
 it is getting better while little by little 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.310
 it is going up 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.980
 VICTOR is because in this channel the day 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.460
 that is great not if hopefully it arrives that no 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.560
 I know if he's going to get to the pace we're going 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.790
 I want everything to be perfect 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.370
 be a good quality that is a good 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.110
 audio that those who leave the least 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.000
 possible that they entertain you the most 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.040
 possible my videos that in the end is what 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.630
 which is that since I upload only call 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.610
 of duty although I try to upload all the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.200
 variety that I can all with competitive 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.450
 departure be frank or games of 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.300
 public I do not know all I can so 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.790
 unless you have fun 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.350
 tell you like this that I roll up and do not 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.880
 I can speak that they existed to the sheet 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.190
 again tell you that this game 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.959
 nuclear plan with the sdr is to take look 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.520
 red dot carries butts and what 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.410
 I usually carry, you know that 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.270
 when I take off a nuclear with a weapon 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.879
 that is not a gun 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.710
 the only 64 because I think it should be used 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.030
 four feet of merit therefore they are 30 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.360
 pure and hard casualties 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.889
 pure forgiveness and some asmr and I'm about 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.509
 of mobile two or three times at the end of the 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.580
 departure when the holidays are approaching 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.159
 I usually get quite nervous and the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.870
 sml I'm usually hooked on what he does 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.949
 that the bullets come out slower 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.300
 I said at the beginning of the video that 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.620
 take for ass that sorry the word 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.199
 the sml because peron works for me 27 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.330
 you are going to forgive because you do not have 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.340
 quite is pretty good sometimes has 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.409
 a lot of damage but it has nothing that 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.120
 see with the lack and really that is a 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.610
 weight for me to take away is nuclear with 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.900
 the s &amp; r because it is one less thing of the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.610
 that everything is pending annular 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.770
 scorpion will be very easy the nuclear with 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.419
 he in sad will not cost much but once 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.889
 that they leave those of do the difficult thing arrives 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.530
 the work of the caixa reaching the 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.909
 Verbalist work of execution on 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.469
 pro that are camejo games will be more 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.940
 tactics will be of the showy but that 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.789
 they will fly a lot because they will be nuclear 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.620
 very complicated I have many things 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.280
 pending uploading and many things that 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.080
 show you some double core and the rush 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.330
 very very rus some video of something are 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.050
 ok but as always you already know tomorrow 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.310
 It's Friday and tomorrow 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.620
 I will not upload videos because I want 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.120
 rest and what I will do is go up ask 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.990
 Saturday will be a pretty league video 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.879
 Handsome 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.830
 it's probably worth I'm not sure and the 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.750
 Sunday will be a video on how to improve the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.330
 call of duty that I do not know if it will be how 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.520
 raise the rate of low death kindles 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.930
 deaths or something else I have to 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.150
 thinking or something else rather than 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.680
 Mr. Durán 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.650
 I do not know I have so many things in my head 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.610
 that sometimes I lose the pot but what 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.820
 I always do is read your 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.710
 comments and try as long as each 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.840
 that you see a critic while it is 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.460
 argued to me it gives me exactly the same 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.080
 another thing is to make a criticism 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.030
 insulting that I do not like anymore and 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.470
 obviously there are people who do it because 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.750
 does not have two fingers of forehead not always 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.970
 that argues is one thing I tell myself what 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.580
 say, even if you say it is not with your channel, 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.140
 I like nothing for these reasons because it is 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.300
 what there is I can not do anything 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.100
 I try to improve things and try 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.810
 solve them good I'm seeing that 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.460
 I have a nuclear with the sml at last 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.630
 Come on come on come on come on 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.850
 the little medal is that a few 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.170
 unstoppable more and just when it arrives 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.660
 the easiest download that is an uncle that 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.490
 I think it leads to the 27th kill me not 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.870
 I know why I wanted to continue taking my 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.550
 streak because there was still enough 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.980
 party I could have gotten better about 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.270
 15 unstoppable is one thing yes but I think 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.620
 that triggers the term with new ones 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.040
 hits or whether it comes being 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.720
 almost 39 39 38 streak with s &amp; m ere plus a 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.250
 with the 27 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.680
 but good the truth that is a good 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.390
 heading once again thank the 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.740
 allies that play with me that I will leave 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.060
