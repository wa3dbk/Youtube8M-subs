00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
make another video to show you how I'm

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.740 
make another video to show you how I'm
lacing<00:00:12.540> them<00:00:13.460> as<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.759> see<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.210> lace<00:00:15.509> lock

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
lacing them as you can see the lace lock

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.830 
lacing them as you can see the lace lock
I<00:00:16.139> moved<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.740> down<00:00:17.449> to<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:19.140> fourth<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:21.539> fourth

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
I moved it down to the fourth the fourth

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.660 
I moved it down to the fourth the fourth
hole<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:24.949> I<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.519> looks

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
hole so it's right here I think it looks

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.990 
hole so it's right here I think it looks
better<00:00:26.820> there<00:00:27.830> because<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.789> could

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
better there because you know you could

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.990 
better there because you know you could
actually<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.630> Jumpman<00:00:31.759> opposed<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
actually see the Jumpman opposed to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.430 
actually see the Jumpman opposed to
weather<00:00:33.180> how<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> used<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.079> when<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> was

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
weather how it used to be when I was

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
weather how it used to be when I was
there<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> way<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> would

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
there all the way up here when you would

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.319 
there all the way up here when you would
tie<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> shoe<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.890> laces<00:00:38.399> were<00:00:38.579> covering<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
tie the shoe the laces were covering the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
tie the shoe the laces were covering the
Jumpman<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> can't<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.500> see<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
Jumpman so you can't really see it so I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.750 
Jumpman so you can't really see it so I
was<00:00:42.059> pretty<00:00:42.210> much<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:43.050> lace<00:00:43.379> lock<00:00:43.760> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
was pretty much just a lace lock that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.680 
was pretty much just a lace lock that
you<00:00:44.910> can't<00:00:45.210> even<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:47.210> because<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> moved<00:00:48.570> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you can't even see so because I moved it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.869 
you can't even see so because I moved it
down<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.620> more<00:00:49.770> visible<00:00:50.010> it's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
down you know it's more visible it's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.900 
down you know it's more visible it's
more<00:00:51.090> neat<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:52.920> people<00:00:53.190> put<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
more neat I know some people put the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.310 
more neat I know some people put the
lace<00:00:54.090> lock<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.719> right<00:00:54.899> here

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
lace lock like right here

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.819 
lace lock like right here
on<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> first<00:00:55.829> hole<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> used<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
on the first hole but I used to do that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.090 
on the first hole but I used to do that
but<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> problem<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.550> that<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:01.530> lace<00:01:01.739> lock

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
but the problem with that the lace lock

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
but the problem with that the lace lock
will<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.910> flip<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:05.330> which<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
will like flip around like this which is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.520 
will like flip around like this which is
pretty<00:01:07.080> annoying<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.890> me<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.900> being<00:01:10.229> right

pretty annoying to me so it being right

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
pretty annoying to me so it being right
here<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.369> stays<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.299> doesn't<00:01:12.570> flip<00:01:12.750> over<00:01:14.540> as

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here it stays and doesn't flip over as

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
here it stays and doesn't flip over as
far<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.340> laces<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:20.460> could<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> like

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

people think that they didn't so well
but<00:03:15.669> my<00:03:16.269> opinion<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:16.780> they<00:03:17.079> sold<00:03:17.410> pretty

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.190 
but my opinion I think they sold pretty
good<00:03:18.010> it's<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.639> they<00:03:19.269> made<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.569> lot<00:03:19.870> of

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
good it's just that they made a lot of

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.409 
good it's just that they made a lot of
them<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.099> know<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.870> they<00:03:23.680> restocked<00:03:24.190> on

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.550 
them you know they they restocked on

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
I think Nike and finished mine website a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.930 
I think Nike and finished mine website a
couple<00:03:29.560> days<00:03:29.799> ago<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.660> they<00:03:31.660> sold<00:03:31.870> out<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:33.280> I

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
couple days ago and they sold out so I

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.520 
couple days ago and they sold out so I
mean<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.480> me<00:03:34.599> that<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:35.169> means<00:03:35.349> there's

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
mean to me that that means there's

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.909 
mean to me that that means there's
something<00:03:35.769> good<00:03:36.690> if<00:03:37.690> if<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.440> shoe<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.739> gonna

something good if if a shoe is gonna
restock<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.760> means<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:41.049> original

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
restock that means that the original

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.949 
restock that means that the original
stock<00:03:41.709> was<00:03:41.950> sold<00:03:42.220> out<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.700> put<00:03:43.569> him<00:03:43.630> more<00:03:43.810> out
