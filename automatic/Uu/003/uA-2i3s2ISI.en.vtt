 in the greenhouse we are now producing even so 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.830
 After all, additional work as a transfer 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.610

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.820
 greenhouses ground

 but in schools about shelter to 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.380
 find him opinion that they will be burned to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.610
 100 mb because often by 2000 the weather 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.560

 that I knew all its benefits 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.979
 I did not put in the fall for some reason at the end 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.010
 season for one simple reason that i 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.320
 very early go out 500 times starts seedlings 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.229
 annuals perennial wean off 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.790
 she is in winter and needs to be as early as possible 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.550
 take out the greenhouse so spring 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.380
 installation presnyakov not entered I a little bit 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.320

 so Oleg greenhouses go out early in the spring then 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.479
