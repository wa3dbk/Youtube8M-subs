00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
the II's I actually prefer over the low

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.210 
the II's I actually prefer over the low
top<00:02:49.430> 11s<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:52.110> because<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.769> loom<00:02:52.980> top

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
top 11s just because the the loom top

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
top 11s just because the the loom top
Elevens<00:02:53.640> look<00:02:53.819> off<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.299> me<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.630> some<00:02:54.810> reason

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
Elevens look off to me for some reason

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.930 
Elevens look off to me for some reason
and<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.489> they<00:02:56.610> don't<00:02:56.790> have

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
and I don't like that they don't have

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.240 
and I don't like that they don't have
the<00:02:57.060> Jordan<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:58.440> since<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.860> has<00:02:59.069> like

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the Jordan here but since this has like

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.910 
the Jordan here but since this has like
this<00:02:59.430> funky<00:02:59.879> pattern<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.660> think<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.410> makes<00:03:01.590> up<00:03:01.829> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
this funky pattern I think it makes up a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.509 
this funky pattern I think it makes up a
little<00:03:02.099> bit<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:02.910> love<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:04.519> bottom

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
little bit for it but I love the bottom

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:14.319 
little bit for it but I love the bottom
here<00:03:07.160> other<00:03:08.160> than<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.750> I'll<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.370> 360<00:03:11.370> view
