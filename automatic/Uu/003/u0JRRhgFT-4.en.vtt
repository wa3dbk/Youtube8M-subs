in and I'll roast that in the oven at
I'll<00:01:38.969> turn<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.390> by<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.569> point<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.380> like

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I'll turn it up by this point to like

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.029 
I'll turn it up by this point to like
425<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.429> 450<00:01:41.969> just<00:01:42.359> for<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.960> 10<00:01:43.289> minutes

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
425 or 450 just for about 10 minutes

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.380 
425 or 450 just for about 10 minutes
depending<00:01:44.429> on<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:44.670> thick<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.060> asparagus

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
depending on how thick your asparagus

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.649 
depending on how thick your asparagus
spears<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.469> roasted<00:01:46.979> mine<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:48.090> little

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
spears are my roasted mine for a little

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.059 
spears are my roasted mine for a little
longer<00:01:48.869> because<00:01:49.109> mine<00:01:49.409> were<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.829> thick

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
longer because mine were really thick

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.160 
longer because mine were really thick
and<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> 8<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.740> 12<00:01:53.219> minutes<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.759> guess<00:01:54.170> depending

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and so 8 to 12 minutes I guess depending

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.950 
and so 8 to 12 minutes I guess depending
on your<00:01:55.289> asparagus<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:57.179> while<00:01:57.749> that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
on your asparagus and then while that's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.760 
on your asparagus and then while that's
going<00:01:58.109> I<00:01:58.619> start<00:01:59.249> sautéing<00:01:59.429> some<00:02:00.469> mushrooms<00:02:01.469> in

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
going I start sautéing some mushrooms in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.879 
going I start sautéing some mushrooms in
some<00:02:02.549> water<00:02:02.960> until<00:02:03.960> they're<00:02:04.109> soft<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:04.799> I

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
some water until they're soft and then I

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:07.039 
some water until they're soft and then I
add<00:02:05.069> in<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.909> no<00:02:06.209> fat<00:02:06.539> barbecue

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
add in a little bit of no fat barbecue

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.320 
add in a little bit of no fat barbecue
sauce<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.009> nice<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:08.190> about<00:02:08.399> Austin<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
sauce and the nice thing about Austin is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.990 
sauce and the nice thing about Austin is
that<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> big<00:02:10.080> barbecue<00:02:10.530> place<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.130> we

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that it's a big barbecue place and we

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.320 
that it's a big barbecue place and we
have<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.709> local<00:02:13.709> barbecue<00:02:14.190> sauce<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.240> we

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
have a local barbecue sauce that we

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.710 
have a local barbecue sauce that we
really<00:02:15.569> like<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.080> has<00:02:16.380> no

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
really like that has no

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.160 
really like that has no
fat<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.670> use<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.630> mushrooms

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
fat and so we use that on the mushrooms

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.410 
fat and so we use that on the mushrooms
and<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.040> put<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.460> little<00:02:21.610> bit<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.030> until

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
and so I put a little bit of that until

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.290 
and so I put a little bit of that until
it's<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:23.320> know<00:02:23.410> coats<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.950> mushrooms<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.700> I
