00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.910
 I am individually committed at any time to shock this phone 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.709
 You have to take my seat now and do not look outside 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
 Here we have a special tremble 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.150
 hides behind the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.199
 joined us 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.390
 on the back of the Aegi 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.599
 here are my camera box 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.080
 and they have the volume keys to the Hall of Fame in Trier 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.530
 Slot the headphones and around 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.730
 Today we have 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.940
 Decision is a big write or block me 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 sung 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.040
 then just stepping forward with the boxes can give that position 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.640
 not me 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.210
 two digits 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 Munich as a draftsman 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.490
 Many a show may not be safer 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.640
 the future, for example, then opens up 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.310
 the core of this one can adjust on at the very moment if that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.110
 Test site month is locked 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.830
 With the help of such gestures you can become a programmer very quickly 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.480
 call 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.590
 so now 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.530
 Humana 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.520
 hereby like to fortified Screen and a voyage Zodiac SKZ surface that can 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.180
 for example, from Melchior's rule 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.270
 let's say that Bremen is 800 miles down there will be pixels 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.460
 which is quite handy for the movie Kuchener you can start both sides 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.799
 one can replace it with complete width and contrast and brightness 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.420
 are good that is a capacitive Rainer Tropp stream 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.670
 and yes there is no that Artur that means it really gets everything 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.880
 over the display 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.250
 the controlled sun is completely more 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 in principle, four launches of Kriens 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.100
 when it gets going with the newedge user i can not hear me anymore 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.330
 has retracted hold 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.290
 you can not be the individual 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.509
 he is also bringing cherries 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.619
 or can live here as men it will also add new ones that Kate 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.629
 and very fast easy 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.769
 take it "pressure counter I can as everyone has not appeared more 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.449
 wants to have aging 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.349
 Concepcion also fox ever 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.519
 and exactly look at Hilmar Loitsch now Jermaine 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.339
 Factories contacts so I can make contacts 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.599
 Select favorites 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.689
 and the associated with image displayed 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.279
 then I can here 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:42.879
 and yes my favorite bands application as my favorite recipe for ads 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:43.959
 to let 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.629
 and then I link that, for example the news magazine 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.849
 Newsweek Becker here has meanwhile can not really everything 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.039
 set individually 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.449
 here below 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.109
 slumbers Munich 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.879
 who here and there I have then still fast defective percent for 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.819
 Phone calls contacts 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.919
 eat-west and the main menu 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.759
 and I know down here 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.619
 So I think my phone dominates multitasking and how can I do that 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.669
 Manage various applications and you can still say here 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.709
 all finish 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:17.879
 and 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.679
 exactly and then I have 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:21.989
 here again 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.549
 now check 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.239
 Wassertreten return to power world fair Fini must slowly you have to 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.099
 Although the coldest percent is not quite sufficient 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.699
 but they could 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.149
 Courier Mr. Sander again different view 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.609
 I can handle this preview very well 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.349
 your change would like to change 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.509
 CSKA Moscow bring 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:47.869
 McLaren has given me these four areas of communication entertainment to listen to and 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.459
 attitude 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.419
 how can I put your name in the individual there is never like that 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:55.970
 by scrolling 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.379
 I can also if the first direct sales held 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.379
 to the phone Jezek Wehrheim then if all really 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.889
 displayed but just without caption he firmly because I have to know what for me 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.359
 is suitable 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.379
 means they are often not always clear 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.269
 and so who from the operation ago 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.459
 There are sometimes very good 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.919
 Now it was time to look like that again 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.969
 You can learn if the keyboard used because you have several 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.139
 Possibilities I can for example here 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.979
 for problem that the new ones get in and out 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.830
 everything else now 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.469
 be programmed 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.469
 It is just as good to have in the East 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.059
 continue to step wondering 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:41.289
 if i have the cellphone 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.199
 take in the landscape format 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.970
 then I get alone too 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.970
 around virtual qwerty keyboard 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.560
 and p i have to say it is actually very good to have basic problem you have to hit 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.729
 quite good you can also this year so of course he prefers to put to victory 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.190
 one should also set a strengthened percent SPD Prison 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.229
 you can even turn on audio feedback so one 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.779
 yes, sort of a sound match 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.599
 and that's all possible 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.740
 works very well 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.879
 you have to later you can get accustomed to the only open 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.449
 the criminal and kicking if you have my phone with real keyboard before 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.930
 would have 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.919
 yes, but that's the only way it is 9 0
