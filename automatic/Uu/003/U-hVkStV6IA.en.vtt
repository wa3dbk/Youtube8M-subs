I'm<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.720> by<00:02:30.900> research<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.880> think<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.030> to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
I'm going by research I I think to to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.160 
I'm going by research I I think to to
101<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:33.660> even<00:02:33.870> for<00:02:34.079> 21<00:02:34.380> 21<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.100> good<00:02:35.400> um<00:02:36.170> 10

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
101 or even for 21 21 it is good um 10

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.830 
101 or even for 21 21 it is good um 10
or<00:02:37.290> 11<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.739> pushing<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.190> little<00:02:38.340> bit<00:02:38.549> for<00:02:38.760> me<00:02:38.880> why

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
or 11 is pushing a little bit for me why

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.280 
or 11 is pushing a little bit for me why
even<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:41.450> valine<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.630> isoleucine<00:02:42.989> at

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
even have the valine and isoleucine at

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.740 
even have the valine and isoleucine at
that<00:02:43.440> point<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:44.340> don't<00:02:45.060> know<00:02:45.359> but<00:02:45.540> that's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
that point I don't know but that's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.780 
that point I don't know but that's
that's<00:02:46.109> my<00:02:46.260> opinion<00:02:46.620> again<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:47.370> sure<00:02:47.670> they

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that's my opinion again I'm sure they

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.270 
that's my opinion again I'm sure they
have<00:02:47.820> valid<00:02:48.329> research<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.780> back<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.109> up<00:02:49.280> next

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280

anything equal that in the amino acid
market<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.409> I<00:03:52.500> tend<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.829> go<00:03:52.980> with<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.189> two<00:03:53.340> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
market so I tend to go with the two to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.580 
market so I tend to go with the two to
one<00:03:53.579> to<00:03:53.669> one<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.970> my<00:03:54.120> favorite<00:03:54.540> because<00:03:54.590> well

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
one to one is my favorite because well

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.500 
one to one is my favorite because well
the<00:03:55.709> research<00:03:56.010> said<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.849> was<00:03:57.299> there<00:03:57.450> for

36 large orange in the entire warehouse
that<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.949> what<00:04:17.099> i<00:04:17.130> sent<00:04:17.190> for<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.699> study<00:04:17.940> I

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
that is what i sent for the study I

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.420 
that is what i sent for the study I
packed<00:04:18.720> them<00:04:18.870> myself<00:04:18.930> personally<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:20.190> if<00:04:20.310> you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
packed them myself personally so if you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.979 
packed them myself personally so if you
say<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.820> anything<00:04:21.060> was<00:04:21.329> funky<00:04:21.690> about<00:04:21.870> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
say that anything was funky about the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.810 
say that anything was funky about the
study<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.349> put<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.740> me<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.039> it's<00:04:23.639> fine

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
study you put it on me and it's fine

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.750 
study you put it on me and it's fine
I've<00:04:23.970> been<00:04:24.150> called<00:04:24.389> worse<00:04:24.449> many<00:04:25.229> many<00:04:25.440> times

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
I've been called worse many many times

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.430 
I've been called worse many many times
and<00:04:26.760> that's<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.419> agreed<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.810> decanate<00:04:28.229> thing

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
and that's the agreed the decanate thing

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.430 
and that's the agreed the decanate thing
again<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.010> don't<00:04:29.760> think<00:04:30.030> it's<00:04:30.539> really<00:04:31.050> gonna

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
again I don't think it's really gonna

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.840 
again I don't think it's really gonna
add<00:04:31.770> too<00:04:32.130> much

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
like dog crap not the training system

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.659 
like dog crap not the training system
but<00:04:58.270> actually<00:04:58.630> poop<00:04:58.900> on<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.169> ground<00:04:59.199> and

but actually poop on the ground and
secondly<00:05:00.669> is<00:05:00.940> which<00:05:01.449> one<00:05:01.630> do<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.840> think<00:05:02.050> has

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
secondly is which one do you think has

secondly is which one do you think has
the<00:05:02.199> best<00:05:02.410> science<00:05:02.830> behind<00:05:02.979> it<00:05:03.419> but<00:05:04.419> this<00:05:04.570> is

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
the best science behind it but this is

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.300 
the best science behind it but this is
an<00:05:04.870> option<00:05:05.229> definitely<00:05:05.740> take<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.889> look<00:05:06.100> at<00:05:06.280> it

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
an option definitely take a look at it
