this myth of history
it<00:04:07.519> actually<00:04:07.760> was<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.239> historical<00:04:08.900> person

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
it actually was a historical person

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.640 
it actually was a historical person
because<00:04:10.459> also<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.120> was<00:04:11.239> written<00:04:11.359> 150<00:04:12.290> years

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
because also it was written 150 years

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.890 
because also it was written 150 years
after<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.370> event<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:14.449> mentions<00:04:14.840> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.779 
after the event and it mentions the
house<00:04:15.199> of<00:04:15.530> David<00:04:15.949> that<00:04:15.979> is<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.370> lineage<00:04:16.699> of

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
house of David that is the lineage of

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.029 
house of David that is the lineage of
David<00:04:17.180> if<00:04:17.750> there<00:04:18.049> was<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.199> house<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.709> David

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
David if there was a house of David

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.469 
David if there was a house of David
there<00:04:19.159> had<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.310> be<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.519> David<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.030> have<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.209> house

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
there had to be a David to have a house

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.050 
there had to be a David to have a house
