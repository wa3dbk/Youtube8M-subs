more time to make mistakes you know

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.899 
more time to make mistakes you know
that's<00:01:07.390> that's<00:01:07.990> another<00:01:08.260> factor<00:01:08.710> here

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
that's that's another factor here

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.940 
that's that's another factor here
there's<00:01:10.509> time<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.869> get<00:01:11.079> sawed<00:01:11.320> out<00:01:11.350> that's

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
there's time to get sawed out that's

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.649 
there's time to get sawed out that's
right<00:01:12.189> that's<00:01:12.640> right<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:13.090> increases<00:01:13.509> fatigue

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
right that's right it increases fatigue

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.440 
right that's right it increases fatigue

somebody everyone's developing at the
moment<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.530> mean

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
