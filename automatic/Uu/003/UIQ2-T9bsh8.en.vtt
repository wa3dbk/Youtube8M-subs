00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.360 
that season with both in his first year
and<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.480> willing<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.110> team<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:44.190> go

and really willing that team to go
forward<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.480> set<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.739> stage<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.070> 40

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
forward I think set the stage for 40

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.090 
forward I think set the stage for 40
years<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.270> excellence<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.890> Jim
