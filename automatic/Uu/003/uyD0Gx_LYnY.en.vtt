and I would recommend going there

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.960 
and I would recommend going there
because<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.510> her<00:00:50.930> wide<00:00:51.770> selection<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.520> then

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
because of her wide selection and then

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.030 
because of her wide selection and then
the<00:00:53.450> Technic<00:00:54.230> store<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.470> lot<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.740> the<00:00:54.860> world

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:08.449 
different bags I just sorted them an

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.000 
different bags I just sorted them an
organized<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.109> when<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.260> counted<00:03:09.650> them<00:03:09.709> into

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
organized and when I counted them into

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.459 
organized and when I counted them into
these<00:03:10.129> so<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.549> counted<00:03:11.030> each<00:03:11.239> store<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.870> they

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
these so I counted each store and they

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.099 
these so I counted each store and they
both<00:03:12.680> were<00:03:13.209> exactly<00:03:14.209> as<00:03:14.389> I<00:03:14.510> expected<00:03:14.599> the

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
both were exactly as I expected the

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.080 
both were exactly as I expected the
brick<00:03:15.469> actually<00:03:15.919> supplied<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> few<00:03:16.969> extra

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
brick actually supplied a few extra

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.819 
brick actually supplied a few extra
pieces<00:03:18.079> if<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:19.250> each<00:03:19.730> kind<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.480> think<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.500> that

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
pieces if of each kind I think and that

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.619 
pieces if of each kind I think and that
was<00:03:22.010> probably<00:03:22.219> just<00:03:22.519> compensated<00:03:23.329> in<00:03:23.419> case

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
was probably just compensated in case

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.749 
was probably just compensated in case
they<00:03:23.900> miscounted<00:03:24.319> or<00:03:24.590> something<00:03:24.979> so<00:03:25.459> that's<00:03:25.639> a

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:25.759 
they miscounted or something so that's a

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.089 
they miscounted or something so that's a
really<00:03:25.790> good<00:03:26.449> technique<00:03:26.900> for<00:03:27.379> people<00:03:27.859> who

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
really good technique for people who

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.059 
really good technique for people who
want<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.639> sell<00:03:29.060> but<00:03:29.750> even<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.379> you<00:03:30.470> don't<00:03:30.769> just

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
want to sell but even if you don't just

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.559 
want to sell but even if you don't just
make<00:03:31.189> sure<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.639> you<00:03:31.759> don't<00:03:31.879> short<00:03:32.269> someone

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569
