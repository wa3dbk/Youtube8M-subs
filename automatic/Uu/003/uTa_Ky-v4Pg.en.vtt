way down there we go

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.170 
way down there we go
not<00:04:55.750> too<00:04:55.960> bad<00:04:56.280> now<00:04:57.280> there<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.550> one<00:04:57.730> button<00:04:57.970> look

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
not too bad now there is one button look

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.510 
not too bad now there is one button look
over<00:04:58.450> there<00:04:58.660> but<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.620> did<00:04:59.770> talk<00:04:59.950> about<00:05:00.010> that

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
over there but I did talk about that

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.070 
over there but I did talk about that
says<00:05:01.480> test<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.530> hit<00:05:02.710> test<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.280> get<00:05:03.400> this

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
says test you hit test and you get this

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.420 
says test you hit test and you get this
and<00:05:05.080> notice<00:05:05.290> how<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.650> kind<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:05.890> wipes<00:05:06.130> from<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
and notice how it kind of wipes from the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.830 
and notice how it kind of wipes from the
left<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.820> right<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.090> think<00:05:07.390> that's<00:05:07.540> kind<00:05:07.750> of

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
left to the right I think that's kind of

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.090 
left to the right I think that's kind of
neat<00:05:09.630> push<00:05:10.630> test<00:05:10.900> again<00:05:11.230> there<00:05:11.950> we<00:05:12.100> go

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
neat push test again there we go

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.470 
neat push test again there we go
now<00:05:15.100> let's<00:05:15.280> push<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.580> trip<00:05:15.790> odometer<00:05:15.910> see<00:05:16.420> how

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
now let's push the trip odometer see how

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.100 
now let's push the trip odometer see how
