00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.810
 guys from youtube we are going to make a video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.330
 from a doctor's bag we will go through 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.559
 here 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:16.789
 here I have a doctor's plate then 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.339
 here I have then as a plate 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.359
 what's in there doctor and in the jump a 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.359
 man of your last name 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.720
 Then we have a plaster that is 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 it's really just a cat and it takes a 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.760
 chalice then here that 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.030
 so this is a cure that is 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 punctured by taking blood to be a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.000
 vaccine and I have two that have different 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.000
 colors the studs is pink and gray 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.470
 but this is a thing then for 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.370
 to put 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.120
 thing the mouth and here I had a mirror and 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.760
 you put it in your mouth like that and it tells you trace 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:19.110
 you look with the mirror with those who have 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:22.350
 the teeth or what happens to you like this 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.970
 it's a thermometer 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.220
 that here pushes him 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.030
 and here because you have the temperature 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.030
 What do you have 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.450
 that this is not a part and another 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.159
 and then this for you because it's one thing 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 that tells you that from the waist work 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.649
 you have it right so you have it wrong and then 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.039
 from here the beard high up if not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.039
 you have good you have more you 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.459
 and then here there is a sticker 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.459
 to do as one with a laboratory 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.870
 or stickers as well as medicines and 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.580
 after 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.850
 and it 's green 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.130
 Well this is a shower hose 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.990
 or here we have a small phone 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.430
 puts 112 which is the number of the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.670
 ambulance 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.030
 then here you have with the buttons there 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.030
 love 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.010
 with a table so to see well that 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.790
 you put a patch on the eye and then on the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.939
 another you look at it presumably because it's 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.390
 a fence and so I have it here of 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:38.840
 different colors to be blue 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:44.240
 and then here I have all this 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.240
 It is a burden to support children 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.710
 good 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:19.930
 and this is a thing 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.639
 they are like cats for babies 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.900
 and this after a month like this up 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:32.110
 then here because this is like a notebook 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.530
 that this is to put the name of the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.110
 doctor or the doctor then here what 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.910
 what happened to that has happened to him and good 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.139
 Boys 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.139
