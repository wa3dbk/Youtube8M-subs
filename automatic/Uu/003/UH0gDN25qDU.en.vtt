00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.260 

okay<00:02:05.310> I'm<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.579> step<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.970> my<00:02:06.149> garage

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
okay I'm just step out of my garage

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.339 
okay I'm just step out of my garage
right<00:02:06.630> pretty<00:02:07.530> quick<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
right pretty quick so as you can see it

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.680 
right pretty quick so as you can see it
started<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.670> first<00:02:11.849> kick<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:12.540> then

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
started on the first kick but then

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.990 
started on the first kick but then
stalled<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.950> guess<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.400> could<00:02:14.430> say<00:02:14.700> start

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
stalled so I guess you could say start

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.729

also<00:06:01.050> thinking<00:06:01.439> of<00:06:01.889> putting<00:06:02.309> carbon<00:06:02.819> fiber

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.149 
also thinking of putting carbon fiber

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:11.509 
also thinking of putting carbon fiber
over<00:06:03.809> here<00:06:04.019> and<00:06:07.279> replacing<00:06:08.279> the<00:06:08.429> stock<00:06:10.519> front

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:11.519 
over here and replacing the stock front

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.839 
over here and replacing the stock front
sprocket<00:06:12.029> cover<00:06:12.179> with<00:06:12.929> a<00:06:13.339> carbon<00:06:14.339> fiber<00:06:14.519> one

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
sprocket cover with a carbon fiber one

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:22.419 
sprocket cover with a carbon fiber one
and<00:06:15.169> I<00:06:16.169> want<00:06:16.649> to<00:06:16.889> put<00:06:17.099> a<00:06:18.049> v-force<00:06:19.249> reads<00:06:20.269> and

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:22.429 
and I want to put a v-force reads and

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:25.639 
and I want to put a v-force reads and
vertex<00:06:23.429> piston<00:06:23.729> but<00:06:24.689> I'll<00:06:24.929> have<00:06:25.169> to<00:06:25.199> see<00:06:25.439> if<00:06:25.529> my

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.649 
vertex piston but I'll have to see if my

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:29.329 
vertex piston but I'll have to see if my
dad<00:06:25.829> will<00:06:25.979> let<00:06:26.129> me<00:06:26.309> so<00:06:27.119> yeah<00:06:27.809> there's<00:06:28.469> a<00:06:28.649> 2009
