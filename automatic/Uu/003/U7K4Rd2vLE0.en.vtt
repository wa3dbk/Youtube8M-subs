 You can do that here now you can me 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.520
 So first we have to believe the whole 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.009
 Things are done by people who are whole 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.439
 Nice loud when we have done it 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.439
 then we can finally get the general 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.360
 dedicate 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:15.130
 There was no word I'm sorry 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:16.480
 So there are still a lot of beautiful ones 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.209
 mission we can do we are 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.280
 yes only in chapter 3 and chapter 3 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.950
 really contains most of the emissions 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.709
 and he could not contain anything then 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.260
 really most missions and it 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.890
 has also unbelievably noticed in the film 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.910
 why we are here 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.400
 probably need the longest 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.769

 what is he doing there 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.770
 Fourth, at least a reasonable four 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.340
 swords and not only and not only 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.340
 Two, that's just how he does that 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:16.430
 went pretty fast, is coming now 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.690
 help people meet the very realistic 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.530
 like standing around there and sure 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.630
 to lock 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.330
 Look at it that scares me 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.890

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.880

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.750

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.709
 fighting in the middle of the fight for fighting 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.359
 we 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.890
 this is definitely to the game me 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.549
 But I have to say that is relatively weak 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.549
 somehow 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:01.880
 finally it goes on again 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.800
 currently 2 and listen to a little bit 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.660

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.260

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:15.230
 actually thrust grip felt thrust 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.930
 black flag Come on, you, you too, what 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:23.240

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.070

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.470
 noticed 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.120
 and then he does his pose again 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.650
 big enough kamer you what is 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.370
 general grievous actually that is one 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.169
 alien 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.760
 I never really knew what that was 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.320
 grief about robots or I do not know 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:46.040
 I have no idea what kind of thing 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:47.960
 is I have to honestly say could 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.490
 you could copy her mirjam 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.280
 the hard-working president then 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:00.350
 Dodge brings the piece of shit 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:04.060
 he kicks me does not trust me 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:09.070
 People are happy to stand around a bit 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.070
 say goodbye to the world 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.940

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.020
 cool on the garden professionals age is there 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.430
 he shot here to go no more 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.560
 that I'm really cool that we're here 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.690
 fight and general is going on by that 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.690
 money from the 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:33.270
 hit by the guns this wool 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.090
 angeber or that's it now 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.350
 let's move on to the next section 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.300
 where we then drove with the vehicle 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.620
 if you are remembered here and 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.500
 Now I have these horny weapons about 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:48.590
 the gun and he can give me a piece 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:51.870
 dirt and sting 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.710
 no, where are we both going to fight? 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.590
 his marketing somehow wants to shit 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.410
 I live again strangely 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.580
 I do not think that's okay with me 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.260
 I'll probably be fine again 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.490
 cool on it I'll try to go short 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.890
 without a student godmode on 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.460
 still looks quite ok but that can 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.900
 change quickly yes she is the can 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.950
 change that right now and then I am 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:24.140
 but not doing is difficult, the game is 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.140
 Hard people nobody tells me what 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.370
 Well you ham sandwich what am I doing there 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.130
 So you see , it's hard without it 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.310
 Got no to play because I'm the same 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.310
 dead 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.910
 I'm sorry people I'm suffering peacefully 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:52.530
 when he was in the city but you watch the 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:54.120
 So I had it once 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.040
 met and almost got my whole 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.450
 lost life 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.610
 Strangely, I'm always better when 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:04.440
 i god mother and he is dead 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.220

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.110
 do not have to go on 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.500
 offended and even kill him 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.880
 is why only in the just put a 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.520
 Shield you just do not get there for long 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.720
 at hand so people I okay 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.540

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.770

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:27.360
 and see you next time 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:29.100
 again and then if they just 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.380
 times with a few people general grievous 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:36.660
 now away from the window 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:42.420
 and exactly how do you call a debate like 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:45.090
 That was called a deceased nearness 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:49.050
 what do you say to one to one 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:51.320

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.320

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.160
 i do not tell people the wrong way 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.800
 I was always forgiven 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.970
 but that was superfluous again and me 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.500
 would say see you next time 

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.500
 follows academy
