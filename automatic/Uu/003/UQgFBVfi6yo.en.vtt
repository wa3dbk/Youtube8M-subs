lines<00:02:08.410> folded<00:02:09.220> you're<00:02:09.940> gonna<00:02:10.060> fold<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.720> up

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
lines folded you're gonna fold it up

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.800 
lines folded you're gonna fold it up
like<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.860> double<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.430> show<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.720> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
like a double you show you that on the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.380 
like a double you show you that on the
side<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.709> should<00:02:14.920> look<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.390> when

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
side so it should look like that when

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.270
