it might be the gear binding up but you

railing<00:04:17.820> I'm<00:04:18.820> not<00:04:19.000> saying<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.330> my<00:04:19.570> track

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
railing I'm not saying that my track

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.740 
railing I'm not saying that my track
work<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.650> perfect<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:22.000> could<00:04:22.210> be<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.540> track

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
work is perfect it could be the track

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.030 
work is perfect it could be the track
work<00:04:23.010> but<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:25.630> engine<00:04:25.990> definitely<00:04:26.860> has

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
work but the engine definitely has

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.800 
work but the engine definitely has
problems<00:04:27.810> with<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.990> railing<00:04:30.390> so<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.420> made<00:04:31.690> it

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
problems with the railing so I made it

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.300 
problems with the railing so I made it
around<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.080> pass<00:04:32.350> once<00:04:32.650> but<00:04:34.440> it's<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.740> it's

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
around the pass once but it's a it's

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.540 
around the pass once but it's a it's
very<00:04:36.610> slow<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.120> rev<00:04:37.390> up<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.750> can<00:04:37.900> get<00:04:38.020> almost<00:04:38.320> a

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
very slow to rev up I can get almost a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.050 
very slow to rev up I can get almost a
128<00:04:39.550> speed<00:04:39.970> step<00:04:40.270> mode<00:04:40.600> gives<00:04:41.410> up<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.740> almost

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
128 speed step mode gives up to almost

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.040 
128 speed step mode gives up to almost
3035<00:04:43.060> without<00:04:43.480> even<00:04:43.810> budging<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:44.590> then<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:46.240> met

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
3035 without even budging and then I met

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.660 
3035 without even budging and then I met
22<00:04:47.530> right<00:04:47.770> now<00:04:47.890> thinking<00:04:48.280> I'm<00:04:48.400> stopped

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
22 right now thinking I'm stopped

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.920 
22 right now thinking I'm stopped
because<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.060> didn't<00:04:49.300> look<00:04:49.420> at<00:04:49.600> it

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
because I didn't look at it

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.820 
because I didn't look at it
and<00:04:50.380> it's<00:04:50.590> actually<00:04:51.040> still<00:04:52.530> still<00:04:53.530> not<00:04:53.650> moving

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
and it's actually still still not moving

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.000 
and it's actually still still not moving
so<00:04:54.370> I've<00:04:55.030> put<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.450> back<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.720> zero<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.740> get<00:04:56.860> this

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
so I've put it back to zero you get this

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.060 
so I've put it back to zero you get this
humming<00:04:57.430> noise<00:04:57.610> when<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.090> try<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.830> try<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.890> get

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
humming noise when you try to try to get

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.230 
humming noise when you try to try to get
it<00:05:00.160> going<00:05:00.310> but<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.670> doesn't<00:05:00.910> really<00:05:01.030> go

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
it going but it doesn't really go
