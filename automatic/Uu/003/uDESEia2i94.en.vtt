so the big ability that it kind of gets

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.270 
so the big ability that it kind of gets
his<00:01:24.930> name<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> ability<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:26.009> steal

items from whoever is fighting against

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710 
items from whoever is fighting against

and<00:01:45.350> use<00:01:46.350> fear<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> normally<00:01:47.460> fears<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and use fear and normally fears the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.950 
and use fear and normally fears the
thing<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.329> only<00:01:48.479> available<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
thing that's only available to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.300 
thing that's only available to
necromancer's<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> makes<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> feed

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
necromancer's and so it makes the feed

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.609 
necromancer's and so it makes the feed
very<00:01:50.579> versatile<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.229> random

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
very versatile but in a bit more random

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.340 
very versatile but in a bit more random
way<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.100> thief<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.700> much<00:01:53.880> about

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
way so the thief is very much about

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.000 
way so the thief is very much about
reacting<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> situation<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:56.130> hand

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
reacting to the situation at hand

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.680 
reacting to the situation at hand
we've<00:01:58.010> seen<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.580> guess<00:01:58.790> some<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.150> the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
we've seen that I guess some of the the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.480 
we've seen that I guess some of the the
early<00:02:00.020> areas<00:02:00.440> for<00:02:00.740> some<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.250> different

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
early areas for some of the different

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.620 
early areas for some of the different
races<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:01.850> now<00:02:02.030> we're<00:02:02.180> seeing<00:02:02.299> some<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.540> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
races but now we're seeing some of the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.090 
races but now we're seeing some of the
more<00:02:02.780> advanced<00:02:03.140> stuff<00:02:03.290> can<00:02:03.860> you<00:02:03.920> tell<00:02:04.070> us

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
more advanced stuff can you tell us

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.440 
more advanced stuff can you tell us
about<00:02:04.190> some<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.119> higher<00:02:05.270> end

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
about some of that the higher end

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.870 
about some of that the higher end
content<00:02:05.869> what<00:02:06.049> players<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:06.530> expect<00:02:06.890> from<00:02:07.130> I

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
content what players can expect from I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.660 
content what players can expect from I
guess<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.390> thigh<00:02:08.539> right<00:02:08.750> yeah<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.490> higher

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
guess the thigh right yeah so the higher

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.240 
guess the thigh right yeah so the higher
end<00:02:10.850> areas<00:02:11.300> tend<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.959> we<00:02:12.290> kind<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:13.100> know<00:02:13.160> I

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
end areas tend to we kind of you know I

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.500 
end areas tend to we kind of you know I
think<00:02:13.459> as<00:02:13.550> we<00:02:13.640> saw<00:02:13.790> with<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> brand<00:02:14.239> and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
think as we saw with the brand and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.900 
think as we saw with the brand and
things<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:14.959> before<00:02:15.230> they<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:16.280> ante

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
things like that before they the ante

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.120 
things like that before they the ante
kind<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.180> gets<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.870> things<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.770> more<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
kind of gets up and things get more and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.550 
kind of gets up and things get more and
more<00:02:19.160> dire<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:19.730> example<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.260> area<00:02:21.500> that

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
more dire for example in the area that

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.720 
more dire for example in the area that
we're<00:02:21.770> seeing<00:02:21.920> now<00:02:22.040> which<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.580> outside

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
we're seeing now which is just outside

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.699 
we're seeing now which is just outside
of<00:02:23.000> Lion's<00:02:23.330> Arch<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.050> these<00:02:24.170> pirates

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
of Lion's Arch you have these pirates

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.830 
of Lion's Arch you have these pirates
who<00:02:24.940> actively<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.120> know<00:02:26.209> try<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.420> burn<00:02:26.630> down

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
who actively you know try to burn down

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.740 
who actively you know try to burn down
towns<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.590> things<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.880> what

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
towns and things like that and so what

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.570 
towns and things like that and so what
ends<00:02:29.959> up<00:02:30.019> happening<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.650> you're<00:02:31.250> going<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.489> see

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
ends up happening is you're going to see

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.210 
ends up happening is you're going to see
bigger<00:02:31.820> fights<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.320> more<00:02:33.590> creatures

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
bigger fights you know more creatures

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.520 
bigger fights you know more creatures
involved<00:02:34.970> more<00:02:35.570> targets<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.350> bigger

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
involved more targets and bigger

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
involved more targets and bigger
creatures<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.280> sort<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.610> thing<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.060> just

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
creatures that sort of thing so just

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.259 
creatures that sort of thing so just
kind<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:38.959> upping<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.410> excitement<00:02:39.890> level<00:02:40.269> and

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
kind of upping the excitement level and

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.210 
kind of upping the excitement level and
we've<00:02:41.660> seen<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.989> guess<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.530> our<00:02:42.620> play<00:02:42.830> sessions

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
we've seen I guess in our play sessions

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.850 
we've seen I guess in our play sessions
we've<00:02:43.340> seen<00:02:43.519> out<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.030> guess<00:02:44.420> some<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.860> flow

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
we've seen out I guess some of the flow

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.110 
we've seen out I guess some of the flow
of<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:45.980> quest<00:02:46.220> system<00:02:46.400> work<00:02:46.670> we've<00:02:46.880> seen<00:02:47.030> that

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
of the quest system work we've seen that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.000 
of the quest system work we've seen that
their<00:02:47.330> events<00:02:48.080> it'll<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.380> randomly<00:02:48.620> pop<00:02:48.860> up

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
their events it'll just randomly pop up

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.350 
their events it'll just randomly pop up
and<00:02:49.190> some<00:02:49.310> events<00:02:49.610> will<00:02:49.730> actually<00:02:50.000> spawn

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
and some events will actually spawn

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.900 
and some events will actually spawn
other<00:02:50.600> events<00:02:51.200> tells<00:02:51.410> us<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.790> way<00:02:52.880> that

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
other events tells us so the way that

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.229 
other events tells us so the way that
works<00:02:53.239> we<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:53.959> use<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.380> pirate<00:02:55.069> example<00:02:55.550> so

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
works we can use that pirate example so

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.790 
works we can use that pirate example so
if<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.630> Pirates<00:02:57.170> aren't<00:02:57.380> stopped<00:02:57.680> from

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
if the Pirates aren't stopped from

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.530 
if the Pirates aren't stopped from
burning<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.190> town<00:02:58.340> then<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> town<00:02:59.239> will<00:02:59.390> burn

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
burning the town then the town will burn

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.240 
burning the town then the town will burn
to<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.720> ground<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.260> players<00:03:00.680> will<00:03:00.980> have<00:03:01.010> an

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
to the ground and players will have an

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.460 
to the ground and players will have an
event<00:03:01.489> where<00:03:01.790> they<00:03:02.150> have<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.510> protect<00:03:03.170> workers

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
event where they have to protect workers

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.680 
event where they have to protect workers
who<00:03:03.769> are<00:03:03.799> trying<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.220> rebuild<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.730> town<00:03:04.910> now

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
who are trying to rebuild the town now

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.110 
who are trying to rebuild the town now
players<00:03:06.019> stop<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.220> Pirates<00:03:07.549> from<00:03:07.640> doing<00:03:07.970> that

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
players stop the Pirates from doing that

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.150 
players stop the Pirates from doing that
then<00:03:08.510> they<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.720> follow<00:03:09.110> up<00:03:09.380> with<00:03:09.620> raids<00:03:09.950> on

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
then they can follow up with raids on

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.430 
then they can follow up with raids on
the<00:03:10.220> Pirates<00:03:10.549> base<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.120> things<00:03:11.810> like<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.019> so

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the Pirates base and things like that so

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.990 
the Pirates base and things like that so
what<00:03:12.650> we<00:03:12.739> try<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.920> do<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:13.549> look<00:03:13.760> at<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
what we try to do is just look at the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.640 
what we try to do is just look at the
situation<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.630> we've<00:03:14.720> created<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.350> try<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
situation that we've created and try to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.199 
situation that we've created and try to
figure<00:03:15.920> out<00:03:16.100> what<00:03:16.640> would<00:03:16.760> happen<00:03:17.060> naturally

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
figure out what would happen naturally

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.930 
figure out what would happen naturally
from<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.920> that's<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.280> way<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:19.549> get<00:03:19.670> our

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
from that and that's the way we get our

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.210 
from that and that's the way we get our
event<00:03:20.209> trained<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.780> they<00:03:21.079> kind<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.560> flow<00:03:21.950> very

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
event trained so they kind of flow very

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.940 
event trained so they kind of flow very
naturally<00:03:22.610> from<00:03:22.700> one<00:03:22.850> another<00:03:23.799> one<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.890> the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
naturally from one another one of the

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.080 
naturally from one another one of the
things<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.280> think<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.790> lot<00:03:25.850> of<00:03:25.970> people

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
things I think that a lot of people

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.430 
things I think that a lot of people
really<00:03:26.269> liked<00:03:26.660> about<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.930> first<00:03:27.109> game<00:03:27.260> was

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
that there was a lot of customization

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.520 
that there was a lot of customization
you<00:03:29.030> could<00:03:29.180> use<00:03:29.359> your<00:03:29.570> primary<00:03:30.320> class

this<00:03:42.170> new<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.709> guess<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.579> system<00:03:43.970> when<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
this new I guess a system when you

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.060 
this new I guess a system when you
create<00:03:44.450> your<00:03:44.540> character<00:03:44.720> where<00:03:45.049> depending<00:03:45.859> on

create your character where depending on

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.800 
create your character where depending on
the<00:03:46.130> choices<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.579> make<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.450> also<00:03:47.690> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
the choices you make and and also the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.599 
the choices you make and and also the
dialogue<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.560> choose<00:03:48.829> in<00:03:49.280> your

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
dialogue that you choose in your

adventure that actually changes how

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.050 
adventure that actually changes how
characters<00:03:51.500> react<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.820> know<00:03:52.910> how

kind<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.470> our<00:04:59.590> die<00:04:59.770> system<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:01.000> way<00:05:01.120> it

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
kind of our die system and the way it

works is every piece of equipment can

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.550 
works is every piece of equipment can
have<00:05:03.400> multiple<00:05:03.580> die<00:05:04.330> channels<00:05:04.720> on<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:05.440> if

have multiple die channels on it so if

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.200
