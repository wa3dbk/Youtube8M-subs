00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
series I think it was in Halo Wars and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.740 
series I think it was in Halo Wars and
perhaps<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.129> others<00:00:41.460> Mega<00:00:42.120> Bloks<00:00:42.329> did

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
one recently or has in the past and and

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.259 
one recently or has in the past and and
it's<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.350> too<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.790> I<00:00:47.820> did<00:00:48.089> see<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
it's not too good it's so I did see that

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's not too good it's so I did see that
when<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.540> was<00:00:48.690> walking<00:00:48.900> in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> store<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
when I was walking in the store the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
when I was walking in the store the
other<00:00:50.070> day<00:00:50.159> and<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.400> thought<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.269> know<00:00:51.390> what

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.850 
other day and I thought you know what
this<00:00:51.900> would<00:00:52.079> look<00:00:52.110> kind<00:00:52.409> of<00:00:52.440> good<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.710> my
