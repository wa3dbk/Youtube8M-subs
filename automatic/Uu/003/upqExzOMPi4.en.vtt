00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.980
 we look at each other and take pictures of Zyxel 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.850
 tremendous fascination 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.830
 So let us know the rules 70 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.779
 It's basically jogging feet 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.919
 Jannie or less matching Iris team of percentage points or tactical 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.769
 Getting started getting out so fast nowhere is going up 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.910
 after that Haider increased her to the rising that the weather before Steiger 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.630
 very precariously secured these are special security funds with the 

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.869
 Common places do not apply 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.509
 Percent climbs 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.440
 In a fall, this would have fatal consequences if one dies Hal up to 20 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.380
 meter 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530
 just because way down 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.830
 Promising bank threatens everything that happened to me Sam has seven 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.130
 defends consequences 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.410
 at the Ostkreis before it was pretty bad that it was there 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.960
 even ending with death 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.050
 Messi must also be highly concentrated to know exactly what to do in the direction 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.300
 Moments go one hundred percent 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.700
 and we almost succeeded in that moment but at 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.590
 who in shooting 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.540
 To get the movie on the limit is also with a defeat type going parents anyway 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.670
 become a big success because 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.810
 It's almost every day of my life that it's not always 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.689
 Sweet licking when you see these pictures then you almost have the impression it 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.450
 is not about to arrive it's just about it 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.960
 to get up as fast as possible so the way is in a sense the destination 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.050
 the visibly 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.540
 In what we always liked so much in sports I'm currently aiming for a spurt 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.480
 Milian would and I achieved a lot here and always wants the question 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.490
 what do I have to do then yes 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.360
 that is quite clear it is always for us she shows herself a stopover 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.289
 to reach 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.569
 Of course they could also look at this stopover 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.510
 in prospect cons maybe so 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.970
 Everyday their husband comes for some trailer of course it is present 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.890
 the kings CCS the summit 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.260
 but with reaching the summit percent of the requested new prospect 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.860
 and on the horizon b then many many new goals will show up Miss even come 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.900
 to literally have to stand there then has the ears for who goes then the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 Set goals of the future and it is indeed the beautiful wave Senge 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.020
 Lifelong passion is the tokens shaped by life where is the limit 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.030
 how high 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.679
 Such a band can be a team 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.540
 Hochdorf 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.860
 So in the end it is limitless nature gives us the frontier 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.519
 People are part of nature and try 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.019
 while the boss has the step to progress and I want to singer 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.400
 continue to jump percent what Alexander Stubb set with him 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.900
 go on into old age that they jump from mountain to mountain to another 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.369
 So give me really in the same place 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.969
 who can not get on Procession St 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.879
 we are practically developing from mountain to mountain and our way of life 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.709
 and the procession to birth our father has given it to us 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.689
 at the time about the mountains and percent Susis they are testing with theirs 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.420
 Skills they could climb on big uninhabited mountains 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.750
 say for example 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.709
 he has Mount Everest is the Aldi under the mountains 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.169
 but I do not mind 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.959
 The oldest man is really to take care of that 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.109
 this is shot in the heights role because in the Semperoper 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.009
 that is real and with are gloomy world going without the world on the go and 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.649
 the one who consciously wants to count with a cool paper I was too one 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:08.799
 Mount Everest 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.469
 That is why the highest sand dune González start to pay 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.229
 and fourth, then you have to then about hundred euros 150 cups Bollenbeck then 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.789
 if you knock it with the drinks then you do the box 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:22.349
 I'm a mountaineer, we have the passion and I am 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.009
 not mountaineer who wants to sell something 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.099
 under the scolding 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.799
 I was lucky enough to be able to turn our passion into a career 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.940
 I would still do it a little 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.039
 rich parents 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.729
 the house and wild animals still other pictures are something then also 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.979
 Again and again in the review it is a really good last and double bottom 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.879
 Bayer the difference between Friedland in the Bund 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.139
 Mr. Frings solo 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.009
 What is meant by that, Strutz explained 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.379
 for physiology it is possible the grid and consumption is the coronation comes 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.589
 it is now very beautiful on the stages it is white marked 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:56.359
 wanted 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.019
 and it's pretty much what would happen if I am now 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.249
 in the Lohmühle really down to the ground throw him on the smell that want 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:07.439
 we are not assured then absolutely not secured the current insurance 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.979
 if it is now also a life insurance 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.449
 is to confess one's own money and one's own mental power 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.529
 however, there is no failure 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.030
 That's missing in this whole thing but that is the the Force of 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.650
 with regard to 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.690
 Since it can not happen that one of us had to stumble something like NEN 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.389
 one together with headquarters in fire 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.539
 massive intense with the situation apart 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.690
 and therefore as a precautionary measure 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.910
 "There is honesty in the Vock course situations for people who do not have one 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.330
 Plan hoods from Verdi before she knows the avalanche dead 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.599
 the people in stumble into this situation and then happens in this 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.110
 Moment something with the victory was not the legal system of the city and such 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.449
 Stories Paparazzi have said place in this context times 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.030
 also other percent death probability in the event that 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.120
 What happens old is like a little Tim our dogs recover 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.800
 Sports psychologist is 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.870
 We are always quick to say 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.849
 they are right 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.120
 adrenaline junkies 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.830
 is that addiction and is it 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.139
 can and possibly just eyes that out of good shape 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.620
 formally we have the limits 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.160
 So if outsiders is that maybe percent is looking for regular 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.150
 but looking closer per man is quite different 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.960
 So, after writing, behaviors become the last ones up 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.710
 Malta is having a negative impact where people really are 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.550
 to have the quick grip where ever they hurt themselves where they get theirs 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.509
 Can not cope with everyday life and that's the case with both of them 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.660
 Also this time the scan was learned since Wednesday helps but it is definite 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.510
 So another thing is that you can with so what is the difference and what do you believe 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.960
 is the motivation 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.520
 the difference is, for example, the extreme control 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.010
 frolicking while an addicted person Jens Mahlke is not in control 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.479
 Percent, the two have themselves 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.830
 to the last under control and only then are these high performance too 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.370
 Both understand it as with any athletic performance Ono is 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.210
 Jesus is still extremely extreme and impressively 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.320
 But is not it also that the this kind of Peter Reid 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.260
 basically also a bit of what tells about the world in which we all too 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.330
 every day life 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.630
 It's all about it 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.810
 to be first 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.869
 to be quicker to be better to be better 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:13.619
 I think that is that there is already in each person his in his 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.680
 to approach one's own performance limits 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.400
 and to do that the level otherwise it means what they do 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.030
 each one of us is just up to his level that is that you agreed to 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.199
 I do that where you do not know exactly 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.479
 If I know exactly how to do it then it does not matter anymore 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.189
 That's fun for anyone who's up to volleyball, for example 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.650
 Play credit as bringing the ball across the net 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.910
 Of course that's something quite different than that but try this Reitz 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.080
 without knowing exactly what I am doing this fully that kids have a very special about 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.080
 but not grown up next to Flextreme climber 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:47.069
 Speaking of children they have three pieces 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:48.449
 I have three children 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.830
 and when married 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.830
 but not always very clearly trying to say that 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.569
 these 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.110
 until he's the little one already 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.980
 So if I developed now then for example the crossings will be years old 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.780
 when i sit at home two days the weather is bad or not or 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.100
 I have to work at home and that has my wife someday 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.390
 Now, maybe he's unfairly climbing 

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:17.399
 every morning, empty inside suddenly big then suddenly and then go 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.639
 one in tennis 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.559
 Nantes railes Maar and then 

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:22.969
 pulling one's eyes closed for a moment 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:26.270
 that has come pouring 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.270
 realistic 

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:39.110
 and all of a sudden you needed that better effort this shirt too 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.110
 Futures exchanges are in nature and St 

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:46.749
 I believe her money is gone and he saw us at the moment 

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:50.629
 sure my kids will give it back and i hope that's just that 

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:55.469
 He realizes he can be a good father and he hopes to have a label in the country for a long time 

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:58.349
 Palin could be the father of all the seas 

00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:00.179
 the injury is the big goal sought
