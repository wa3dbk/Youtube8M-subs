00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
think it's gonna go one way and he grabs

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
think it's gonna go one way and he grabs
ahold<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.310> himself<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> gets<00:01:21.000> his<00:01:21.119> game<00:01:21.330> back

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
ahold of himself and gets his game back

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
ahold of himself and gets his game back
in<00:01:21.780> order<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.409> amount<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.830> he's<00:01:26.070> played

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
in order so the amount that he's played

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.630 
in order so the amount that he's played
he's<00:01:26.700> played<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.939> lot<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.770> some<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> flows

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
he's played a lot and some of the flows

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.429 
he's played a lot and some of the flows
and<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> pressures<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.350> were

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and the and the pressures of what were

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.010 
and the and the pressures of what were
involved<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.060> great<00:01:33.270> process<00:01:33.540> for

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
involved here it's a great process for

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.120 
involved here it's a great process for
him<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.380> he's<00:01:34.680> handled<00:01:35.009> himself

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
him and I think he's handled himself

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.090 
him and I think he's handled himself
really<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.140> again<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:38.090> come<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:40.100> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
really well and again to come from a it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.490 
really well and again to come from a it
to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> number<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.570> guy<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.049> he's<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
to be a number one guy as he's going to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
to be a number one guy as he's going to
the<00:01:43.619> process<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> trying<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> it's

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the process of trying to do that it's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
the process of trying to do that it's
mental<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.380> its<00:01:46.740> handling<00:01:47.130> those<00:01:47.399> type<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
mental it's its handling those type of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.590 
mental it's its handling those type of
situations<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.600> handling<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.140> every<00:01:49.409> day<00:01:49.439> I

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
situations and handling it every day I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.700 
situations and handling it every day I
think<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.720> been<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.259> process

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
think it's been a really good process

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.500 
think it's been a really good process
and<00:01:52.860> he's<00:01:52.950> handle<00:01:53.189> himself<00:01:53.310> real<00:01:53.670> well

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.810

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
haven't been together as a line we just

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.680 
haven't been together as a line we just
did<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.160> other<00:03:22.190> night<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.120> thought

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
did it the other night and I thought

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.060 
did it the other night and I thought
they<00:03:23.870> played<00:03:23.900> very<00:03:24.140> well<00:03:24.410> but<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.709> David

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
they played very well but the David

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.150 
they played very well but the David
Booth<00:03:25.780> Richie<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.989> cast<00:03:27.260> line<00:03:27.590> has<00:03:27.739> been<00:03:27.890> very

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
Booth Richie and cast line has been very

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.550 
Booth Richie and cast line has been very
good<00:03:28.430> too<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:28.880> think<00:03:29.810> we<00:03:29.900> get<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.049> little<00:03:30.170> finish

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
good too I think we get a little finish

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.090 
good too I think we get a little finish
from<00:03:31.220> Sean<00:03:31.489> when<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:32.239> put<00:03:32.420> them<00:03:32.510> on<00:03:32.630> there<00:03:33.100> but

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
from Sean when we put them on there but

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.250 
from Sean when we put them on there but
David<00:03:34.400> Booth<00:03:34.549> finishes<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.299> maybe<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.959> helps

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
David Booth finishes to maybe that helps

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.710 
David Booth finishes to maybe that helps
them<00:03:37.239> again<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.269> like<00:03:39.790> with<00:03:40.790> Sean<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.120> it's

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
them again I like with Sean and it's

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.380 
them again I like with Sean and it's
something<00:03:41.989> that<00:03:42.790> we've<00:03:43.790> talked<00:03:44.060> about<00:03:44.239> is

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
something that we've talked about is

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.390 
something that we've talked about is
just<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.660> utility<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.230> them<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.680> think<00:03:46.220> that's

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
just the utility of them I think that's

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.039 
just the utility of them I think that's
a<00:03:46.489> really<00:03:46.850> good<00:03:46.970> thing<00:03:47.030> now<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.720> moving

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
a really good thing now and moving

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.320 
a really good thing now and moving
forward<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:49.700> we'll<00:03:49.820> see<00:03:50.000> how<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.120> all<00:03:50.239> shakes

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
forward so we'll see how it all shakes

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.539 
forward so we'll see how it all shakes
out<00:03:50.750> they<00:03:51.260> may<00:03:51.440> see<00:03:51.500> some<00:03:52.130> time<00:03:52.340> together

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
out they may see some time together

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.870 
out they may see some time together
tomorrow<00:03:53.030> night<00:03:53.120> also<00:03:54.370> but<00:03:55.370> again<00:03:55.489> even
