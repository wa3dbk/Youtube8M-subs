of screen size they are still LCD panels
but<00:01:27.290> what<00:01:27.590> has<00:01:27.740> changed<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.610> lighting

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
but what has changed is the lighting

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.860 
but what has changed is the lighting
system<00:01:29.590> behind<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.860> panel<00:01:31.870> traditionally

system behind that panel traditionally
they've<00:01:33.110> been<00:01:33.290> see<00:01:33.560> CFL<00:01:34.160> which<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.880> basically

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
they've been see CFL which is basically

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.930 
they've been see CFL which is basically
fluorescent<00:01:36.080> tubes<00:01:36.410> behind<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.040> panel<00:01:37.370> to

fluorescent tubes behind the panel to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.730 
fluorescent tubes behind the panel to
illuminate<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.540> screen<00:01:38.870> so<00:01:39.230> it<00:01:39.410> can<00:01:39.530> see<00:01:39.710> the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.950 
screen the LEDs switch off in that area
to<00:01:57.050> give<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.650> total<00:01:58.460> black<00:01:58.840> now<00:01:59.840> I've

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
to give you a total black now I've

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.860 
to give you a total black now I've
spoken<00:02:00.230> before<00:02:00.530> about<00:02:01.040> one<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.550> the

spoken before about one of the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.940 
spoken before about one of the
advantages<00:02:02.870> of<00:02:02.930> getting<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.350> good<00:02:03.560> blank

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
advantages of getting that good blank

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.670 
advantages of getting that good blank
level<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> TV<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:05.480> that<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.260> deeper<00:02:06.590> the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
level on a TV is that the deeper the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.710 
level on a TV is that the deeper the
black<00:02:06.920> level<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.700> better<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.060> color<00:02:08.300> public

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
black level the better the color public

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.949 
black level the better the color public
that<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:08.959> get<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.649> better<00:02:09.920> depth<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.459> field

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
that you get the better depth of field

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.630 
that you get the better depth of field
more<00:02:11.959> detail<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.500> darker<00:02:13.129> areas<00:02:13.489> of<00:02:13.519> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
more detail on darker areas of the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.119 
more detail on darker areas of the
screen<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.750> with<00:02:14.900> LED<00:02:15.260> technology<00:02:15.530> you're

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
screen so with LED technology you're

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.000 
screen so with LED technology you're
achieving<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:17.030> much<00:02:17.780> better<00:02:18.170> black<00:02:18.650> level

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
achieving a much better black level

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.259 
achieving a much better black level
night<00:02:19.129> you<00:02:19.220> would<00:02:19.370> traditionally<00:02:19.580> get<00:02:20.120> with

there<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:28.040> do<00:02:28.280> tend<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.670> get<00:02:28.819> lower<00:02:29.060> running

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
there you do tend to get lower running

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.630 
there you do tend to get lower running
costs<00:02:29.510> because<00:02:30.200> those<00:02:30.470> LEDs<00:02:31.040> those<00:02:31.310> whites

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640

has<00:03:50.389> been<00:03:50.660> standardized<00:03:51.290> when<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.709> look<00:03:51.919> at

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
has been standardized when you look at

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.470 
has been standardized when you look at
say<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.549> ps3<00:03:52.970> menu<00:03:53.480> it's<00:03:54.109> no<00:03:54.319> using<00:03:54.799> Sony's

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
say a ps3 menu it's no using Sony's

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.750 
say a ps3 menu it's no using Sony's
crossbar<00:03:56.480> menu<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.949> cross<00:03:58.190> media<00:03:58.579> bar

crossbar menu so the cross media bar

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.789 
crossbar menu so the cross media bar
menu<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.299> you<00:03:59.389> get<00:03:59.569> on<00:03:59.690> here<00:03:59.930> is<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.349> very

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
menu that you get on here is a very
