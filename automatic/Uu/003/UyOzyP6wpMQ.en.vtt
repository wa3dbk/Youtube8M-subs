at<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.930> stage<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:01.650> sealed<00:00:02.010> everything<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.700> did

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
at this stage I sealed everything we did

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.110 
at this stage I sealed everything we did
again<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.300> binder<00:00:03.899> just<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.640> leave<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.670> there

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
again and binder just to leave it there

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.459 
again and binder just to leave it there
because<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.660> like<00:00:07.099> the<00:00:08.099> state<00:00:08.370> where<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.790> was

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
because I like the state where it was

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.060 
because I like the state where it was
now<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.880> moving<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.240> painting<00:00:12.570> some

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
now I'm moving on to painting some

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.530 
now I'm moving on to painting some
wildflowers<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> details<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> binder

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
wildflowers and details and the binder

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
wildflowers and details and the binder
will<00:00:15.750> keep<00:00:15.990> me<00:00:16.139> keep<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.710> from<00:00:16.859> interacting

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
will keep me keep it from interacting

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.029 
will keep me keep it from interacting
reacting<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:21.170> what<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> previous

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
reacting with the what the previous

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.080 
reacting with the what the previous
leaders<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.199> stage<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.920> kind<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.910> did

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
leaders and at this stage I kind of did

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.810 
leaders and at this stage I kind of did
a<00:00:30.740> quick<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.920> dirty<00:00:32.070> version<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.700> how<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
a quick and dirty version of how I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.670 
a quick and dirty version of how I
usually<00:00:33.210> paint<00:00:33.450> because<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.840> normally<00:00:34.350> have

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
usually paint because I normally have

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
usually paint because I normally have
several<00:00:34.950> more<00:00:35.160> layers<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:36.559> but<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:38.670> can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
several more layers to go but you can

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.369 
several more layers to go but you can
see<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> few<00:00:39.719> letters<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.230> get

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
see with just a few letters you can get

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.910 
see with just a few letters you can get
quite<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> dramatic<00:00:40.829> effect<00:00:42.649> and<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.739> lot

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
quite a dramatic effect and a lot

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.910 
quite a dramatic effect and a lot
happening<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> painting<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.620> they<00:00:49.739> can

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
happening in the painting and they can

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.110 
happening in the painting and they can
do<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:52.140> destructively<00:00:52.710> without<00:00:53.120> ruining

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
do so in destructively without ruining

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.720 
do so in destructively without ruining
my<00:00:54.390> previous<00:00:54.870> work<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> nice<00:00:57.899> feeling

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
my previous work and it's a nice feeling

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.040 
my previous work and it's a nice feeling
to<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> paint<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.960> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to have a paint like this that's so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
to have a paint like this that's so
flexible<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
flexible that I don't have a lot of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.350 
flexible that I don't have a lot of
hacks<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.840> worried<00:01:04.080> over<00:01:05.030> having<00:01:06.030> ten

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
hacks and worried over having ten

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
hacks and worried over having ten
minutes<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> running<00:01:06.900> spider<00:01:07.260> painting<00:01:07.680> ruins

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
minutes of running spider painting ruins

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.450 
minutes of running spider painting ruins
like<00:01:08.310> 10<00:01:08.610> days<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.850> who's<00:01:09.659> murdered<00:01:10.080> painting

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
like 10 days of who's murdered painting

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:23.270 
like 10 days of who's murdered painting
so<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:15.740> can<00:01:17.930> go<00:01:18.930> ahead<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.259> work<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:22.280> these

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so I I can go ahead and work on these

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.770 
so I I can go ahead and work on these
new<00:01:23.490> elements<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> painting<00:01:24.330> without

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
new elements in the painting without

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
new elements in the painting without
having<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.560> experiment<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.369> without

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
having to an experiment with it without

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.260 
having to an experiment with it without
having<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.060> worry<00:01:27.890> about<00:01:28.939> destroying<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
having to worry about destroying all the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
having to worry about destroying all the
work<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.570> did<00:01:30.630> before<00:01:30.869> then

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.950 

if<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.190> was<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:38.150> standard<00:01:39.150> occur<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.570> I'd<00:01:39.750> be

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
if this was a standard occur like I'd be

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
if this was a standard occur like I'd be
worried<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.440> painting<00:01:40.890> over<00:01:40.979> top<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.460> this

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
worried about painting over top of this

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.580 
worried about painting over top of this
because<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:44.720> paint<00:01:45.720> over<00:01:45.780> top<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.440> gonna

because I paint over top is not gonna
come<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.220> decided<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.729> change<00:01:47.909> it

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:14.190 

sometimes<00:02:01.170> tell<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.500> I've<00:02:01.590> been<00:02:01.800> too<00:02:01.980> fussy

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.180 

just<00:02:15.200> close<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.560> end<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.800> painting<00:02:16.100> I'll

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
just close the end of the painting I'll

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.960 
just close the end of the painting I'll
throw<00:02:16.820> it<00:02:16.940> into<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.180> frame<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:20.440> carry<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
throw it into a frame and carry it to a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.750 
throw it into a frame and carry it to a
big<00:02:23.240> mirror<00:02:23.690> mm-hmm<00:02:24.620> flip<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.370> over<00:02:25.460> in<00:02:25.730> front

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
big mirror mm-hmm flip it over in front

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.620 
big mirror mm-hmm flip it over in front
of<00:02:26.000> me<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> fresh<00:02:27.470> instant<00:02:28.630> he

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
of me it's like it a fresh instant he

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.210 
of me it's like it a fresh instant he
will<00:02:29.810> make<00:02:29.930> before<00:02:30.200> my<00:02:30.320> brain<00:02:30.530> resets<00:02:31.040> to

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
will make before my brain resets to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.930 
will make before my brain resets to
recognize<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.180> meaning<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.470> did

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
recognize the meaning that I just did

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.400 
recognize the meaning that I just did
and<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.060> gives<00:02:35.240> me<00:02:35.300> an<00:02:35.480> idea<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.110> see

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
and it gives me an idea that I can see

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.640 
and it gives me an idea that I can see
any<00:02:36.620> compositional<00:02:37.490> problems<00:02:37.970> or<00:02:38.650> color
