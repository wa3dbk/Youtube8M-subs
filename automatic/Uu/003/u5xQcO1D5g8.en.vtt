00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.860 

one<00:00:01.050> of<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.260> harder<00:00:01.620> things<00:00:01.829> woodworking<00:00:02.580> is

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
one of the harder things woodworking is

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.210 
one of the harder things woodworking is
clapping<00:00:03.870> together<00:00:04.140> might<00:00:04.529> have<00:00:04.710> joined<00:00:04.980> like

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
clapping together might have joined like

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.690 
clapping together might have joined like
this

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
this

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.610 
this
and<00:00:05.790> I've<00:00:06.420> come<00:00:06.660> up<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.960> fairly<00:00:07.230> simple

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
and I've come up with a fairly simple

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.700 
and I've come up with a fairly simple
way<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:07.980> doing<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.610> I'll<00:00:08.790> show<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.030> now<00:00:09.710> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
way of doing it I'll show that now to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.820 
way of doing it I'll show that now to
clamp<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.130> miter<00:00:11.340> joint<00:00:11.460> together<00:00:12.650> you<00:00:13.650> need<00:00:13.769> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
clamp a miter joint together you need a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.140 
clamp a miter joint together you need a
clamping<00:00:14.340> system<00:00:14.929> so<00:00:15.929> here's<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.100> came<00:00:17.880> up

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
clamping system so here's what I came up

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.220 
clamping system so here's what I came up
with<00:00:19.100> these<00:00:20.100> ones<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.060> 90<00:00:21.660> degree<00:00:21.930> joint

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
with these ones are for 90 degree joint

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.000 
with these ones are for 90 degree joint
like<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:24.439> they're<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.470> made<00:00:25.800> from

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
like this and they're just made from

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.269 
like this and they're just made from
plywood<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.699> cut<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.480> shape<00:00:28.279> first

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
plywood and cut out in the shape first

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.290 
plywood and cut out in the shape first
thing<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.640> do<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.289> clamp<00:00:31.289> these<00:00:31.590> onto<00:00:32.489> pieces

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
thing we do is clamp these onto pieces

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
thing we do is clamp these onto pieces
you<00:00:33.540> want<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.809> clamp<00:00:34.020> together<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.440> tighten

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you want to clamp together you tighten

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.549 
you want to clamp together you tighten
the<00:00:40.950> clamps<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.270> use<00:00:45.539> another<00:00:45.570> clamp<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the clamps and then use another clamp to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:01:02.869 
the clamps and then use another clamp to
clamp<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:47.010> together<00:01:01.430> these<00:01:02.430> allow<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
clamp them together these allow you to

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
clamp them together these allow you to
put<00:01:03.149> good<00:01:03.840> clamping<00:01:04.170> pressure<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
put good clamping pressure right on the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.800 
put good clamping pressure right on the
joint<00:01:07.880> here<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> wider

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
joint here you can see from a wider

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
joint here you can see from a wider
stock<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.740> wider<00:01:11.159> ones<00:01:11.460> made<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.479> allows

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
stock I have wider ones made that allows

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.490 
stock I have wider ones made that allows
me<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> get<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:14.100> than<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.369> clamp<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.500> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
me to get more than one clamp on and you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.179 
me to get more than one clamp on and you
can<00:01:16.680> make<00:01:16.830> these<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.250> wide<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
can make these as wide as you want and

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.469 
can make these as wide as you want and
it's<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.430> limited<00:01:20.850> by<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> number<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it's only limited by the number of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
it's only limited by the number of
clamps<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> joint<00:01:23.670> that's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
clamps you have this is a joint that's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.780 
clamps you have this is a joint that's
nearly<00:01:24.270> impossible<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:25.530> clamp<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:26.100> using<00:01:26.490> any

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
nearly impossible to clamp up using any

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.780 
nearly impossible to clamp up using any
other<00:01:27.090> means<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.920> 135<00:01:29.850> degree<00:01:30.210> joint<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
other means it's 135 degree joint and

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.179 
other means it's 135 degree joint and
these<00:01:32.790> allow<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.720> done<00:01:33.979> fairly<00:01:34.979> easily

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
these allow it to be done fairly easily

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.980 
these allow it to be done fairly easily
I<00:01:36.500> climbed<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.680> some<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.369> we'll<00:01:39.210> convert

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.469 

okay<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:44.490> fairly<00:01:44.700> simple<00:01:45.090> trick

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
okay that's it it's fairly simple trick

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.730 
okay that's it it's fairly simple trick
very<00:01:46.320> easy<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:47.810> I'm<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.049> several<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
very easy to make I'm not several like I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.690 
very easy to make I'm not several like I
say<00:01:49.979> made<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> little<00:01:53.369> bit<00:01:53.549> more

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
say made up to get a little bit more

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.240 
say made up to get a little bit more
detail<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.590> read<00:01:55.740> about<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.100> on
