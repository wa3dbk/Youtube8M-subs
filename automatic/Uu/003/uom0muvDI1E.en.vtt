you grow about four years you're about
four<00:03:31.690> years<00:03:31.870> older<00:03:32.260> when<00:03:32.349> your<00:03:32.560> body<00:03:32.739> starts

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
four years older when your body starts

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.920 
four years older when your body starts
moving<00:03:33.159> you're<00:03:34.060> holding<00:03:34.510> your<00:03:34.629> mousse<00:03:34.780> and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
moving you're holding your mousse and

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.990 
very tight they're very hard and I like
that<00:03:38.830> but<00:03:39.099> now<00:03:39.280> start<00:03:39.580> thinking<00:03:39.730> about

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
that but now start thinking about

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.460 
that but now start thinking about
different<00:03:40.239> dimensions<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.049> add<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.379> the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
different dimensions to add to the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.780 
different dimensions to add to the
performance<00:03:41.920> maybe<00:03:42.129> something<00:03:42.519> with<00:03:42.640> this

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
performance maybe something with this

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.550 
performance maybe something with this
story<00:03:43.030> think<00:03:43.540> about<00:03:43.720> an<00:03:43.840> illusion<00:03:44.319> think

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
story think about an illusion think

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.380 
story think about an illusion think
about<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.830> stunt<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.400> really<00:03:45.819> did<00:03:46.030> enjoy<00:03:46.209> the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
about a stunt I really did enjoy the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.550 
about a stunt I really did enjoy the
performance<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.810> would<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:47.019> say<00:03:47.140> add<00:03:47.349> that

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
performance I would just say add that

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:58.080 
performance I would just say add that
one<00:03:47.830> thing<00:03:48.099> give<00:03:48.310> me<00:03:48.370> one<00:03:48.580> more<00:03:48.760> later<00:03:54.450> Puri<00:03:57.090> it

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
one thing give me one more later Puri it

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.220 
one thing give me one more later Puri it

time you guys are dancing like adults
maybe<00:04:07.329> stunts<00:04:07.840> aren't<00:04:08.109> your<00:04:08.230> strength<00:04:08.560> maybe

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
maybe stunts aren't your strength maybe

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.770 
maybe stunts aren't your strength maybe
illusions<00:04:09.370> are<00:04:09.549> not<00:04:09.730> your<00:04:09.910> strength<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.569> take

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
illusions are not your strength so take

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.479 
illusions are not your strength so take
advantage<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.650> transitions<00:04:12.129> if<00:04:12.220> you<00:04:12.280> stay

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
advantage of the transitions if you stay

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.190 
advantage of the transitions if you stay
there<00:04:12.700> for<00:04:12.730> two<00:04:12.970> eight<00:04:13.120> counts<00:04:13.150> we're<00:04:14.019> gonna

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
there for two eight counts we're gonna

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.690 
there for two eight counts we're gonna
automatically<00:04:14.739> like<00:04:14.920> okay<00:04:15.190> who<00:04:15.370> wants<00:04:15.519> the

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700

automatically like okay who wants the
next<00:04:15.790> thing<00:04:16.000> cuz<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.180> choreography<00:04:16.840> is

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
next thing cuz the choreography is

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:27.450 
next thing cuz the choreography is
already<00:04:17.620> there<00:04:25.560> because<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.919> mean<00:04:27.100> don't<00:04:27.370> like

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
already there because I mean don't like
