00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.299
 today I had a pizza head and welcome to 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.740
 the review of the light type 88 metric 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.090
 if they are new here remember that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.680
 these videos are not to prove 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.119
 skills but to see how 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.920
 the hands of a puppet work 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.300
 average as I am equally 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.039
 comment with a weapon they would like to see 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.449
 receiving a near future or if not 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.009
 they have nothing to comment on 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.199
 comment with the word of the day that is 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.660
 edge let's start with the review of the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.849
 Lightweight metric type 88 in real life 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.470
 abusive and tom jones and xiang is a weapon 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.510
 manufactured by the company norinco in the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.130
 country of china this light matter is 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.650
 in production is from the year 2000 and uses 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.530
 ammunition of 5.8 x 42 mm type 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.910
 of vp 87 common in Chinese weapons by 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.950
 last his firing rate is very 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 similar to the game with 700 shots 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.060
 per minute already pin oxox 2004 this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.980
 weapons is what after you 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.260
 they get 4000 points with the metrics 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.060
 light is to say the second metric of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.160
 light that you block the game not 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.230
 It is so hard to get past the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.030
 statistics but we have that the damage is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.280
 of 24 points of damage within the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.290
 first 8 meters is to say a death of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 5 shots and then it's shrinking 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.759
 slightly until you reach 65 meters 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.400
 where you take a minimum damage of 18 points 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.990
 damage that is 6 shots you can 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.650
 account that by the characteristics of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.850
 damage keeps a death of 5 shots 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.280
 approximately to eye of good cubero to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.110
 about 50 meters very consistent in this 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.820
 aspect except for some exceptions to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.900
 medium long distances and the enemies 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.460
 who wear the vest of the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.200
 defensive specialty but that's it 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.510
 prehistory we also pass to the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 ammunition the ammunition is 200 bullets in 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.260
 the charger and enough chamber for 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.570
 all those who want to go to the rambo 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.280
 firing and firing this charger 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.170
 200 bullets from the best things of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.060
 this light shrapnel as it allows them 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.800
 both provide supportive fire without 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.510
 need to recharge for a long time 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.220
 time as much as you can 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.040
 kill more enemies without having to pass 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.840
 for the long 7- second recharge the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.410
 second recharge slower after the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 m 60 with its long and tedious 7.8 seconds 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.130
 of recharging the cadence shots the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.650
 we mentioned that similar to real life 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.229
 with 700 shots per minute here is how 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.060
 say slow mean is an average for 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.280
 the light metrics but in comparison 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.080
 to the SLR assault and carbines stays 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.300
 a little slow therefore if you 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.890
 fail some shots at the beginning you can 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.019
 that if the enemy is using a 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.540
 weapon of higher cadence the enemy leave 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.459
 also earning another point 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.920
 that does not highlight the one but that either 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.409
 the week is 600 bullet speed 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.689
 meters above second makes it not so 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.010
 difficult to keep enemies moving and 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.540
 if you are shooting at long 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.609
 distances do not have to aim more 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.230
 above where they are pointing the mode 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.269
 trigger is only automatic by 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.370
 the type of open bolt that uses 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.409
 that kind of meter the light ones really 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.760
 they do not need a semiautomatic that a 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.409
 machine gun of this type mostly 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.629
 with that huge amount of bullets 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.069
 talking now about the kick this is one 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.170
 of the points that make it one of the 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.879
 favorite of many players and a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.829
 excellent option for those players 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.840
 that are starting with the class and not 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.000
 they have to deal with kicks very 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.549
 strong as for example the apec app 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.680
 has hole me 240 bravo has a kick 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.989
 from point 28 upwards pretty good 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 the type 3 assault rifle is the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.829
 left and point 3 to the right 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.150
 throwing him a little high without 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.220
 However, it is quite controllable in 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.389
 comparison to other light metrics in 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.579
 how much to the multiplier the first 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.200
 shot is only 1 so if 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.689
 are firing at the first burst or 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.329
 the fifteenth bullet in a burst no 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.639
 matter the recoil will remain the 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.170
 same among all the bullets now past 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.090
 to municipalities in terms 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.430
 look, I recommend a holographic or 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.780
 red dot this is a personal matter 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.790
 maybe the firing rate and the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.099
 recoil may allow for more 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.440
 amplification although it seems that the 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.150
 holographic or red go pretty well in 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.800
 as to the canyon there is not much of where 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.810
 modify since the firing pattern is 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.550
 quite controllable in any case can 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.860
 put a burst suppressor or leave in 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.660
 white that accessory and if you are from 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.220
 chance they will have problems 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.230
 with the pattern of shooting sideways 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.330
 which is the more or less unstable point 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.800
 can put a compensator but not what 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.630
 I would suggest by not wanting 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.160
 alter the accuracy as to the 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.720
 let's take advantage of the a 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.819
 lightweight materials that most are 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.190
 made for the fire ring with click by 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.680
 bullet and put some angled to 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.690
 diminish even more that retreat of the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.640
 first shot also not an accessory 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.500
 highly recommended by the fact that it 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.410
 they are very vulnerable to what they would be 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.359
 sniper mortars grenades 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.340
 you will also fire the enemies that 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.410
 flank an endless list I'm 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.940
 talking about the accessory of the beep or if 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.440
 you are so defined in a very 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.850
 closed where it is not so exposed to 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.860
 as many dangers as previous ones 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.510
 mentioned are playing for example in 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.660
 assault where they are defending a 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.430
 communications station 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.990
 like they can put the beat pode and 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.760
 due to the rate of shots and the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.620
 high loader that has this weapon is going 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.480
 to allow intense fire in an area 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.250
 for quite a long time and 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.320
 prevent the enemy from poking or that 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.850
 receive the consequences finally the 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.350
 accessory of your preference can put 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.390
 a measure of red dot only 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.670
 remember to turn it off in long combat 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.140
 reach a magnifier and it's also a 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.970
 good choice if you want a little more 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.920
 scope will consume holographic or point 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.290
 red what you decide now 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.790
 happening to the pros and cons of the weapon 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.250
 the good points of this weapon the 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.380
 charger is immense and number 2 is 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.270
 relatively controllable in terms of 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.400
 bad points the average mean cadence 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.960
 low makes it not very competitive 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.490
 this weapon and if so playing against 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.760
 enemies that put on their pants 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.700
 trailers and they start to fight with aces 23 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.650
 and maybe this weapon is too much for 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.330
 below them also in relation to the 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.070
 cadence is that the damage is nothing 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.350
 spectacular for that cadence so 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.140
 so much does not make up for it at all and number 3 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.630
 kilometric recharge is hidden is 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.070
 before recharging seriously at last you 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.890
 give a rating of 2 slices of 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.900
 pizza over 4 that is average that 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.800
 word perfectly describes this 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.629
 light metric 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.520
 has average statistics on everything 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.740
 sense does not stand out in a single one either 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.720
 in the worst of all except for the fact 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.490
 fire held there if they can draw a 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.960
 certain advantage and this is recommended 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.639
 weapon but in another sense there 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.349
 machine guns that do better work 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.120
 but as always the best judge are 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.860
 you tell me how do you like this 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.270
 what has worked for them if not the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.650
 have tested if they believe that this video 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.090
 could I serve someone else please 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.889
 of the one rating to it and 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.900
 consider sharing it also if you do not 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.860
 subscribed, check other videos 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.539
 that I have in the channel so that 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.949
 convince and subscribe networks 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.569
 social facebook and twitter and also 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.530
 twitch are in the description and we 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.530
 we see in the next 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.450
