00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.540
 that walk cuberos as they are is because 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.630
 the video is very good and I'm going to 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:14.269
 bring a tutorial of this modification 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.690
 mod mode is the city tower or tower 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.500
 mods and 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.770
 it's a three by three extended with these 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.850
 structures so that it is blocked I can not 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.340
 do here network here if I want to be re 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.329
 I have to make three turns so that 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.460
 it's here 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.970
 and it is an easy modification of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 do 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.200
 you only need two rubik cubes of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.530
 preference of the same brand and I this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.090
 I did it with a Cuban oxxo with two if not 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 they know they are the rockies is because they do not 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.270
 they live in mexico and well we are going to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.270
 start with the tutorial 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.789
 The first thing we are going to do is choose 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.339
 the cube that we want as a base that is the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.500
 that we want it to turn 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.570
 and well, I 'm not going to do it because 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 I already have it done here but I'm going to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.719
 explain choose the cube and already depending 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.550
 of the color code they want to follow 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:21.409
 I followed this 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.049
 with green above blue 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.039
 and it depends the color code have 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:31.399
 to remove these four of these four 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.810
 stickers the four from the corner of 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:40.429
 a face since they do that they have to 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.069
 dismantle the other cube all three of that 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.159
 color is counted I choose here the face 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.950
 green then I have to dismantle the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.040
 green face over is a yellow I have 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.800
 what to remove these 3 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.260
 which are the ones that I am going to modify 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.900
 when we have the pieces I will put 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.870
 here an example I have these three that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.390
 There was not enough of this modification 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.830
 and these three are the ones that we're going to 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.729
 Modify 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.890
 let's do 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.610
 let's take this away 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.240
 these pieces left over from the edges and 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.750
 this base corner to be able 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.750
 do it so let's make it easy 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.330
 good 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.840
 here they see what 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.780
 very easy I could remove the base to the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.280
 corner and the same will do with the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.740
 edges 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.620
 I'm going to cut the video and right now 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.620
 I do it with the video 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.980
 once the doors have been cut 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.310
 leftovers it would be best to sand the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.440
 borders 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.650
 as here 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.740
 but as I already did, I'm going to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.960
 go on to explain the next step 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.590
 let's imagine that in the pieces that I have 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.930
 here are the right ones or not just fail 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.870
 fail one imagine that the target is 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.390
 of the shakhtar as yellow 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.650
 and then well let's go the following is 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.650
 let me dismantle 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.110
 is it so 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.700
 the following is 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.830
 to do 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.040
 this 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.970
 so the piece 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.330
 the piece that is going to go here is the one that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.069
 we said we 're going to paste on top of the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.019
 corner that has to go 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.200
 that we had already removed the sticker 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.390
 previously 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.020
 and we're going to hit it, I'm not going to do it 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.210
 because I had messed up my bucket 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.150
 and once I've done that we're going to do 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:02.350
 these three we are going to paste the so 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.350
 we take the resistol 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.900
 we put it 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.400
 we paste the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.870
 respective corner as today 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.870
 well I think 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.919
 A) Yes 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.919
 we stuck 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.170
 and the same is 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.949
 we paste it so it's fine there 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.870
 we stick it like that and it's going to be lost 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.490
 here 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.490
 good equal resistor 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.680
 good a good important fact has if 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.900
 begin to make the modification of 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.550
 right side 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.390
 all other corners also the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.350
 They have to make 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.350
 on the right side 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.490
 and if they start doing it on the side 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.639
 left as is all the pieces the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.660
 they had to do the left side 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.660
 that is here louis on the left side 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.540
 and here all the pieces are towards the 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.660
 left side 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.780
 here I did it on the right side and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.890
 consequently the pieces should go to the side 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.040
 right and once we have done 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.130
 this with the three good with all the 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.780
 corners already well placed here in the 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.920
 place they're going to finally finally be 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.140
 assemble it 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.140
 let's join do not we the 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.589
 the corner as it goes 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.350
 Y 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.680
 here we will have it important when 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.620
 go to paste the piece paste them all 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.990
 towards the same side here we see towards the 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.060
 left 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.580
 toward the left 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.290
 to the left you want them if 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.930
 you hit one on the left and one on the 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.480
 right is going to be deformed and then 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.660
 already repeating this step with the four 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.770
 corners is only 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.770
 doing so 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:31.450
 and then let's go to form it 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.640
 to see how it looks is a simple 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.950
 three by three here here you already notice the 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.430
 three by three and you only see there the 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.139
 extensions 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.950
 and well, it 's an easy modification 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.830
 since they had asked him in the forum 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.770
 here is the video I hope you have them 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.040
 liked and if you have a doubt leave it 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.930
 know in the comments and I'll try to 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.860
 resolve the 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:05.310
 it is an oxxo that is cheap this one that you do not 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.770
 passes 80 pesos 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.780
 and then it's very quick to do so 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:15.800
 I hope you liked a video 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:18.169
 video here I say goodbye with the cube 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:23.139
 these 3 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:25.729
 This is because this small garbage and the 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:29.919
 and I hope you liked it and we 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:29.919
 we see in the following video thanks
