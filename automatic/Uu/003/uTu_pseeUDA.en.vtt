wheel or a bear surface the metalizer is

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.609 
wheel or a bear surface the metalizer is
alone<00:00:18.789> will<00:00:19.359> it<00:00:19.510> rip<00:00:19.810> off<00:00:20.019> just<00:00:20.230> like<00:00:20.380> original

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619

interesting a lot of people think for
some<00:00:24.369> reason<00:00:24.699> the<00:00:25.119> metalizer<00:00:25.720> z'<00:00:25.929> will<00:00:26.260> just

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
some reason the metalizer z' will just

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.519 
some reason the metalizer z' will just
stay<00:00:27.099> there<00:00:27.310> they<00:00:27.519> have<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:27.939> be<00:00:28.320> over<00:00:29.320> an

stay there they have to be over an
original<00:00:29.949> layer<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.279> plastic<00:00:30.670> so<00:00:30.910> we're<00:00:31.060> going

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
original layer of plastic so we're going

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.360 
original layer of plastic so we're going
to<00:00:31.210> go<00:00:31.779> over<00:00:31.929> that<00:00:32.050> today<00:00:32.230> I've<00:00:32.500> taken<00:00:32.800> a<00:00:33.190> wheel

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
to go over that today I've taken a wheel

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.520 
to go over that today I've taken a wheel
mast<00:00:33.640> off<00:00:33.850> an<00:00:34.030> area<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.360> sprayed<00:00:34.750> just<00:00:35.170> bare

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.930 
gold metal Iser over at five or six
coats<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:38.140> let<00:00:38.649> it<00:00:38.739> sit<00:00:38.980> for<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.489> last<00:00:39.670> three

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
days so let's see if the metalizer is

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.940 
days so let's see if the metalizer is
going<00:00:41.770> to<00:00:41.860> come<00:00:41.950> up<00:00:42.100> or<00:00:42.280> if<00:00:42.370> it's<00:00:42.430> stuck<00:00:43.950> okay

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
going to come up or if it's stuck okay

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.279 
going to come up or if it's stuck okay

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
well here we have a wheel I taped off

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.029 
well here we have a wheel I taped off
this<00:00:47.500> area<00:00:47.800> here<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.719> I<00:00:49.840> sprayed<00:00:50.260> on<00:00:50.410> five<00:00:50.829> or

six coats of just gold metalizer

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.279 
six coats of just gold metalizer
now<00:00:53.800> this<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.579> spare<00:00:54.969> wheel<00:00:55.149> here<00:00:55.539> and<00:00:55.719> this

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
now this is a spare wheel here and this

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.110 
now this is a spare wheel here and this
is<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.620> five<00:00:56.949> or<00:00:57.100> six<00:00:57.280> coats<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.640> gold<00:00:57.879> medal

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
tape now as you guys know that the tape

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.150 
tape now as you guys know that the tape
edge<00:01:01.960> should<00:01:02.320> bring<00:01:02.559> up<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.829> edge<00:01:02.949> of<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
edge should bring up the edge of the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:36.290 
edge should bring up the edge of the
metalizer<00:01:03.519> if<00:01:03.730> it's<00:01:03.850> going<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.120> peel<00:01:04.330> off

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.200 

it's<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.330> little<00:01:37.659> bit<00:01:37.780> thinner<00:01:38.200> than<00:01:39.040> regular

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's a little bit thinner than regular

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750 
it's a little bit thinner than regular
plastidip<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.710> metalizer<00:01:42.190> z'<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.490> glossa

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
plastidip the metalizer z' the glossa

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.070 
plastidip the metalizer z' the glossa
fires<00:01:43.090> are<00:01:43.270> all<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.600> be<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.690> little<00:01:43.900> bit

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
fires are all going to be a little bit

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:56.160 
fires are all going to be a little bit
thinner<00:01:44.320> but<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:46.240> peeling<00:01:46.780> up<00:01:54.960> okay<00:01:55.960> guys

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170

thinner but it's peeling up okay guys
now<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.250> wheel<00:01:57.700> after<00:01:58.080> the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
now this is the wheel after the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.940 
now this is the wheel after the
metalizer<00:01:59.530> as<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:01.030> can<00:02:01.180> see<00:02:01.360> there's<00:02:01.570> no

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
metalizer as you can see there's no

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.290 
metalizer as you can see there's no
color<00:02:02.950> left<00:02:03.220> over<00:02:03.580> there's<00:02:03.789> no<00:02:03.940> residue

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300

color left over there's no residue
there's<00:02:04.630> no<00:02:04.780> metal<00:02:04.960> flake<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.530> came<00:02:05.710> off<00:02:05.890> just

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
there's no metal flake it came off just

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.419 
there's no metal flake it came off just
as<00:02:06.280> easily<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:06.789> regular<00:02:07.690> Plasti<00:02:08.110> Dip<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:09.280> can

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
as easily as regular Plasti Dip you can

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
see the two sides together so metalizer

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.140 
see the two sides together so metalizer
does<00:02:13.769> pull<00:02:14.769> back<00:02:14.950> off<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.310> wheel<00:02:15.459> even<00:02:15.820> on<00:02:16.120> a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
does pull back off the wheel even on a
