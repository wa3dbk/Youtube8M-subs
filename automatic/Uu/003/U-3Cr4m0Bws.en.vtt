00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Hello, welcome to a new one today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.980
 video of her two times that has mine 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.180
 bus lines and cash per reli though as 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.810
 my mum today for a wedding 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.639
 invited 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.170
 you already see the hairstyle ready and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.790
 Although still this video and two parts 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.950
 divided because it is too long for us 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 because I omit none of the explanation 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.320
 want 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 and if we do this first now 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.420
 make a person and tomorrow you will 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 see the make-up and outfit and here 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.859
 she brings herself for a short time 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 this is the finished hairstyle and you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 will also be shown images 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 and if we get it now first 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.570
 do it together and I will get that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.920
 start with hair and you just now 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.300
 First of all, it is stuck because it is not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.850
 out because I have the hair now 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.690
 smoothed are still something 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.969
 unusual 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.430
 now comes the bells with the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.079
 Remington Pearl I have you now 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.350
 times already may I also made this 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.820
 in my own abeba or participated 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.000
 Very large curling iron I think 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.680
 32 centimeters or so I 'm doing now 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.850
 have already started with the lok 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.859
 many will probably ask 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 why I smoothed out again before 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.210
 I have all the normal everyday life and the hair 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.650
 I would not be so straining now 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.150
 Do not blind it but just 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 try to make the notes directly there 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 but they have very freaky choices and there 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.549
 If the occasion would be a break, then 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.799
 I recommend to flatten and 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.299
 so for example the light association 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.320
 to do that with it all 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.930
 bit believe it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 I'm doing a whole updo 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.990
 really only very short and easy 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.009
 We also do not have to shake waves and how 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.299
 look neat 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.590
 it's just that the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.630
 updo a bit more 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.409
 has volume 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.670
 I should collapse if you 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.500
 then you want to have a more detailed tutorial 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.600
 I link you a card in the end 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.250
 video where I with the curling iron here 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.539
 and then you can 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.740
 just stop by 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:49.119
 I would have is to fix the whole 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.119
 just your favorite hairspray and 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.069
 then you can match so plugged in 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.509
 lichens look forward to a farm 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.340
 and although that is down here 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.530
 calculated, therefore, I lower part 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.439
 you are already a part of the back 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.880
 not to be braided 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.500
 So I share first part of the first 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.780
 later then copied so that the whole 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.890
 a little more volume has 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.430
 I just do it with a whole 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.349
 normal next, I'll start 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.000
 up here with a farm and the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.310
 strands that can look out later 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.440
 you also later out to fill 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.269
 and here just the normal 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.290
 wall surfaces first in three parts 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.519
 divided and you should 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.769
 decide whether on top of each other or 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.030
 want to braid with each other because that 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.380
 Of course, then does not see subordinate 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.720
 I decide now for the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.260
 Apartment Longer variant and bad 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.260
 down around 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.360
 ireland simply craves the end 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.360
 normal down or asphalt to braid 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.390
 I do it all with such a small one 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.130
 hair tie firmly and I think that is 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.570
 Simply the best way to do that 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.920
 also does not see and best people the 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.890
 because we really have space in the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.510
 own hair color so the whole approach 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.220
 here has a little piece of the flower 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.110
 we will start copying here 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.520
 here is still to add 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.080
 By doing so I have forgotten 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.300
 I film that on the other side 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.440
 exactly symmetrical also a farmer's head 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.440
 down have braided 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.659
 copy two properties it is 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.010
 really so we do not have too much 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.459
 Do that when you are all the time 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.629
 until the approach is used 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.280
 below there is the approach 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.049
 then it just gets tight 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.030
 volume has no dream but 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.579
 just got knotted and therefore 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.260
 rather easy down not too 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.010
 a lot of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.189
 and then with a bit of hairspray 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.109
 fix 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.639
 Now jan euro will just do that 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.920
 let hair fall forward 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.209
 so it just dries properly and 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.209
 not directly smooth again 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.910
 Actually, I would not be down here 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.590
 but by copying that came from 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.000
 the small village crates coming in here 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.710
 I would recommend you the approach 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.250
 easy to copy so he just came 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.740
 a little better if the whole thing 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.350
 now comes back to you then missing 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.350
 this nice joke 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.779
 I have it all here in aix now 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.729
 Forming facebook with it all 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:55.900
 really nice is pay attention 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.150
 that the cover sheet if you have too few 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.949
 I recommend you hair such hair 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.930
 pillow or a donut depending on 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.219
 which shape that has me now 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.589
 decided for such a straight pillow 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.139
 These boxes with this can exist 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:10.150
 also there and m or dm and indeed 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.949
 I stick this over the cross 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.499
 if it is not fixed in this case 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.330
 you should be enough to fight this 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.309
 somehow still try with bobby pins 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.930
 to stick to it 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:21.460
 It's really real on a day like this 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.479
 very important that the hairstyle is easy 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.669
 holds bombs 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.710
 Next, the hair with a 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.930
 we'll see soon 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.610
 hair pillows wrapped and hair 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.039
 can you then with bobby pins or with 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.199
 attach hairpins depending on what 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.990
 you love working or what just in 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.849
 the respective hair holds better around now 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.699
 Just comment to my shaking too 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.680
 Avoid, I tell you, just go 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.569
 I somehow have a shiver in mine 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.270
 hands and that unfortunately was not 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.949
 figured out why that is 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.960
 Me too, unfortunately, but not you 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.819
 just have to learn to live with it 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.889
 it is not always funny 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.689
 there and in this case I do not even have 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.160
 noticed that I am a shivering sun 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.110
 even now in this video 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.660
 yes, as you can see you can now 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.820
 put single strands and if 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.890
 it would be smaller I would you 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.720
 mpn bobby pins to used is great 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.060
 that we just put the whole in that 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.590
 can put crises and that way 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.590
 just keeps much better 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:28.349
 the last step is then the loose ones 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:30.180
 Area pool if you are here and a word 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:34.259
 to wrap and fasten here and there 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.300
 so that you really did not use anything 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.509
 again too many bobby patton as too 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.509
 paralyze 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.719
 so it is from the beginning and up 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.389
 Although you should be here again 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:22.240
 try small bull steel or the 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:24.780
 funny rausgucken just with it again 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.420
 to fix small bobby pins sideways 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.150
 important is simply the both 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:33.540
 Politicians have it all easy 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.430
 not so noticeable as me 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.050
 Forget about the guy's name 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.690
 I forgot the first part 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.460
 here again 23 photos why then 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.260
 I look forward very much hope that you 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.540
 that was for like and that was once 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.889
 what else if you have more videos with you 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.419
 My mom wants to see me then 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:50.220
 but really like a thumbs up 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:52.230
 this video and here in the endart 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.970
 I link again that left 

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.060
 lure tutorial with the remington 

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.919
 curling iron and then right as soon as 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.050

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:03.270
 link to the second video follow 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.950
 if you do not see it until tomorrow 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.930
 next video can wait then we 

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.030

 on twitter and otherwise will be 

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.340
 Have a very nice day until then 

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.340
 bye
