00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 here with the genii rodrigues that goes 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.179
 to teach a super different pie to the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.309
 People are all very well dudÃ© and hygiene of the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.980
 where this pie this recipe that pie 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.039
 vegetable that is different from what I'm 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.480
 used to seeing that pie is happened 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.560
 so a chance in a government house 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.359
 Chechen, huh? 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.150
 sometimes we work ever 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 amount of food is many 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.750
 people is not is who I am not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 money will not depend on each case 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.620
 it happens that one ingredient is missing or 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 a problem with the supplier not being 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 traveled the same as creating have to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.190
 create and that's what happened to us 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.360
 on the pitch coming out of a den for diego 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.710
 I saw myself in an innovator still put a 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 cap of a charm you do not look the forrÃ³ and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.420
 Here we start the mass by 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.320
 mass finally what you do first 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.899
 first I'll put word of mouth 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 flours that needed to pick lili spoon 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.689
 forgets 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.810
 first we will put the flour one 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.040
 whole egg two spoons well filled with 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 I like margarine and one of boron 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.100
 little sugar because it gets 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.189
 so she becomes a fan of a mass of 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:35.070
 tortilla east understands different then 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:36.600
 champion cement and then I'll bet the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.509
 sugar, right? 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:47.850
 together for love of the same mass 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:52.290
 everything has to be done by always messing around 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.189
 love well and then form a 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.469
 with the dough molding in the form 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.750
 Why drill the dough for a little more 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.390
 of lightness it loosens more it seems 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.540
 ruled by oven 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.819
 let her last a little tact she stays 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.810

 from solver until it looks like a 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.950
 then turn off after the dough has
