00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello to everyone then in this I see 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.080
 I will turn how I comb my hair 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.849
 curls ok 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 what is the problem first of all 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.130
 curly hair tends to me 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 especially if you do not frizzy 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.630
 look now to be a little frizzy 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.970
 on the tips and also on the lengths 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.439
 then what is usually done for non 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.790
 to give frizz 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:42.120
 ok it is usually advisable from hair 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.000
 wet now in short a thousand bathroom a little 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.739
 I'm always a bit unruly 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.739
 curly hair ball 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:59.480
 put on some gel but for me it dirty them 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:06.230
 a little too much so I usually do n't 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:10.370
 never put foam or ok puts 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.310
 the like but my case that or this 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.250
 length of hair that will be lengthened 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:27.750
 of 10 cm 12 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:30.710
 need a little light of this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.710
 size 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.730
 then we go to distribute the hair and 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.730
 the product 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:53.540
 well and the hands have to move 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:57.860
 chewing the curl on the hat 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.860
 go like that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.629
 already look at how to take form 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:17.310
 even at the base there is just touching the 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.860
 head more forcing in this case not 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 serves are normal or always serves 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.890
 a speaker because a food hour why 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.349
 the diffuser allows you to move the 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.849
 the area differently 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:35.849
 ok not going to move the hat in 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:40.519
 direction in which the appearance is not 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.220
 move it dries slowly slowly 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.940
 different in this wet salesman 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.940
 previously therefore 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:28.110
 it's not easy to comb your hair looking at 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.480
 contrary in a webcam then to give him 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.250
 a bit of a messy effect 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:39.590
 we can increasingly return slightly 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.590
 with your fingers and take the hair 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.540
 and we're not there 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.540
 a little, not like that 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.160
 because the curl hat is always 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.160
 nice with the volume 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.730
 so it's not true that one in the hat 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.890
 curl and should not be treated does not go 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.890
 molded is absolutely not true 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.090
 also because it is a very rebellious hat 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.590
 here it is 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.320
 we look natural 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.100
 but not broken up and not frizzy 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.520
 and then after having done everything gradually 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.970
 hat will increasingly take his 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:22.930
 natural movement and will always be better 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:26.130
 ok always something that comes esizione 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.130
 always by the wind, you sea 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.560
 I hope this tutorial has been there 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.250
 useful to me certainly I have a little 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.250
 worsted 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:48.769
 and I thank you all also 

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:51.089
 those who write comments a little 

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:56.639
 offensive because I enjoy it so much 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:59.429
 to answer is when then machinery 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.009
 I'm not doing it often doing tutorials 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:03.809
 but as you can see I sometimes make a video 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.309
 what I do one I do three in a row 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:12.059
 if it depends I thank you you are always 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:15.769
 more and no more greeting and to the next 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:15.769
