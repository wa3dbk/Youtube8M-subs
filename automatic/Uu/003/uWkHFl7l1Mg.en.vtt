you're<00:01:35.100> using<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.850> coarse<00:01:36.180> crime

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you're using a very very coarse crime

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
you're using a very very coarse crime
you're<00:01:36.840> trying<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.590> an<00:01:37.680> espresso

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you're trying to put it in an espresso

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
you're trying to put it in an espresso
machine<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:39.570> weak

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
machine you're going to get a very weak

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.870 
machine you're going to get a very weak
coffee<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> key<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:43.310> coffee<00:01:44.310> grinding

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
coffee so the key to a coffee grinding

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.139 
coffee so the key to a coffee grinding
is<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.829> match<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.189> fineness<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
is to match the fineness with the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.120 
is to match the fineness with the
brewing<00:01:48.509> method<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.110> also<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.920> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
brewing method and also you want a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.170 
brewing method and also you want a
uniform<00:01:50.670> coffee<00:01:51.299> grind<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.100> want<00:01:53.340> some

uniform coffee grind you don't want some

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
uniform coffee grind you don't want some
large<00:01:54.450> pieces<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.409> some<00:01:55.649> coffee<00:01:55.890> dust

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
large pieces and then some coffee dust

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.580 
large pieces and then some coffee dust
mixed<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.360> you're<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.439> getting

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
mixed in because you're not getting

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.399 
mixed in because you're not getting
consistency<00:01:59.430> within<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.850> beans<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:01.049> here

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
consistency within the beans so here

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
taste with your coffee beans because

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.990 
taste with your coffee beans because
that<00:02:28.810> those<00:02:28.989> are<00:02:29.140> being<00:02:29.290> released<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:30.310> rotates

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
that those are being released it rotates

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.680 
that those are being released it rotates
at<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.209> very<00:02:31.510> low<00:02:31.810> speed<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.620> under<00:02:33.160> 500<00:02:33.850> rpms

at a very low speed of under 500 rpms

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.949 
at a very low speed of under 500 rpms
and<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.980> reason<00:02:36.459> why<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.180> slower<00:02:37.690> is

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
and the reason why it's that slower is

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.470 
and the reason why it's that slower is
so<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.230> have<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.430> reduce<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:40.000> frictional

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
so you have you reduce the frictional

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.440 
so you have you reduce the frictional
heat<00:02:40.840> caused<00:02:41.230> exerted<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.370> those<00:02:42.640> beans<00:02:43.030> which

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
heat caused exerted on those beans which

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.520 
heat caused exerted on those beans which
retains<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.830> aroma<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.730> beans<00:02:46.530> this

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
retains the aroma of the beans this

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.470 
retains the aroma of the beans this

500 the 20,000 to 30,000 rpm actually

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.229 
500 the 20,000 to 30,000 rpm actually
warms<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.440> coffee<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.220> there's<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.000> lot<00:03:52.209> of

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
warms the coffee and there's a lot of

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.240 
warms the coffee and there's a lot of
frictional<00:03:52.750> heat<00:03:53.079> that's<00:03:53.320> released<00:03:53.590> into<00:03:54.160> the

frictional heat that's released into the
beans<00:03:54.459> which<00:03:54.820> also<00:03:55.329> reduces<00:03:56.049> some<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.260> the

beans which also reduces some of the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.580 
beans which also reduces some of the
aroma<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.190> flavor<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.959> comes<00:03:59.170> from<00:03:59.410> the

aroma and the flavor that comes from the
beans<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:01.209> one<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.680> main<00:04:02.950> concern<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.700> have

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
beans the one the main concern I have

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.120 
beans the one the main concern I have
with<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.940> can't<00:04:07.299> really<00:04:07.420> control

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
with this is a you can't really control

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.870 
with this is a you can't really control
the<00:04:09.130> size<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.359> grind<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:11.650> also<00:04:12.549> it's<00:04:12.730> not

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
the size of the grind and also it's not

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.780 
the size of the grind and also it's not
uniform<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:14.739> think<00:04:15.010> okay<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.370> can<00:04:15.700> get

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
uniform so you think okay I can get

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.280 
uniform so you think okay I can get
coarser<00:04:16.239> grind<00:04:16.450> I'm<00:04:16.690> just<00:04:16.870> going<00:04:17.019> to

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
all set a couple of times we'll quickly

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.180 
all set a couple of times we'll quickly
find<00:04:19.810> out<00:04:20.050> you're<00:04:20.470> going<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.860> some

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
find out you're going to have some

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.520 
find out you're going to have some
coffee<00:04:21.400> dust<00:04:21.820> mixed<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.390> with<00:04:22.600> some<00:04:22.660> beans

coffee dust mixed in with some beans

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.830 
coffee dust mixed in with some beans
that<00:04:23.770> maybe<00:04:24.070> have<00:04:24.280> been<00:04:24.310> cut<00:04:24.670> in<00:04:24.700> half<00:04:25.030> or<00:04:25.270> 1/4

that maybe have been cut in half or 1/4

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.110 
that maybe have been cut in half or 1/4
so<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:27.010> inconsistent<00:04:27.430> they're<00:04:27.940> not

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
so it's inconsistent they're not

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.590 
so it's inconsistent they're not
uniformed<00:04:28.750> coffee<00:04:28.990> beans<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:30.340> are<00:04:30.600> brought
