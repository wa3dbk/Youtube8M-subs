trim<00:00:45.030> control<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.510> EVC<00:00:45.989> you've<00:00:46.170> got<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
trim control with EVC you've got the

trim control with EVC you've got the
standard<00:00:46.890> trim<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.180> engine<00:00:48.450> control<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
standard trim on your engine control so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.119 
standard trim on your engine control so
you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.020> operate<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.680> thumb<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you can operate it with your thumb you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.950 
you can operate it with your thumb you
also<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.730> individual<00:00:51.329> trim<00:00:51.539> controls<00:00:51.870> just

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
also have individual trim controls just

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.799 
also have individual trim controls just
forward<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.120> counter<00:00:54.420> uneven

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
forward here so you can counter uneven

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
forward here so you can counter uneven
distribution<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> weight<00:00:55.590> perhaps<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.969> EBC

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
distribution of weight perhaps but EBC

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.580 
distribution of weight perhaps but EBC
does<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> lot<00:00:57.719> more<00:00:57.780> than<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.260> sometimes

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
does a lot more than that sometimes

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.069 
does a lot more than that sometimes
people<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.100> trouble<00:01:00.059> controlling<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.899> trim

you on the back of the engine control is
a<00:01:06.450> trim<00:01:06.810> assist<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.950> sets<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.939> EVC<00:01:09.270> into

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
a trim assist and that sets the EVC into

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.289 
a trim assist and that sets the EVC into
the<00:01:10.110> automatic<00:01:10.470> trim<00:01:10.830> mode<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
means as an operator is that as you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.310 
means as an operator is that as you
bring<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.640> power<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> boat<00:01:15.960> starts

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
coming up the EVC will automatically

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
coming up the EVC will automatically
adjust<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> trim<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> boat<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> you

adjust the trim of the boat for you you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
adjust the trim of the boat for you you
don't<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> worry<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.770> what

becomes<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.340> dominant<00:02:47.519> lever<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.209> now<00:02:48.420> that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
becomes the dominant lever and now that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.390 
becomes the dominant lever and now that
will<00:02:48.900> control<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.349> boat<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.739> both<00:02:50.010> engines

will control the boat and both engines

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.220 
will control the boat and both engines
will<00:02:50.549> be<00:02:50.579> synchronized<00:02:51.180> with<00:02:51.359> that<00:02:51.720> one<00:02:51.959> lever

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
will be synchronized with that one lever

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.179 
will be synchronized with that one lever
the<00:02:52.739> other<00:02:52.859> one<00:02:53.069> does<00:02:53.670> nothing<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.920> say<00:02:56.129> you
