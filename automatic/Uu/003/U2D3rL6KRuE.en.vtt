show<00:00:44.579> icon<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.660> some<00:00:45.899> banner

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
show icon and then you have some banner

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
show icon and then you have some banner
height<00:00:46.440> adjustments<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.280> speed<00:00:47.820> adjustments

and duration adjustments they're done by
means<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.940> sliders<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.809> banner

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
means of sliders so there's banner

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
scrolling banners and then of course

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
scrolling banners and then of course
scroll<00:00:59.129> speed<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.820> we'll<00:01:00.180> adjust<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
scroll speed and we'll adjust that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240 
scroll speed and we'll adjust that
scroll<00:01:01.140> speed<00:01:01.350> later<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.800> show<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> how<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
scroll speed later to show you how that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
scroll speed later to show you how that
works<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> top<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.110> you'll

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
works out but at the top here you'll

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.190 
works out but at the top here you'll
notice<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.129> show<00:01:05.880> title<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
notice that's the show title I have that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.050 
notice that's the show title I have that
disabled<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.340> feel<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> have

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
disabled because I feel like if you have

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
disabled because I feel like if you have
the<00:01:09.240> title<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> icon<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.590> sort<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the title and the icon it's sort of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740 
the title and the icon it's sort of
redundant<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.549> mean<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.600> either

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
redundant I mean you know it's either

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.140 
redundant I mean you know it's either
the<00:01:13.020> title<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> icon<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.850> both

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the title of the icon you can get both

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
the title of the icon you can get both
if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> want<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.619> seems

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
if you want to do that but it just seems

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
if you want to do that but it just seems
like<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.549> title<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.180> unnecessary<00:01:18.810> just

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like the title is unnecessary just

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
like the title is unnecessary just
having<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.560> big<00:01:19.740> title<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.310> takes<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
having that big title there takes up a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
having that big title there takes up a
lot<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> space<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.930> could<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.409> used<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
lot of space that could be used for

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
lot of space that could be used for
displaying<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> banner<00:01:23.820> notification<00:01:24.540> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
displaying the banner notification so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
displaying the banner notification so
for<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.560> reason<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.220> use<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> icon

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
for that reason I just use the icon

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
for that reason I just use the icon
because<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.600> easily<00:01:27.840> identify<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.829> app

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
because you can easily identify what app

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.149 
because you can easily identify what app
it<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> by<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> icon<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.860> if

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it is by the icon just like that so if

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
it is by the icon just like that so if
you<00:01:32.310> change<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.970> settings<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.509> tiny<00:01:33.810> bar

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
you change the settings in tiny bar

other settings here let's change the
scrolling<00:01:46.439> speed<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.490> how<00:01:47.939> much

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
scrolling speed and you can see how much

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.780 
scrolling speed and you can see how much
faster<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> scrolling<00:01:49.170> speed<00:01:49.310> goes<00:01:50.310> with

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
faster the scrolling speed goes with

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.730 
faster the scrolling speed goes with
that<00:01:51.000> turned<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that turned up just like that so you

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.770 
that turned up just like that so you
really<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> keep<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:53.970> eyes<00:01:54.149> peeled<00:01:54.600> on

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
really have to keep your eyes peeled on

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.209 
really have to keep your eyes peeled on
your<00:01:54.899> banner<00:01:55.049> notifications<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.040> that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
your banner notifications with that

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.580 
your banner notifications with that
scrolling<00:01:56.610> speed<00:01:56.729> cranked<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> but

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
scrolling speed cranked up like that but

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.350 
scrolling speed cranked up like that but
I<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.979> how<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.189> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> slows<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.119> when

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
I do like how it kind of slows down when

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.700 
I do like how it kind of slows down when
he<00:02:00.450> gets<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> beginning<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
he gets to the beginning of the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.550 
he gets to the beginning of the
notification<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:02.969> nice<00:02:03.180> effect

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
notification that is a very nice effect

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.810 
notification that is a very nice effect

works<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:22.450> well<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.379> very

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
I did notice that the text seems a

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.399 
I did notice that the text seems a
little<00:02:27.700> low<00:02:28.299> resolution<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.049> don't<00:02:29.230> know<00:02:29.319> if

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
little low resolution I don't know if

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.199 
little low resolution I don't know if
it's<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.680> me<00:02:29.920> or<00:02:29.950> what<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.970> doesn't

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
it's just me or what but it just doesn't

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.149 
it's just me or what but it just doesn't
seem<00:02:31.360> fully<00:02:31.870> retina<00:02:32.409> it<00:02:32.530> doesn't<00:02:32.799> seem<00:02:32.980> like

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
seem fully retina it doesn't seem like

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.190 
seem fully retina it doesn't seem like
it's<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.849> know<00:02:33.879> non-retina<00:02:34.599> but<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:34.989> just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
it's you know non-retina but it just

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.410 
it's you know non-retina but it just
doesn't<00:02:35.560> seem<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:35.739> full<00:02:36.129> retina<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.760> that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
doesn't seem like full retina and that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.149 
doesn't seem like full retina and that
may<00:02:37.569> have<00:02:37.840> something<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.319> do<00:02:38.500> with<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.920> how

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
may have something to do with just how
