00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.310
 hello friends welcome to another video 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.040
 tutorial of diva argentina 2013 all 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.950
 for our windows 8 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.820
 in this opportunity we will see a little 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:36.650
 new options final windows 8 to 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.940
 moment of wanting to copy some file 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.870
 failing to move me here in the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.329
 desk I have the file made of the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.720
 decade 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.600
 28 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.240
 because I chose this file now because 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 it is quite heavy then it does not give time 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.830
 with more the possibility to visualize 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 this new option since it will not be copied 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.920
 quickly to another and another folder of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.229
 our computer 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.180
 I will give him the right button and I will put him 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.180
 the option to copy to the folder 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.680
 we will look for the folder 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.980
 in this case we will go to library 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.440
 documents to my document I will not give 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.140
 copy 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.610
 and as you can see, a window will open in the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.610
 which will we have the possibility 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 again windows 8 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.630
 to pause the transfer and the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 file or failing to delete it ok 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.870
 now 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.870
 we will copy this file again 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.009
 and copy it to another destination like this 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.740
 we will see the new option I will pass it to 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.740
 images we will give you copy 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.270
 and now we wait a few seconds 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.270
 will give the possibility of having both 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.270
 options 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.260
 As you can see, everything opens up in the same 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:27.010
 Window opens all in one 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.420
 window where it provides us with 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.540
 percentage of the speed of 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.800
 transfer of this file if we put 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.800
 less detail 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:46.050
 will show us the window on its way more 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.630
 simple as you see with the progress line 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.250
 and it will give us the percentage that is being 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.250
 completing the download 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.110
 now we will go back to details and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.630
 As you can see, if you pay attention, you will see that 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.610
 the transfer percentage of the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.970
 files when we're going over 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.620
 one file at a time is about 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.069
 balance at a certain moment 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.610
 try to balance yourself because if we give it 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.209
 pause one of the files the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.569
 we stop momentarily puts in a 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.810
 color more yellow and as we see the 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.260
 second file begins to take its 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.299
 maximum speed 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.439
 the transfer speed of the 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.500
 files in windows 8 is very very good and 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:43.180
 the move is also very very good 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.810
 now we will give you the start again 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.390
 to the file that we had stopped 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.469
 partially and good and we see that the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.080
 speeds 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:57.650
 basically they are balanced 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.210
 that is, it is as if it were a regulator and 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.000
 good is the new option that 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:07.500
 we will have in our 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.940
 windows windows 8 at the time of copying 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.940
 files or pass files from a part 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.980
 from one partition for example to another or from 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.350
 one folder to another without any kind of 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.750
 problem or novelty is that good is 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.730
 opens only a single window is divided 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.040
 with the amount of files that we are 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.740
 thinking that moment and good to me 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.729
 criterion of this option is 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.949
 a point a like to windows 8 because 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:45.319
 good on this occasion this new option 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.470
 it has not undergone very great changes but 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:50.380
 has had a better good friends I hope 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.180
 that you liked this video tutorial 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.020
 and that good little by little we will go 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.690
 knowing this new windows 8 so much 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.520
 you like me a big hug to all and 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.520
 we'll see you in a next video tutorial
