00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.650
 welcome ladies and gentlemen we are new again 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.879
 cambuur motor for me is the last one 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.099
 to the last two girls from 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.480
 December nerd to do windows and how 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.540
 I want to do it is just like mark 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 the young this is deal is just suggestions 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.740
 come in remarks or short list of 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.180
 and them this just like that transfer fee 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.859
 with you had the mini of the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.449
 removed from the shortlist 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.560
 and then people just let what they see 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.000
 loved it and I think so too 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.529
 in that way it also makes a difference 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.529
 those little screens against in between 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.789
 and just see it all at once 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.199
 will be the last matches I go on 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.969
 filters should i go all want in between 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.380
 do because it's fun, you know you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.760
 stuff even easier is purely good 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.040
 matches through the stays in a good one 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.780
 form in which they can take more money faster 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 make efset put and then make 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.180
 it just nicer and wooden through 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.890
 interesting 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.539
 I take for both you and for you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.180
 me and that's the most important thing about it 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.680
 this try motion of first game 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.570
 surprise nickel against groningen 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 easy close groningen 112 minutes 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.079
 I'll be loved in the first grade 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.250
 two chance of the match so I broke 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 easily add those chronic 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.770
 defenses 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.739
 so really not normal i speak i play 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300
 this match in a 442 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.979
 with such a diamond in midfield in time 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.330
 and know twiter in the English term there 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.130
 today 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.500
 and that went to surprisingly good like that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.200
 i use i pull the counter and that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.960
 really works so well that really fantastic 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.450
 I had so few words for all the time 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 click ball take now also right mulu 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.869
 man narsingh 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.549
 and this is really one of the seeks de 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.950
 scripts that I have drawn in this 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.920
 year or four five pants look how 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.600
 he pulls hard machine wing 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.280
 explains because their gestures here on any score 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 then of course captain demanded you too 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.759
 nowadays i have a first you have to 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 to adjust really fascinates me 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.860
 few 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.200
 but this is of course a delicious one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.040
 rest and assist of narsingh on earth 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.420
 ryon 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 and they stand another three and that is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 in the first half all that gives 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 from little to how easy I am talking about 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.860
 indians had been broken and you 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.689
 wanted I actually wanted a heel 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.890
 here it does n't work but you by the way 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.649
 just know what goes in such a situation 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.149
 happen that automatically becomes i40 and me 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.250
 wants to do that by the way not even about the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.469
 gameplay i wanted to talk about psv yesterday 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.040
 I have psv the healthy worthy there 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.340
 is watching 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.110
 and i must honestly say as an ajacied 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.620
 do not add a photo of here 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.360
 for some 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.140
 I quickly psv in times not so good 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.220
 considering the pye and bakkali where real 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.400
 fantastic just like the mickey mouse ears 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.420
 snap really good or the complete that not 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.130
 normal 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.560
 kind did not have much to do so 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.410
 I don't have a god to say about that 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.580
 But just defense PPP blood pressure 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.380
 at bottom and mattress 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.940
 basically everyone should have scored 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.980
 of course had in the first half on 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.390
 Rome to be honest then 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.850
 is said but not cool of the pyes 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.100
 really from absolute class that is real 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.570
 fantastic to see 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.430
 great though from out of nowhere 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.080
 exactly on psv and she needed them 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.420
 had been around as long as we had to deal with 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.200
 awesome is a great opportunity with another 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.810
 mr chance 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.250
 Bakkali played very fresh down sets 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.020
 the second or even less a being that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.520
 can of course the 17 by bit that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.920
 moment endurance of that kind 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.350
 things but they both show a lot 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.580
 potency is what the very strong and i think 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.000
 not a playful champion this year 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.680
 is becoming 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.810
 I think the team for that too 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.880
 is young and therefore not yet too 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.410
 Being able to perform consistently is certainly not 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.060
 shame of course where i do like this 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.470
 team on lk come in and then bad 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.330
 young had been together for so long 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.810
 able to remain individually well able 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.400
 grow and work on each other than me 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.850
 see the year after that best for contender 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.560
 for the title 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.000
 and that can be seen of course 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.620
 what that makes it more exciting 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.330
 for every fierce for mumps and to go to the 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.340
 Premier League 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.570
 so hopefully they can psv next week 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.850
 finish the job and we have two 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.230
 dutch clubs in the chompy sleek and 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.060
 it also became only too favorable 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.940
 wrist so they might both be 9 for it 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.370
 furthermore, good ship in europe 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.420
 joker by psb and the brochure almost 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.670
 never say because it was just real 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.780
 it looks really tight 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.540
 which is said to be for the language 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.820
 extremely weak zalegem waregem 'like this 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.310
 team on a walk to champion shoe 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.410
 in Belgium than to Belgian football 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.170
 really a joke to make this look so embarrassing 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.489
 his showed really ridiculous 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.769
 brother of that gaza this can not 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.000
 go matter well i don't know where that you are 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.239
 wasted but I have him number 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.980
 considering it is really very bad but good 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.600
 PC and of course all compliments good 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.000
 performance and next week just go 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.280
 and I finish it in this one 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.750
 match it's really that easy here 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.350
 and everywhere that could be half and bakkali 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.300
 delicious of course 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.650
 he is also a meeting place grown faith 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.000
 I might be in next time 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.430
 shot report to 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.740
 you can see it all 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.960
 well this or winter the mucus comes alave 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.130
 between players behind that is maybe 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.660
 can buy or 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.180
 players you can trade for paul 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.280
 players as you enter the correct responses 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.710
 Someone chips him so I know which one we have 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.000
 players with them like to see them 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.410
 makes it easy for me and then go 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.720
 I do it as I start from 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.770
