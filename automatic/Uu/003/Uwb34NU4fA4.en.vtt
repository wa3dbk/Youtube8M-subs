00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
hi guys today we're going to be working

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.920 
hi guys today we're going to be working
on<00:00:14.600> this<00:00:14.720> blue<00:00:15.080> and<00:00:15.320> gold<00:00:15.680> water<00:00:16.010> marble

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
on this blue and gold water marble

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.920 
on this blue and gold water marble
and<00:00:17.020> I<00:00:17.770> actually<00:00:18.039> did<00:00:18.520> this<00:00:18.730> design<00:00:19.090> on<00:00:19.390> top<00:00:19.689> of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
and I actually did this design on top of

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.830 
and I actually did this design on top of
my<00:00:20.050> current<00:00:20.500> mana<00:00:20.710> care<00:00:21.070> which<00:00:21.849> was<00:00:22.119> orally

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
my current mana care which was orally

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.569 
my current mana care which was orally
Royal<00:00:23.170> Navy<00:00:23.529> and<00:00:23.949> I<00:00:24.849> just<00:00:25.150> made<00:00:25.360> sure<00:00:25.390> to

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
Royal Navy and I just made sure to

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.939 
Royal Navy and I just made sure to
really<00:00:27.579> get<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:27.910> nail<00:00:28.090> clean<00:00:28.509> wash<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:29.800> dry

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
really get the nail clean wash and dry

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.299 
really get the nail clean wash and dry
completely<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.849> then<00:00:31.290> even<00:00:32.290> soap<00:00:32.770> can<00:00:33.129> leave

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
completely and then even soap can leave

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.689 
completely and then even soap can leave
residue<00:00:33.820> so<00:00:34.150> I<00:00:34.180> would<00:00:34.510> suggest<00:00:35.580> cleaning<00:00:36.580> your

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
residue so I would suggest cleaning your

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.939 
residue so I would suggest cleaning your
nail<00:00:36.879> with<00:00:37.150> like<00:00:37.480> some<00:00:37.720> alcohol<00:00:38.290> or<00:00:38.739> even

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
nail with like some alcohol or even

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.280 
nail with like some alcohol or even
vinegar<00:00:39.550> just<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.510> make<00:00:40.629> sure<00:00:40.660> there's<00:00:41.050> no

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
vinegar just to make sure there's no

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.990 
vinegar just to make sure there's no
residue<00:00:41.800> on<00:00:41.949> there<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.339> would<00:00:42.489> prevent<00:00:42.820> the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
residue on there that would prevent the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.470 
residue on there that would prevent the
nail<00:00:43.150> polish<00:00:43.629> from<00:00:43.900> sticking<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:46.000> gold<00:00:46.300> I'm

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
and the clear that I'm using is Sally

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.229 
and the clear that I'm using is Sally
Hansen<00:00:52.449> invisible<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.879> can<00:00:55.000> probably

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
Hansen invisible and you can probably

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.060 
Hansen invisible and you can probably
tell<00:00:55.420> they<00:00:55.839> don't<00:00:55.960> work<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.379> best<00:00:56.619> together

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
tell they don't work the best together

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.630 
tell they don't work the best together
in<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.339> water

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.399 

in<00:01:00.640> fact<00:01:00.909> right<00:01:01.180> there<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.689> clear<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.110> kind<00:01:02.320> of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
in fact right there the clear is kind of

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.520 
in fact right there the clear is kind of
just<00:01:02.619> sitting<00:01:02.949> on<00:01:03.040> top<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.510> if<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.839> kind<00:01:05.470> of

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
just sitting on top but if you kind of

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.740 
just sitting on top but if you kind of
poke<00:01:05.770> through<00:01:06.189> with<00:01:06.820> your<00:01:06.970> orange<00:01:07.299> stick<00:01:07.390> you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
poke through with your orange stick you

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.910 
poke through with your orange stick you
can<00:01:07.900> see<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.170> helps<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.619> to<00:01:08.740> spread<00:01:09.040> out<00:01:09.189> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
can see it helps it to spread out and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.770 
can see it helps it to spread out and
I'm<00:01:11.920> just<00:01:12.159> going<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.400> add<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.090> couple<00:01:13.510> more

touch you can see this is already drying
a<00:01:57.010> little<00:01:57.220> bit<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:59.400> making<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.549> more

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
a little bit and making it more

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.399 
a little bit and making it more
difficult<00:02:01.000> but<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.510> really<00:02:05.110> light

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
difficult but just is a really light

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.359

quite as important with this one because
there's<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.189> clear<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.700> that's<00:02:27.879> not<00:02:28.060> going<00:02:28.239> to

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
there's the clear so that's not going to

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.600 
there's the clear so that's not going to
show<00:02:28.389> like<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.959> said<00:02:29.170> I'm<00:02:29.290> kind<00:02:29.499> of<00:02:29.560> going
