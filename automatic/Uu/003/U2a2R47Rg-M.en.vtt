tipping it in one end and as the grader
turns<00:00:24.839> small<00:00:25.829> stuff<00:00:26.189> that's<00:00:26.579> too<00:00:26.789> small<00:00:26.999> falls

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
sandy might have picked up in the shovel

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.080 
sandy might have picked up in the shovel
and<00:00:32.210> at<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> other<00:00:33.510> end<00:00:33.660> Chris<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:35.090> sorting

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and at the other end Chris is sorting

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.410 
and at the other end Chris is sorting
having<00:00:36.539> a<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.750> through<00:00:37.109> to<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:38.089> all<00:00:39.089> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
having a look through to see if all the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.900 
having a look through to see if all the
charcoal<00:00:39.839> is<00:00:40.079> actually<00:00:40.679> converted<00:00:41.429> properly

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
charcoal is actually converted properly

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
charcoal is actually converted properly
because<00:00:42.600> we're<00:00:42.929> trying<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.410> avoid<00:00:43.739> anything

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
because we're trying to avoid anything

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.079 
because we're trying to avoid anything
like<00:00:44.929> this<00:00:46.460> coming<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:48.690> bag<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.940> is

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
like this coming in to your bag this is

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.549 
like this coming in to your bag this is
a<00:00:51.120> brown<00:00:51.390> end<00:00:51.719> which<00:00:52.679> looks<00:00:53.249> like<00:00:53.999> charcoal

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
a brown end which looks like charcoal

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.739 
a brown end which looks like charcoal
but<00:00:55.559> hasn't<00:00:55.800> converted<00:00:56.489> fully<00:00:56.940> there's<00:00:57.449> still

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
but hasn't converted fully there's still

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.360 
but hasn't converted fully there's still
wood<00:00:58.019> in<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.730> piece<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.449> charcoal<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
wood in that piece of charcoal so if you

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
wood in that piece of charcoal so if you
were<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.819> put<00:01:02.999> that<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.390> barbecue<00:01:03.680> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
were to put that on your barbecue it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
were to put that on your barbecue it
would<00:01:04.860> burn<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.729> would<00:01:05.970> burn<00:01:06.149> with<00:01:06.329> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
would burn but it would burn with a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
would burn but it would burn with a
flame<00:01:06.600> rather<00:01:07.290> than<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> number

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.789 

I<00:01:19.540> seem<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.570> remember<00:01:20.780> saying<00:01:21.200> look<00:01:21.470> more

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
I seem to remember saying look more

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.590 
I seem to remember saying look more
other<00:01:22.009> stuff<00:01:22.310> under<00:01:22.729> that<00:01:23.000> okay<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:26.570> a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
other stuff under that okay this is a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.440 
other stuff under that okay this is a
bit<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.960> wood<00:01:27.650> tar<00:01:27.979> that<00:01:28.280> has<00:01:28.520> come<00:01:28.880> out<00:01:28.909> well

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
bit of wood tar that has come out well

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.230 
bit of wood tar that has come out well
when<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.930> kilns<00:01:30.229> really<00:01:30.530> hot<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.240> it's

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
when the kilns really hot and it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.109 
when the kilns really hot and it's
burning<00:01:32.750> all<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.490> different<00:01:34.490> elements<00:01:34.729> out

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
burning all the different elements out

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.670 
burning all the different elements out
of<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.509> wood<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:35.869> you're<00:01:36.020> left<00:01:36.170> with<00:01:36.350> pure

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
of the wood so you're left with pure

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.190 
of the wood so you're left with pure
carbon<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.600> quite<00:01:39.590> sticky<00:01:40.220> and

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
carbon and this is quite sticky and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.960 
carbon and this is quite sticky and
quite<00:01:42.200> brittle<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.420> smells<00:01:44.869> bad<00:01:45.670> but<00:01:46.670> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
quite brittle and it smells bad but I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.060 
quite brittle and it smells bad but I
was<00:01:47.750> any<00:01:48.110> bits<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.440> coming<00:01:48.770> down<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:48.950> chute

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
was any bits that coming down the chute

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.410 
was any bits that coming down the chute
like<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.820> don't<00:01:50.000> want<00:01:50.119> them<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.240> your

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
like that you don't want them in your

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.730 
like that you don't want them in your
bag<00:01:50.600> either<00:01:50.810> because<00:01:51.110> they're<00:01:51.259> not<00:01:51.380> actually

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.780 

yeah<00:01:57.819> go<00:01:58.819> down<00:01:59.420> my<00:01:59.720> top
