00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.870
 this little video i would like 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 tell as much as possible from improvised 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.110
 literally from scrap materials 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 make it quite comfortable here 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.980
 easel easel folding 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.030
 for home and not only homework 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.040
 you can take this easel and nature 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.860
 on such a relatively windless day 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.009
 this was albert and i did for my own 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.769
 master classes 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.730
 but in principle they can still be made 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:42.030
 for some school and for studios and the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.890
 similar institutions to understand 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.379
 how easy it is to make such an easel 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.690
 I will say that 12 easels I did in one 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.390
 the day and the next day I painted them 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.449
 that is, the elementary design is already 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.409
 probably hard and come up and so 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.139
 easel has three laths in my 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.829
 case of slats with a cross section of 20 to 30 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:04.110
 millimeters 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.040
 rivers can be found in any building 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.409
 shop in the market in my balcony 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.079
 then the main thing is that the tree was 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.810
 exactly and without knots so as not to lead and 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.390
 Passat rack in my case 140 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.829
 centimeters due only to 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.180
 put a pack of easels show here 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.270
 for home use I recommend 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.789
 take and lath thicker and higher 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.229
 possible up to two meters will be 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.000
 fairly stable reliably and massive 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.710
 need some kind of massiveness 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.179
 after all, 3 slats are attached to the easel 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.119
 here in such a node on the usual 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.090
 long in my case furniture bolt with 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.950
 lamb so that it can be quickly 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.520
 going to just hand and collect and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.590
 disassemble this easel that's how it 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.859
 everything looks like it is disassembled 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.390
 Easel can be removed simply 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.619
 for the closet he is very mobile 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.250
 actually this is what the node itself looks like 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.970
 mounts here these angles have an angle 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.849
 zapilov 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.830
 about 10 degrees but it can be picked up 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.940
 experimentally from this angle will 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.310
 depend on the distance itself below 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.569
 the distance of the lower legs on which 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.670
 distance from each other will be 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.069
 be 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.200
 yes even an important point average rake 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.170
 support should be slightly shorter 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.440
 lateral in my case it's about five 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.239
 centimeters she shorter it gives 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.049
 the correct angle of the easel 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.910
 that's how in my case on the tables 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.390
 painted surface paintings are 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.260
 perpendicular to the look of the painter that 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.639
 most convenient for work that is 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.240
 delivered comfortable enough to draw or 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.640
 so on the side surfaces 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.260
 across the surface of the side rails 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.170
 a hole with a diameter of 6 s is exposed 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.310
 half millimeters at a distance of 7 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.070
 centimeters from each other 7 centimeters 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.900
 this is an optimal distance of 10 lots 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.580
 5 do not recommend 7 centimeters in these 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.430
 holes are inserted like this 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.450
 furniture bolts if you find very 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.550
 conveniently six millimeter diameter on 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.480
 which actually relies itself 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.640
 stretcher picture well or is there some kind 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 an easel that is a tablet can that 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.200
 Any graphics tablet 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.090
 here they are mounted 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.650
 Conveniently enough, that is, it is inserted 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.920
 and due to its carving 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.070
 this bolt does not pop up but to 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.260
 change the height of the thick enough 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.800
 quickly just rearrange them others 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.990
 holes it all fast and enough 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.940
 it is securely fastened when sitting 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.580
 I highly recommend this easel 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.989
 fasten the palette right into this easel 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.230
 in my case the palettes 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.510
 serves as a piece of acrylic glass 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.330
 but it can be any plywood or or 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:27.460
 the same piece of glass just fixed it 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.010
 But in such here are such butterflies with 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.940
 gash 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.100
 being inserted are getting enough 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.440
 reliably by the way if use for 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.470
 easel rake cut more than 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.290
 my case is 20 by 30 millimeters more 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.840
 You can just make a thick gash 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.230
 right in the rail small well up to a centimeter 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.140
 and it will all be 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.680
 less work will be the only way 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.380
 note that here these gashes they 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.950
 perpendicular rails but under this 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.770
 here's a slight angle to actually 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.180
 the surface of the palettes was parallel to the floor 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.130
 that is, so that our paints do not flow down 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.610
 yes and work in this position 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.790
 palettes are very convenient especially for beginners 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.610
 insofar as 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.560
 the palette is located as close as possible to 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.600
 surface painting and paint 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.940
 are near that is very convenient 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.660
 pick their own colorful 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.810
 mixtures 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.720
 they are near lit one 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.050
 source that is recommend 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.700
 such a mount palette here's another 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.590
 small moment to the surface to 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.040
 Tyunig did not slide on the floor 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.930
 or it became possible to drill as in my 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.240
 case 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.370
 hole in the lower legs and butt like me 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.230
 put in just pieces of fuel 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.590
 fuel rubber hose which 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.850
 can be found in any auto shop 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.850
 can something else come up with 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.840
 rubber is that is enough 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:08.390
 reliably stands and the technician on the surface and 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.550
 guarantees from any falls of some kind 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.420
 catastrophes 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.810
 Yes, even this moment is quite convenient with 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.500
 using such crocodile mount 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:25.420
 cup like this in this case for 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:28.580
 thinner or storage brushes 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.560
 that all this was the maximum mobile 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.740
 and compact 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.950
 that's probably all for today I repeat 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.289
 simpler design to come up hard even 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.469
 theoretically with relative 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:48.050
 usability of this kind 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:50.009
 easel that is the design is cheap and 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.040
 functionally relatively 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.600
 functional 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:59.570
 here actually subscribe 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.570
 good wishes everyone good bye
