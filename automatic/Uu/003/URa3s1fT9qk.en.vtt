okay<00:00:01.400> and<00:00:01.640> now<00:00:01.790> I'm<00:00:01.879> going<00:00:01.969> to<00:00:02.030> talk<00:00:02.180> for<00:00:02.389> a

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.480 
okay and now I'm going to talk for a

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.289 
okay and now I'm going to talk for a
second<00:00:02.840> about<00:00:02.870> the<00:00:03.140> fret<00:00:03.380> board<00:00:03.710> and<00:00:04.299> these

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
second about the fret board and these

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.139 
second about the fret board and these
carbon<00:00:05.749> fiber<00:00:05.990> rods<00:00:06.430> these<00:00:07.430> weigh<00:00:07.759> like

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
carbon fiber rods these weigh like

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.740 
carbon fiber rods these weigh like
nothing<00:00:08.690> they're<00:00:08.929> air<00:00:09.200> but<00:00:10.070> on<00:00:10.460> six<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.210> seven

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
nothing they're air but on six and seven

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.780 
nothing they're air but on six and seven
string<00:00:12.049> basis<00:00:12.530> or<00:00:12.710> sometimes<00:00:13.309> if<00:00:13.490> somebody

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
string basis or sometimes if somebody

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.119 
string basis or sometimes if somebody
really<00:00:14.059> says<00:00:14.450> hey<00:00:14.719> I'm<00:00:14.929> on<00:00:15.530> the<00:00:15.650> road<00:00:15.830> a<00:00:15.860> lot

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
really says hey I'm on the road a lot

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.640 
really says hey I'm on the road a lot
and<00:00:16.340> I'm<00:00:16.400> constantly<00:00:16.730> playing<00:00:17.330> in<00:00:17.689> climates

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
and I'm constantly playing in climates

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.890 
and I'm constantly playing in climates
that<00:00:18.859> are<00:00:18.920> rainy<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:19.939> sunny<00:00:20.240> and<00:00:20.480> you<00:00:20.779> know

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
that are rainy and sunny and you know

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
that are rainy and sunny and you know
all<00:00:21.140> over<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.380> place

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
all over the place

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.519 
all over the place
I'll<00:00:22.369> inset<00:00:23.179> a<00:00:23.210> couple<00:00:23.570> of<00:00:23.660> carbon<00:00:23.990> fiber<00:00:24.230> rods

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
I'll inset a couple of carbon fiber rods

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.150 
I'll inset a couple of carbon fiber rods
into<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:24.949> neck<00:00:25.840> for<00:00:26.840> stability<00:00:27.170> because

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
into the neck for stability because

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.679 
into the neck for stability because
obviously<00:00:28.340> they<00:00:29.090> don't<00:00:29.210> they<00:00:29.480> aren't

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
obviously they don't they aren't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.990 
obviously they don't they aren't
affected<00:00:30.230> by<00:00:30.380> moisture<00:00:30.679> content<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.730> they

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
affected by moisture content and they

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.110 
affected by moisture content and they
just<00:00:32.210> make<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:32.689> neck<00:00:32.899> more<00:00:33.170> rigid<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:33.680> strong

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
just make the neck more rigid and strong

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.830 
just make the neck more rigid and strong
so<00:00:35.120> I<00:00:36.280> that's<00:00:37.280> their<00:00:37.879> couple<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.390> them<00:00:38.570> there

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
so I that's their couple of them there

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.020 
so I that's their couple of them there
that<00:00:38.870> are<00:00:39.140> inlaid<00:00:39.469> and<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.430> do<00:00:40.489> that<00:00:40.760> of<00:00:41.000> course

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
that are inlaid and I do that of course

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.440 
that are inlaid and I do that of course
in<00:00:41.510> addition<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.260> truss<00:00:42.469> rod<00:00:43.059> on<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.210> fret

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
in addition to the truss rod on the fret

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.270 
in addition to the truss rod on the fret
board<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.960> start<00:00:45.469> out<00:00:45.590> with<00:00:45.649> basically<00:00:46.190> a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
board I start out with basically a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.689 
board I start out with basically a
quarter<00:00:46.610> inch<00:00:47.230> slab<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.500> wood<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:48.980> it's

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
quarter inch slab of wood and it's

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.520 
quarter inch slab of wood and it's
important<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.629> tip<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.320> grain

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
important on the tip for the grain

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.610 
important on the tip for the grain
pattern<00:00:51.770> to<00:00:52.129> be<00:00:52.250> pretty<00:00:52.579> even<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.239> consistent

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
pattern to be pretty even and consistent

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.830 
pattern to be pretty even and consistent
you<00:00:54.620> don't<00:00:54.800> want<00:00:55.010> any<00:00:55.760> weird<00:00:56.329> things<00:00:56.690> to

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
you don't want any weird things to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.779 
you don't want any weird things to
happen<00:00:57.020> over<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.500> life<00:00:57.680> of<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:58.039> fret<00:00:58.280> board<00:00:58.550> and

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
happen over the life of a fret board and

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.110 
happen over the life of a fret board and
I<00:00:59.600> have<00:00:59.809> cut<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.289> notches<00:01:00.640> these<00:01:01.640> are<00:01:01.879> just

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
I have cut the notches these are just

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.980 
I have cut the notches these are just
very<00:01:02.269> tiny<00:01:03.140> slots<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.340> here<00:01:05.240> I<00:01:05.270> have<00:01:05.600> frets

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
very tiny slots and here I have frets

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.500 
very tiny slots and here I have frets
that<00:01:06.770> are<00:01:06.920> going<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.100> be<00:01:07.280> placed<00:01:07.850> into<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
that are going to be placed into the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.620 
that are going to be placed into the
board<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.400> because<00:01:10.400> they're<00:01:10.610> tiny<00:01:10.880> I'll<00:01:11.420> just

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
board and because they're tiny I'll just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.090 
board and because they're tiny I'll just
draw<00:01:11.990> what<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.560> on<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.920> end<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.310> fret

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
draw what is on the end of a fret

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.750 
draw what is on the end of a fret
there's<00:01:16.100> your<00:01:16.400> fret<00:01:16.730> and<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.180> has<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.390> tang

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
there's your fret and it has a tang

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.700 
there's your fret and it has a tang
so<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.910> fret<00:01:20.150> literally<00:01:20.660> has<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.870> Tang<00:01:21.350> that

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
so the fret literally has a Tang that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.650 
so the fret literally has a Tang that
goes<00:01:22.520> down<00:01:22.970> into<00:01:23.360> each<00:01:23.630> slot<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:25.100> put<00:01:25.660> CA

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
goes down into each slot and I put CA

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.130 
goes down into each slot and I put CA
glue<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.820> pound<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.150> fret<00:01:29.390> right<00:01:29.630> into<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
glue and pound the fret right into the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.950 
glue and pound the fret right into the
slot<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:31.580> stays<00:01:32.620> fortunately<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:34.960> so

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
slot and it stays fortunately and so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.990 
slot and it stays fortunately and so
that's<00:01:37.780> that's<00:01:38.780> how<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.080> works<00:01:39.500> at<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.610> I

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
that's that's how that works at and I

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.030 
that's that's how that works at and I
have<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.420> go<00:01:41.570> down<00:01:41.810> obviously<00:01:42.380> there's<00:01:42.560> 24

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
have to go down obviously there's 24

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.150 
have to go down obviously there's 24
frets<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.760> have<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.210> inlaid<00:01:44.740> but<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:45.950> this

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
frets that have to be inlaid but at this

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.630 
frets that have to be inlaid but at this
point<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.420> fretboard<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:48.050> still<00:01:48.350> flat<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.310> is

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
point the fretboard is still flat it is

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.110 
point the fretboard is still flat it is
I'm<00:01:50.300> going<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.570> glue<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
I'm going to glue this on to the to the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.810 
I'm going to glue this on to the to the
wood<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.140> being<00:01:54.380> flat<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.980> can<00:01:55.250> clamp<00:01:55.520> it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
wood with it being flat I can clamp it

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.810 
wood with it being flat I can clamp it
it's<00:01:56.480> all<00:01:56.750> there<00:01:57.050> but<00:01:57.260> I'm<00:01:57.680> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.130> go<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
it's all there but I'm going to go and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.470 
it's all there but I'm going to go and
put<00:01:59.480> a<00:01:59.510> radius<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.400> curve<00:02:01.400> on<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.940> this<00:02:02.090> for

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
put a radius a curve on to this for

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.950 
put a radius a curve on to this for
comfort<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.110> for<00:02:03.920> playability<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.660> use<00:02:05.930> a

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
comfort and for playability and I use a

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.360 
comfort and for playability and I use a
compound<00:02:06.560> radius

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
compound radius

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.359 
compound radius
it's<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:08.090> steeper<00:02:08.810> radius<00:02:09.410> here<00:02:09.830> than<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.340> is

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
it's a steeper radius here than it is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.840 
it's a steeper radius here than it is
here<00:02:11.050> because<00:02:12.050> as<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.680> strings

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
here because as the strings

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.930 
here because as the strings
they<00:02:14.510> widen<00:02:14.960> out<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.710> it's<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.550> really<00:02:16.910> a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
they widen out and it's a it's really a

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.840 
they widen out and it's a it's really a
conical<00:02:17.510> shape<00:02:17.570> as<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.980> strings<00:02:19.310> widen<00:02:19.730> out

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
conical shape as the strings widen out

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.270 
conical shape as the strings widen out
and<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.560> be<00:02:21.710> able<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.980> put<00:02:22.160> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
and so to have to be able to put the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520 
and so to have to be able to put the
strings<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.910> an<00:02:23.030> equal<00:02:23.390> distance<00:02:24.170> from<00:02:24.350> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
strings at an equal distance from the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.010 
strings at an equal distance from the
fret<00:02:24.800> board<00:02:24.830> all<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.340> way<00:02:25.520> out<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.390> arc<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
fret board all the way out the arc the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.940 
fret board all the way out the arc the
compound<00:02:27.530> radius<00:02:28.010> has<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.670> change<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:30.500> have

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
compound radius has to change so I have

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370 
compound radius has to change so I have
an<00:02:31.150> amazing<00:02:32.150> tool<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.690> does<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.080> very

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
an amazing tool that does that very

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.670 
an amazing tool that does that very
accurately<00:02:34.060> but<00:02:35.060> anyway<00:02:35.420> at<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:36.320> point

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
accurately but anyway at this point

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.740 
accurately but anyway at this point
we're<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.370> glue<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.820> down<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.450> we've

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
we're going to glue this down and we've

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.530 
we're going to glue this down and we've
still<00:02:39.080> got<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.410> neck<00:02:39.680> as<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.490> square<00:02:40.970> block<00:02:41.240> at

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
still got the neck as a square block at

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:51.809 
still got the neck as a square block at
this<00:02:41.690> point

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.879
