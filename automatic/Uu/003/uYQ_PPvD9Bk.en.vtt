messing up your listening experience and
it<00:01:19.389> does<00:01:19.569> a<00:01:19.600> fairly<00:01:20.020> good<00:01:20.170> job<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:21.039> sealing

very many good sounding sealed

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.530 

and<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:45.100> think<00:02:45.310> these<00:02:45.400> headphones<00:02:45.640> sound<00:02:46.270> quite

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
and I think these headphones sound quite

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.760 
and I think these headphones sound quite
a<00:02:46.570> bit<00:02:46.750> better<00:02:46.870> than<00:02:47.020> those<00:02:47.260> two<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.680> of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
a bit better than those two and of

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.660 
a bit better than those two and of
course<00:02:47.950> they're<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.160> little<00:02:48.340> bit<00:02:48.490> more

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
course they're a little bit more

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.580 
course they're a little bit more
expensive<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.960> other<00:02:50.110> headphone<00:02:50.440> that's

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
expensive the other headphone that's

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.710 
expensive the other headphone that's

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
has a more refined treble but I would

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.400 
has a more refined treble but I would

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
say the bass on these headphones is a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.570 
say the bass on these headphones is a
little<00:03:32.830> bit<00:03:32.980> tighter<00:03:33.310> than<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.880> Denton's<00:03:34.350> I

although<00:03:36.690> overall<00:03:37.690> I'd<00:03:38.080> say<00:03:38.140> they're<00:03:38.530> quite

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830
