00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
use the toothpick sometimes when you do

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.220 
use the toothpick sometimes when you do
smaller<00:02:36.620> stores<00:02:37.269> we<00:02:38.269> need<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> small<00:02:38.720> one<00:02:38.959> it's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
smaller stores we need a small one it's

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.869 
smaller stores we need a small one it's
hard<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.650> put<00:02:39.859> it<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.129> so<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.370> can<00:02:40.459> just<00:02:40.609> use

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
hard to put it in so you can just use

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.819 
hard to put it in so you can just use
this<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.329> push<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:41.870> blood<00:02:42.109> push<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.470> push<00:02:42.799> the

this to push to blood push it push the

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.610 
this to push to blood push it push the
edge<00:02:43.129> in<00:02:43.459> but<00:02:44.090> here<00:02:44.329> it's<00:02:44.629> you<00:02:44.780> don't<00:02:44.930> yet<00:02:45.079> once

exists which is just like that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.020 
exists which is just like that
there<00:02:51.260> are<00:02:53.470> see<00:02:54.470> there's<00:02:54.680> line<00:02:55.129> that's<00:02:55.760> where

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
you touch the paper in and there's one

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.559 
you touch the paper in and there's one
on<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.670> other<00:02:58.790> side<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.150> that's<00:02:59.239> not<00:02:59.420> worked

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
on the other side but that's not worked

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.229 
on the other side but that's not worked
on<00:02:59.720> favorite<00:03:00.109> okay<00:03:00.829> once<00:03:01.639> you<00:03:01.730> have<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:01.970> is

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
on favorite okay once you have this is

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.149 
on favorite okay once you have this is
the<00:03:02.329> hardest<00:03:02.569> part<00:03:02.689> and<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.829> is<00:03:03.889> what's

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
the hardest part and this is what's

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.949 
the hardest part and this is what's
going<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> really<00:03:04.790> determine<00:03:05.269> what<00:03:05.750> your

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
going to really determine what your

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.160 
going to really determine what your
start<00:03:06.290> looks<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:06.920> you're<00:03:07.909> going<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.150> push<00:03:08.569> me

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
start looks like you're going to push me

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.059 
start looks like you're going to push me
in<00:03:10.209> here<00:03:11.209> every<00:03:12.049> edge<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.590> also<00:03:12.889> over<00:03:12.950> here

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
in here every edge and also over here

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.000 
in here every edge and also over here
you're<00:03:13.340> going<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.489> push<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:14.919> towards<00:03:15.919> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
you're going to push it towards the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:30.270 
you're going to push it towards the
metal<00:03:19.000> push<00:03:20.000> it

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.710 

I'm<00:03:30.670> gonna<00:03:30.790> push

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.210 

and<00:03:34.230> you're<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.530> start<00:03:34.740> kind<00:03:35.160> of

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
and you're going to start kind of

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.620 
and you're going to start kind of
molding<00:03:35.700> your<00:03:35.850> star<00:03:38.060> what<00:03:39.060> you're<00:03:39.210> left<00:03:39.390> with

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
molding your star what you're left with

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.850 
molding your star what you're left with
is<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:40.190> paper<00:03:41.190> star<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.970> 3d<00:03:42.420> paper<00:03:42.720> star<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
is a paper star a 3d paper star the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.100 
is a paper star a 3d paper star the
hardest<00:03:44.250> part<00:03:44.760> would<00:03:45.090> would<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.960> one

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
hardest part would would be the one

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.450 
hardest part would would be the one
where<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.320> push<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.680> because<00:03:46.800> if<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.130> push<00:03:47.310> it

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
where you push it because if you push it

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.120 
where you push it because if you push it
wrongly<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.150> end<00:03:48.330> up<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:49.130> deformed

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
wrongly you can end up with a deformed

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.270 
wrongly you can end up with a deformed
star<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.210> physically<00:03:51.600> how<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.810> may<00:03:51.930> start

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
star that physically how you may start

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.710 
star that physically how you may start
drawing<00:03:53.280> different<00:03:53.430> sizes<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.180> stars<00:03:54.510> all

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
drawing different sizes of stars all

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.530 
drawing different sizes of stars all
depends<00:03:55.050> on<00:03:55.170> your<00:03:55.760> paper<00:03:56.760> how<00:03:57.120> you're<00:03:57.390> how

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
depends on your paper how you're how

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.990 
depends on your paper how you're how
thick<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:58.170> cut<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.560> with<00:03:58.590> your<00:03:58.860> Lubert<00:03:59.250> so<00:03:59.760> for

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
thick you cut it with your Lubert so for

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.280 
thick you cut it with your Lubert so for
example<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:02.160> will<00:04:02.490> make<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:03.000> really<00:04:03.660> fast<00:04:03.990> R

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
example this will make a really fast R

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.950 
example this will make a really fast R
this<00:04:04.980> will<00:04:05.040> make<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.750> normal-sized<00:04:06.750> one

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
this will make a normal-sized one

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.290 
this will make a normal-sized one
another<00:04:07.650> size<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:08.880> depends<00:04:09.150> on<00:04:09.180> your

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
another size it all depends on your

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.600 
another size it all depends on your
thighs<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:09.870> do<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.710> too<00:04:11.100> big<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.460> one

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
thighs don't do it too big of a one

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.920 
thighs don't do it too big of a one
because<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.000> wouldn't<00:04:12.210> work<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.630> won't<00:04:12.840> be

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
because it wouldn't work it won't be

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.620 
because it wouldn't work it won't be
long<00:04:13.350> enough<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.800> mean<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:15.060> want<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.450> do<00:04:15.600> a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
long enough I mean if you want to do a

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
long enough I mean if you want to do a
really<00:04:16.049> big<00:04:16.080> star<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.709> need<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:17.070> longer<00:04:17.820> paper

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
really big star you need a longer paper

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.590 
really big star you need a longer paper
once<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.580> can<00:04:20.880> decorate<00:04:21.269> your

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
once you do that you can decorate your

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.310 
once you do that you can decorate your
Stars

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
Stars

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.340 
Stars
um<00:04:22.790> these<00:04:23.790> all<00:04:24.180> kinds<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.510> colors<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.110> can

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
um these all kinds of colors you can

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.130 
um these all kinds of colors you can
draw<00:04:25.500> faces<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.160> them<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.730> can<00:04:26.970> paint<00:04:27.960> them

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
draw faces on them you can paint them

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.000 
draw faces on them you can paint them
and<00:04:28.290> everything<00:04:28.650> um<00:04:29.570> yeah<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.900> can<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.770> paint

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
and everything um yeah you can in paint

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.580 
and everything um yeah you can in paint
them<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.340> can<00:04:32.580> draw<00:04:33.360> all<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:33.720> it's<00:04:34.320> easier

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
them you can draw all of it it's easier

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.780 
them you can draw all of it it's easier
to<00:04:34.710> color<00:04:34.890> them<00:04:35.070> we<00:04:35.160> haven't<00:04:35.340> load<00:04:35.550> them<00:04:35.700> up

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
to color them we haven't load them up

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.290 
to color them we haven't load them up
yet<00:04:36.060> but<00:04:37.050> then<00:04:37.500> if<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.580> risk<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:38.970> if<00:04:39.120> you

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
yet but then if the risk is that if you

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.200 
yet but then if the risk is that if you
squeeze<00:04:39.720> them<00:04:40.140> too<00:04:40.260> much<00:04:40.380> with<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.770> coloring

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
squeeze them too much with the coloring

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.480 
squeeze them too much with the coloring
you<00:04:42.210> won't<00:04:42.390> be<00:04:42.450> able<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.660> blow<00:04:43.169> them<00:04:43.350> up<00:04:43.470> now<00:04:44.250> is
