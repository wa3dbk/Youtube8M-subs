let's talk about epic package for for
just<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.369> quick<00:01:09.490> set<00:01:09.789> a<00:01:10.090> second<00:01:10.539> here<00:01:10.660> what<00:01:10.810> does

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
just a quick set a second here what does

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
just a quick set a second here what does
the<00:01:11.110> epic<00:01:11.350> package<00:01:11.710> include<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.700> have<00:01:27.909> two

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.800 

these<00:01:33.700> guys<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.759> when<00:01:37.329> you<00:01:37.450> get<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.720> where

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
these guys but when you get to where

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:48.480 
these guys but when you get to where
you're<00:01:37.960> going<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.590> can<00:01:38.799> basically<00:01:47.430> put<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
you're going you can basically put the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.940 
you're going you can basically put the
lights<00:01:48.700> on<00:01:48.909> run<00:01:49.869> your<00:01:50.020> awnings<00:01:50.470> out<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:50.890> do

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
lights on run your awnings out and do

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.580 
lights on run your awnings out and do
the<00:01:51.040> system<00:01:51.700> off<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.930> don't<00:01:53.049> have<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.290> come<00:01:53.439> in

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
the system off you don't have to come in

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.889 
the system off you don't have to come in
your<00:01:53.710> unit<00:01:54.009> all<00:01:54.159> to<00:01:54.310> operate<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:55.090> yeah

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
your unit all to operate in that yeah

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.420 
your unit all to operate in that yeah
that's<00:01:56.140> that's<00:01:56.680> fantastic

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
that's that's fantastic

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.190 
that's that's fantastic
all<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.729> these<00:01:57.820> solid<00:01:58.329> surface<00:01:58.750> corian

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
all of these solid surface corian

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.649 
all of these solid surface corian
counter<00:01:59.530> tops<00:01:59.790> pretty<00:02:00.790> much<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.180> same<00:02:01.360> thing

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
counter tops pretty much the same thing

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.450 
counter tops pretty much the same thing
that<00:02:01.810> we<00:02:01.930> were<00:02:01.960> looking<00:02:02.200> at<00:02:02.500> in<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.189> fusion

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
that we were looking at in the fusion

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.760 
that we were looking at in the fusion
the<00:02:04.299> voltages<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.960> course<00:02:05.170> come<00:02:05.350> with<00:02:05.500> two<00:02:05.619> air

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
the voltages of course come with two air

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.469 
the voltages of course come with two air
conditioners<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:06.820> come<00:02:07.030> with<00:02:07.180> two<00:02:07.329> air

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
conditioners they come with two air

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.900 
conditioners they come with two air
conditioners<00:02:08.079> they<00:02:08.799> come<00:02:09.040> also<00:02:09.250> with<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.640> patio

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
conditioners they come also with a patio

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.759 
conditioners they come also with a patio
on<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.450> outside<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:11.049> don't<00:02:11.170> have<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.440> set<00:02:11.680> up

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
on the outside we don't have it set up

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.699 
on the outside we don't have it set up
right<00:02:11.799> now<00:02:12.220> but<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.820> rear<00:02:13.030> ramp<00:02:13.269> door<00:02:13.709> will

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
right now but the rear ramp door will

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.340 
right now but the rear ramp door will
make<00:02:14.890> into<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> full<00:02:15.549> patio<00:02:15.970> where<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.989> fusion

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
make into a full patio where the fusion

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.900 
make into a full patio where the fusion
does<00:02:17.500> not<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.100> it's<00:02:18.280> an<00:02:18.400> option<00:02:18.790> with

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
does not have that it's an option with

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.690 
does not have that it's an option with
the<00:02:19.000> fusion<00:02:19.360> with

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the fusion with

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.610 
the fusion with
voltage<00:02:20.000> we<00:02:20.209> stopped<00:02:20.720> them<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.110> way<00:02:21.290> yeah

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
voltage we stopped them that way yeah

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.930 
voltage we stopped them that way yeah
and<00:02:21.650> kind<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.129> going<00:02:22.280> back<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> air

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
and kind of going back to the air

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.350 
and kind of going back to the air
conditions<00:02:23.360> part<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:25.400> has<00:02:25.670> what's<00:02:25.940> called<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
conditions part it has what's called the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.910 
conditions part it has what's called the
whisper<00:02:26.660> quiet<00:02:26.900> air<00:02:27.110> conditioning<00:02:27.590> system

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
whisper quiet air conditioning system

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.949 
whisper quiet air conditioning system
okay<00:02:28.280> explain<00:02:28.670> them<00:02:28.879> basically<00:02:29.750> if<00:02:29.840> you've

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
okay explain them basically if you've

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.780 
okay explain them basically if you've
ever<00:02:30.110> known<00:02:30.290> dan<00:02:30.590> RB<00:02:30.890> before<00:02:31.340> when<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.610> turn

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
ever known dan RB before when you turn

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.190 
ever known dan RB before when you turn
it<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.330> hear<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.599> fan<00:02:32.870> blowing

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
it on you can hear the fan blowing

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.920 
it on you can hear the fan blowing
pretty<00:02:33.410> hard<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.360> guy<00:02:35.569> here

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
pretty hard in it and this guy here

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.390 
pretty hard in it and this guy here
basically<00:02:36.470> when<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.680> turn<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.130> can't

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
basically when you turn on you can't

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
voltage was the first ever do it can

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.360 
voltage was the first ever do it can
actually<00:05:27.630> frame<00:05:28.350> out<00:05:28.620> all<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:28.980> way<00:05:29.070> up<00:05:29.160> to<00:05:29.280> the
