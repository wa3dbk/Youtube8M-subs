00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:32.839 
you have a B C and D is on off and it's

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:38.770 
you have a B C and D is on off and it's
default<00:00:33.350> blue<00:00:34.480> B<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.710> color<00:00:37.280> blue<00:00:37.780> green

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.790 
red
you<00:00:41.809> got<00:00:41.989> purple<00:00:43.089> like<00:00:44.089> a<00:00:44.120> lime<00:00:44.690> which<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.440> more

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
you got purple like a lime which is more

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.430 
you got purple like a lime which is more
like<00:00:46.219> yellowish<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.960> have<00:00:48.109> aqua<00:00:48.379> then<00:00:49.370> white

like yellowish you have aqua then white

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.410 
like yellowish you have aqua then white
there<00:00:51.969> and<00:00:52.969> that<00:00:53.089> goes<00:00:53.239> back<00:00:53.269> to<00:00:53.480> blue<00:00:54.339> with

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
there and that goes back to blue with

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.630 
there and that goes back to blue with
this<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.629> C<00:00:57.140> which<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:57.829> your<00:00:58.129> different

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
this you have C which is your different

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.000 
this you have C which is your different
modes<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.390> have<00:00:59.530> three<00:01:00.530> different<00:01:00.859> modes

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
modes you have three different modes

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.530 
modes you have three different modes
this<00:01:01.460> is<00:01:01.640> one<00:01:01.819> of<00:01:01.940> them<00:01:04.000> that's<00:01:05.000> another<00:01:05.330> one

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
this is one of them that's another one

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.600 
this is one of them that's another one
where<00:01:05.570> just<00:01:05.930> kind<00:01:06.080> of<00:01:06.200> stops<00:01:06.830> flashes<00:01:07.400> stops

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
where just kind of stops flashes stops

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:17.410 
where just kind of stops flashes stops
flashes<00:01:08.150> tops<00:01:08.360> lashes<00:01:10.780> goes<00:01:11.780> back<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.260> forth

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.730 

and<00:01:17.860> kind<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:18.979> actual<00:01:19.400> strobe<00:01:19.690> D<00:01:20.740> itself

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
and kind of the actual strobe D itself

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.340 
and kind of the actual strobe D itself
is<00:01:22.010> your<00:01:22.190> speed<00:01:22.550> it<00:01:23.300> goes<00:01:23.540> slower<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.290> not

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
is your speed it goes slower and not

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.469 
is your speed it goes slower and not
faster<00:01:25.010> there's<00:01:25.460> nine<00:01:25.760> different<00:01:25.790> settings

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
faster there's nine different settings

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.300 
faster there's nine different settings
on<00:01:26.900> your<00:01:26.930> speed<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.590> believe<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.280> a

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
on your speed and I believe this is a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.859 
on your speed and I believe this is a
little<00:01:31.490> slowest<00:01:32.000> yep<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.450> then<00:01:32.540> there's<00:01:32.750> your

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
little slowest yep and then there's your

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.670 
little slowest yep and then there's your
actual<00:01:33.170> strobe<00:01:33.440> lights<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:35.479> what's<00:01:36.320> really

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
actual strobe lights so what's really

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.600 
actual strobe lights so what's really
cool<00:01:36.800> about<00:01:36.979> these<00:01:37.340> shut<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> software<00:01:39.610> they

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
cool about these shut the software they

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.149 
cool about these shut the software they
come<00:01:43.610> with<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:46.659> little<00:01:47.659> seal<00:01:47.900> on<00:01:48.140> them<00:01:48.320> trying

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
come with a little seal on them trying

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.160 
come with a little seal on them trying
to<00:01:49.220> get<00:01:49.340> eyes<00:01:49.490> get<00:01:49.729> image<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
to get eyes get image of it and the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.930 
to get eyes get image of it and the
Cielo<00:01:51.530> after<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.280> know<00:01:52.340> drill<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.700> hole

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
Cielo after you you know drill a hole

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.170 
Cielo after you you know drill a hole
yeah<00:01:53.930> big<00:01:54.220> would<00:01:55.220> have<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.460> measure<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.060> I'll

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
yeah big would have to measure and I'll

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.810 
yeah big would have to measure and I'll
put<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:56.990> on<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.470> description<00:01:58.220> part<00:01:58.550> of<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
put that on the description part of the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.350 
put that on the description part of the
video<00:01:59.770> drill<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.800> hole<00:02:01.009> yeah<00:02:01.340> big<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.940> just

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.779 
video drill a hole yeah big and just
stick<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.539> in<00:02:03.160> get<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.190> little<00:02:04.460> curve<00:02:04.759> right

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
stick it in get a little curve right

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.960 
stick it in get a little curve right
there<00:02:05.619> pop<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.890> headlight<00:02:07.250> reverse<00:02:07.700> slide

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
there pop in the headlight reverse slide

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.140 
there pop in the headlight reverse slide
wherever<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.019> want<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.259> put<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.560> thing<00:02:09.619> and
