00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.620 
wouldn't recommend it for anybody it
absolutely<00:02:20.680> sucked<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.720> um<00:02:23.730> yeah<00:02:24.730> these<00:02:25.360> are

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
absolutely sucked so um yeah these are

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.930 
absolutely sucked so um yeah these are
extremely<00:02:26.230> good<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:27.250> had<00:02:27.580> fusion

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
extremely good I just had fusion

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.270 
extremely good I just had fusion
extensions<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.780> my<00:02:28.810> hair<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.130> from

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
extensions in my hair so going from

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.400 
extensions in my hair so going from
fusion<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.880> clippin<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.540> always<00:02:31.960> really<00:02:32.110> hard

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
fusion to clippin is always really hard

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.440 
fusion to clippin is always really hard
because<00:02:33.070> fusion<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.090> much<00:02:34.210> more

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
because fusion is just so much more

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.920 
because fusion is just so much more
easier<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.960> like<00:02:35.110> manage<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:37.150> know<00:02:37.300> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.180 
easier to like manage and you know you
