the<00:00:39.809> school<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:41.220> sister<00:00:41.520> teaches<00:00:41.820> art

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the school and my sister teaches art

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.330 
the school and my sister teaches art
here<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.720> very<00:00:42.930> much<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> family<00:00:43.980> feel

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
here and it's very much a family feel

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040 
here and it's very much a family feel
and<00:00:44.580> that's<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.600> important

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and that's really really important

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
and that's really really important
because<00:00:46.650> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> boys<00:00:47.520> feed<00:00:47.760> off<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
because I think the boys feed off that I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.390 
because I think the boys feed off that I
think<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> star<00:00:48.629> feed<00:00:48.870> off<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:50.160> think

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
think the star feed off that and I think

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.890 
think the star feed off that and I think
it<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.610> makes<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.970> really<00:00:51.210> sort<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.660> happy

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
it just makes it a really sort of happy

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.660 
it just makes it a really sort of happy
tight-knit<00:00:52.290> place<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.040> know<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
tight-knit place you know I just want it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
tight-knit place you know I just want it
to<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.940> good<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.420> possibly<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to be as good as it can possibly be it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
to be as good as it can possibly be it's
a<00:00:55.920> strength<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.879> hold<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.659> to<00:00:57.839> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
a strength that we hold on to the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.540 
a strength that we hold on to the
traditional<00:00:58.559> aspects<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> school

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
traditional aspects of the school

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
traditional aspects of the school
I<00:00:59.580> suppose<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.930> focus<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.559> three<00:01:02.040> main

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
I suppose we really focus on three main

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
I suppose we really focus on three main
areas<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.150> they<00:01:03.269> should<00:01:03.449> work<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:03.750> hard

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
areas that they should work really hard

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.860 
areas that they should work really hard
that<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:04.890> should<00:01:05.070> enjoy<00:01:05.339> their<00:01:05.640> games<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
that they should enjoy their games and

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.750 
that they should enjoy their games and
their<00:01:06.930> free<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.340> should<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.580> nice

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
their free time and they should be nice

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.219 
their free time and they should be nice
to<00:01:08.790> each<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.870> we<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
to each other I think if we get that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.160 
to each other I think if we get that
right<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:10.680> everything<00:01:11.670> works<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.870> hope

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
right then everything works what I hope

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.300 
right then everything works what I hope
we<00:01:13.440> do<00:01:13.620> is<00:01:13.950> equip<00:01:14.760> them<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.000> confidence<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
we do is equip them with confidence and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.250 
we do is equip them with confidence and
prepare<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.490> their<00:01:18.120> future<00:01:18.630> schools<00:01:19.049> I

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
prepare them for their future schools I

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.570 
prepare them for their future schools I
think<00:01:19.290> hopefully<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.159> something<00:01:20.370> our<00:01:20.460> boy

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
think hopefully or something our boy

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
will always be well mannered I hope

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
will always be well mannered I hope
they'll<00:01:22.500> always<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.830> considerate<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.490> other

school for the boys is a really

school for the boys is a really
important<00:03:29.799> part<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.099> my<00:03:30.250> job<00:03:30.609> and<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:32.019> is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
important part of my job and that is

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.920 
important part of my job and that is

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
really does help me to give the parents

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.199 
really does help me to give the parents
what<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.590> hope<00:03:41.859> is<00:03:41.979> the<00:03:42.100> right<00:03:42.280> advice<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:42.910> terms

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
what I hope is the right advice in terms

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.630 
what I hope is the right advice in terms
of<00:03:43.359> cynics<00:03:43.630> in<00:03:43.780> their<00:03:43.900> public<00:03:44.169> school<00:03:44.350> reload

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
of cynics in their public school reload

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.060 
of cynics in their public school reload
again<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.170> think<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.290> what<00:03:47.440> boarding<00:03:47.800> gives

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
again I think that what boarding gives

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.060 
again I think that what boarding gives
children<00:03:48.520> is<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:49.110> continuity<00:03:50.110> there<00:03:50.920> at

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
children is that continuity there at

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.770 
children is that continuity there at
school<00:03:51.370> where<00:03:51.910> they<00:03:52.030> can<00:03:52.180> do<00:03:52.330> all<00:03:52.570> these

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
school where they can do all these

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.910 
school where they can do all these
activities<00:03:52.960> without<00:03:53.470> having<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.740> being

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
activities without having to being

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.490 
activities without having to being
farmed<00:03:54.280> off<00:03:54.430> from<00:03:54.640> one<00:03:54.970> side<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.720> London<00:03:56.350> for

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
farmed off from one side of London for

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.990 
farmed off from one side of London for
example<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.010> other<00:03:57.130> there<00:03:57.700> with<00:03:57.880> all

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
example to the other there with all

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.400 
example to the other there with all
their<00:03:58.150> friends<00:03:58.330> all<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.630> time<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:59.020> they<00:03:59.170> make

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
their friends all the time and they make

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.530 
their friends all the time and they make
incredibly<00:04:00.160> close<00:04:00.490> friends<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.150> last<00:04:01.360> for

incredibly close friends that last for

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.950 
incredibly close friends that last for
life

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
life

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.890 
life
I<00:04:02.520> think<00:04:03.520> boarding<00:04:04.120> school<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.630> definitely

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
I think boarding school is definitely

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.300 
I think boarding school is definitely
brilliant<00:04:05.860> because<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:07.770> like<00:04:08.770> sleep<00:04:09.280> with

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
brilliant because you like sleep with

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.240 
brilliant because you like sleep with
them<00:04:09.790> all<00:04:10.540> not<00:04:10.990> exactly<00:04:11.530> sleep<00:04:11.920> with<00:04:12.130> your

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
them all not exactly sleep with your

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.550 
them all not exactly sleep with your
friends<00:04:12.670> but<00:04:12.910> you're<00:04:13.600> it's<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.110> having<00:04:14.530> a

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
friends but you're it's like having a

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.789 
friends but you're it's like having a
sleepover<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.520> whole<00:04:15.970> year<00:04:16.480> round<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.590> it's

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
sleepover the whole year round so it's

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.580 
sleepover the whole year round so it's
really<00:04:18.160> fun<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:19.709> know<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:21.270> lots<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.419> people

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
really fun I know that lots of people

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.380 
really fun I know that lots of people
think<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.800> boarding<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.460> an<00:04:24.850> anachronism

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
think that boarding is an anachronism

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.750 
think that boarding is an anachronism
and<00:04:25.680> something<00:04:26.680> that<00:04:26.860> belongs<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.700> the
