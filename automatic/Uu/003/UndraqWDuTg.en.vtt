00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.950
 we must start making some 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.169
 delicious barbecue wings what is so 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.300
 easy and if more to do is a recipe 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.429
 very successful and there is always a sauce 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.170
 barbeque the sauce is different by 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.210
 some reason is always put or you are 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.800
 they remove ingredients it is very 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.160
 simple but what most called me the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.619
 attention was to do it in a way with 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.540
 wings or pure salitas that is father 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.340
 because you can get it out just say like 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.079
 of snack the kids today are out there 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.399
 playing not just for the purpose of 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.770
 week for any day is true them 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.420
 they grab will be comedy we're not going to 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.550
 fry that is another wonderful thing the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.079
 let's bake and well I'll start 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.489
 to put on the super sharqat a 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.489
 bowl at medium heat 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.160
 and we are going to put chile schools of 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.059
 tree to taste if you go for the kids 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.059
 you have to be careful I'm going to put garlic 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.059
 minced 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.380
 I'm going to put an English sauce 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.290
 I'm going to put apple cider vinegar 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.780
 the special touch 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.750
 and I'm going to put sugar muscabada that is the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.700
 that will give you that smoky flavor that 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.939
 we love 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.149
 let's reduce it let's remember that 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.759
 the sauces before were produced with a 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.079
 thickeners ale always put a starch 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.360
 compound specular corn flour and 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.539
 with that they weighed them now we do not try to 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.819
 do avoid that and we make a sauce more 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.429
 thickens by means of reduction and is 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.560
 that's why I tell them to do it 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.990
 this way because look at this is like this 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.200
 of liquid 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.780
 I'm going to listen 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.899
 and look how thick it is 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.890
 same sauce but already after about 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.920
 15-20 minutes 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.479
 all I did was put them in a 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.250
 bag your blog with a bag closure 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.830
 and the only thing I'm going to expose them 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.240
 there because for me it's more comfortable because 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.970
 there I can play with them I'm going to 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.380
 explain why the sauce has to 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.900
 barbecue to use it has to be 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.890
 cold should not be hot ok it 's very 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.090
 important 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.090
 let's put the wings 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.550
 and now we are going to put is our 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.650
 basic sauce 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.990
 let's let them marinate for 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.200
 about an hour or so 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.010
 so that they are taking flavor among more 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.170
 time they are is much better 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.900
 and I like these bags I'm going to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.200
 explain why I close them 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.989
 perfectly they cretin the air 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.390
 and I start playing with them a bit and they 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.940
 they are mixing all that is the joke that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.980
 in all very well mixed that not 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.500
 let's leave none without our 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.200
 delicious sauce and me every five minutes 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.750
 or streets it's my turn that I remember balls 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.660
 he turned and I give him another marinated 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.670
 so that none of them will run out 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.230
 this delicious salsa bar and salsa bar 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.330
 that after up to a month inside 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.120
 refrigeration since they are marinated 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.470
 now another tip plan is very important I 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.760
 when I leave them marinated those of 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.670
 communities a while out of the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.920
 refrigerator that makes the skin the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.599
 chicken skin is in this case it is re 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.610
 link opens the forum and you can enter 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.319
 the marinade in another way if they arrive 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.630
 directly to the refrigerator it contracts 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.280
 immediately by the cold ok 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.140
 of course I leave them for 15 minutes and then 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.049
 if I'm going to take an hour a marinated 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.380
 the other 45 minutes I leave them inside the 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.470
 refrigerator I'm ready 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.240
 Look at the difference from one to another I 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.180
 to give my thinking that grab her with the 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.040
 hands remember that raw chicken does not 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.300
 it's so good it can be a transmitter 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.880
 Salmonella and we are not interested in any 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.560
 motive to have salmonella if we got it 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.530
 to touch it is very important to wash the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.090
 hands perfectly and then already does 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.150
 other things but while please 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.770

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.270

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.620
