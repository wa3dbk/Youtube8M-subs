00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.539
 said to play today we end up 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.270
 for episode 1 of the ex playes pvp 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.949
 faction on the know one fight I'm 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.170
 totally happy because I'm going 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.789
 find all my friends is 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.410
 Frankly, I was fed up with 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.519
 this situation that there was on the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.500
 know and last that by the way 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.050
 starts to drop to one wonders 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.080
 why are these important or I read 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.390
 three months later you will see how 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.740
 he manages that short good what's that I 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.530
 discover bees here you have seen 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.540
 grow this test that I won 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.140
 some tricks that I discover 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.430
 places 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.730
 why be because it extends the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.160
 purse rts is true that the twins have 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.470
 to do that with not much 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.720
 despite that they have despite he has 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.580
 nothing yeah that's the spawn I like but 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.940
 not too much what I like like a little too much 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.200
 of twice in it but otherwise I have 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.600
 spotted that there was a store the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.920
 main store can be bought with 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.080
 sub elsewhere if I do this chf 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.770
 cap and bg without warne 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.660
 that's just then there are the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.420
 good pvp releases released non stop but good 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.770
 because no, I did not do this to them 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.560
 next videos are alex tanguay 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.490
 youth of course obviously with 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.730
 other people also if possible 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.460
 you know why he writes me leads 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.200
 in him yes I went to do spam 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.540
 on this case he can since the players 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 monty say to me bravo you finally have 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.940
 it's the right decision and all good 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.380
 ok thank you very much thank you I have in 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.240
 makes think 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.979
 I would put the address of the site in the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.799
 neat description that they have me 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.960
 server world fight which is a server 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.780
 pleaded faction to the best faction of the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.659
 soap is the fraction impact I do not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.799
 this is nothing you're going to trap 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.369
 we have a modo the founder of the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.470
 know those little bugs that I would put 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.420
 also its description string you 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.670
 see the spot how beautiful it is 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 pleasure to turn on it finally on 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.260
 a real waiter who is not pat quinn 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.480
 and that is normal williams to this area 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:27.390
 and then there are those paid when they 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.590
 follow me and I have a fanboy here good I 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.569
 go around the houses I do not know 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.130
 what does it all serve these houses but I 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.340
 do the trick but in fact it is that the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.610
 shops we see here block store 's 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.200
 blocks 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.200
 here you have the block store 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.299
 hostile here bay 6 stops since the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.060
 band of gaza requires an empty room 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.250
 in fact, yes, it's an empty room 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.230
 behind everything in it I have a chain 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.060
 dream after all they ask for 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.579
 to be at the weight chair but 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.079
 does not prevent there are many people but 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.690
 also look at all the stocks that has 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.040
 it's huge for pdp you'll see 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.160
 it goes into a spin on this page a few 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.700
 bugs and I wanted to do but still a 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.110
 fanboy that's it 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.360
 uh yeah we were watching every 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.470
 muscular trainees I will try a 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.730
 breakthrough to make the end of this video 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.060
 I do not want to last long in our 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 video 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.130
 I think I said everything about 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.530
 server sections a lot of people 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.959
 this point frankly it's a lot of 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.799
 everything but which is in for me I 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.060
 lose me and you call me him but yes 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.799
 because with windows 8 you can not get 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.110
 shelter at the cecce kummer dry 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.760
 who calls me in any case a cell 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.099
 empty I want to stop I do not want 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.630
 see him in the parlor 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.750
 I am for this departure impute him 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.720
 at the Bay of Fight but some faults 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.519
 fight we will follow the Pope soap opera 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.190
 years will leave yes even the messages are 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.900
 sulphate facts knew that caddies 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.599
 I do not put him the carpet the crowds 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.510
 but he's crazy him but hop but no 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.750
 but no but no but my moral choice 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.550
 and yes because there is 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.560
 the only little flaw that I would say in 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.420
 this server there is no so it is the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.609
 despite all that people can say 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.750
 yade has a lot who will agree with 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.910
 me that anti cheat 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.970
 it's still good but watts is 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.590
 what does it agree the normal war zone what 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.040
 these genres we can see mutations 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.040
 there against 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.800
 this is so it was joy the killer for this 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.210
 first episode of the gameplay the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.490
 the esp the eye the first episode it's a 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.120
 bit the most boring I think that when we 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.129
 presents the server we present everything 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.460
 this is warzone I suicide is so 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.460
 I do not want to kill myself 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.289
 in episode 2 you find me real 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.969
 to be other people who are my 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.949
 friends 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.990
 and on that I leave you because all 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.729
 world is in kosovo the kiss of 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.370
 do not forget about fallen king in 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.409
 my time because there in the name it is 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:18.039
 still there him but he still has her 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:22.629
 sail and cat or the world and ciao xx on 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:24.490
 the 75 xx what is waiting for us here I have 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.800
 finally made a mark on my life 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.659
 previous and I'm ready for the 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.620
 beginning of a new life but 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.120
 I still have a lot of stuff in 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.080
 eats alone sleeps should start well 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.539
 although I am not yet 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.400
 better it's just a matter of 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.159
 time 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.159
 this is everyone
