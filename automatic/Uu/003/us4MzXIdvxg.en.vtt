00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.769

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.519
 water less than the amount that we get 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:58.130
 they say you have to be preparing another 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.130
 Slavic ingredient condensed milk 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:05.780
 the cream is what we are going to do 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:09.950
 with milk powder dilute in gelatin 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.470
 without flavor and then we will do it in 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.810
 different molds good hands to the work 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.500
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.970
 select gelatin without water that's what 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.940
 we do in a little water 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.040
 let's dilute it well alright well well 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 we leave at least three 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.130
 seconds three minutes sorry and then 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.710
 we add the warm water because it is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.690
 with what what is going to be in a 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.040
 gelatine yes more 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.190
 well I'm already a lot in the room 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.170
 you are now born in cold water now 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.640
 we apply the warm water later so that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.920
 look good 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.920
 it's much more diluted 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.810
 we start with condensed milk 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.690
 we need the rest 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.959
 and we add the milk powder 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:35.810
 sometimes instead of diluting the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 the unflavored gelatin in water 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.800
 dissolved in the milk powder remains 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.600

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.210

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.930
