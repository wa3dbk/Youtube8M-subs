 upon arrival in France of a practice 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 already common in other countries the

 CCTV thirty thousand cars 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.590
 and maybe tomorrow yours are already 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.210
 equipped with small cameras they film 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.460
 constantly the road is sometimes 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.130
 the main cockpit lens use 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.630

 ambroise boulez Jean Francois monier a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.840
 overtaking on the right and on 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.880
 zebra these videos are all posted 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 on the internet by the same driver 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.760
 Marseille exasperated by these offenses 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.590
 daily roads and this vigilante of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.390
 the road will magnify with a magnifying glass 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.950
 drivers' plates for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.149
 denounce 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.649
 the man did not wish to speak in front of 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.649
 our camera for fear of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.370
 retaliation for turning these images there 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.629
 actually used an onboard camera 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.840
 a practice that has become a phenomenon 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.480
 in Russia and there the captured images 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.260
 by Russian motorists have to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:15.780
 what to thrill obstacles on 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.270
 Truck roads gone crazy or total loss 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 control of the most scenes 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.400
 violent to the most unusual these cameras 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 film the whole purpose avoid the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.479
 scams to insurance these pedestrians 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.409
 who seeks the accident to be done 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.400
 compensate in France hugo meyer has adopted 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.710
 this little camera 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.049
 this motorist install it there is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 two years after a road accident 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.400
 where he had hit another car 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.600
 having had the camera but I was 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 allowed to understand what happened 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.899
 and to see especially my reaction time 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.310
 because today 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.240
 I still ask myself today 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.640
 question know what I was 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.320
 responsive enough or not now 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.630
 that black boxes record everything in 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.840
 permanence even when he entrusts his 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.399
 car to his garage for example with 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.710
 the camera he discovered that his 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.900
 mechanic was having a good time with his 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.810
 car 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.060
 he slips into the parking lot and roars 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.229
 the engine we realize at once 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.550
 creative very close to cars but 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.170
 that in addition to the climb it is 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.390
 involved in a new one that makes 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.590
 hardly 20 m the vehicle is cold I the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.880
 remember when we put on a 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.810
 surprisingly it is to avoid 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.120
 the arrival with new problems 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.500
 like him thirty thousand French get 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.810
 would already be equipped with a camera 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.820
 embarked but in the streets difficult 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.680
 to find motorists seduced by 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.030
 that idea 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.650
 no I do not really like this system of 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.040
 denouncement 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.920
 here are some more videos 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.480
 brother that's enough but for the first 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.670
 French manufacturer of embedded cameras 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.650
 big brother can have good 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.830
 as for video surveillance it's 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.390
 camera would mostly have a deterrent role 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.700
 when we have a third eye and a 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.110
 black box that is objective unbiased 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.130
 somewhere we do not want to 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.750
 get off of his vehicle and make 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.880
 justice itself even if someone has 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.160
 makes a fishtail for one of his 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.520
 devices counted between 150 and 500 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.530
 euros 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.810
 but beware the French insurers 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.070
 they are still reluctant to do the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.640
 part of the responsibilities in a 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.010
 accident 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.230
 he always prefers the good old report 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.230
 amicably 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.230
