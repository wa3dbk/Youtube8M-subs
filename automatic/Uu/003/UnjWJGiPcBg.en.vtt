00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.080 
so you'll see some new icons appear
saying<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.080> is<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.290> multi<00:00:52.860> click<00:00:53.250> slide<00:00:53.700> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
saying this is a multi click slide and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
saying this is a multi click slide and
let's<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.780> how<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.990> works<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.920> basically

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
let's see how that works so basically

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.550 
let's see how that works so basically
we're<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> click<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> slide<00:00:57.930> once<00:00:58.260> it's

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
we're going to click the slide once it's

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.990 
we're going to click the slide once it's
going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> show<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.130> slide<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> first

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
going to show the slide in the first

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
going to show the slide in the first
item<00:01:00.450> and<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.840> click<00:01:01.080> again<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
item and then we click again for the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.579 
item and then we click again for the
next<00:01:02.130> item<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.610> one<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> third<00:01:04.320> so

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
next item and one more for the third so

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
next item and one more for the third so
that's<00:01:04.739> how<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> multi<00:01:05.489> click<00:01:05.880> slide<00:01:06.240> works<00:01:06.689> now

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that's how a multi click slide works now

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.169 
that's how a multi click slide works now
let's<00:01:07.859> look<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.249> how<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.670> fill<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
new slide using a template so I'm going

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
new slide using a template so I'm going
to<00:01:47.819> go<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.389> impact<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.590> want<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> use

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to go here to impact and I want to use

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
to go here to impact and I want to use
this<00:01:50.159> full<00:01:50.490> page<00:01:50.520> text<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.329> we're<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
this full page text so we're going to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
this full page text so we're going to
create<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:52.109> new<00:01:52.350> slide<00:01:52.560> using<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.369> template

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
create a new slide using that template

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.669 
create a new slide using that template
and<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.719> the<00:01:54.810> title<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.319> going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.499> put

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
and for the title we're going to put

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.699 
and for the title we're going to put
visualize<00:01:56.399> success<00:01:57.350> I'm<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.679> to

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
visualize success I'm just going to

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.069 
visualize success I'm just going to
resize<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.459> text<00:01:59.850> box<00:02:00.029> so<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.359> can<00:02:00.389> see<00:02:00.840> all

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
resize this text box so we can see all

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.109 
resize this text box so we can see all
of<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.350> text<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.279> then<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.429> can<00:02:02.609> delete<00:02:02.789> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
of our text and then we can delete this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.699 
of our text and then we can delete this
other<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:03.840> need<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.319> and

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
other one because we don't need it and

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.489 
other one because we don't need it and
now<00:02:05.459> let's<00:02:05.789> add<00:02:05.999> some<00:02:06.359> images<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.170> slide

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
now let's add some images to this slide

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.770 
now let's add some images to this slide
so<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.859> can<00:02:08.009> visualize<00:02:08.580> our<00:02:08.850> success<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.630> we're

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
so we can visualize our success so we're

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.059 
so we can visualize our success so we're
going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.080> up<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.679> add<00:02:10.709> image

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
going to go up here to the add image

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
going to go up here to the add image
button<00:02:11.250> I'm<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.330> grab<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:12.689> of<00:02:12.720> these

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
button I'm going to grab one of these

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.770 
button I'm going to grab one of these
climbing<00:02:13.439> images<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.040> hit<00:02:14.189> select<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.849> then

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
climbing images and hit select and then

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.650 
climbing images and hit select and then
let's<00:02:16.019> just<00:02:16.260> scale<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.799> down

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
let's just scale this down

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.230 
let's just scale this down
and<00:02:17.750> let's<00:02:18.680> add<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.160> couple<00:02:19.370> more<00:02:19.490> so<00:02:19.970> let's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
and let's add in a couple more so let's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.430 
and let's add in a couple more so let's
add<00:02:20.960> climb<00:02:21.770> number<00:02:22.100> two<00:02:22.900> again<00:02:23.900> I'll<00:02:24.410> just

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
add climb number two again I'll just

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.000 
add climb number two again I'll just
scale<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.160> down<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.460> little<00:02:25.760> bit<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.530> we'll

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
scale this down a little bit and we'll

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.470 
scale this down a little bit and we'll
add<00:02:28.220> climb<00:02:28.670> number<00:02:29.180> three<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:32.150> now<00:02:32.240> we<00:02:32.300> have

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
add climb number three so now we have

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.350 
add climb number three so now we have
our<00:02:32.600> three<00:02:32.990> images<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:34.850> can<00:02:35.000> scale

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
our three images in and we can scale

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.390 
our three images in and we can scale
them<00:02:35.600> down<00:02:35.630> I'll<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.710> similar

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
them down I'll get that to a similar

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.240 
them down I'll get that to a similar
size<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.420> other<00:02:38.450> one<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.230> can<00:02:39.890> move<00:02:40.040> this

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
size as the other one I can move this

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.800 
size as the other one I can move this
over<00:02:40.430> here<00:02:40.610> we<00:02:41.090> could<00:02:41.210> spend<00:02:41.480> more<00:02:41.600> time

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
over here we could spend more time

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.990 
over here we could spend more time
making<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.560> look<00:02:42.800> perfect<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:43.550> for<00:02:43.850> now

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
making this look perfect but for now

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.480 
making this look perfect but for now
we'll<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.720> call<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.230> pretty<00:02:45.500> good<00:02:45.740> now<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
we'll just call this pretty good now the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.130 
we'll just call this pretty good now the
one<00:02:46.640> thing<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:46.910> can<00:02:47.150> do<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.480> since<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.780> scaled

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
one thing we can do is since I scaled

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.810 
one thing we can do is since I scaled
these<00:02:48.290> down<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.920> little<00:02:49.160> harder<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.640> see

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
these down it's a little harder to see

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.270 
these down it's a little harder to see
the<00:02:49.970> people<00:02:50.360> I'm<00:02:50.570> trying<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.050> visualize<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:52.250> I

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
the people I'm trying to visualize so I

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.190 
the people I'm trying to visualize so I
actually<00:02:52.460> can<00:02:52.850> crop<00:02:53.120> these<00:02:53.390> images<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.110> I'm

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
actually can crop these images so I'm

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.720 
actually can crop these images so I'm
just<00:02:54.320> going<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.500> double<00:02:54.740> click<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.430> now<00:02:55.490> with

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
just going to double click and now with

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.450 
just going to double click and now with
the<00:02:55.880> black<00:02:56.150> bounding<00:02:56.750> box<00:02:57.020> here<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:58.070> scale

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
the black bounding box here I can scale

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.190 
the black bounding box here I can scale
this<00:02:58.700> up<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.030> it's<00:02:59.210> going<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.480> crop<00:02:59.960> my<00:03:00.170> image

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
this up and it's going to crop my image

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.740 
this up and it's going to crop my image
inside<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.400> get<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.580> little<00:03:01.880> closer<00:03:02.270> look

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
inside so I can get a little closer look

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.380 
inside so I can get a little closer look
at<00:03:02.960> that<00:03:03.500> person<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.280> can<00:03:04.430> maybe<00:03:04.550> go<00:03:04.850> just

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
at that person so we can maybe go just

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.450 
at that person so we can maybe go just
slightly<00:03:05.750> bigger<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:07.010> we're<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:07.160> kind<00:03:07.430> of

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
slightly bigger so we're just kind of

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.130 
slightly bigger so we're just kind of
cropping<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.090> image<00:03:08.390> down<00:03:08.630> within<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
cropping that image down within the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.720 
cropping that image down within the
bounding<00:03:09.560> box<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.040> I'll<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> same<00:03:10.670> to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
bounding box so I'll do the same to

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.630 
bounding box so I'll do the same to
these<00:03:11.090> other<00:03:11.330> ones<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:12.620> we'll<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.160> make

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
these other ones so we'll just make

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.720 
these other ones so we'll just make
these<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.850> little<00:03:14.090> bit<00:03:14.300> bigger<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.700> last

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
these a little bit bigger and the last

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.110 
these a little bit bigger and the last
one<00:03:18.370> double<00:03:19.370> click<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:21.250> scale<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.520> up<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.030> we

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
one double click and scale this up so we

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.930 
one double click and scale this up so we
can<00:03:23.300> see<00:03:23.810> our<00:03:24.140> people<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.430> we're<00:03:25.550> trying<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
can see our people that we're trying to

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.630 
can see our people that we're trying to
visualize<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.770> now<00:03:27.890> we<00:03:27.950> have<00:03:28.250> our<00:03:28.400> people

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
visualize so now we have our people

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.150 
visualize so now we have our people
visualize<00:03:29.330> now<00:03:29.720> let's<00:03:29.990> actually<00:03:30.260> create<00:03:30.740> our

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
visualize now let's actually create our

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.030 
visualize now let's actually create our
slide<00:03:31.640> build<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:33.170> first<00:03:33.440> let's<00:03:33.650> start<00:03:33.770> with

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
slide build so first let's start with

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.980 
slide build so first let's start with
our<00:03:34.070> text<00:03:34.550> we're<00:03:35.090> going<00:03:35.210> to<00:03:35.300> go<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.420> our<00:03:35.600> slide

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
our text we're going to go to our slide

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.920 
our text we're going to go to our slide
build<00:03:36.320> properties<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.130> then<00:03:37.250> we<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.550> set<00:03:37.850> a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
build properties and then we can set a

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.750 
build properties and then we can set a
transition<00:03:38.930> I'm<00:03:39.530> going<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.770> use<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.130> zoom<00:03:40.190> in

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
transition I'm going to use this zoom in

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.880 
transition I'm going to use this zoom in
transition<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.870> maybe<00:03:42.050> we<00:03:42.230> want<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.500> set<00:03:42.710> this

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
transition and maybe we want to set this

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.400 
transition and maybe we want to set this
to<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.160> center<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> screen<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:45.230> we<00:03:45.290> can

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
to the center of the screen so we can

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.010 
to the center of the screen so we can
set<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.740> center<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.340> hit<00:03:46.580> done<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.180> now<00:03:47.870> I'm

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
set the center and hit done and now I'm

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.220 
set the center and hit done and now I'm
going<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.320> set<00:03:49.250> how<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:50.150> comes<00:03:50.480> on<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.020> right

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
going to set how this comes on so right

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.080 
going to set how this comes on so right
now<00:03:51.410> it's<00:03:51.620> set<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.830> come<00:03:52.130> on<00:03:52.250> with<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.730> slide

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
now it's set to come on with the slide

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.210 
now it's set to come on with the slide
but<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.420> want<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.900> come<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:54.380> on<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.650> click<00:03:55.040> by

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
but I want this to come on on a click by

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.650 
but I want this to come on on a click by
itself<00:03:55.610> so<00:03:55.850> I'm<00:03:55.940> going<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.150> set<00:03:56.330> it<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.630> on

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
itself so I'm going to set it to on

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.560 
itself so I'm going to set it to on
click<00:03:57.320> now<00:03:57.770> let's<00:03:58.040> set<00:03:58.280> transitions<00:03:59.000> for<00:03:59.300> our

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
click now let's set transitions for our

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.840 
click now let's set transitions for our
images<00:04:00.200> so<00:04:00.350> I'll<00:04:00.440> grab<00:04:00.650> my<00:04:00.680> first<00:04:01.130> image<00:04:01.400> here

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
images so I'll grab my first image here

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.090 
images so I'll grab my first image here
I'll<00:04:01.970> do<00:04:02.510> another<00:04:02.810> transition<00:04:03.560> will<00:04:03.950> do

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
I'll do another transition will do

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.670 
I'll do another transition will do
another<00:04:04.400> zoom<00:04:04.910> in<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.900> center<00:04:06.290> is<00:04:06.410> fine

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
another zoom in and the center is fine

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.280 
another zoom in and the center is fine
for<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.070> so<00:04:07.250> we'll<00:04:07.370> hit<00:04:07.550> done<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:09.020> one

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
for this so we'll hit done and this one

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.960 
for this so we'll hit done and this one
we<00:04:09.470> want<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.860> be<00:04:09.950> on<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.100> separate<00:04:10.550> click<00:04:10.790> as

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
we want to be on a separate click as

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.300 
we want to be on a separate click as
well<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.450> we<00:04:11.600> can<00:04:11.630> go<00:04:11.930> here<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.440> say<00:04:12.620> on<00:04:12.860> click

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
well so we can go here and say on click

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.910 
well so we can go here and say on click
and<00:04:13.580> then<00:04:14.180> we<00:04:14.360> can<00:04:14.540> set<00:04:14.840> our<00:04:14.990> next<00:04:15.320> transitions

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
and then we can set our next transitions

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.840 
and then we can set our next transitions
here<00:04:16.400> another<00:04:17.060> zoom<00:04:17.540> in<00:04:17.750> from<00:04:17.930> Center<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.850> one

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
here another zoom in from Center and one

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.650 
here another zoom in from Center and one
mores

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
mores

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.980 
mores
zoom<00:04:20.750> in<00:04:21.019> from<00:04:21.320> center<00:04:22.330> now<00:04:23.330> you'll<00:04:23.510> see<00:04:23.780> these

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
zoom in from center now you'll see these

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.310 
zoom in from center now you'll see these
are<00:04:24.170> kind<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.590> in<00:04:24.800> groups<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.780> what<00:04:26.780> these<00:04:27.050> are

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
are kind of in groups and what these are

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.990 
are kind of in groups and what these are
saying<00:04:27.620> here<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.760> what's<00:04:28.940> going

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
saying here is that this is what's going

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.030 
saying here is that this is what's going
to<00:04:29.120> happen<00:04:29.450> with<00:04:29.570> my<00:04:29.720> first<00:04:29.990> click<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.500> this

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
to happen with my first click and this

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.710 
to happen with my first click and this
is<00:04:31.190> what's<00:04:31.370> going<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.580> happen<00:04:31.940> with<00:04:32.090> my<00:04:32.210> second

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
is what's going to happen with my second

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.650 
is what's going to happen with my second
click<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.200> now<00:04:33.920> this<00:04:34.340> next<00:04:34.850> item<00:04:35.030> says<00:04:35.480> that

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
click and now this next item says that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.480 
click and now this next item says that
it's<00:04:35.810> going<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.020> go<00:04:36.230> with<00:04:36.530> previous<00:04:37.190> well

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
it's going to go with previous well

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.520 
it's going to go with previous well
instead<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.270> with<00:04:38.510> previous<00:04:39.050> I'm<00:04:39.290> going<00:04:39.440> to

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
instead of with previous I'm going to

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.740 
instead of with previous I'm going to
say<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.710> want<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.100> do<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.340> on<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.610> delay<00:04:41.330> because

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
say I want to do this on a delay because

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.750 
say I want to do this on a delay because
I<00:04:41.780> don't<00:04:42.080> want<00:04:42.290> all<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.650> our<00:04:42.800> items<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.370> come<00:04:43.610> in

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
I don't want all of our items to come in

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.390 
I don't want all of our items to come in
at<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.090> exact<00:04:44.420> same<00:04:44.630> time<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.320> want<00:04:45.710> them<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:45.920> be

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
at the exact same time I want them to be

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.000 
at the exact same time I want them to be
staggered<00:04:47.090> as<00:04:47.330> they<00:04:47.510> come<00:04:47.720> on<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.990> screen<00:04:48.140> so

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
staggered as they come on the screen so

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.410 
staggered as they come on the screen so
I'm<00:04:49.070> going<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.280> set<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.850> like<00:04:50.030> maybe<00:04:50.300> a

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
I'm going to set this to like maybe a

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.260 
I'm going to set this to like maybe a
point<00:04:50.980> three-second<00:04:51.980> delay<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.730> maybe<00:04:52.970> we'll

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
point three-second delay and maybe we'll

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.530 
point three-second delay and maybe we'll
set<00:04:53.540> this<00:04:53.780> one<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.800> delay<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.490> like<00:04:55.790> 0.6

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
set this one to a delay of like 0.6

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.040 
set this one to a delay of like 0.6
seconds<00:04:57.160> so<00:04:58.160> now<00:04:58.310> we<00:04:58.370> have<00:04:58.730> two<00:04:59.270> clicks<00:04:59.690> and

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
seconds so now we have two clicks and

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.990 
seconds so now we have two clicks and
the<00:05:00.290> second<00:05:00.770> click<00:05:01.040> is<00:05:01.280> going<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.610> trigger<00:05:01.880> our

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
the second click is going to trigger our

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.720 
the second click is going to trigger our
images<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.140> they're<00:05:03.530> going<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.740> come<00:05:04.010> on<00:05:04.250> one

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
images and they're going to come on one

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.520 
images and they're going to come on one
after<00:05:05.240> another<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:05.660> let's<00:05:05.870> see<00:05:06.260> how<00:05:06.380> this

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
after another so let's see how this

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.090 
after another so let's see how this
works

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
works

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.030 
works
so<00:05:07.700> let's<00:05:07.970> go<00:05:08.210> here<00:05:08.540> we'll<00:05:08.810> click<00:05:09.230> once<00:05:09.590> that's

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
so let's go here we'll click once that's

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.100 
so let's go here we'll click once that's
going<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.310> show<00:05:10.490> my<00:05:10.670> slide<00:05:11.000> second<00:05:11.930> click

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
going to show my slide second click

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.680 
going to show my slide second click
should<00:05:12.350> show<00:05:12.560> my<00:05:12.740> text<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.400> then<00:05:14.210> our<00:05:14.360> third

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
should show my text and then our third

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.260 
should show my text and then our third
click<00:05:15.050> will<00:05:15.260> show<00:05:15.560> our<00:05:15.590> images<00:05:16.340> coming<00:05:16.670> on<00:05:16.940> in

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
click will show our images coming on in

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.200 
click will show our images coming on in
order<00:05:18.200> now<00:05:18.770> if<00:05:18.890> we<00:05:19.040> wanted<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.490> take<00:05:19.670> this<00:05:19.880> one

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
order now if we wanted to take this one

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.660 
order now if we wanted to take this one
step<00:05:20.540> further<00:05:20.570> we<00:05:21.530> could<00:05:21.680> have<00:05:21.860> these<00:05:22.010> images

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
step further we could have these images

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.270 
step further we could have these images
transition<00:05:23.480> off<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:23.990> slide<00:05:24.230> and<00:05:24.800> have<00:05:25.010> some

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
transition off this slide and have some

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.370 
transition off this slide and have some
more<00:05:25.460> text<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.030> come<00:05:26.240> on<00:05:26.480> the<00:05:26.690> slide<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.200> let's

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
more text to come on the slide so let's

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.080 
more text to come on the slide so let's
see<00:05:27.530> how<00:05:27.680> we<00:05:27.740> could<00:05:27.920> do<00:05:28.070> this<00:05:28.250> so<00:05:28.910> we're<00:05:29.000> going

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
see how we could do this so we're going

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.000 
see how we could do this so we're going
to<00:05:29.150> go<00:05:29.240> back<00:05:29.450> to<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.720> editor<00:05:30.080> I'm<00:05:30.590> going<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.920> go

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
to go back to the editor I'm going to go

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.620 
to go back to the editor I'm going to go
to<00:05:31.070> this<00:05:31.250> slide<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:31.880> we<00:05:31.940> actually<00:05:32.210> have<00:05:32.330> build

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
to this slide and we actually have build

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.810 
to this slide and we actually have build
out<00:05:32.960> options<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:33.830> I'm<00:05:33.920> going<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.160> select<00:05:34.340> this

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
out options so I'm going to select this

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.630 
out options so I'm going to select this
I'm<00:05:35.240> going<00:05:35.540> to<00:05:35.600> say<00:05:35.780> build<00:05:36.169> out<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.919> we're

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
I'm going to say build out and we're

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.120 
I'm going to say build out and we're
going<00:05:37.790> to<00:05:37.850> do<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.440> fly<00:05:39.440> in<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:39.830> it's<00:05:39.980> going<00:05:40.070> to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
going to do a fly in so it's going to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.700 
going to do a fly in so it's going to
zoom<00:05:40.490> back<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:41.450> direction<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.200> came<00:05:42.410> and

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
zoom back the direction that it came and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.980 
zoom back the direction that it came and
we're<00:05:43.550> going<00:05:43.700> to<00:05:43.730> set<00:05:44.000> this<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.390> Center<00:05:44.840> and

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
we're going to set this to Center and

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.430 
we're going to set this to Center and
hit<00:05:45.590> done<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:47.030> this<00:05:47.240> will<00:05:47.419> be<00:05:47.540> my<00:05:47.720> third<00:05:47.750> click

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
hit done so this will be my third click

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.110 
hit done so this will be my third click
and<00:05:48.680> now<00:05:48.710> we<00:05:48.919> can<00:05:49.160> transition<00:05:49.550> these<00:05:49.850> other

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
and now we can transition these other

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.600 
and now we can transition these other
images<00:05:50.720> off<00:05:50.930> with<00:05:51.440> this<00:05:51.680> one<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:52.130> I'll<00:05:52.250> click

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
images off with this one so I'll click

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.530 
images off with this one so I'll click
this<00:05:52.820> one<00:05:53.060> we'll<00:05:53.690> say<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.230> zoom<00:05:55.190> or<00:05:55.400> fly<00:05:55.820> in<00:05:56.120> and

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
this one we'll say a zoom or fly in and

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.050 
this one we'll say a zoom or fly in and
we'll<00:05:56.690> say<00:05:56.900> centered<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.860> we'll<00:05:58.700> do<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:59.030> same

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
we'll say centered and we'll do the same

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.640 
we'll say centered and we'll do the same
for<00:05:59.330> this<00:05:59.720> other<00:05:59.900> one<00:06:00.169> so<00:06:00.410> we'll<00:06:00.500> do<00:06:00.620> another

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
for this other one so we'll do another

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.600 
for this other one so we'll do another
fly<00:06:01.340> in<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:01.970> set<00:06:02.240> this<00:06:02.390> to<00:06:02.450> centered<00:06:03.080> and

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
fly in and set this to centered and

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.280 
fly in and set this to centered and
again<00:06:04.610> we<00:06:04.790> can<00:06:04.970> set<00:06:05.210> these<00:06:05.390> delays<00:06:05.810> so<00:06:06.169> I'm

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
again we can set these delays so I'm

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.560 
again we can set these delays so I'm
going<00:06:06.470> to<00:06:06.530> say<00:06:06.710> after<00:06:07.610> a<00:06:07.640> delay<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.330> we'll<00:06:08.450> do

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
going to say after a delay and we'll do

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.020 
going to say after a delay and we'll do
the<00:06:08.690> same<00:06:08.720> sort<00:06:09.500> of<00:06:09.590> delay<00:06:09.919> so<00:06:09.980> we'll<00:06:10.220> do<00:06:10.370> 0.3

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
the same sort of delay so we'll do 0.3

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:18.340 
the same sort of delay so we'll do 0.3
seconds<00:06:11.540> and<00:06:13.240> 0.6<00:06:14.240> seconds<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:16.960> now<00:06:17.960> we<00:06:18.020> can

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
seconds and 0.6 seconds and now we can

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.590 
seconds and 0.6 seconds and now we can
add<00:06:18.560> our<00:06:18.590> text<00:06:19.190> back<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.790> our<00:06:19.910> slide<00:06:20.210> that<00:06:20.480> we

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
add our text back to our slide that we

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.780 
add our text back to our slide that we
want<00:06:20.870> to<00:06:20.960> transition<00:06:21.680> on<00:06:22.040> after<00:06:22.550> these<00:06:22.730> guys

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
want to transition on after these guys

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.480 
want to transition on after these guys
are<00:06:23.240> gone<00:06:23.480> so<00:06:24.290> we'll<00:06:24.530> go<00:06:24.680> back<00:06:24.860> up<00:06:24.890> here<00:06:25.340> I'm

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
are gone so we'll go back up here I'm

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.460 
are gone so we'll go back up here I'm
just<00:06:25.580> going<00:06:25.790> to<00:06:25.850> grab<00:06:26.000> this<00:06:26.390> bullet<00:06:27.020> list<00:06:27.260> that

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
just going to grab this bullet list that

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.440 
just going to grab this bullet list that
I<00:06:27.500> had<00:06:27.830> and<00:06:28.190> we're<00:06:28.370> going<00:06:28.490> to<00:06:28.580> grab<00:06:28.850> this<00:06:29.150> and

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
I had and we're going to grab this and

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.320 
I had and we're going to grab this and
add<00:06:30.289> this<00:06:30.530> to<00:06:30.590> our<00:06:30.860> slide<00:06:31.190> and<00:06:31.460> then<00:06:32.030> we<00:06:32.180> can

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
add this to our slide and then we can

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.060 
add this to our slide and then we can
just<00:06:32.510> set<00:06:32.720> a<00:06:32.750> transition<00:06:33.470> for<00:06:33.710> this

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
just set a transition for this

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.100 
just set a transition for this
to<00:06:34.190> build<00:06:34.640> in<00:06:35.000> so<00:06:35.240> we'll<00:06:35.390> set<00:06:35.600> this<00:06:35.720> to<00:06:35.870> build

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
to build in so we'll set this to build

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.590 
to build in so we'll set this to build
in<00:06:36.350> and<00:06:36.650> we're<00:06:37.550> going<00:06:37.670> to<00:06:37.700> say<00:06:38.000> that<00:06:38.030> this<00:06:38.390> is

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
in and we're going to say that this is

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.140 
in and we're going to say that this is
going<00:06:38.720> to<00:06:38.780> be<00:06:39.020> another<00:06:39.560> zoom<00:06:40.070> in<00:06:40.370> transition

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
going to be another zoom in transition

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.580 
going to be another zoom in transition
and<00:06:41.570> we're<00:06:41.690> going<00:06:41.810> to<00:06:41.840> do<00:06:42.020> this<00:06:42.200> from<00:06:42.440> the

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
and we're going to do this from the

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.490 
and we're going to do this from the
center<00:06:43.040> and<00:06:43.220> hit<00:06:44.030> done<00:06:44.330> and<00:06:44.720> we<00:06:45.050> want<00:06:45.260> this<00:06:45.440> to

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
center and hit done and we want this to

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.220 
center and hit done and we want this to
be<00:06:45.650> on<00:06:45.980> click<00:06:46.640> and<00:06:46.910> this<00:06:47.480> click<00:06:47.810> is<00:06:47.990> going<00:06:48.170> to

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
be on click and this click is going to

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.430 
be on click and this click is going to
happen<00:06:48.650> after<00:06:49.190> everything<00:06:49.760> else<00:06:49.910> so<00:06:50.840> this<00:06:51.260> is

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
happen after everything else so this is

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.590 
happen after everything else so this is
now<00:06:51.620> down<00:06:51.890> at<00:06:52.070> the<00:06:52.100> bottom<00:06:52.220> and<00:06:52.760> so<00:06:53.330> we<00:06:53.480> have

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
now down at the bottom and so we have

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.450
