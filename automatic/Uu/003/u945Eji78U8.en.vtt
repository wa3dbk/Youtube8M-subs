00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.780
 to make the tortillas here I already 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.059
 I have the chilies can unveil the 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.610
 remove the seeds to sew them or 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.910
 put them in hot water I have not 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.630
 removed nothing because I'm going to strain the 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.010
 then they are from 8 to 10 guajillo chiles 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.380
 in the glass of the blender we are going to 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.380
 place a little dry oregano 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.230
 in the pinch of cumin 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.210
 and we're going to put half a clove of garlic 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.210
 as well 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.990
 together with chilies 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.770
 we add one together with chiles no 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.110
 we are going to put salt because the salt is the 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.629
 let's put the mass this we're going to 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.250
 liquefy very very very well and we're going to 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.540
 move to a colander 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.630
 for the dough I have put three cups of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.930
 Masseca or mass is this and we're going 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.400
 to put two tablespoons this 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.400
 spoon of flour 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.730
 well let's add a pinch of salt 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.550
 we put the chili pepper that do not have 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.280
 nothing nothing nothing of seed nor 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.130
 cascarita and enough water to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
 that we have a brand and when we 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.050
 let's go chili when we are 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.110
 Straining more or less something like that looks 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.600
 here I have everything there is to strain it very well 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.990
 we are going to one more there is and if we see 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.490
 that lacks water because we add more 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.610
 after we have already cast the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.120
 chili and water if necessary 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.790
 in my case I need very, very little 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.130
 water see the consistency that the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.050
 mass so they have to stay they are going to 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.600
 stain your hands a little but there's no 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.510
 problem when I 'm here I have my 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.450
 turning machine with a bag a 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.730
 plastic and so that it does not stick we're going to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.160
 make tortillas with a medium ball 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.830
 and let's tighten them very well to me 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.200
 like to make the remaining tortillas 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.450
 thin not thick because you do not want 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.540
 more than as too rough I have 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.130
 put in the same comal as in the one 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.320
 I put the tortillas to heat the one in the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.890
 vean stove they are going inflating they have a 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.350
 color but great barbarian I do not know if the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.780
 camera catches it up and then 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.390
 back to chile it smells like adobo then 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.060
 is really rich of the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.770
 amount that I have told you before I have 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.010
 out 27 cake 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.050
 of good size a normal size and are left 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.380
 very good nothing else you have to turn the 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.450
 once and then nothing would be all 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.300
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.670
 recipe I hope they put it into practice 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.550
 truth really should try 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.070
 make tortillas with all the variants 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.010
 they have is not a total pass 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.350
 then say to them to teach you that 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.030
 others 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.910
 things can be done and nothing I see them 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.870
 in the next, take care and please 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.050
 please if they do let me know ok 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.050
