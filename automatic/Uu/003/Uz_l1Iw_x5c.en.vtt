00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.940
 to do it 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.610
 The first thing we are going to do before 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.890
 mix the flour and all the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.640
 ingredients we are going to preheat the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.280
 110-degree oven so that when 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.310
 be ready our bread is already hot 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.180

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.180
 our mix 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.350
 let's add all the flour we're going to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.790
 add the 3 eggs 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.480
 we add milk 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.560
 and we add the oil so let's 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.560
 mix all this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.880
 Now let's add the half cup of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 pineapple juice 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.530
 and we mix again 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.400
 now let's grab a bit of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.159
 butter or margarine and with this we go 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.159
 to oil our mold 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.030
 we greased it very well so that it does not 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.310
 go to paste the bread 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.030
 now we are going to add sugar 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.030
 brunette 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.290
 we are not going to scatter little by little 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.290
 here in our mold 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.450
 now let's put the pineapples 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.400
 now we are going to add cherries or 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.760
 the cherry and half of the circles of the 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.760
 pineapple 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.430
 and then we're going to add our mix 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.430
 about all this 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.360
 well here we have it ready for 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.599
 put it in the oven we will put it through 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.290
 about 20 to 25 minutes the oven has to 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.569
 be at 350 degrees so we're going to 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.770

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.810
 to stay 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.810
 well it was already cooked in our bread 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.770
 flipped pineapple to find out if it's 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.890
 cooked let's introduce a knife 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.410
 and this has to come out clean so 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.209
 when the knife is already clean 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.740
 it means that our 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:26.250
 bread and well this puts it in the oven for 30 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.490
 minutes sometimes varies somewhat time 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.150
 but hey this is already ready so what 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.150
