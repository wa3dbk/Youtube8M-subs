Brits remember this one let's get to it
all<00:00:36.269> right<00:00:36.539> first<00:00:37.050> question<00:00:37.199> is<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.859> even<00:00:38.069> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
all right first question is it even the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.770 
all right first question is it even the
right<00:00:38.280> attack<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:38.999> this<00:00:39.120> case<00:00:39.359> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
right attack and in this case with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
right attack and in this case with
gowipe<00:00:40.350> Bowie<00:00:40.769> you're<00:00:41.550> looking<00:00:41.819> for<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.999> base

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
gowipe Bowie you're looking for a base

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.669 
gowipe Bowie you're looking for a base
that<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.539> least<00:00:42.659> has<00:00:42.839> fifty<00:00:43.170> percent<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
that at least has fifty percent of it

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.349 
that at least has fifty percent of it
that's<00:00:43.889> kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.159> dense<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.819> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> risks

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
that's kind of dense not a lot of risks

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.660 
that's kind of dense not a lot of risks
with<00:00:45.479> big<00:00:45.659> bombs<00:00:45.929> or<00:00:46.319> spring<00:00:46.589> traps<00:00:46.889> and<00:00:47.159> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with big bombs or spring traps and this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.849 
with big bombs or spring traps and this
one<00:00:47.879> matches<00:00:48.089> that<00:00:48.329> profile<00:00:48.929> with<00:00:49.199> anything

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
one matches that profile with anything

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.520 
one matches that profile with anything
from<00:00:50.069> 1030<00:00:50.940> down<00:00:51.179> to<00:00:51.359> 4<00:00:51.629> 30<00:00:51.929> kind<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> being

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
from 1030 down to 4 30 kind of being

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
from 1030 down to 4 30 kind of being
pretty<00:00:52.710> well<00:00:52.920> packed<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.359> that's<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
pretty well packed in there so that's a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
pretty well packed in there so that's a
green<00:00:55.109> if<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.499> ever<00:00:55.589> saw<00:00:55.889> one<00:00:56.159> next<00:00:56.670> question

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
green if you ever saw one next question

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
green if you ever saw one next question
is<00:00:57.179> where<00:00:57.389> you're<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.659> to<00:00:57.719> attack<00:00:57.959> from<00:00:58.019> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
is where you're going to attack from and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.169 
is where you're going to attack from and
in<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.709> case<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
in this case we're actually not going to

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.699 
in this case we're actually not going to
t<00:01:00.389> duck<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.929> we<00:01:01.139> don't<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> worry

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to be make sure to do is pick the line

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
to be make sure to do is pick the line
that<00:01:17.190> enables<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.940> go<00:01:18.150> wipe<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:18.870> to<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that enables your go wipe to get to the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.930 
that enables your go wipe to get to the
mid<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.620> they<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.980> taking<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> shots

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
mid so they can be taking all the shots

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.180 
mid so they can be taking all the shots
from<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> outside<00:01:21.660> then<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.500> hog<00:01:22.680> team<00:01:22.980> can

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
from the outside then your hog team can

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.680 
from the outside then your hog team can
run<00:01:23.340> around<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> edge<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.120> distraction

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
run around the edge with the distraction

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.690 
run around the edge with the distraction
going<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.040> he<00:01:26.100> does<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.520> by

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
going on and I think he does that by

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.360 
going on and I think he does that by
coming<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.120> here<00:01:27.360> from<00:01:27.600> 830<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.010> I'm<00:01:29.100> gonna<00:01:29.220> get

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
coming in here from 830 so I'm gonna get

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.610 
coming in here from 830 so I'm gonna get
my<00:01:29.430> green<00:01:29.690> next<00:01:30.690> step<00:01:30.870> is<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.050> deploy<00:01:31.410> and<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
my green next step is a deploy and you

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.660 
my green next step is a deploy and you
want<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.800> make<00:01:31.890> sure<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.190> least<00:01:32.250> seventy

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
want to make sure at least seventy

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.550 
want to make sure at least seventy
percent<00:01:32.790> or<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.690> army<00:01:33.990> gets<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
percent or so of your army gets into the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
percent or so of your army gets into the
mid<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.220> take<00:01:35.370> that<00:01:35.580> distract<00:01:36.030> fires

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
mid so they can take that distract fires

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
mid so they can take that distract fires
i<00:01:36.390> mentioned<00:01:36.750> before<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.290> coach<00:01:38.010> o<00:01:38.160> yer<00:01:38.310> does

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
i mentioned before and coach o yer does

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.740 
i mentioned before and coach o yer does
a<00:01:38.520> good<00:01:38.760> job<00:01:38.820> i<00:01:39.030> mean<00:01:39.300> looks<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.690> little

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a good job i mean looks like a little

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.720 
a good job i mean looks like a little
chaotic<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.620> it's<00:01:40.740> i'm<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.250> sure<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.550> by

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
chaotic so it's i'm not sure if it's by

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.850 
chaotic so it's i'm not sure if it's by
plan<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.210> uppity<00:01:42.480> he<00:01:42.870> also<00:01:43.020> gets<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.380> flanking

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
plan an uppity he also gets a flanking

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
plan an uppity he also gets a flanking
team<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.550> all<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.750> if

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
team that's all right I don't know if

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
team that's all right I don't know if
flanking<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.380> both<00:01:46.560> sides<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> great<00:01:47.370> idea

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
flanking them both sides is a great idea

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
flanking them both sides is a great idea
that<00:01:48.120> which<00:01:48.390> probably<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.900> would<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.230> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that which probably I would have that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.080 
that which probably I would have that
come<00:01:49.620> out<00:01:49.800> with<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.100> Hogs<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.580> back<00:01:50.790> side

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
come out with the Hogs in the back side

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.790 
come out with the Hogs in the back side
so<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> give<00:01:52.050> me<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> yellow<00:01:52.409> overall

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
so I'm going to give me a yellow overall

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.190 
so I'm going to give me a yellow overall
here<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.310> not<00:01:53.460> bad<00:01:53.640> bell<00:01:53.880> wiseco<00:01:54.420> Joe<00:01:54.600> uses<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
here but not bad bell wiseco Joe uses to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
here but not bad bell wiseco Joe uses to
raise<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.740> drive<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.280> main<00:01:56.490> army<00:01:56.820> into<00:01:57.060> mid

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
raise to drive the main army into mid

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.790 
raise to drive the main army into mid
and<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.870> mean<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.500> heel

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
and that's good I mean and then a heel

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.890 
and that's good I mean and then a heel
to<00:01:59.040> support<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.550> as<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> goes<00:01:59.820> saving<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.720> last

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
to support it as it goes saving the last

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.420 
to support it as it goes saving the last
deal<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.440> Hogs<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.800> back<00:02:01.950> side<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:02.400> I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
deal for the Hogs in the back side so I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.950 
deal for the Hogs in the back side so I
think<00:02:02.610> overall<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.090> uses<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> spells<00:02:03.780> I'm

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
think overall good uses of spells I'm

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
think overall good uses of spells I'm
gonna<00:02:04.080> get<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.229> green<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:05.310> magic<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> the

they<00:02:23.940> huts<00:02:24.240> back<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.750> would<00:02:24.990> have<00:02:25.080> really

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
they huts back there would have really

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.860 
they huts back there would have really
helped<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.700> then<00:02:26.850> they<00:02:27.000> watch<00:02:27.480> how<00:02:27.690> much

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
helped but then they watch how much

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.660 
helped but then they watch how much
damage<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.410> Hogs<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:29.070> do<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.490> base

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
damage the Hogs actually do in the base

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.470 
damage the Hogs actually do in the base
they'll<00:02:30.510> wipe<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.200> entire<00:02:31.770> quarter

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
they'll wipe out that entire quarter

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.060 
they'll wipe out that entire quarter
because<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> distract<00:02:34.380> they're<00:02:34.830> getting

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
because of the distract they're getting

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.440 
because of the distract they're getting
from<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> column<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> Queen<00:02:36.060> there<00:02:36.330> at
