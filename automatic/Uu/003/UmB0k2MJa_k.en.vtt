you can easily run these things off of
your<00:02:01.469> car<00:02:01.740> battery<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
your car battery when you're out on the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.170 
your car battery when you're out on the
road<00:02:03.060> off<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.960> grid<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.969> nice<00:02:06.149> thing

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
road off the grid and the nice thing

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479 
road off the grid and the nice thing
about<00:02:06.450> these<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:07.170> opposed<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.890> cooler<00:02:08.310> where

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
about these as opposed to a cooler where

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.669 
about these as opposed to a cooler where
you're<00:02:08.670> relying<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.179> ice<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:10.200> actually

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
you're relying on ice these actually

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.160 
you're relying on ice these actually
generate<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.160> cold<00:02:11.550> inside<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:13.020> can

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
generate the cold inside so you can

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.300 
generate the cold inside so you can
actually<00:02:13.349> get<00:02:13.739> these<00:02:13.920> down

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
actually get these down

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.580 
actually get these down
to<00:02:14.550> zero<00:02:14.880> degrees<00:02:15.330> inside<00:02:15.750> there's<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> 90

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
to zero degrees inside there's a 90

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.010 
to zero degrees inside there's a 90
degree<00:02:16.950> difference<00:02:17.340> between<00:02:17.819> outside<00:02:18.450> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
degree difference between outside and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.260 
degree difference between outside and
ambient<00:02:19.440> temperature<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.040> these<00:02:20.220> things<00:02:20.520> so

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
ambient temperature with these things so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.809 
ambient temperature with these things so
you<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.200> using<00:02:22.470> these<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:22.980> combination<00:02:23.670> with

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
you know using these in combination with

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.740 
you know using these in combination with
a<00:02:23.849> cooler<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.510> example<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.599> use
