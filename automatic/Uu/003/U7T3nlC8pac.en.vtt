00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 another video 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.670
 Last night Apple has iOS 7 beta 2 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.860
 published and simultaneously with it 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.330
 finally the ipad version 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.799
 I have it on my ipad mini now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.549
 We want to get that installed today 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.080
 look at 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 he is currently my iphone 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 I'll say repair later 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.970
 a few words to that I can you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.970
 Unfortunately, not at the moment 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.840
 we already know most innovations 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 from ios 7 beta 1 on the iphone 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 I have a detailed video too 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.879
 you can do that up here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 you just have a look 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.920
 but now for the ipad as a whole 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.789
 of course first the complete design 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.010
 already known from 7 beta 1 just got there 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.210
 Not so much changed except that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.430
 of course, we now have one 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 number bigger on the ipad we have 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.489
 As usual, we have our whole 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.770
 animations and this complete 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.420
 simple, clean design 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.879
 if we turn it off now 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 slowly it starts slowly again 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.170
 here is the new lockscreen we can 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.439
 unlock the whole as usual and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.900
 although everywhere we want 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.580
 furthermore, we can now at ios 7 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.009
 that did not go before also from the ipad 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.460
 go straight to the camera app was there 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.979
 previously only a picture frame function 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.950
 basically, that a small renewal for 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.420
 Have 7 beta 1 at this whole slider 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 We are so fine now that one 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.090
 really, aha, i have to know that in the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.040
 push direction 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 especially so with these clothes 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.619
 this is on everyone when you turn off 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.960
 case useful so that you can see really well 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.180
 is that something where I have to be or is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.110
 that's where I have to tap that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.759
 was a bit before that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.250
 I find everyone confusing now 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.079
 If so, then let's have a look 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.619
 into the new multitasking 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.180
 that is very fluid in any case 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.610
 already that's really good, I have to say 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.610
 we can now just post an app 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 push out the top we can now too 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.509
 just then stop back here again 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 homescreen we still have the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.659
 whole app animation if we have now 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.060
 on 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.310
 then open the stop from the point 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.800
 out on and on this point again 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.209
 and we have already here 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.730
 have seen the completely new 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.230
 design everything looks very simple 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.650
 any case good and I like that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.670
 here on the ipad also really pretty good 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.730
 Let's take a quick look at a few 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.040
 apps for example in the camera app there 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.239
 you see me just here, for example 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.549
 above we can turn the camera then 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.190
 Ok, so it seems to the little bug 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.049
 Well , it's definitely going to happen now 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.720
 we can vote down here now 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.239
 between all the modes video foto and 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.709
 now also the new square mode of the 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.319
 now also in German renamed 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.250
 in total, several were 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.470
 Translation mistake there a bit 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.970
 gefixed so we had before often times 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.940
 At this point , there was something English 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.400
 stood there is now mostly over 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.260
 all the german and correct word the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.060
 Music app for example is natural 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.709
 also completely in a new design 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.180
 if we sing any song now 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.250
 call 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.019
 which of course we do not play now 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.780
 this is definitely how the new player looks 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.790
 now off we open a few more 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.269
 Another is that we still have to go 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.230
 For example, in the watch app 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.579
 it looks that way too 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.519
 not changed that much now 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:30.019
 Let's go to the calendar like that 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.000
 he also has a very nice design 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.299
 we can get up here 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.760
 yes month week day that's it too 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.099
 not bad then of course here 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.139
 Below our control center also looks 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.889
 really fancy it on the ipad 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.359
 I like it 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.680
 but we still see that for example 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.669
 a little wobbly is now standing 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.530
 the title in the music controls 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.139
 that's not how it should be in there 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.690
 okay then we have ours from above 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.880
 notification center here with today 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.720
 view with the calendar the appointment and 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.000
 so on 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.129
 then the notifications resp 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.829
 missed notifications if you have the 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:10.160
 which has those are in the rough and 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.319
 all the first so the innovations like us 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.150
 actually already 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.370
 changes in quotes we 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.289
 but still have siri with one 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.280
 male voice and also a new one 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:28.840
 We just make series for women 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:30.400
 hello you have the male now 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.389
 voice is a bit 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.800
 a matter of taste 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.970
 the male sounds easy 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.300
 robot moderately on so a bit weird 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.229
 is that but the female also has one 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.000
 get update 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.820
 we have to go here for a short time 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.440
 attitude to siri and need 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:53.009
 sex change to female like 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.009
 it will be the weather 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.139
 I do not know if you like it now 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.060
 is a bit of a matter of taste 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.800
 I thought that was true before 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.449
 more pleasant so at least the female 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.310
 like male I do not think bad 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.820
 it's just a bit like that 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.380
 getting used to it if you want that before 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.990
 did not know that right now 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.930
 By and large , therefore, only one 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.280
 few bugs fixed a few 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.250
 Corrected translation errors and here 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.050
 and there a small innovation installed 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.789
 Siri with the new votes is here 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.039
 certainly the biggest at least here 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.110
 the ipad on the iphone still exists 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.210
 now the new memo app we spoke 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.270
 from ios six all already know the but 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.710
 where u 7 beta 1 was gone at once 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.030
 Now she is back in one 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.360
 send new design with nice 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.740
 animations and then look at us 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.630
 Maybe soon if my iphone 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.030
 that's it, that's it 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.220
 Write a few comments if you too 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.849
 an ipad with ios win already used 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.949
 or 17 on the ipad like and so 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.630
 continue and then I would say if 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.639
 you liked the video shows it with 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.110
 a thumb up or through the 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.599
 subscribe button if you have no further 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.960
 want to miss videos and then to the 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.960
 next time
