did<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> play<00:01:19.710> against<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.220> had

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
did get to play against you know you had

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.640 
did get to play against you know you had
to<00:01:20.640> respect<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> scramble<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> way<00:01:22.619> that

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
to respect the scramble so the way that

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
to respect the scramble so the way that
you<00:01:22.979> prepared<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.520> him<00:01:23.729> wouldn't<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you prepared for him wouldn't be the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.359 
you prepared for him wouldn't be the
same<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.110> prepared<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:25.979> somebody

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
same way that you prepared for somebody
