tires we're going to carry out two tests
the<00:00:45.059> first<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> braking<00:00:46.079> test<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.680> will

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the first is a braking test which will

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
the first is a braking test which will
show<00:00:47.010> clearly<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> difference<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.059> stopping

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
show clearly the difference in stopping

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.959 
show clearly the difference in stopping
distances<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> two<00:00:49.440> tires<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.520> second

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
distances for the two tires the second

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.850 
distances for the two tires the second
is<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> cornering<00:00:51.690> test<00:00:51.930> which<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.469> show<00:00:52.649> how

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
is a cornering test which will show how

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
is a cornering test which will show how
effective<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.489> different<00:00:53.879> eyes<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.270> at

effective the different eyes are at
gripping<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.079> cold<00:00:55.350> conditions

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 

so<00:01:02.789> let's<00:01:03.329> show<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> difference<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.290> to

so let's show the difference with to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 
so let's show the difference with to
virtually<00:01:04.979> identical<00:01:05.549> purges<00:01:06.000> except<00:01:06.659> the

the<00:03:00.410> winter<00:03:00.710> tires<00:03:00.950> let's<00:03:01.610> see<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
the winter tires let's see the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.460 
the winter tires let's see the
difference<00:03:02.030> again<00:03:02.360> from<00:03:02.810> our<00:03:02.930> overhead

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
difference again from our overhead

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.280 
difference again from our overhead
camera<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.880> same<00:03:05.090> entry<00:03:05.390> speed<00:03:05.690> the

camera so the same entry speed the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.140 
camera so the same entry speed the
winter<00:03:06.650> tires<00:03:06.860> guide<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.370> driver<00:03:07.580> safely

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
winter tires guide the driver safely

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.820 
winter tires guide the driver safely
round<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.480> corner<00:03:08.870> while<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.350> car<00:03:09.560> equipped

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
round the corner while the car equipped

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.740 
round the corner while the car equipped
with<00:03:09.980> summer<00:03:10.250> tires<00:03:10.520> loses<00:03:11.120> control<00:03:11.330> and

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
with summer tires loses control and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.940 
with summer tires loses control and
takes<00:03:11.870> out<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.500> cones

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
takes out the cones

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.460 
takes out the cones
so<00:03:13.550> remember<00:03:14.030> winter<00:03:14.570> tires<00:03:14.780> are<00:03:15.020> not<00:03:15.200> just

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
so remember winter tires are not just

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.650 
so remember winter tires are not just

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
for driving in arctic conditions they

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.420 
for driving in arctic conditions they
work<00:03:17.870> much<00:03:18.170> better<00:03:18.200> than<00:03:18.530> summer<00:03:18.890> tires<00:03:19.160> and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
work much better than summer tires and

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.760 
work much better than summer tires and
