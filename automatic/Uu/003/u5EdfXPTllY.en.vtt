00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.600
Saint Petersburg is gloomy

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.300
Saint Petersburg is bleak

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.300
My underwear got frozen
standing here all week

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.000
Since the revolution
our lives have been so grey

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.200
Thank goodness for the gossip
that gets us through the day. Hey

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.900
Have you heard, there's a rumor in Saint Petersburg?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.900
Have you heard, what they're saying on the street?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
Although the Tsar did not survive

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.400
One daughter may be still alive

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.100
The Princess Anastasia

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
But please do not repeat

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.400
It's a rumor, a legend, a mystery

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.400
Something whispered in an alleyway
or through a crack

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.400
It's a rumor that's part of our history

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.000
They say her royal grandmamma
will pay a royal sum

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.200
To someone who can bring the princess back

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.400
Vlad!

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.200
Dimitri!

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500
A rouble for this painting

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.600
It's Romanov, I swear

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.600
Count Yusupov's pyjamas. Comrades, buy the pair

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.100
I got this from the palace, it's lined with real fur

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.100
It could be worth a fortune if it belonged to her

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.200
Well, Dimitri, I got us a theatre.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.000
Everything's going according to plan.
All we need is the girl.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.500
Just think, Vlad, no more forging papers,
no more stolen goods.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.700
We'll have three tickets out of here,
One for you,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.100
one for me and one for Anastasia!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.300
It's the rumor, the legend, the mystery

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.100
It's the Princess Anastasia who will help us fly

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.200
You and I, friend, will go down in history

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.200
We'll find a girl to play the part and teach her what to say

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.400
Dress her up and take her to Paree

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.700
Imagine the reward her dear old grandmamma will pay

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.000
Who else could pull it off but you and me?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.900
- We'll be rich
- We'll be rich

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:35.784
- We'll be out
- We'll be out

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.600
And Saint Petersburg will have some more to talk about

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.100
Have you heard, there's a rumor in Saint Petersburg?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.600
Have you heard, what they're saying on the street?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.511
Hey

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:55.200
Hey

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.400
Hey

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.100
Have you heard, there's a rumor in Saint Petersburg?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.400
Have you heard, comrades, what do you suppose?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.700
- A fascinating mystery
- The biggest con in history

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.900
The Princess Anastasia

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.400
Alive or dead?

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.200
Who knows? Shh!
