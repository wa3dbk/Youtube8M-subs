press<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.890> flat

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.959 

then<00:00:36.289> I<00:00:36.379> can<00:00:36.559> peel<00:00:36.769> everything<00:00:37.309> off<00:00:37.670> and

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
then I can peel everything off and

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.290 
then I can peel everything off and
remove<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.629> textured<00:00:39.050> disc

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
if your disc doesn't come out round you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.340 
if your disc doesn't come out round you
can<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.790> circle<00:00:48.090> template<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.840> refine<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
can use a circle template to refine the

then<00:00:51.840> drape<00:00:52.080> the<00:00:52.260> slab<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> drawing<00:00:53.070> form

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
then drape the slab on the drawing form

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.450 
then drape the slab on the drawing form
and<00:00:53.700> smooth<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.510> sides<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.110> fit<00:00:55.290> in<00:00:55.470> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and smooth down the sides to fit in this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
and smooth down the sides to fit in this
takes<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.790> bit<00:00:56.970> of<00:00:57.060> finesse<00:00:57.240> because<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.990> I

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
takes a bit of finesse because as I

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.650 
takes a bit of finesse because as I
smooth<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.710> side<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> other<00:00:59.220> pops<00:00:59.700> up<00:01:00.000> this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
smooth one side the other pops up this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.780 
smooth one side the other pops up this
is<00:01:00.870> similar<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> stone<00:01:02.010> setting<00:01:02.430> where<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.580> work

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
is similar to stone setting where I work

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.510 
is similar to stone setting where I work
the<00:01:02.940> opposites<00:01:03.540> at<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.840> same<00:01:04.050> time<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.800> want<00:01:05.489> to

just smooth and be very careful that I

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.140 
just smooth and be very careful that I
use<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> delicate<00:01:08.250> touch<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.660> go<00:01:11.150> different

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
use a delicate touch as I go different

clay also has an effect on how it
behaves<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:19.020> keep<00:01:19.200> working<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.800> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
behaves I just keep working it and

my two halves are dry so now I need to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.560 
my two halves are dry so now I need to
sand<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.659> edges<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.680> fit<00:01:40.890> together

equally then when both sides are flat

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.270 
equally then when both sides are flat
put<00:02:11.780> them<00:02:11.930> together<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.590> make<00:02:12.950> sure<00:02:13.130> that

using a little bit of water and I like a
small<00:02:36.350> disc<00:02:36.620> because<00:02:36.950> no<00:02:37.100> matter<00:02:37.310> what<00:02:37.580> size

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
small disc because no matter what size

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.699 
small disc because no matter what size
my<00:02:38.000> mixing<00:02:38.420> plate<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.959> paste<00:02:39.200> ends<00:02:39.590> up

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
my mixing plate is the paste ends up

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.130 
my mixing plate is the paste ends up
over<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> whole<00:02:40.310> thing<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.970> small<00:02:41.720> surface

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
over the whole thing so small surface

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.440 
over the whole thing so small surface
more<00:02:42.380> control

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
more control

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.839

then<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.470> brush<00:02:45.680> over<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.040> edges<00:02:46.430> with<00:02:46.580> water

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
then I brush over the edges with water

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.509 
then I brush over the edges with water
just<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.300> help<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.599> paste<00:02:47.840> bond<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:49.370> use

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
just to help the paste bond and I use

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.890 
just to help the paste bond and I use
the<00:02:49.640> pallet<00:02:50.000> knife<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.390> spread<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.660> little

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900

paste<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.440> one<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.550> beat<00:02:52.700> edges<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.239> don't

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
paste on one of the beat edges I don't

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.320

need<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.629> do<00:02:53.750> both<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.260> one<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.590> them<00:02:54.769> and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
need to do both just one of them and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.380 
need to do both just one of them and
then<00:02:56.330> put<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.750> halves<00:02:56.989> together<00:02:58.060> these<00:02:59.060> guys

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390
