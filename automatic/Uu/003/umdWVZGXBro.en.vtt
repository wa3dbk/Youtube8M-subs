00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 good afternoon everyone today audrey that 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.759
 I come here to present a new trick 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.059
 there goes video 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.610
 this trick is basically the closing of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.389
 the return to the index is exactly what 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.389
 same but the other way around 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.780
 well you have already seen how it is the turn 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.780
 to the index 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.289
 is linked to the tutorial in the 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.770
 description I will explain it here because 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.480
 if it's not going to be very long the video well 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.690
 Well, as I said, the closure is 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.470
 exactly the same but in reverse there 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.750
 a small change if at the beginning good 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.780
 apart from that the knife is open since 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.550
 it's a close is a new drawer is let's go 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.860
 to have it horizontally and looking 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.440
 well up because because being 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.420
 slightly inclined it may happen 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.359
 this and we do not want this to happen 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.440
 then comes initial position 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.589
 horizontal and grade that cuts looking 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.149
 up as feed see here by 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.180
 the index on the handle of an insurance 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:13.170
 that fits here room to spare 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.890
 the return to the index and we will proceed 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.820
 let's go then with this doll moment 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.820
 make the butterfly 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.440
 It did not happen to me because I was doing it on camera 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.440
 slow 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.299
 let's make the butterfly go through 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.299
 above the index 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.659
 or the name of the figure indicates return to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.659
 line 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.680
 I repeat in this position we do like this and it 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.840
 place the butterfly on top of the Indian you see 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.330
 in placed here on the side staying 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.330
 short you worry and it is retained by the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.640
 second finger is worth this is with the stick the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.150
 second step let's push the butterfly 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.150
 towards there 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.190
 and again in the same clamp is now worth 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.430
 what we are going to do is put here the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.319
 thumb and basically put all the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.810
 fingers below 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.110
 just as it does once we have this 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 grip 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.490
 let's put the finger and sorry the thumb 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.890
 index in the typical clip of in the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.360
 side of the safe and last montgÃ³ 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.300
 pretty obvious moment we are going to close them 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.700
 and we have closed the return to the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.629
 index 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.629
 recapitulated 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.560
 worker who carries looking towards 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.450
 held up with the thumb clamp 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.030
 index on the safe handle with sites 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.470
 spare for the return here 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.470
 we turn the index 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.720
 is already placed here tightly pressed before 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.150
 the two fingers the side that does not count here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.170
 and no door 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.830
 we put the dough on the other side 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.260
 here 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.120
 me to give time when I'm already in 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.870
 this position I put my thumb here to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.629
 small trick 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.069
 so that when in this position 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.540
 I only need to put my fingers here 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.010
 and put 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.109
 then the clip by index on the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.090
 through the handle the insurance and then 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.440
 land 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.099
 ok as you see is exactly the opposite 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.819
 to the opening of the return to cris 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.670
 exactly what is it worth 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.260
 very simple trick I think I do not have 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.819
 nothing else they did like that if you have 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.109
 questions you can ask in the forum or 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.909
 in the comments that same video 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.909
 thanks for looking until next time
