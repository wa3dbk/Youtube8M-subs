00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
you see that you have a distance meter

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.770 
you see that you have a distance meter
that<00:01:03.120> lets<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.630> how<00:01:03.990> you're<00:01:04.530> doing<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
then if you see if I can grab it not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.490 
then if you see if I can grab it not
really<00:01:13.370> ah<00:01:14.570> trying<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> grab<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.170> coin

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
really ah trying to grab that coin

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.330 
really ah trying to grab that coin
because<00:01:17.210> every<00:01:18.210> coin<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.750> grab<00:01:19.340> adds

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
because every coin that you grab adds

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.090 
because every coin that you grab adds
another<00:01:20.810> hundred<00:01:21.810> points<00:01:22.290> or<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.800> hundred

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
another hundred points or a hundred

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.480 
another hundred points or a hundred
meters<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.150> score<00:01:24.870> so<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.310> goal

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
meters to your score so the goal
