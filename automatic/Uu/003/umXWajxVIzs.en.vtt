00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.050
 of myths and lies 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.199

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.320
 I'm going to make a horror string like that 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.030
 It is a suspense string of fear and not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.940

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.100
 the night Mexico time so do 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.899
 your conversions and it will be very good 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 because we're going to be carrying like this 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.759
 wait, I heard it at 10 o'clock at night 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.440
 Mexico time very well but for the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.710
 first myth of the week we're going to have 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.050
 to mendoza a succulent myth if 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.759
 you ask for an air attack you can kill the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.210
 pilot before he does the bombing 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.009
 eye only the pilot does not destroy the house 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.110
 there is so that the uncle talent does not see with the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.509
 lack of chabelo so thank you uncle 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.509
 chabelo taking a palette or I do not know who 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.190
 you were and how can you see there we have the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.679
 the flare where the air attack is 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.690
 but I want to tell you that it's super super 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.850
 difficult this and this is the best thing that 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.590
 I got and the best they're going to get to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 see this myth as you can see it is already 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.369
 at night here comes early in the morning 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.470
 so we tried it many times and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.510
 a lot of eye here in the photo where I'm going to 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
 take what they are seeing there 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.670
 it is the plane that there is also the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.190
 jet that out of nowhere appeared where 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.530
 after many and trying times and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.480
 taking flares finally 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.920
 I managed to see where the jet was not sure if 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
 the following on screen until almost 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.700
 in front of my house is almost opposite 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.980
 Ninth my house and see it Anaya 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.320
 everyone is the one we 're shooting read and 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.850
 that house is the plane there hits a 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.580
 missile my friend hits another missile my 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.410
 friend incredibly the jet does not 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.660
 destroy as you can see it is not destroyed 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.090
 until it is falling too much and there yes 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.820
 and he broke into pieces to fall but 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.430
 well here the important part is that you 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.010
 myth is impossible black you tell me in 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.630
 first we kill the pure pilot but 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.910
 well before that I want to press the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.760
 picture and I want to make your teachers clouds 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.650
 they see something I do not see anything now 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.330
 we go back to the image and we 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.480
 we do again add the clouds and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.130
 the house appears so the cast appears 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.950
 out of nowhere and I do not know if they can not see 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.560
 but the house already very fast arrives 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.270
 bombing so it's impossible to be able 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.960
 arrive before the case before 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.420
 bombing and still kill him 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.300
 well our next myth is going to be of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.920
 walter miguel such myth or what but if 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.080
 you call the policemen's firemen 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.510
 when the cops arrive and you strip him 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.120
 a Molotov cocktail at a police 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.560
 firefighters try to help you hashtag 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.390
 law so you see it hashtag greetings 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.550
 from Argentina until Miss 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.950
 talent is very good hashtag good 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.570
 hashtag because many hashtags hashtag 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.250
 I know that my girlfriend is very good 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.680
 hashtag why I'm with my girlfriend 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.720
 hashtag yes yes it's good hashtag let's go 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.240
 already with the myth so how can you see 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.520
 now here is all this explosion 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.890
 all these cars lighting up and eye 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.690
 the firefighters arrive but the firefighters 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.400
 they got the ones in the back I do not know 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.190
 if they noticed but the firefighters of 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.040
 back they went down fast fast fast 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.810
 quickly and quickly so good now 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.220
 let's do the same street as they can 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.720
 see here the firemen there were 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.130
 starred I had not realized 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.870
 that there was no fire from here 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.670
 I tell you that when we teach the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.740
 obviously, there is not going to be a police 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.450
 no one to save us because this because 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.670
 the firemen a subscriber who arrive at the 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.650
 area where they are all burning in 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.720
 instead of saving the cops going to 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.850
 escape so the myth 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.830
 right now I tell you that it is a false myth and 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.020
 that the fire department is too much 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.630
 fear of being the heroes and they will escape 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.120
 our next myth is from alan 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.880
 if you put gasoline at 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.710
 tips of the blades of a helicopter 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.380
 then sets them on fire and took off the 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.920
 helicopter the blades are turned off by the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.750
 wind with forty-something the xxxvi 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.790
 those of greater area has alan made so 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.190
 that's why I took this one that interested me the 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.800
 myth as you can see we are up here 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.290
 of the helicopter blades and we're going to 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.510
 fill the gas can and a lot 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.490
 eye that gasoline does not fall for 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.250
 down that is something that did not impress that 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.710
 gasoline does not transfer to him as 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.110
 He explained it looks like I will not be 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.720
 I was not throwing fire at the blades 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.640
 but gasoline does not cross now 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.160
 when we turn on the blades I go to 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.960
 turn on the helicopter to try 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.940
 start the rotor and all the 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.880
 blades and as you can see I'm trying 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.190
 to extinguish them by the wind or by something 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.070
 that must be of physics and we achieve 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.139
 turn off the helicopter's propellers 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.479
 now let's do it 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.419
 start the helicopter to see if 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.490
 this myth is true or is false or what 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.740
 It is what will then happen again 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.629
 forgiveness we press again we press him 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.659
 we put gasoline here to the part of the 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.999
 propellers and let's do the same thing we're going to 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.520
 see how this works without the 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.919
 helicopter is running without there 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.319
 wind or something but how can you see the same 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.419
 it goes off so I think many fake 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.569
 since it does not matter if you are windy or 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.270
 without wind, our fire goes out 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.000
 next myth is of fatality or take 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.659
 malone you can hit a c4 a policeman 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.419
 the one with the most likes is fucking with 85 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.159
 likes turning all fatality the most 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.349
 fucking of the week I'm sorry fatal and 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.629
 you have the most fucking of these weeks like this 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.849
 how good can my friend see there? 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:58.129
 he throws the c4 and asks the cops 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.569
 they even kill him then I do it so 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.639
 let's do it again this time with 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.270
 another policeman and when I look at the 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.589
 window los cuatros traspasa al policía 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.020
 pass on to our friends piglets 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:11.240
 so as you can see here in this there 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.970
 a second where they pierce and bounce 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.290
 the four 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.600
 takeoff if you can not find a 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.060
 back and you will fall in love 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.090
 for the last method does aexca have 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.620
 fear myth drill is based on a car 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.320
 in the first person and you look in the mirror 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.880
 rear-view mirror while someone is following you 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.210
 see the person a car that is going 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.100
 following with 71 likes and this in the middle of 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.360
 the ancestor week seems to me because 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.520
 remember that I tell you that there are times 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.000
 I do not spare time or something and I keep 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.590
 the myths as well as you can see here 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.330
 I bring my bolt and that is convertible 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.550
 so there's nothing that does not leave me 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.470
 see the part of the roof or something like that and 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.230
 can see the mirrors as it looks 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.270
 the flashing light of my friend that brings 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.030
 the motorcycle and what the 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.250
 truck eye with that there we have as 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.990
 that a good part now let's see if 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.880
 these people who are going to pass by 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.920
 towards me they come to open the recoil 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.990
 we see the mirror we see the mirror 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.210
 natural and you do not see anything you do not see the 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.130
 right so I said good let's go to 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.170
 do it different, put yourself behind me 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.850
 my friends are now behind me 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.150
 how are you watching there and I see the 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:19.100
 rearview mirror and den realizes that no no 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.120
 knows nothing there is no difference so the 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.120
 route is going to be false 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:27.500
 very good my crumbs because that has been all 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.509
 in the myths and lies of today 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.460
 I hope you liked it remember that 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.259

 the myths that they want and remember that 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.990
