linearity issues that I'm sure are due
to<00:03:02.680> due<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.700> bad<00:03:03.910> capacitors<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:05.790> mean<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.000> set

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
to due to bad capacitors I mean this set

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.250 
to due to bad capacitors I mean this set
is<00:03:07.540> 34<00:03:08.290> years<00:03:08.620> old<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.400> time<00:03:09.670> for<00:03:09.700> some

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
is 34 years old so it's time for some

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.810 
is 34 years old so it's time for some
capacitors<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.320> start<00:03:11.740> failing<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.550> so

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
capacitors to start failing in it so

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.590 
capacitors to start failing in it so
I'll<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.050> look<00:03:14.230> into<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.680> soon<00:03:18.600> either

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
I'll have to look into that soon either

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.770 
I'll have to look into that soon either

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.220 

you<00:03:46.030> must<00:03:46.390> bring<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> ball<00:03:46.990> back

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.250 

I<00:03:51.790> wished<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.970> could<00:03:53.150> show<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.600> inside<00:03:54.230> of

I wished I could show you the inside of
this<00:03:54.590> TV<00:03:54.920> but<00:03:57.910> release<00:03:59.020> or<00:04:00.020> I<00:04:00.050> have<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.560> at<00:04:00.680> the

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
this TV but release or I have it at the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.090 
this TV but release or I have it at the
moment<00:04:00.980> it's<00:04:01.340> really<00:04:01.460> not<00:04:01.730> conducive<00:04:03.010> for<00:04:04.010> me

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
moment it's really not conducive for me

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.010 
moment it's really not conducive for me
to<00:04:04.220> pull<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.580> out<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:04.730> open<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.270> up<00:04:05.420> right<00:04:05.780> now

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
to pull it out and open it up right now

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.260 
to pull it out and open it up right now
but<00:04:06.520> pretty<00:04:07.520> easy<00:04:07.790> just<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.330> flat<00:04:08.600> single<00:04:09.170> board

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
but pretty easy just a flat single board

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.900 
but pretty easy just a flat single board

I'm<00:04:17.630> sure<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.079> thing<00:04:18.440> will<00:04:18.650> keep<00:04:18.890> going<00:04:19.130> for

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
I'm sure this thing will keep going for

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.220 
I'm sure this thing will keep going for
another<00:04:19.609> thirty<00:04:20.570> some-odd<00:04:20.930> years<00:04:22.900> okay<00:04:23.900> there
