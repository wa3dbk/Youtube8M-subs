00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.270
 three generators 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 the damaged journey 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.580
 Yes 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.430
 these paths 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.729
 what friends rave stone I hope that 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.040
 you're fine today we get 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.570
 found as you could see after 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.580
 cinematics to make it a small 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.759
 video this comparative between halo 3 which 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.259
 know who is safe pardon the master 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.440
 chief summer collection at the three 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.470
 So bad classics of the xbox 360 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.310
 so you have left halo 3 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.260
 of the xbox one and right the halo 3 of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.010
 our 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.740
 console old gen so the 360 ​​then the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.810
 first point that I might have noticed 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.400
 on this comparison very frankly already 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.320
 for me the gameplay 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.000
 the gameplay so I explained you 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.770
 just why the few points for 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.390
 me who are evoked on the gameplay 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.960
 it's just 60 fps 60 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.000
 fps does really feel halo 3 on 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.770
 masterchef collection so on a long 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.820
 massage suppression is much more 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.800
 fluid and I find it much faster 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.140
 doc in all his movements in the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.540
 way to reload dash etc and it gets 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.360
 really makes one feel during when 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.310
 year ii of some fighting against 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.570
 covered etc 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.930
 another point that you will notice 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.209
 the play of light the lights is 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.180
 absolutely better on halo master 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.340
 collection I found exactly halo 3 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.430
 by thinking back and looking at them 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.630
 little bit better a bit too dark 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.180
 hamidou and it's true that we joined there 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.030
 to the favorite mission he has in this 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.880
 slow frame on the macif collection on 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.870
 immediately see the difference in everything 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.850
 case at the level of clarity 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.160
 despite that they have not touch them 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.980
 to the graphics absolutely not but I 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.890
 find that grass the vehicles 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.500
 like the warthog 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.670
 the weapons are just nicer to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.220
 watch because the gameplay more 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.740
 quick and better suited perhaps to this 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.800
 we have what we did not have before 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.630
 to say the xbox one personally finally 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.560
 that's what I was able to play 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.720
 I still find it more suitable for stx 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.900
 om box because that's game 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.310
 fluidity and that's also the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.000
 ships to take in hand the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.410
 kinematic 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.820
 as you could see at the very beginning 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.120
 I personally think we see 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.180
 better 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.030
 the andrh when the pelicans arrives on 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.210
 the place on the place of or to deposit 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.910
 we see them through the backfield and I 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.140
 find them really finally I find 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.720
 really the map is better say 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.970
 better drawn - pixelized perhaps 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.880
 less blur also than on halo 3 is this 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.820
 only because it's the mass-start 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.410
 connection and the xbox one I'm 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.710
 lost no I do not think so frankly very 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.460
 frankly I'm pretty surprised 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:12.820
 just that the 1080p and 60 species shows 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.870
 so much of a difference that's 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.060
 Truly unbelievable 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.510
 this is what a tiny video 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.730
 quick on a small comparative halo 3 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.870
 and halo 3 of the star title elections 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.360
 whose carlo my amazement 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.040
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.430
 found again very soon for new 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.360
 videos 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.360
 it was obvious tons
