00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.350
 hello welcome to my channel abc today you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.459
 I'm going to teach how to make lettuce in bread 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.539
 We're going to use a breast kilo 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:22.169
 you have to frame it and let it drain 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.710
 We are going to use ground bread and I use 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:28.820
 of this because I feel that it does not leave much 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.689
 does not absorb a lot of oil 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.550
 they gave me this is I'm going to 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.750
 add but you can use the one 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.820
 more you like three eggs 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.650

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.739
 pepper powder and half a teaspoon of 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.739
 Salt

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.440
 let's add a teaspoon of 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 mustard the average is over so I'm going 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 to throw all that I have 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.610

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.030

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.220
 The condiments 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.120

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.120
 minutes 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.150
 well after we 've left it 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.000
