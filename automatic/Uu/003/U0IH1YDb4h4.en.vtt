and<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.920> graphics<00:01:29.400> card<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.150> ready<00:01:30.420> for

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and your graphics card will be ready for

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.399 
and your graphics card will be ready for
it<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.530> support<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> r9<00:01:33.720> 270x

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it to support it with the r9 270x

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.880 
it to support it with the r9 270x
alright<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.430> let's<00:01:35.610> move<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> unboxing

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
alright so let's move to the unboxing

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
alright so let's move to the unboxing
now<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.400> has<00:01:38.640> already<00:01:38.939> been<00:01:39.270> opened<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
now this one has already been opened and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
now this one has already been opened and
I<00:01:39.900> suspect<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:40.979> Paul<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.549> been

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I suspect it's because Paul has been

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.590 
I suspect it's because Paul has been
doing<00:01:42.649> overclocking<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.880> anyways

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
doing overclocking with it but anyways

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.980 
doing overclocking with it but anyways

heat pipes which are plainly visible but
if<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.019> take<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> closer<00:03:13.530> look<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.010> can

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
if you take a closer look you can

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.030 
if you take a closer look you can
definitely<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.780> technology<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.799> how

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040

it disperses the heat out over the open
design<00:03:20.100> here<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:22.609> air

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
design here so you can see that the air

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.590 
design here so you can see that the air
from<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.359> actually<00:03:24.780> going<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:26.600> moved

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
from this is actually going to be moved

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.379 
from this is actually going to be moved
out<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.170> card<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.739> into<00:03:29.190> your<00:03:29.370> PC<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.120> make

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
out of the card and into your PC so make

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.270 
out of the card and into your PC so make
sure<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.959> you're<00:03:31.139> aware<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.130> it's

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
sure that you're aware of that that it's

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.620 
sure that you're aware of that that it's
not<00:03:32.459> going<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:32.760> come<00:03:32.910> out<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> back<00:03:33.389> of<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
not going to come out of the back of the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.150 
not going to come out of the back of the
PC<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.230> that's<00:03:34.319> where<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> secondary

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
PC and that's where the secondary

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.520 
PC and that's where the secondary
cooling<00:03:35.549> obviously<00:03:36.540> comes<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.139> from<00:03:37.440> your

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
cooling obviously comes in from your

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.420 
cooling obviously comes in from your
case<00:03:38.239> now<00:03:39.410> let's<00:03:40.410> move<00:03:40.799> around<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.250> talk<00:03:41.400> a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
case now let's move around and talk a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.280 
case now let's move around and talk a
little<00:03:41.760> bit<00:03:41.940> more<00:03:42.150> about<00:03:42.359> some<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> specs

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
little bit more about some of the specs

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.259 
little bit more about some of the specs
and<00:03:43.470> features<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.340> card<00:03:44.579> all<00:03:44.970> right<00:03:45.030> so

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
and features of the card all right so

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.699 
and features of the card all right so
here<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.720> back<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.079> see<00:03:46.200> some<00:03:46.560> more

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
here on the back you can see some more

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.190 
here on the back you can see some more
matte<00:03:47.040> black<00:03:47.370> on<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> PCB<00:03:48.389> which<00:03:48.750> kind<00:03:49.079> of

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
matte black on the PCB which kind of

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.229 
matte black on the PCB which kind of
complements<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.980> overall<00:03:50.459> look<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.910> card

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
complements the overall look of the card

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.990 
complements the overall look of the card
the<00:03:51.620> GPU<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.739> attached<00:03:53.069> here<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.760> other

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
the GPU is attached here on the other

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.150 
the GPU is attached here on the other
side<00:03:54.290> it's<00:03:55.290> worth<00:03:55.470> mentioning<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:56.010> this

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
side it's worth mentioning that this

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.539 
side it's worth mentioning that this
card<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.639> based<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.359> HD<00:03:57.870> 7870<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.370> has<00:03:59.519> a

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
card is based on the HD 7870 so it has a

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.520

card so this one comes with a DVI I and
a<00:05:16.170> DVID<00:05:16.950> let<00:05:17.310> me<00:05:17.400> turn<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.610> over<00:05:17.820> actually<00:05:18.330> so

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
a DVID let me turn it over actually so

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.090 
a DVID let me turn it over actually so
it<00:05:18.630> can<00:05:18.780> be<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.350> way<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.770> when<00:05:19.950> its

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
it can be the way it is when its

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.320 
it can be the way it is when its
installed<00:05:20.250> in<00:05:20.520> your<00:05:20.550> computer<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.090> can<00:05:21.150> take

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
installed in your computer you can take

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.240 
installed in your computer you can take
a<00:05:21.360> look<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:21.990> here<00:05:22.020> at<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.410> top<00:05:22.590> we<00:05:22.710> have<00:05:22.740> dvi-i

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
a look so here at the top we have dvi-i

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.040 
a look so here at the top we have dvi-i
which<00:05:23.730> will<00:05:23.910> cover<00:05:24.090> you<00:05:24.330> if<00:05:24.480> you<00:05:24.630> still<00:05:24.900> have

which will cover you if you still have

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.860 
which will cover you if you still have
an<00:05:25.170> analog<00:05:25.620> display<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.880> need<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.570> but<00:05:27.780> this

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
an analog display and need that but this

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
will also work for digital and then at

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.760 
will also work for digital and then at
