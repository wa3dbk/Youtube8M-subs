00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.910
 hello to all ipad device friends today 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.060
 we'll talk about an application we have 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.070
 inserted in our site and precisely 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.900
 the application of the penultimate it produced 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.090
 from the cocoÃ  box design 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.130
 the penultimate program and is nothing but 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.750
 a sort of virtual notebook where we 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.790
 we could take any kind of 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.160
 just make drawings of the sketches 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.920
 little is known if anything else I would do less 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.750
 a very common sheet of paper and we can 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.790
 do it either with the use of fingers or with 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.210
 the use of special nibs created 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.760
 for use on touchscreen panels 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.670
 many of you have asked us if we have 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.410
 found around valid penises that yes 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.300
 behave properly or at least give 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.040
 a kind of response feedback 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.120
 positive or in the use of this type 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.140
 of programs 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.600
 today we will talk to you together 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.579
 to the application of this nib the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.390
 nib produced by the installment with the company 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.890
 American is called sti lloyd created 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.570
 at the beginning only for iphone and ipod 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.700
 touch however the company as you can see 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.240
 this nib is attested on others 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.619
 devices with 20 touch screens and precisely 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 above all we see the beautiful writing 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:29.240
 show ipad 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:32.479
 we immediately open the package here it is 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.990
 this is the nib created in aluminum 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.289
 resistant metal we see in beautiful 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.740
 shows the company name 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.179
 then we have ship hooks allows us to 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.920
 insert it in a jacket pocket 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.229
 like a common pen or 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.569
 inside a pocket of a bag and 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.789
 at the end we find the part 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.740
 that interests us practically from 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.990
 use in the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 in the touch we go immediately to try 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.090
 let's try this nib by scrolling i 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.319
 programs present in the app in the home 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:14.680
 let's see what it looks like first impression 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.569
 quite good so it doesn't stay there 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.970
 than to try it in the application 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.530
 for non team and let's open up together 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.880
 to the review of this nib vi 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.760
 I will also talk about this very simple 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.130
 program at the opening of the program 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.680
 we find the program says it's not there 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.120
 no notebook open to new 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.209
 if we want to create one we must 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.500
 click at the center we will do two tests either 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.640
 with the use of fingers both with 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.640
 the use of the nib 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.010
 let's start with our fingers click yes 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.989
 open a virtual talk as you can 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.140
 see is the main page where 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.299
 can we start writing at the top 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.160
 on the right we find an icon there 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.019
 lets you choose what kind of card 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.760
 want to use if checkered if a 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.290
 roses is completely white 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.209
 we choose the white one for community 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.739
 like other options we can find 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.630
 the beginning of writing with the symbol of 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.459
 a pen the symbol an eraser 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.930
 allows you to delete a part of the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.269
 text a part of the design that we 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.010
 we have carried out or the aics that 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.530
 practically wipes out all the work 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.690
 which we did above on the left 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.519
 we find three other commands but by bus 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.930
 practically they would be the notebooks that 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.560
 we have already registered those 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.870
 previous 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.370
 then we find a piece of furniture that would be 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.720
 practically functions for 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.150
 cancel the last operation that 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.100
 we did or restore it 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.980
 we immediately try the application by writing 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.540
 something at random I advise that as well 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.290
 a location because not making the video 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.290
 too suitable 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.120
 however the feedback of the program is 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.120
 great 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.150
 even precision in writing 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.720
 suspending words at random just for 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.720
 to show you a bit of writing 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.470
 looks quite good so how 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.660
 I showed before you can use the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.270
 eraser to erase only part of 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.950
 one interests or press the aics e 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.400
 cancel all the work you have 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.760
 done 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.420
 choose another type of card 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:29.150
 let's put that perfect picture 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.150
 now we will try the nib in question 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.610
 let's pretend we have to do one 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.610
 shopping list 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.810
 I'm writing, I repeat, boys what a 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.310
 in fact, nothing less in mind 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.430
 we write directly the name of the 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.330
 our site 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.690
 what can you see the feedback 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.160
 the Apennines are really excellent 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.120
 above all I have tried others but not 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.120
 they had this answer 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.720
 we can try 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.130
 delete and pressure try to do 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.200
 a kind of drawing sketch maybe 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:17.240
 very good really good 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.240
 the pen behaves in an excellent way 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.410
 always shy from random letters 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.200
 because in this entity I don't know what he writes 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.090
 but to make you really notice that 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.090
 this nib is really great 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.890
 we cancel we find another thing 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.500
 we can do everything, even see it 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:42.180
 between a hatch and is done 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.620
 perfectly the kids what to say 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.900
 pen is purchasable both on the site 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.430
 American who is in various other sites 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.390
 Europeans if you don't want to wait 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.310
 too much 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.400
 let's say the time of shipments of the 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:57.150
 united states the cost is around 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.800
 from 12 to 14 euros, however, I repeat many there 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.410
 there are many nibs around that you can 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.630
 find at 45 euros 6 euros which honestly 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.880
 not in my opinion it is not worth it too 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.800
 rowe purchased and accepted immediately 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.440
 because they had no meaning 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.890
 this I must say that really good me 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.840
 he also positively surprised 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.480
 as I said the application is a lot 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.890
 useful even if you have very simple 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.380
 always at hand a notebook 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.760
 where to take your notes thanks to 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.680
 all of having followed the review and 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.250
 next time on ipad rais 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.250
 Hi everyone
