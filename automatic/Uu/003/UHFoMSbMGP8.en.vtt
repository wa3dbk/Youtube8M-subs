00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.960 
outside I think Gennady golovkin will
cut<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> ring<00:01:33.360> off<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.369> stop<00:01:35.369> him<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:35.729> knock

cut the ring off and stop him or knock

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.569 
cut the ring off and stop him or knock
him<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:37.530> Daniel<00:01:37.860> Gil<00:01:38.040> decides<00:01:38.430> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
I when were talking about to put up a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900 
I when were talking about to put up a
really<00:02:43.560> good<00:02:43.680> fight<00:02:44.040> i<00:02:44.070> would<00:02:44.280> say<00:02:44.459> gaborova

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
really good fight i would say gaborova

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.730 
really good fight i would say gaborova
shadow<00:02:45.240> even<00:02:45.570> though<00:02:45.690> he<00:02:45.780> was<00:02:45.930> getting<00:02:46.620> hit

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
shadow even though he was getting hit

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.290 
shadow even though he was getting hit
with<00:02:46.860> some<00:02:47.070> clean<00:02:47.310> shots<00:02:47.610> here<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:47.850> there<00:02:48.090> I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
with some clean shots here and there I

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.090 
with some clean shots here and there I
thought<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.990> got<00:02:49.080> rid<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.320> Assad<00:02:49.470> was<00:02:49.770> doing

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
thought you got rid of Assad was doing

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.510 
thought you got rid of Assad was doing
really<00:02:50.310> good<00:02:50.810> boxing<00:02:51.810> Gennady<00:02:52.230> golovkin<00:02:52.520> but

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
really good boxing Gennady golovkin but

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.360 
really good boxing Gennady golovkin but
I<00:02:54.209> don't<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:55.350> Daniel<00:02:55.709> Gil<00:02:55.860> has<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.160> same

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
I don't think Daniel Gil has that same

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
I don't think Daniel Gil has that same
kind<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.700> level<00:02:57.060> even<00:02:57.239> compared<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.870> Gabriel

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
kind of level even compared to Gabriel

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.070 
kind of level even compared to Gabriel
Rosado<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:59.090> even<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> gabber<00:03:00.390> was<00:03:00.630> satisfied

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
Rosado and even the gabber was satisfied

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.900 
Rosado and even the gabber was satisfied
even<00:03:01.260> though<00:03:01.470> Rosado<00:03:02.070> was<00:03:02.250> doing<00:03:02.520> really<00:03:02.700> well

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
even though Rosado was doing really well

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.540 
even though Rosado was doing really well
boxing<00:03:03.560> Gennady<00:03:04.560> golovkin<00:03:04.739> was<00:03:05.280> still

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
boxing Gennady golovkin was still

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.680 
boxing Gennady golovkin was still
landing<00:03:06.300> some<00:03:06.510> punches<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:08.420> we'll<00:03:09.420> see<00:03:09.660> if

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
landing some punches so we'll see if

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.320 
landing some punches so we'll see if
Daniel<00:03:10.170> Gil<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.830> take<00:03:11.130> his<00:03:11.400> punches<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.209> would

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
Daniel Gil can take his punches it would

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.479 
Daniel Gil can take his punches it would
be<00:03:12.420> really<00:03:12.840> pretty<00:03:13.350> interesting<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.130> he<00:03:14.160> can

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
be really pretty interesting if he can

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.310 
be really pretty interesting if he can
man<00:03:14.760> they'll<00:03:15.330> be<00:03:15.390> pretty<00:03:15.630> cool<00:03:15.900> if<00:03:15.959> he<00:03:16.080> can

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
man they'll be pretty cool if he can

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.960 
man they'll be pretty cool if he can
take<00:03:16.530> his<00:03:16.650> punch<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.100> he<00:03:17.340> gets<00:03:17.550> hit<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970

take his punch if he gets hit with a
clean<00:03:18.209> punch<00:03:18.620> man<00:03:19.620> they'll<00:03:19.860> be<00:03:19.890> pretty

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
clean punch man they'll be pretty

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.690 
clean punch man they'll be pretty
interesting<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:22.680> don't<00:03:23.070> think<00:03:23.100> Daniel<00:03:23.519> girl

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
interesting I don't think Daniel girl

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.430 
interesting I don't think Daniel girl
has<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:23.940> much<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> power<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.170> hurt

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
has really much of the power to hurt

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.850 
has really much of the power to hurt
Gennady<00:03:25.980> golovkin<00:03:26.190> maybe<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.450> mean<00:03:27.780> Daniel<00:03:28.620> Gil

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
Gennady golovkin maybe I mean Daniel Gil

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.810 
Gennady golovkin maybe I mean Daniel Gil
has<00:03:29.780> has<00:03:30.780> stopped<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.080> lot<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.980> more<00:03:32.670> than

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
has has stopped a lot of like more than

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.430 
has has stopped a lot of like more than
half<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.330> viruses<00:03:33.780> fought<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.200> past

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
half of the viruses fought in the past

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.830 
half of the viruses fought in the past
so<00:03:35.310> we'll<00:03:35.489> see<00:03:35.700> if<00:03:35.730> he<00:03:35.940> has<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.209> power<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.540> hurt

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
so we'll see if he has the power to hurt

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.430 
so we'll see if he has the power to hurt
