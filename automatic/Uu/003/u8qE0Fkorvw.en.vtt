00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.410
 we are here outside of the drom time of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.420
 berlin where galaxy kia was 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.400
 presented by samsung in an event 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.910
 special which also saw the protagonist 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.810
 the new generation galaxy notes 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.550
 what we see is the new smartphone 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.779
 interrupted by samsung and we give 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.369
 look at its interface that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.500
 also allows you to make calls 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.710
 phone numbers on a connected phone 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.769
 obviously via bluetooth and a series of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.070
 checks that we will see in detail in 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.360
 these few minutes of navigation in the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 its interface 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.290
 the clock is the classic one 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.010
 obviously have other types of watch 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.620
 and through a connection with the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 Tablet 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.899
 smartphone you can access 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.610
 a whole series of operations 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.820
 these are notifications you can't 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.149
 log in you can access recordings 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.729
 voice memo voices and the file can 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.869
 be registered directly on the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.869
 phone on the tablet 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.250
 obviously if the file saved me 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 reaction is canceled and as you see 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.950
 there is a series of optional menus to which 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.200
 and possible to register 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.940
 access to previous stations is there 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.430
 possibility to manage through east 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.300
 voice the hands-free call e 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.390
 through this smartwatch all 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.500
 telephone or high well connected also 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.150
 we have the possibility to access one 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.320
 gallery of images that are those 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.450
 taken through the galaxy itself 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.870
 through his camera that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.260
 allows you to also shoot videos 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.510
 camera is placed in the strap that 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.510
 therefore it is an integral part of the telephone 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.910
 as well as microphone the right button like 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.290
 you see it is always used to return 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.000
 from the main menu 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.910
 here we have access to control 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.490
 music from the connected tablet or phone 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.800
 to manage the progress of the tracks e 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.800
 volume adjustment 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.960
 another option is that of control 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.910
 of the phenomenon we have a warning 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:35.330
 on physical activity can manage the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.120
 the councilor of roses mattia and here we have 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.620
 access to the settings that allows 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.140
 manage the clock the bluetooth was 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.650
 obviously also the language as we see 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.860
 also Italian to those present e 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.030
 the interface is clearly manageable 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.340
 entirely in Italian 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.740
 here we see the information on 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.940
 device on the battery on the ss be 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.550
 the movement code is the version 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.630
 of the software has just been released 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.120
 obviously if the whole world of 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.700
 applications that are based on the system 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.650
 android operating that as you see from 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.150
 this clock shot has 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.620
 considerable dimensions in the thickness 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.210
 probably did not go to the course of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.420
 all and above all of the girls who 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.780
 will find the project a little heavy 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.720
 anyhow 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.930
 from there you can manage others 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.569
 applications install them and access 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.430
 a series of functions that are those 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.680
 which you see in this rapid scrolling 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.390
 in the next few hours we will show you some 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.510
 images of applications we have 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.510
 registered 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.290
 our last king on these products here 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.940
 we see the camera and access to 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.269
 gallery of images that have been 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.269
 shot
