00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.609 
pretty neat I got this at Toys R Us
I<00:00:20.699> always<00:00:21.300> check<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.779> tech<00:00:21.960> deck<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.320> own<00:00:22.470> when

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
I always check the tech deck I own when

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.810 
I always check the tech deck I own when
I'm<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.890> there<00:00:23.250> these<00:00:24.029> were<00:00:24.500> $6.99<00:00:25.640> which<00:00:26.640> I

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
I'm in there these were $6.99 which I

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.210 
I'm in there these were $6.99 which I
thought<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> very<00:00:27.420> good<00:00:27.599> deal<00:00:27.980> because<00:00:28.980> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
thought was a very good deal because you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.260 
thought was a very good deal because you
get<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:30.439> complete<00:00:31.470> finger<00:00:31.859> boards<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
get to complete finger boards and the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.090 
get to complete finger boards and the
reason<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.600> picked<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> Billie<00:00:34.230> marks<00:00:34.620> coin

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
reason I picked the Billie marks coin

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.490 
reason I picked the Billie marks coin
machine<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.840> Billy<00:00:37.140> marks

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
machine is not just because Billy marks

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.920 
machine is not just because Billy marks
is<00:00:37.680> funny<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.410> black<00:00:40.410> trucks<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.750> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
is funny but as black trucks so if I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
is funny but as black trucks so if I
ever<00:00:43.079> wanted<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> take<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> trucks<00:00:43.980> off<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
ever wanted to take the trucks off and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
ever wanted to take the trucks off and
use<00:00:44.550> them<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.820> something<00:00:45.270> else

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
use them on something else

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
use them on something else
the<00:00:47.219> colored<00:00:47.550> trucks<00:00:47.879> are<00:00:48.059> better<00:00:48.210> than

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the colored trucks are better than

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
the colored trucks are better than
regular<00:00:49.110> silver<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.190> ask<00:00:50.340> me<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
regular silver if you ask me so I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.080 
regular silver if you ask me so I
thought<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> bonus<00:00:52.789> $6.99<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
thought it was like a bonus $6.99 for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.060 
thought it was like a bonus $6.99 for
two<00:00:54.210> finger<00:00:54.539> boards<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> black<00:00:55.770> trucks<00:00:56.780> yeah

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
two finger boards and black trucks yeah

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
two finger boards and black trucks yeah

but if you already have the tool for
your<00:02:13.819> finger<00:02:14.060> boards<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.450> laying<00:02:14.690> around<00:02:15.220> for

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
your finger boards to laying around for

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.800 
your finger boards to laying around for
a<00:02:16.250> few<00:02:16.459> bucks<00:02:16.670> more<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.270> definitely<00:02:17.720> go

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
a few bucks more I would definitely go

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.350 
a few bucks more I would definitely go
ahead<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.110> get<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.319> new<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.680> thrash<00:02:19.360> just

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
ahead and get the new and thrash just

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.660 
ahead and get the new and thrash just
because<00:02:20.690> they're<00:02:21.290> awesome<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.220> ask<00:02:22.280> me

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
because they're awesome if you ask me

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.790 
because they're awesome if you ask me
and<00:02:22.850> if<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.810> can<00:02:23.959> find<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.380> ones<00:02:24.560> with

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
and if you can find the ones with

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.120 
and if you can find the ones with
coloured<00:02:25.160> trucks<00:02:25.489> like<00:02:25.730> these<00:02:25.940> black<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:28.010> an

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
coloured trucks like these black it's an

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.100 
coloured trucks like these black it's an
even<00:02:28.370> better<00:02:28.520> deal<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.910> think<00:02:29.120> because<00:02:29.840> color

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
even better deal I think because color

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.320 
even better deal I think because color
trucks<00:02:30.500> are<00:02:30.709> more<00:02:31.220> rare<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.050> awesome<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
trucks are more rare and awesome and the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.660
