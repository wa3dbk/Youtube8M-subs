this part into your heart in your
motherboard<00:05:00.900> this<00:05:01.530> part<00:05:01.830> yeah<00:05:02.370> they<00:05:02.729> go<00:05:02.880> look

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
motherboard this part yeah they go look

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.719 
motherboard this part yeah they go look
at<00:05:03.690> how<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:03.870> works<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:05.250> comes<00:05:05.520> with<00:05:05.580> some

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
at how that works it comes with some

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.240 
at how that works it comes with some
extra<00:05:06.270> backup<00:05:06.690> cables<00:05:07.320> in<00:05:07.500> case<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.070> ones

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
extra backup cables in case the ones

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.540 
extra backup cables in case the ones
that<00:05:08.430> come<00:05:08.639> with<00:05:08.850> it<00:05:08.880> actually<00:05:09.150> break<00:05:09.690> so

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
that come with it actually break so

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.340 
that come with it actually break so
they're<00:05:11.550> just<00:05:11.760> be<00:05:12.180> redundant<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:13.050> be<00:05:13.229> one

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
they're just be redundant to be one

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.260 
they're just be redundant to be one
