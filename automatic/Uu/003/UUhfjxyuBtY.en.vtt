00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
something I made to heat our pool it

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.650 
something I made to heat our pool it
gets<00:00:07.919> cool<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.490> early<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.090> fall<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
gets cool here early in the fall and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.330 
gets cool here early in the fall and
we're<00:00:10.230> just<00:00:10.290> trying<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.559> keep<00:00:10.679> our<00:00:10.800> pool<00:00:11.010> open

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
we're just trying to keep our pool open

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.250 
we're just trying to keep our pool open
longer<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> came<00:00:12.990> up<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.410> pool<00:00:13.620> heater

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
longer so I came up with a pool heater

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.840 
longer so I came up with a pool heater
it<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.340> right<00:00:17.340> here

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
it is right here

what I did is I soldered together 23
feet<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.930> 3/4<00:00:27.930> inch<00:00:27.960> copper<00:00:28.320> tubing<00:00:29.150> I<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
feet of 3/4 inch copper tubing I have a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.220 
feet of 3/4 inch copper tubing I have a
submersible<00:00:31.050> pump<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:31.859> under<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> pool

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
submersible pump and one under the pool

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
submersible pump and one under the pool
bringing<00:00:34.230> cold<00:00:34.440> water<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.090> taps

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
bringing cold water in and I have taps

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.010 
bringing cold water in and I have taps
on<00:00:36.540> both<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.410> adjust<00:00:38.510> flow<00:00:39.510> rate<00:00:39.719> for

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
on both of these to adjust flow rate for

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.000 
on both of these to adjust flow rate for
warmer<00:00:40.670> water<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> anyway

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
warmer water so anyway

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.740 
warmer water so anyway
cold<00:00:44.219> water<00:00:44.399> goes<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.090> fire<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.140> going

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
cold water goes in here fire is going

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.000 
cold water goes in here fire is going
pumps<00:00:48.750> hot<00:00:48.899> water<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.620> back<00:00:49.800> into

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
pumps hot water out of here back into

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
pumps hot water out of here back into
the<00:00:50.160> pool<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> opposite<00:00:50.969> end<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:52.020> I'm

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the pool at the opposite end now I'm

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
the pool at the opposite end now I'm
bringing<00:00:52.350> water<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:53.160> 60<00:00:53.789> degrees<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
bringing water in that's 60 degrees and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
bringing water in that's 60 degrees and
it's<00:00:55.110> coming<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.710> over<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> hundred<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it's coming out just over a hundred and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.290 
it's coming out just over a hundred and
that's<00:00:57.239> wide<00:00:58.199> open<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.760> no<00:00:59.789> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that's wide open that's with no I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.819 
that's wide open that's with no I
haven't<00:01:00.719> turned<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> flow<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> need<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> get

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
haven't turned on the flow I need to get

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.060 
haven't turned on the flow I need to get
it<00:01:01.949> hotter<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.629> had<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.350> old<00:01:04.559> stove<00:01:04.799> laying

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it hotter so I had this old stove laying

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.289 
it hotter so I had this old stove laying
around<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:07.130> what<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> did<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> take<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> copper

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
around and what I did is take the copper

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.010 
around and what I did is take the copper
tubing<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.369> basically<00:01:11.580> built<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.180> rad<00:01:12.420> out

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
tubing and I basically built a rad out

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870 
tubing and I basically built a rad out
of<00:01:13.320> three-quarter<00:01:13.799> inch<00:01:13.950> copper<00:01:14.159> tubing<00:01:14.640> now

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of three-quarter inch copper tubing now

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.340 
of three-quarter inch copper tubing now
one<00:01:15.060> thing<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.270> got<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> make<00:01:15.810> sure<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> when

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
one thing you got to make sure is when

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.870 
one thing you got to make sure is when
you're<00:01:16.470> making<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> rad<00:01:16.979> make<00:01:17.430> sure<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> fits

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
you're making the rad make sure it fits

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.210 
you're making the rad make sure it fits
through<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.090> door<00:01:18.350> but<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.650> don't<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.100> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
through the door but I don't know if you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
through the door but I don't know if you
can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> rad<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> mounted

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
can see in here but the rad is mounted

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.240 
can see in here but the rad is mounted
at<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> top<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> wood<00:01:23.850> stove<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:25.250> when

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
at the top of the wood stove and when

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.160 
at the top of the wood stove and when
the<00:01:26.340> fires<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.880> obviously<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.750> heats<00:01:28.020> your

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the fires going obviously it heats your

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.330 
the fires going obviously it heats your
copper<00:01:28.500> pipe<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> heats<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> water<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
copper pipe and heats the water and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
copper pipe and heats the water and
water<00:01:32.340> warm<00:01:32.880> water<00:01:32.939> flows<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
water warm water flows back out to the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
water warm water flows back out to the
pool<00:01:34.880> works<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.119> well<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.720> really

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
pool works really well it's really

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.640 
pool works really well it's really
efficient<00:01:38.270> with<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> large<00:01:39.810> fire<00:01:40.140> going

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
efficient with not a large fire going

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
efficient with not a large fire going
I'm<00:01:41.009> getting<00:01:41.310> water<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.759> coming<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.119> too

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
I'm getting water that's coming out too

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.990 
I'm getting water that's coming out too
at<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.930> hundred<00:01:43.439> degrees<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.610> really

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
at a hundred degrees so if I really

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.249 
at a hundred degrees so if I really
wanted<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.930> sure<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> can

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
wanted to get it going I'm sure I can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.160 
wanted to get it going I'm sure I can
get<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.740> hotter<00:01:46.920> than<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.960> one<00:01:48.960> thing

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
get it a lot hotter than that one thing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.350 
get it a lot hotter than that one thing
to<00:01:49.290> remember<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:49.890> run<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.820> without

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to remember is don't run this without

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
to remember is don't run this without
water<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.320> through<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.829> or<00:01:53.070> you'll<00:01:53.340> melt

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
water going through it or you'll melt

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.209 
water going through it or you'll melt
your<00:01:53.700> solder<00:01:54.439> as<00:01:55.439> long<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.829> there's<00:01:55.979> water

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
your solder as long as there's water

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.569 
your solder as long as there's water
flowing<00:01:57.119> through<00:01:57.920> through<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> rad<00:01:59.219> that's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
flowing through through the rad that's

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.030 
flowing through through the rad that's
inside<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.450> um<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.649> don't<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
inside of here um you don't have to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.709 
inside of here um you don't have to
