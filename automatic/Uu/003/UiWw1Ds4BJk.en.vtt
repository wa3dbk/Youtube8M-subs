00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.440
 ni 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.440
 Yup 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.090
 2 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.090
 7 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.090
 me 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:41.370
 The network of this work is part of the network play is one of the key points of this time 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:47.040
 There is a system called date that is one, but it is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.520
 So-called network connected users are not in the form of sharing more than anything 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.329
 But 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.730
 Traveling together in the same world with friends 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.660
 You can feel like you are the other player 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.700
 system 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 In addition yeah not only that 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.780
 It is contained in the form of so-called mutual role play 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.520
 Each user player is yeah 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.390
 What kind of position do you take? There is a new system called a constraint. 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.930
 But 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.310
 By standing in that position 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.689
 Human beings of the same position are to share the same purpose 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.120
 User with different purpose is a high-level view of hostility 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:35.220
 Those things that get up 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:39.560
 Enjoy the same worldview on the original network 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.560
 Become a game you can do 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.810
 This is everyone 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.620
 Well there are thousands and hundreds 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.860
 You too will drive to death 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.440
 It is to deliver a work called 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:03.070
 And we we are also excited about 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:03.070
 But that kind of part we want to play is still the wind of its sense of accomplishment 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.880
 It is in terms of the of the word 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.580
 Very hard 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.740
 Anyway 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.220
 It may be hard to eat, but anyone can eat it deliciously 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.220
 The place to say 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.569
 As we think from all 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.930
 Don't be scared 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.910
 It is a game without fear of death 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.100
 eat 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.700
 If you can 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.390
 I think that only you noticed what we wanted to convey 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.440
 And that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.440
 In the wind that you convey it to everybody around you again 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.780
 Fun mission
