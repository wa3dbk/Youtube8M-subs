00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 Let 's use this fun tool called Lego Digital Designer from now on. 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.719
 I'll see. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.280
 Yerego Digital Designers This tool, called ldd for short, 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.289
 And 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.269
 If you are interested to see now, as you can see, the screen yen of products LEGO mi Storm 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:30.869
 There is a sensor, a computer, and a motor. 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.899
 We use this to make this machine in working form through Lego 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.950
 That's why it's a concept. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.050
 Well, as you can see, this is not what you wanted me explain itself 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.210
 Products that you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 Using the 3d modeling tool 2 Using the 3d tool 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 Machi 2 Briggs usually put the block that I worked hard Britt 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.489
 Using the Briggs just as you do this, you create simulations 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.180
 Or is it modeling? 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.650
 That same kind of thing that makes you do these things 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.290
 It is a tool 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.460
 You can see it from a distance or from a distance. 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.180
 And if you do this, 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.270
 As you can see, there's some ominous music. 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.800
 Yes 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 The background behind the metallurgy 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.380
 Oh so ooo 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.240
 I'll take it . 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.390
 And, as you can see, 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.759
 This process we are creating 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:41.840
 There are also features that you can play 1 1 2 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.979
 As you can see. 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.000
 These are tools that offer a variety of these features 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:55.009
 It is our goal to learn how to use this tool 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.610
 But I do not know the Lego digital designer 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.780
 It's only been two days. 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.950
 It was 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.269
 Well, I know that I'm not a very good user of this 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.489
 I'll tell you. 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:17.630
 If there is something I am misrepresenting or something I am missing, 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.370
 If you give me advice, you will be able to 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.670
 I'll do it 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.600
 And the reason I made this class was because my nephew 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.000
 I love this Lego so much, so I showed it to my nephew . 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:35.500
 I liked it too. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.660
 So the effect is not yet good at computers, but using this tool 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:47.180
 If your nephew helps me get started on some sort of computer like this, 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.100
 I was interested in this tool because I thought it would be nice, and unfortunately, 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.829
 I'm a little far away 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:58.160
 So I class by class to create a video sent to the niece 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:02.630
 This is the lesson that you are seeing now . 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:07.250
 Secondly, my goal is, 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.859
 I do not need to make Seoul for my nephew alone . 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.770
 I'm going to organize a class. 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:19.210
 And, as I think, my lesson is, first of all, 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.950
 If these young friends are helped by their young friends rather than seen by their parents 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:27.760
 or 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:32.440
 These uncle aunts are probably the ones who told the children that this program 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:38.800
 I think you'll see our class to tell us how to use it. 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:43.690
 Oh, and with the help of such graduates, this Lego Digital Designer 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:47.920
 If you are a younger friend who knows how to use it, 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.030
 I hope you will be able to create a class with the expectation that you will understand 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.700
 I'll do it 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:04:00.880
 So in the next video, note that the tool has some configuration 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:03.990
 Each configuration has its own overall usage of how to use it. 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.990
 I will explain.
