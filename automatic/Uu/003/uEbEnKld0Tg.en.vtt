using great arms keep that in mind
especially<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.000> throw<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
especially with this throw this is a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780 
especially with this throw this is a
very<00:01:27.900> tough<00:01:28.170> throw<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.530> pleading<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.610> get

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it you can kind of back layup and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.319 
it you can kind of back layup and
manually<00:01:40.680> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.070> charge<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.210> I'm

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
manually kind of charge it but I'm

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.490 
manually kind of charge it but I'm

just<00:01:45.810> let<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> computer<00:01:46.799> will<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
just let go the computer will do that

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
just let go the computer will do that
those<00:01:47.430> three<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.790> four<00:01:47.970> steps<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
those three or four steps there and you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.069 
those three or four steps there and you
just<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> time<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:51.990> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
just got to time it up so just get in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.810 
just got to time it up so just get in
the<00:01:52.170> middle<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.189> too<00:01:53.250> far<00:01:53.579> back

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the middle of that don't go too far back

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.910 
the middle of that don't go too far back
and<00:01:53.880> don't<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.540> sit<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> blue<00:01:55.140> line<00:01:55.350> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and don't just sit on the blue line so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.679 
and don't just sit on the blue line so
there's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.159> good<00:01:56.369> example<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
there's a good example right there of I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.649 
there's a good example right there of I
did<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.020> fill<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.680> red<00:01:58.860> throw<00:01:59.820> max<00:02:00.360> meter

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659

did not fill up the red throw max meter
there<00:02:00.930> here's<00:02:01.469> another<00:02:01.680> example<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.460> filled<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
there here's another example I filled it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
there here's another example I filled it
up<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> max<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.560> always<00:02:04.680> have

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
up to the max but you don't always have

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
up to the max but you don't always have
to<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.790> positioning<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> key<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
to but really positioning is a key I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.529 
to but really positioning is a key I
don't<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:07.890> hit<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.280> X<00:02:08.879> button<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.330> hold

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
don't really hit the X button and hold

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.960 
don't really hit the X button and hold
right<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:11.220> hope<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.459> guys<00:02:11.520> enjoyed
