00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
so I figured I might as well follow in

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.000 
so I figured I might as well follow in
his<00:02:10.720> footsteps<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.500> was<00:02:11.620> probably<00:02:11.740> good

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
his footsteps it was probably good

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.660 
his footsteps it was probably good
because<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.250> don't<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:12.520> buy<00:02:12.640> another

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
because you don't have to buy another

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.010 
because you don't have to buy another
one<00:02:13.060> your<00:02:13.180> mother's<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:13.480> use<00:02:13.660> your<00:02:13.780> brothers

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
yeah actually that's exactly how it went

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.580 
yeah actually that's exactly how it went
because<00:02:16.810> she<00:02:16.990> didn't<00:02:17.170> want<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.320> spend<00:02:17.470> the

because she didn't want to spend the
money<00:02:17.740> for<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.070> because<00:02:18.220> they're<00:02:18.400> expensive

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
money for it because they're expensive
