00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.090
 more precisely about whom 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.090
 here it means here are some 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.269

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.400
 venerable place somewhere something here 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.380

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.320
 cars next comics 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.350
 Already tasks I hope this is a little while 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.000

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.169
 neon race inside 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.970

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.639
 sad and always loved comics 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.940
 you are wondering not sad parting 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.949
 a little further here is a task with humor 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.729
 here count how much disk 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.009
 to collect the right picture decorate and 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:02.690
 we learn that if it is clear that there is 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:07.080
 there is a planet with a few stars 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.800
 znachechek and points and the ball like 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.580
 it turns out 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:16.440
 and from being able to mean so look 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:19.949
 looking here means like 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:28.199
 to draw him a new wave means it is necessary 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:32.370
 draw two times what it is here and 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:35.000
 and the memory is shorter than it is necessary to come up with 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.840
 pencils further paint makveena and 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.930
 like a fool new to me 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.720
 one that's the whole here is shown cars 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.699
 what in this set but not all of these cars 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.220
 of which the magazine writes will not buy 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:53.310
 where only one posters here because 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.130
 on mind there are two logs this skill boots 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.550

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:02.930
