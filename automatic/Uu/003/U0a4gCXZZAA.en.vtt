00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 international and apart from said 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 legends because it has many games 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 in which you can play versus against 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.620
 other people as you click you have 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.859
 to register I just registered 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.660
 less than a day ago he started playing my 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.310
 first games 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.030
 I had say that the competition is 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.570
 pretty professional, it's worth it here you see 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 games 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.960
 there's a lot here is in the news and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.700
 such 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.000
 there are times of butterfield call sections 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.550
 of duty starcraft then for each 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.070
 well, we have enough 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.180
 in principle only by computer in 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.180
 beginning 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.830
 I did not investigate it much either here 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.560
 You have to see her that is what we 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.920
 to try now 10 professionals here is 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.680
 when I climb I made 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.960
 in the rankings I will be able to participate 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.290
 and this is worth so you make the profile 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.080
 they can be a team the leagues with 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.810
 time will let you in, it's worth for your 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.530
 feet time back his playing versus 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.690
 try to play a versus elite laws 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.159
 since it is the only game of these in the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.130
 I play the computer 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.319
 Well, being a global, I do not know if there will be 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.990
 a lot of people usually the most 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.380
 they play are Americans and there are the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.729
 games are not very long and well let's go 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.420
 briefly it was made law and while 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.420
 load this 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.810
 If you have any questions, add me ice 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.370
 I have it on my channel or 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.659
 twitter 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.659
 and answer any question 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.069
 should be playing then at least 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.700
 hours I will teach 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.319
 while loading these he also taught the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.909
 ranking is not a ranking 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.499
 with a lot of people now about 6000 or so 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.139
 more reason to play grow better to 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:38.140
 the first 1,000 because they are the ones 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:41.170
 participate in the official leagues 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.540
 currently 51 not 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.540
 It's not so much but well, yes 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.910
 like 6 3 against 3 but 1 2 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.680
 so let's get 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.680
 butterfield of 80 people 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.390
 ballack and this indicates 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.740
 Let's get into my name is epitaph c's 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.740
 Well, someone wants to add me 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.670
 and password 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.280
 well while this starts then look 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.010
 players here we would look 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.590
 until I thought 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.930
 It does not take long for the truth 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.610
 You see, here I would be looking for 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.710
 I'm teaching the rankings a little 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.770
 to start that pile of games 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.690
 and friends, a game would be ready 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.840
 I lost her 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.620
 I've only been playing two weeks I 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.840
 touched a maximum level well the reason 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.340
 We were 15 I think 17 I do not know 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.640
 I can not do anything 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.280
 Well look at points 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.950
 and it is the truth that makes me little are 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.480
 for spring that is only 144 game 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.340
 It's not so much 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.620
 there are people who are normative but the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.569
 most then 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.680
 I am today let's get or be good 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.200
 there are 3,000 people 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.509
 It is not so much but good if you want 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.639
 try to be professionals in the 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:23.070
 professionals if you could not stand out in 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.070
 a game I recommend that this page 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.140
 eulex that just this end of 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.030
 week 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.570
 this company organizes the tournament of 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.350
 four starcraft games the itf legens 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.330
 the counter strike and the fifa because if not 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.760
 you know but he's active and rex are going to go 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.670
 that event is that this is quite 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.150
 important is not a page of nonsense 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.370
 It's official because 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.230
 now they will give us a code and ready let's go 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.249
 to get in here 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.900
 I will have to give 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:59.400
 to play 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.810
 personalized code here gives me the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.630
 code to see if it starts at par bit 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.300
 as it is although I will not be able to play 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.099
 why 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.610
 I prefer to leave it a little longer to 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.610
 ahead 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.460
 to make a game by aggravating the 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.919
 to go up 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.639
 but it showed a little more thoroughly good 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:23.150
 if you want, let's see a little more 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.150
 right in the game 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.140
 this okay let's play 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.080
 do not hurry like this removed something nation 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.539
 good like that but this is not sorry 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.539
 yes yes no 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.510
 is that he prefers to teach a little more and 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.510
 leave it for another day 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.919
 good followed here 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:12.690
 well let's copy the code now 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.030
 here we would give control v and dalÃ­ would be 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.490
 here join the non-fiction game is the 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.110
 departure this is to transmit to the game 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.460
 play that is one against one on a map 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:26.280
 straight with four turrets an inhibitor and 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.670
 a base the store is registered and not 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.510
 there is regeneration 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.880
 on the basis of that fight and withdrawal 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.740
 possible good so with this I 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.420
 dismissal I hope that it has served you 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.420
 something and thanks
