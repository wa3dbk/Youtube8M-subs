a<00:01:18.210> position

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
a position

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740 
a position
we're<00:01:20.340> hitting<00:01:20.550> that<00:01:20.580> c-sharp<00:01:21.120> again<00:01:21.480> that's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
making it feel major again and then we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.920 
making it feel major again and then we
have<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.990> pull<00:01:25.200> off<00:01:25.350> flakes<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.890> row

pentatonic now we have a pull off from F

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.350 
pentatonic now we have a pull off from F
sharp<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.840> e<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:49.159> it's<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> really<00:01:49.580> nice<00:01:49.729> mix<00:01:49.790> of
