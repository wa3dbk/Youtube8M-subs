playing<00:01:57.310> new<00:01:57.579> and<00:01:57.789> tasty<00:01:58.020> /<00:01:59.020> odyssey<00:01:59.530> or

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
playing new and tasty / odyssey or

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.249 
playing new and tasty / odyssey or
exodus<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.969> definitely<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.719> constant

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
exodus is definitely the constant

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.919 
exodus is definitely the constant
scrolling<00:02:02.770> environment<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.119> grids<00:02:04.780> and

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
scrolling environment with the grids and

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.929 
scrolling environment with the grids and
slides<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:05.590> only<00:02:05.920> had<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.310> worry<00:02:06.520> about<00:02:06.759> one

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
slides I only had to worry about one

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.949 
slides I only had to worry about one
slider<00:02:07.329> a<00:02:07.450> grid<00:02:07.719> at<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.899> time<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.450> constant

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
slider a grid at a time so the constant

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.380 
slider a grid at a time so the constant
scrolling<00:02:11.349> does<00:02:11.560> take<00:02:11.800> some<00:02:12.190> getting<00:02:12.880> used<00:02:12.910> to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
scrolling does take some getting used to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.870 
scrolling does take some getting used to
and<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:14.319> does<00:02:14.530> make<00:02:14.739> other<00:02:14.950> areas<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.610> have<00:02:15.760> to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
and it does make other areas I have to

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.300 
and it does make other areas I have to
pay<00:02:16.000> attention<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.569> lot<00:02:16.720> more<00:02:16.800> how<00:02:17.800> far<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.160> am

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
pay attention to a lot more how far I am

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.500 
pay attention to a lot more how far I am
from<00:02:18.630> things<00:02:19.739> however<00:02:20.739> due<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.640> stereo

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
from things however due to the stereo

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.400 
from things however due to the stereo
design<00:02:23.440> sound<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.160> new<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.700> tasty<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:26.230> tell

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
design sound in new and tasty I can tell

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.440 
design sound in new and tasty I can tell
the<00:02:26.560> distance<00:02:26.950> between<00:02:27.340> myself<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.060> objects

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
the distance between myself and objects

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.320 
the distance between myself and objects
much<00:02:28.690> better<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.200> Odyssey<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.220> Exodus<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
much better in Odyssey and Exodus the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.420 
much better in Odyssey and Exodus the
sound<00:02:31.599> was<00:02:31.780> within<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.290> screen<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
sound was within the screen that you

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.009 
sound was within the screen that you
were<00:02:33.549> currently<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.660> was<00:02:34.750> kind<00:02:34.989> of

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
were currently in but it was kind of

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.589 
were currently in but it was kind of
hard<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.230> tell<00:02:35.410> exactly<00:02:35.709> where<00:02:35.980> object<00:02:36.370> work

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
hard to tell exactly where object work

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.970 
hard to tell exactly where object work
now<00:02:37.599> new<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.049> tasty<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.769> tell<00:02:38.890> exactly

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
now new and tasty I can tell exactly

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.190 
now new and tasty I can tell exactly
where<00:02:39.489> slugs<00:02:39.819> are<00:02:40.000> where<00:02:40.239> scraps<00:02:40.630> are<00:02:40.870> and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
where slugs are where scraps are and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.550 
where slugs are where scraps are and
that<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.590> great<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.130> bet<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.610> advance<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.079> the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
that is a great in bet in advance so the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.910 
that is a great in bet in advance so the
constant<00:02:45.010> scrolling<00:02:45.370> is<00:02:45.549> is<00:02:46.319> tougher<00:02:47.319> yes<00:02:47.590> but

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
constant scrolling is is tougher yes but

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.380 
constant scrolling is is tougher yes but
I<00:02:47.950> don't<00:02:48.099> think<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.489> gonna<00:02:48.610> be<00:02:48.819> an<00:02:48.910> issue<00:02:49.060> due

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
I don't think it's gonna be an issue due

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.900 
I don't think it's gonna be an issue due
to<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.920> advancement<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> sound<00:02:51.400> quality

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
to the advancement in the sound quality

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.539 
to the advancement in the sound quality
do<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:52.989> feel<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.440> audio<00:02:53.829> in<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.250> tasty

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
do you feel the audio in you and tasty

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.910 
do you feel the audio in you and tasty
better<00:02:54.819> describes<00:02:55.299> what's<00:02:55.599> going<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:55.989> talking

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
better describes what's going on talking

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.129 
better describes what's going on talking
again<00:02:57.190> about<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.640> advanced<00:02:58.030> audio<00:02:58.299> design<00:02:58.690> it

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
again about the advanced audio design it

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.229 
again about the advanced audio design it
is<00:02:59.350> definitely<00:02:59.859> easier<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.400> tell<00:03:00.609> my<00:03:00.819> distance

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
is definitely easier to tell my distance

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.180 
is definitely easier to tell my distance
between<00:03:01.420> different<00:03:02.139> characters<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.920> how

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
between different characters like how

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.240 
between different characters like how
far<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.760> am<00:03:04.120> from<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.630> slake<00:03:04.930> if<00:03:05.200> I'm<00:03:05.470> hiding<00:03:06.160> in

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
far I am from a slake if I'm hiding in

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.890 
far I am from a slake if I'm hiding in
smoke<00:03:06.549> for<00:03:06.790> instance<00:03:07.120> if<00:03:07.239> he's<00:03:07.389> passing<00:03:07.660> me

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
smoke for instance if he's passing me

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.330 
smoke for instance if he's passing me
and<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.260> know<00:03:08.319> it's<00:03:08.650> safe<00:03:08.829> for<00:03:08.980> me<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.190> get<00:03:09.310> up

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
and I know it's safe for me to get up

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.120 
and I know it's safe for me to get up
and<00:03:09.579> sneak<00:03:09.850> away<00:03:10.030> or<00:03:10.510> if<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.440> screw<00:03:11.739> if<00:03:11.889> I<00:03:11.980> have

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
and sneak away or if I screw if I have

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.949 
and sneak away or if I screw if I have
to<00:03:12.220> jump<00:03:12.430> down<00:03:12.609> off<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.850> Ledge<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:13.359> a<00:03:13.450> scrab<00:03:13.750> is

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
to jump down off a Ledge if a scrab is

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.960 
to jump down off a Ledge if a scrab is
below<00:03:14.380> me<00:03:14.560> or<00:03:14.739> if<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.190> jump<00:03:15.430> down<00:03:15.489> if<00:03:15.790> they're

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
below me or if I jump down if they're

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.390 
below me or if I jump down if they're
gonna<00:03:16.209> be<00:03:16.389> in<00:03:16.510> my<00:03:16.660> path<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.829> definitely<00:03:18.220> with

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
gonna be in my path so definitely with

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.370 
gonna be in my path so definitely with
the<00:03:18.430> more<00:03:18.819> advanced<00:03:19.269> sound<00:03:19.569> it<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:19.989> definitely

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
the more advanced sound it is definitely

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.460 
the more advanced sound it is definitely
easier<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.829> tell<00:03:21.010> where<00:03:21.190> objects<00:03:21.609> are<00:03:21.790> and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
easier to tell where objects are and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.500 
easier to tell where objects are and
also<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.920> sounds<00:03:24.549> for<00:03:24.760> like<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.150> motion

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
also the sounds for like the motion

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.690 
also the sounds for like the motion
detection<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.530> beeping<00:03:26.920> bombs<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.459> mines

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
detection the beeping bombs the mines

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.789 
detection the beeping bombs the mines
that<00:03:28.060> has<00:03:28.239> been<00:03:28.450> retained<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.319> can<00:03:29.560> still

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
that has been retained so I can still

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.550 
that has been retained so I can still
tell<00:03:30.069> where<00:03:30.250> those<00:03:30.370> objects<00:03:30.790> are<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.530> what<00:03:32.530> a

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
tell where those objects are and what a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.930 
tell where those objects are and what a
other<00:03:33.100> element<00:03:33.639> is<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.180> moving<00:03:34.510> mines<00:03:34.780> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
other element is the moving mines that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.640 
other element is the moving mines that
can<00:03:36.940> move<00:03:37.120> around<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.049> definitely<00:03:38.230> tell

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
can move around I can definitely tell

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.559 
can move around I can definitely tell
where<00:03:38.829> those<00:03:39.010> are<00:03:39.220> now<00:03:39.370> even<00:03:39.700> in<00:03:39.819> Exodus<00:03:40.299> it

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
where those are now even in Exodus it

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.780 
where those are now even in Exodus it
was<00:03:40.630> kind<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.019> just<00:03:41.230> test<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.190> see<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.609> could

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
was kind of just test to see if I could

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.030 
was kind of just test to see if I could
go<00:03:42.940> or<00:03:43.120> not<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.420> get<00:03:43.540> blown<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.650> now<00:03:44.799> with

to new n tasty relatively easily I felt
that<00:05:03.460> my<00:05:03.640> transition<00:05:04.300> into<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.750> new<00:05:04.930> game<00:05:05.230> was

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
that my transition into the new game was

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.040 
that my transition into the new game was
easier<00:05:06.280> since<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.120> have<00:05:07.240> played<00:05:07.570> some<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:07.870> the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
easier since I have played some of the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.230 
easier since I have played some of the
old<00:05:08.169> Odyssey<00:05:08.590> before<00:05:08.950> but<00:05:09.669> it<00:05:09.790> definitely

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
old Odyssey before but it definitely

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.330 
old Odyssey before but it definitely
took<00:05:10.480> some<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:11.050> learning<00:05:11.620> curve<00:05:11.800> definitely

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
took some a learning curve definitely

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.510 
took some a learning curve definitely
with<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.520> way<00:05:12.730> he<00:05:13.620> with<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.740> how<00:05:14.890> he<00:05:14.950> jumps

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
with the way he with you how he jumps

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.700 
with the way he with you how he jumps
for<00:05:16.150> instance<00:05:16.540> like<00:05:16.720> jumping<00:05:17.080> forward<00:05:17.380> versus

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
for instance like jumping forward versus

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.760 
for instance like jumping forward versus
jumping<00:05:18.100> straight<00:05:18.280> up<00:05:18.400> that<00:05:18.760> took<00:05:19.000> some<00:05:19.150> time

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
jumping straight up that took some time

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.700 
jumping straight up that took some time
one<00:05:20.770> addition<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:21.220> love<00:05:21.660> though<00:05:22.660> is<00:05:23.050> when<00:05:23.620> he

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
one addition I love though is when he

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.900 
one addition I love though is when he
gets<00:05:23.830> nearer<00:05:24.100> ledge<00:05:24.340> instead<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:24.760> just

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
gets nearer ledge instead of just

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.900 
gets nearer ledge instead of just
falling<00:05:25.300> off<00:05:25.450> he<00:05:25.740> hesitates<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.890> makes<00:05:27.730> it

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910
