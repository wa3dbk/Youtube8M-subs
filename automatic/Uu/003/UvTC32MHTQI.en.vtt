00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 ayotte waited for an all my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 videos the dyads so this will be video of 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.230
 team building then in the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 last video creation of the summer uma 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.099
 a lot to ask me what do you see 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.809
 true I have a lot of credit nasa you 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.480
 can do team creations 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.010
 for those who do not have a lot of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 credit so that is to say in the 100 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.650
 200 to 300 and feared stuff like 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.750
 it 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.580
 so here I am going to try a little bit 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.560
 now to do some of the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 team creations whether for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.939
 small budgets means budgets 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.650
 big budget and even huge d 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.329
 budget we will see later what 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.030
 I will do like parking type so there 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.399
 it's an original team with when 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 not bad information tested for you 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.430
 so it will still be a team base 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.120
 basically on a few small 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.620
 Swiss players 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.149
 we will start with the first 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 player it's diego benaglio the keeper 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.520
 of wolfsburg so so here is the live 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.190
 not bad at all with 84.2 dive 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.469
 4-1-3-2 reflex he does the taf with a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 size of m 94 still a guardian I 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.890
 advise you very widely for 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.750
 o'byrne more here they know keeper 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 will have cheap he does the top 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.809
 here I have no problem with him for 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.880
 the central hinge 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.220
 we had fabien richard version inform 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.330
 I wanted to test it but it's 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 it yields that had a little 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.920
 that's high high but frankly it's okay 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.180
 it's clearly late in addition 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.409
 frankly I was amazed there is a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.100
 good strike and all for a defender 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.560
 central 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
 he can shoot the penaltys even a few 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.409
 free kicks late he does not really die 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.600
 very very good when you look at that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 because still his little 9 in speed 81 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.490
 in defense 86 years old physics is very 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.229
 very good 20 86 more but leaves to these 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 great so here I advise you in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 plus this four star edit 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.540
 for a central defender it's when 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.430
 not bad so in addition my life a goal 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.409
 and a decisive pass for a defender 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.170
 central I repeat in case of fashion it's 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.420
 not bad for 2013 next to him we have 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 so johan djouror the hamburg player 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.659
 so at best to have a little more 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.030
 three concrete case nor believe I was 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.610
 a small deal on it but here it is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.560
 is not bad but 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.940
 but this is the year a plus because the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.760
 stadiums anyway we see that because for 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.950
 a money are 13th defense center 15 of 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.430
 physical one meter 91 and yield 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.440
 high fire defense says to yves is huge 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.880
 huge huge but it's okay it's good but 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.830
 I was expecting 10 years even more 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.750
 huge but I still advise it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.550
 is in very good condition you speak more 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.920
 in addition to magnificent assists but 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.510
 for self central is not bad defense 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.660
 on the left we have the quarterbacks 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.990
 rodriguez him certainly I say 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.640
 definitely have a second 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.260
 version a form so it will be so 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.780
 good shape i think next wednesday 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.700
 because bailly lamy he put a doubled 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 this weekend in league with two 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.570
 days so for a side defender 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.310
 left that doubled necessarily said I 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.989
 think karting form 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.000
 so if there there will be very very 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.140
 beautiful sapes even if there is already very 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.730
 very good stats he's really very 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.220
 very good I advise you for a little 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.080
 less than 50000 creek I bought it 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.680
 came back very good I advise you the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.260
 nif a goal and then defender 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.540
 right side one to his fans he won in 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.150
 version a tape of course because he 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.310
 is the basic idea and it makes the sphere 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.170
 85 breaks me 80 in defense 4 3 in 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.609
 physical as in attack and b and 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.319
 defense is beautiful so you will see 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.489
 close up everywhere and his cream well he is 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.829
 really very very good for a little less 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.329
 70 kg 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.730
 the two backgrounds so here we have a 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.640
 minicar miti to a family who that 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.050
 I had 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.660
 I liked a lot during another 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.790
 team there a little less really I 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.160
 do not know why I did not choose a 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.680
 only decisive pass in four matches 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.510
 whereas before but nesta who is not 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.830
 really monstrous before as did 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.790
 African line with why they 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.440
 accuse of match in passing 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.480
 but now you have to 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.140
 have it a lot less than 10000 credit 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.600
 if ever so that's it's not synonymous 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.760
 enormously expensive for charity then the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.170
 honda and gilles yapi yapo then him 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.260
 frankly before very very good I you 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.880
 this player recommends zurich 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.650
 when you see his silver card have 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.880
 said here you are not very good but 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.440
 frankly I really saw it all 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.540
 everywhere this player while there he has 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.550
 76 years old speed and 66 years of the 175 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.900
 physical is still 17 not bad 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.160
 but not exceptional besides the 3g 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.570
 that he said no and so it's not 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
 disgusting for a central place 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.870
 reason she has to frankly make 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.150
 at first I was skeptical but he does 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.880
 do I advise you of course to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.410
 side one to valentin store a good player 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.610
 well, it's a pity he has not four 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.800
 g7 stars I think it would be 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.090
 better so long but hey he does it 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.040
 does the job for a small team 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.450
 was not places I found 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.250
 that there was still a good 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.000
 speed despite his 83rd he would have given 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.530
 a good 86-87 he gay but good damage 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.250
 we do not see more on the ground because 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.540
 that I was not too skipper in md 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.000
 of course time to name one 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.130
 caravan shaqiri I would have taken a 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.569
 but I had come back to amaze 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.029
 seeing his price 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.309
 version to mozilla I was there okay ok 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.149
 the maquis choice and taste over 600000 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:47.300
 something like that 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:49.699
 in premium it is a little cracked on this 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.469
 shot there but left very very good for 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.059
 the regular version of its 88 speed 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.409
 goal pulls 90 from his clinics and we 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.939
 repeat how many keepers but I think 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.399
 that you can have to go 2000 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:01.069
 credit france even a little bit less in 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:03.619
 did we at yassine el shaarawy of course the 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.839
 version of a form I had overchanged the 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:07.699
 regular version hosted by egypt which 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.289
 does the iphone version it's really 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.789
 very very good and its 5 stars gc cnic 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.289
 and 5 stars and my feet with a good 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.619
 speed in addition 85 years of actions 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.180
 surrendered shots 4 assists 4 from drill 74 to 

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:19.339
 chile you see this map has a bus 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.589
 a mast 89.6 sites to their name to 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:24.619
 kids and more for 12250 made illegal 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:26.300
 it's huge 4 games 4 goals I would have 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:26.930
 could do a lot more but now 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.699
 that's not bad 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.749
 so few matches I advise you 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.180
 of course on the paws and it's still 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:35.209
 really very very good and finally we 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.029
 so takes place der der meech the player of the 

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:39.860
 bayer leverkusen 4 matches 3 goals and 4 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.509
 decisive assists though though vick has 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.539
 almost put all the assists 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:47.360
 for chirac yes really very very very 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.879
 very good scénar mitch that sends a 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.529
 listen when I think about especially the 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.439
 fifa on all the games all the same that 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:57.050
 be it on before fifa 14 year 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:59.209
 last in ton t on very very good on 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.129
 pbs i did not have it really is very very 

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:02.779
 good there too banal exit almost 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.050
 go there too was not doing 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.240
 enough 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.889
 it's weird in any case I like 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.389
 a lot this derby that even if he did not 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.099
 stats when we look we say 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.439
 here you go there are stadiums but not 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.779
 no more exceptional for us to say 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:17.749
 be the two player mode so yeah 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:19.610
 88 s 82-81 dream it's stats 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:22.069
 go back very far from the state in 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.449
 my very complete so I find crowd 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.639
 to have for just under 3000 credit 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.809
 but that's what makes my back ache 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.249
 of course it is not capital g7 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:32.639
 nique but it's not disgusting 80 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.149
 technique for a scorer it can do 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.819
 the difference 

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:37.499
 we could only see this team what 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.119
 what has become simply so 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:40.889
 so that's exactly what you'll have 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.999
 pleased for this team we are a 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.039
 little to the dismissal remedy is not 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:46.139
