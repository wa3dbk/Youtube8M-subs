00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 hello youtube friends are welcome 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.700
 to a new video and today we're going to see how 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.049
 reset mozilla browser 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.529
 firefox this can solve us many 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:21.060
 problems we have with the browser 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 and so avoid being uninstalling the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.789
 browser and reinstalling for 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.850
 this I recommend you save your 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.060
 essential and good information 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.270
 we are going to go 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.080
 to the browser 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.080
 let's click 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.900
 we go to this part 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.650
 and in this option it says help 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.050
 this contextual menu will open and 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.040
 we click on restart with the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.830
 add-ons disabled will appear 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.520
 this dialog box and we give in 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.520
 restart 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.560
 this window will appear and here 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.910
 we can choose to start in safe mode 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 or reset firefox you can read 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.750
 here what the details 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.119
 but I recommend that if you have 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.979
 errors in the browser can 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 reset firefox and see if it solves 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.960
 the problem since it is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.960
 restoring 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.290
 in reset 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.760
 as previously it had been said that 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.470
 save your information that you have in the 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.520
 browser 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.080
 but also the browser will be 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.170
 leaving a folder 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.790
 which is a backup for example 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.240
 which tells us of old data from 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 firefox 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.950
 and how can you tell 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 I do not have the idea that if I installed it 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.530
 Recently 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.420
 restored absolutely everything you can 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.170
 see if your problem continues or continues 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.920
 be solved 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.850
 If your problem continues I recommend you 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.660
 what 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.060
 analyze your computer an antivirus for 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.520
 see if it finds virus I advise you to 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.130
 visit the official website of the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.950
 mozilla firefox browser that has 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.370
 a support for several problems that you 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.980
 they can go by
