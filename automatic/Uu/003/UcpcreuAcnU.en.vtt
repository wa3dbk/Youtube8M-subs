00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
oh okay then I think that this little

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.479 
oh okay then I think that this little
button<00:04:13.319> here<00:04:13.439> does<00:04:14.370> whatever<00:04:14.790> Chula<00:04:15.599> is<00:04:15.900> and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
button here does whatever Chula is and

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.599 
button here does whatever Chula is and
this<00:04:17.489> button<00:04:17.880> boosts<00:04:18.739> whatever<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.070> that

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
this button boosts whatever it is that

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.870 
this button boosts whatever it is that
this<00:04:20.940> button<00:04:21.329> does<00:04:22.280> kind<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.370> makes<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.699> a

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
this button does kind of makes it a

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.320 
this button does kind of makes it a
little<00:04:23.940> gritty<00:04:24.449> brighter<00:04:25.520> not<00:04:26.520> necessarily

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
little gritty brighter not necessarily

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.060 
little gritty brighter not necessarily
louder<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:28.430> little<00:04:29.430> ratty<00:04:29.639> er<00:04:29.960> anyway<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.349> guess

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
louder a little ratty er anyway I guess
