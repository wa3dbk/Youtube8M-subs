do and I hope one day you tube will
learn<00:06:34.070> that<00:06:34.099> they<00:06:34.430> need<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:34.789> spread<00:06:35.090> this<00:06:35.300> to

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.330 
learn that they need to spread this to
other<00:06:35.659> channels<00:06:36.289> because<00:06:36.469> it's<00:06:36.860> kind<00:06:37.039> of<00:06:37.190> not

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
other channels because it's kind of not

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.450 
other channels because it's kind of not
fair<00:06:37.669> to<00:06:37.849> have<00:06:38.029> this<00:06:38.240> just<00:06:38.630> for

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
fair to have this just for

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.150 
fair to have this just for
larger<00:06:39.729> channels<00:06:40.000> but<00:06:40.889> that's<00:06:41.889> for<00:06:42.130> another

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
larger channels but that's for another

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.980 
larger channels but that's for another
video<00:06:42.490> another<00:06:42.970> day<00:06:43.120> when<00:06:43.270> I<00:06:43.300> discuss<00:06:43.720> that
