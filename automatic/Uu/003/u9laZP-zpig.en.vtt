packaging<00:00:15.139> so<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.590> think<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.850> really

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
packaging so I think it's a really

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.840 
packaging so I think it's a really
really<00:00:18.750> pretty<00:00:19.140> way<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> store<00:00:20.279> your<00:00:20.369> lipstick

so let you come in closer so I really

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.389 
so let you come in closer so I really
like<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.789> color<00:00:54.000> um<00:00:54.390> no<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.860> lips<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.190> very

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
like this color um no my lips are very

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.240 
like this color um no my lips are very
pigmented<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.050> shows<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> darker<00:00:59.039> than<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
pigmented so it shows a darker than it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
pigmented so it shows a darker than it
would<00:00:59.579> say<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.090> someone<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.809> normal

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
would say for someone with like normal

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
would say for someone with like normal
colored<00:01:01.800> lips<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.399> normal<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.390> guess<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.840> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
colored lips so normal I guess as in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.810 
colored lips so normal I guess as in
like<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.350> bit<00:01:04.559> lighter<00:01:04.799> mine<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.640> dark

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
like a bit lighter mine are really dark

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
like a bit lighter mine are really dark
for<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.210> skin<00:01:06.450> tone<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.290> kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.650> makes

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
for my skin tone so it kind of makes

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.880 
for my skin tone so it kind of makes
this<00:01:08.340> lipstick<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:08.909> darker<00:01:09.360> um<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
this lipstick look darker um it's like a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.820 
this lipstick look darker um it's like a
medium<00:01:11.430> light<00:01:11.939> pink<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> put<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.710> on

medium light pink on when I put it on

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
medium light pink on when I put it on
it's<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> medium<00:01:14.970> pink<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.780> said

it's just like a medium pink like I said

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
it's just like a medium pink like I said
since<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.350> pigment<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:16.979> natural<00:01:17.130> lips

since my pigment of my natural lips

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.570

increases<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.729> lips<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.079> really

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
increases in my lips and I really really

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.550 
increases in my lips and I really really
like<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> feeling<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.579> um<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:37.200> doesn't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
like the feeling of it um it doesn't

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.649 
like the feeling of it um it doesn't
feather<00:01:37.979> away<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:38.820> lines<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
feather away into my lines and it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.740 
feather away into my lines and it
doesn't<00:01:39.960> smear<00:01:40.680> um<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.729> wouldn't<00:01:42.270> say<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
doesn't smear um I wouldn't say that

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
doesn't smear um I wouldn't say that
it's<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> longest<00:01:44.009> lasting<00:01:44.369> lipstick

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's like the longest lasting lipstick

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.600 
it's like the longest lasting lipstick
but<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.240> does<00:01:45.390> last<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.810> good<00:01:46.020> time<00:01:46.610> I'm

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
but it does last a good time I'm

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.420 
but it does last a good time I'm
thinking<00:01:47.869> for<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> price<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:50.070> probably

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
thinking for the price you can probably

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340 
thinking for the price you can probably
just<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> regular<00:01:50.820> lipsticks<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.079> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
just get the regular lipsticks and it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
just get the regular lipsticks and it
would<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.399> same<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.939> mostly<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
would be just the same it's mostly the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.420 
would be just the same it's mostly the
packaging<00:01:54.930> you're<00:01:55.170> buying<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.890> score<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
packaging you're buying the score I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700 
packaging you're buying the score I
still<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.659> worth<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> i'd<00:01:58.200> buy<00:01:58.409> more

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
still think it's worth it i'd buy more

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.520 
still think it's worth it i'd buy more

Canadian<00:03:14.640> um<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.450> think<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.040> worth<00:03:17.250> the

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
Canadian um I think it is worth the

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.520

price anything girl and me is worth the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.860 
price anything girl and me is worth the
price<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.640> color<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:20.970> gorgeous<00:03:21.269> they<00:03:21.750> had
