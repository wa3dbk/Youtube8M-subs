fractal<00:00:03.179> design<00:00:03.330> certainly<00:00:04.020> has<00:00:04.230> some<00:00:04.500> really

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
fractal design certainly has some really

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.619 
fractal design certainly has some really
good<00:00:04.950> options<00:00:05.160> for<00:00:05.430> cases<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.270> mid<00:00:06.420> tower

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
good options for cases in the mid tower

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.020 
good options for cases in the mid tower
range<00:00:06.960> all<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.710> which<00:00:07.830> carry<00:00:08.130> similar<00:00:08.700> design

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
range all of which carry similar design

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.209 
range all of which carry similar design
that<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.420> functional<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.219> user-friendly

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
that is functional and user-friendly

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.370 
that is functional and user-friendly
both<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> define<00:00:12.300> then<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> arc<00:00:12.809> series<00:00:13.200> are

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
both the define then the arc series are

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.709 
both the define then the arc series are
designed<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.130> suit<00:00:14.400> your<00:00:14.639> specific<00:00:14.700> needs

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
designed to suit your specific needs

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.080 
designed to suit your specific needs
but<00:00:16.109> each<00:00:16.289> case<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.949> unique<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.760> its<00:00:17.910> own<00:00:18.029> way

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
but each case is unique in its own way

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.090 
but each case is unique in its own way
so<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> latest<00:00:18.960> addition<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> arc<00:00:19.680> series

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
so the latest addition to the arc series

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.790 
so the latest addition to the arc series
is<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.609> midi<00:00:20.880> r2<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:22.050> takes<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> internal

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
is the midi r2 which takes the internal

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
is the midi r2 which takes the internal
