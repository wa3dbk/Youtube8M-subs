to our course planet Oriole today I'm
going<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.420> show<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.569> how<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.839> use<00:00:06.990> course<00:00:07.290> play

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
going to show you how to use course play

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.280 
going to show you how to use course play
to<00:00:07.589> pick<00:00:07.830> up<00:00:07.980> straw<00:00:08.280> using<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.179> loading<00:00:09.990> waggon

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
to pick up straw using a loading waggon

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.720 
to pick up straw using a loading waggon
so<00:00:10.380> let's<00:00:10.500> going<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.679> apply<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> grass<00:00:11.190> as<00:00:11.490> well

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
so let's going to apply to grass as well

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.459 
so let's going to apply to grass as well
so<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.420> couple<00:00:12.540> different<00:00:12.660> options<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.230> have

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
so a couple different options we have

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.829 
so a couple different options we have
here<00:00:13.580> as<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:14.790> see<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> combine<00:00:15.599> on

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
here as you can see I have a combine on

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.540 
here as you can see I have a combine on
the<00:00:15.960> field<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.529> I've<00:00:16.650> done<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.100> I've

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the field and what I've done is I've

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
the field and what I've done is I've
generated<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.330> course<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> combine<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
generated a course for the combine and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.859 
generated a course for the combine and
it's<00:00:19.980> currently<00:00:20.189> mowing<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.060> then<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.689> just

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it's currently mowing so then you just

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.200 
it's currently mowing so then you just
set<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.140> its<00:00:22.199> way<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.029> so<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> was

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
set it on its way it like that so I was

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.330 
set it on its way it like that so I was
a<00:00:24.269> pre<00:00:24.480> generated<00:00:24.930> course<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.289> had<00:00:25.439> setup<00:00:25.680> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
a pre generated course I had setup so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490 
a pre generated course I had setup so
all<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.670> need<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.330> copy<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> same

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
all you need to do is copy the same

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.189 
all you need to do is copy the same
course<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.330> case<00:00:30.570> IH

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
course as you can see I have the case IH

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
course as you can see I have the case IH
axial-flow<00:00:31.619> 92<00:00:32.130> 30<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> copy

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
axial-flow 92 30 so it's going to copy

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.200 
axial-flow 92 30 so it's going to copy
the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.290> course<00:00:34.590> instead<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> drives<00:00:36.059> in

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the same course instead so it drives in

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
the same course instead so it drives in
the<00:00:36.270> nearest<00:00:36.510> Waypoint<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the nearest Waypoint and it's going to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520 
the nearest Waypoint and it's going to
follow<00:00:38.399> right<00:00:38.760> behind<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.570> combine<00:00:40.079> right

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
follow right behind that combine right

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.200 
follow right behind that combine right
there<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
there just like that that's going to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.580 
there just like that that's going to
collect<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.660> straw<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.610> okay<00:00:45.590> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
collect your straw like so okay so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.380 
collect your straw like so okay so
that's<00:00:47.010> how<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.399> collect<00:00:47.670> straw<00:00:47.940> using

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that's how you can collect straw using

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
that's how you can collect straw using
that<00:00:48.629> method<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.820> second<00:00:51.570> method<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.230> can

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that method the second method you can

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.150 
that method the second method you can
use<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.320> rake<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.920> field

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
use is over here you can rake the field

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.000 
use is over here you can rake the field
up<00:00:56.370> together<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.020> rake<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> field<00:00:58.559> using

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
up together you can rake the field using

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
up together you can rake the field using
a<00:00:59.100> rake<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.270> follow<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.989> same<00:01:01.199> course

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a rake and then follow the same course

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.080 
a rake and then follow the same course
as<00:01:01.710> your<00:01:02.160> Rick<00:01:02.460> let<00:01:02.730> me<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.969> demonstrate

rake we have set up over here let's just
stop<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.610> course<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> turn<00:01:13.830> around

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
stop that course there and turn around

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.500 
stop that course there and turn around
and<00:01:14.430> I'll<00:01:14.909> show<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.540> looks<00:01:15.720> like

want to drive into drive into the field

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.540 
want to drive into drive into the field
hit<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.120> calculate<00:01:28.360> field<00:01:28.960> field<00:01:29.530> edge<00:01:30.130> path

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
hit the calculate field field edge path

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.970 
hit the calculate field field edge path
and<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.570> this<00:01:31.660> case<00:01:31.900> this<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.080> fuel<00:01:32.350> number<00:01:32.560> 15

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
and in this case this is fuel number 15

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.670 
and in this case this is fuel number 15
so<00:01:33.160> I'm<00:01:33.220> go<00:01:33.370> ahead<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.640> overwrite<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:34.270> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so I'm go ahead and overwrite that and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.440 
so I'm go ahead and overwrite that and
I'm<00:01:35.680> going<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.890> choose<00:01:36.190> field<00:01:36.790> number<00:01:36.940> 15

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
I'm going to choose field number 15

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.990 
I'm going to choose field number 15
right<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.230> then<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.130> set<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.610> up<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:39.850> it's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
right here and then I set it up so it's

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.020 
right here and then I set it up so it's
the<00:01:40.060> northeast<00:01:40.570> corner<00:01:40.840> heading<00:01:41.260> south<00:01:41.560> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the northeast corner heading south and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.280 
the northeast corner heading south and
set<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.330> does<00:01:43.480> not<00:01:43.510> return<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.170> the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
set it so it does not return to the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.980 
set it so it does not return to the
first<00:01:44.470> point<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.280> there<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.610> go<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
first point so there you go that's the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.600 
first point so there you go that's the
very<00:01:47.230> first<00:01:47.470> point<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:47.860> let's<00:01:48.010> set<00:01:48.220> back<00:01:48.400> on

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
very first point so let's set back on

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.230 
very first point so let's set back on
his<00:01:48.850> way<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:51.040> we'll<00:01:51.190> set<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.369> up<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.790> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
his way and we'll set that up to the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.170 
his way and we'll set that up to the
first<00:01:52.510> Waypoint<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:54.040> what<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.250> do<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:54.940> copy

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
first Waypoint so what we do is we copy

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.200 
first Waypoint so what we do is we copy
the<00:01:55.390> same<00:01:55.570> course<00:01:55.840> as<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.770> guy<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.820> let's<00:02:01.090> go

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
is going to demonstrate how would work

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.330 
is going to demonstrate how would work

we're<00:03:54.980> going<00:03:55.099> to<00:03:55.129> add<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:56.799> f-15<00:03:57.799> unload

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
we're going to add it to f-15 unload

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.929 
we're going to add it to f-15 unload
straw<00:03:58.939> so<00:03:59.930> let's<00:04:00.049> go<00:04:00.199> ahead<00:04:00.319> and<00:04:00.730> set<00:04:01.730> them<00:04:01.819> on

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
straw so let's go ahead and set them on

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.520 
straw so let's go ahead and set them on
the<00:04:02.150> nearest<00:04:02.540> Waypoint<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.260> see<00:04:03.409> what

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
the nearest Waypoint and see what

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.530 
the nearest Waypoint and see what
happens<00:04:06.790> apparently<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.879> nearest<00:04:08.120> waypoints

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
happens apparently the nearest waypoints

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.729 
happens apparently the nearest waypoints
in<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.659> other<00:04:08.780> direction<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.260> let's<00:04:09.439> go<00:04:09.590> over

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
in the other direction so let's go over

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.539 
in the other direction so let's go over
here<00:04:10.040> quickly<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:11.859> let's<00:04:12.859> follow<00:04:13.189> along

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
here quickly and let's follow along

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.370 
here quickly and let's follow along
right<00:04:14.150> here

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.430 

and<00:04:17.580> here<00:04:18.580> we<00:04:18.670> go<00:04:18.820> nearest<00:04:19.300> Waypoint<00:04:19.720> that's

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
and here we go nearest Waypoint that's

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.350 
and here we go nearest Waypoint that's
going<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.620> follow<00:04:20.800> along<00:04:20.950> here<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.580> it's

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
going to follow along here and it's

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.660 
going to follow along here and it's
going<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.540> be<00:04:22.810> it's<00:04:22.990> going<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.140> be<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:24.550> going

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
going to be it's going to be it's going

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.010 
going to be it's going to be it's going
to<00:04:24.760> fill<00:04:24.970> up<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.270> that's<00:04:25.480> going<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.690> go<00:04:25.810> and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
to fill up and that's going to go and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.450 
to fill up and that's going to go and
drive<00:04:26.230> that<00:04:26.470> course<00:04:26.740> right<00:04:26.950> there<00:04:26.980> so<00:04:27.340> let's

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
drive that course right there so let's

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.800 
drive that course right there so let's
see<00:04:27.610> what<00:04:27.790> happens<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:31.300> right<00:04:31.450> now<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.630> way

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
see what happens so right now the way

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.320 
see what happens so right now the way
it's<00:04:31.900> going<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.050> do<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.590> it's<00:04:32.890> going<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.330> go

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
it's going to do it is it's going to go

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.880 
it's going to do it is it's going to go
to<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:35.730> it's<00:04:36.730> going<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.000> go<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:38.320> end<00:04:38.590> of

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
to the it's going to go to the end of

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.910 
to the it's going to go to the end of
the<00:04:39.600> course<00:04:40.600> first<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.170> then<00:04:41.560> it's<00:04:41.710> going<00:04:41.830> to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
the course first and then it's going to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.370 
the course first and then it's going to
go<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.310> unloading<00:04:42.790> point<00:04:43.140> okay

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
go to the unloading point okay

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.490 
go to the unloading point okay
so<00:04:45.100> here<00:04:45.550> it's<00:04:45.760> filling<00:04:46.060> up<00:04:46.150> it's<00:04:46.360> at<00:04:46.450> 85<00:04:46.740> 86<00:04:48.390> 90

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
so here it's filling up it's at 85 86 90

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.180 
so here it's filling up it's at 85 86 90
92<00:04:53.070> that's<00:04:54.070> 99<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:54.820> now<00:04:54.940> it's<00:04:55.090> stopped<00:04:56.190> it's

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
92 that's 99 so now it's stopped it's

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.500 
92 that's 99 so now it's stopped it's
turning<00:04:57.490> around<00:05:00.030> speed<00:05:01.030> this<00:05:01.150> up<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.390> little

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
turning around speed this up a little

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.640 
turning around speed this up a little
bit<00:05:01.750> it's<00:05:02.680> going<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.890> go<00:05:03.010> to<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.720> waypoint<00:05:04.720> as

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
bit it's going to go to the waypoint as

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.200 
bit it's going to go to the waypoint as
you<00:05:06.550> can<00:05:06.700> see

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.100 

and<00:05:10.530> then<00:05:11.530> it's<00:05:11.710> going<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:12.210> do<00:05:13.210> it's<00:05:13.540> unload

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
and then it's going to do it's unload

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.720 
and then it's going to do it's unload
course<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:14.860> here<00:05:15.040> we<00:05:15.130> go<00:05:15.250> it's<00:05:15.370> going<00:05:15.520> out<00:05:15.670> to

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
course so here we go it's going out to

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.360 
course so here we go it's going out to
the<00:05:16.680> unload<00:05:17.680> portion<00:05:19.920> so<00:05:20.920> it<00:05:21.010> doesn't<00:05:21.250> go<00:05:21.310> to

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
the unload portion so it doesn't go to

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.760 
the unload portion so it doesn't go to
the<00:05:21.460> end<00:05:21.640> in<00:05:21.760> this<00:05:21.880> case<00:05:22.440> sometimes<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.590> does

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
the end in this case sometimes it does

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.080 
the end in this case sometimes it does
depending<00:05:24.220> on<00:05:24.310> what<00:05:24.490> type<00:05:24.670> of<00:05:24.760> course<00:05:24.940> you're

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
depending on what type of course you're

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.090 
depending on what type of course you're
running<00:05:25.330> so<00:05:25.450> in<00:05:25.540> this<00:05:25.630> case<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:25.990> does<00:05:26.140> not<00:05:26.170> so

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
running so in this case it does not so

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.740 
running so in this case it does not so
it's<00:05:27.250> going<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.760> unload<00:05:28.150> course<00:05:28.420> which<00:05:28.630> is

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
it's going to the unload course which is

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.900 
it's going to the unload course which is
coming<00:05:28.930> up<00:05:29.110> around<00:05:29.710> here<00:05:30.070> this<00:05:30.550> is<00:05:30.700> where<00:05:30.820> we

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
coming up around here this is where we

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.110 
coming up around here this is where we
started<00:05:31.210> our<00:05:31.330> record<00:05:32.820> recording<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.940> course

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
started our record recording the course

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.370 
started our record recording the course
so<00:05:34.240> there<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:34.450> go<00:05:34.600> it's<00:05:34.750> driving<00:05:35.170> around

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
so there you go it's driving around

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.260 
so there you go it's driving around
there<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:37.110> now<00:05:38.110> it's<00:05:38.290> making<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.710> turn<00:05:38.950> and

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
there and now it's making the turn and

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.730 
there and now it's making the turn and
it's<00:05:40.270> going<00:05:40.390> to<00:05:40.450> drive<00:05:40.720> past<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.140> unloading

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
it's going to drive past that unloading

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.340 
it's going to drive past that unloading
point<00:05:42.240> so<00:05:43.240> it<00:05:43.330> should<00:05:43.510> say<00:05:43.660> tip<00:05:43.990> trigger<00:05:44.200> is

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
point so it should say tip trigger is

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.470 
point so it should say tip trigger is
reached<00:05:45.960> there<00:05:46.960> he<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:48.120> stopping<00:05:49.120> and

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
reached there he is and stopping and

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.630 
reached there he is and stopping and
unloading<00:05:50.380> now<00:05:50.410> you<00:05:50.560> can<00:05:50.800> do<00:05:50.890> that<00:05:50.920> same<00:05:51.340> thing

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
unloading now you can do that same thing

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.300 
unloading now you can do that same thing
with<00:05:51.670> a<00:05:52.270> sell<00:05:52.750> point<00:05:53.080> depending<00:05:54.010> on<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.160> style

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
with a sell point depending on the style

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.800 
with a sell point depending on the style
point<00:05:54.580> not<00:05:54.700> every<00:05:54.940> sell<00:05:55.120> point<00:05:55.390> works<00:05:55.570> that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
point not every sell point works that

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.780 
point not every sell point works that
easily<00:05:56.230> but<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:57.010> can<00:05:57.220> do<00:05:57.310> with<00:05:57.400> any<00:05:57.550> type<00:05:57.640> of

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
easily but you can do with any type of

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.360 
easily but you can do with any type of
course<00:05:58.150> so<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:59.590> thing<00:05:59.770> you<00:05:59.830> need<00:05:59.950> to<00:05:59.980> do<00:06:00.160> is

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
course so the thing you need to do is

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.900 
course so the thing you need to do is
you<00:06:01.150> can<00:06:01.300> follow<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.660> same<00:06:01.840> course<00:06:02.080> as<00:06:02.320> a<00:06:02.910> rake

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
you can follow the same course as a rake

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.340 
you can follow the same course as a rake
or<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:04.300> can<00:06:04.450> follow<00:06:04.540> the<00:06:04.660> same<00:06:04.900> course<00:06:05.140> as<00:06:05.320> a

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
or you can follow the same course as a
