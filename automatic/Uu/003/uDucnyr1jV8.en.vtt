contaminants the steps of playing a fish
start<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.370> making<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.910> cut<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.660> behind<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
start with making a cut just behind the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
start with making a cut just behind the
head<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> top<00:00:43.980> part<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> fillet<00:00:44.700> then

head at the top part of the fillet then

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.440 
head at the top part of the fillet then
you<00:00:45.719> make<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.250> cut<00:00:47.250> along<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
you make a cut along the back of the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
you make a cut along the back of the
fish<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.230> creates<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> outline<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.250> the

fillet then starting without outline you
make<00:00:53.520> cuts<00:00:53.879> keeping<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> knife<00:00:54.870> flat<00:00:55.199> against

the ribs of the fillet until you've
removed<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> entire<00:01:06.810> play<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> fish

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
removed the entire play from the fish

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
removed the entire play from the fish
leaving<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> triangular<00:01:08.850> shaped<00:01:09.450> piece<00:01:10.049> of

fish one of the benefits of filleting

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.410 
fish one of the benefits of filleting
the<00:01:12.630> fish<00:01:12.659> by<00:01:13.560> cutting<00:01:13.890> around<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.610> ribs<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the fish by cutting around the ribs is

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.020 
the fish by cutting around the ribs is
it<00:01:15.780> keeps<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.259> fillet<00:01:16.560> isolated<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it keeps the fillet isolated from the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
it keeps the fillet isolated from the
internal<00:01:18.720> organs<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> fish<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:19.979> people

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
internal organs of the fish some people

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.530 
internal organs of the fish some people
when<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.490> fillet<00:01:20.759> fish<00:01:21.000> they'll<00:01:21.299> cut

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
when they fillet fish they'll cut

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.140 
when they fillet fish they'll cut
through<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.080> ribs<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
through the ribs like this and what that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.719 
through the ribs like this and what that
does<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.930> will<00:01:25.200> expose<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> fillet<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> blood

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
does it will expose a fillet to blood

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
does it will expose a fillet to blood
and<00:01:27.090> internal<00:01:27.900> organs<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.409> high

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and internal organs that have high

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
and internal organs that have high
levels<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.159> contaminants<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.210> much

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
levels of contaminants so it's much

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.090 
levels of contaminants so it's much
better<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> try<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> cut<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.320> round<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> belly

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
better to try to cut it round the belly

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.730 
better to try to cut it round the belly
instead<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.670> through<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> next<00:01:34.560> step<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
instead of through it the next step is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.340 
instead of through it the next step is
to<00:01:34.920> remove<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.180> skin<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:36.990> important

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to remove the skin it's very important

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
to remove the skin it's very important
to<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.430> skin<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to do so because the skin has a lot of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.240 
to do so because the skin has a lot of
the<00:01:39.990> fat<00:01:40.229> content

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the fat content

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.680 
the fat content
by<00:01:41.310> removing<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.730> again<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> reduce<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
by removing this again you reduce that

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.840 
by removing this again you reduce that
additional<00:01:43.260> fat<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.400> lay<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
additional fat do that you lay the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.270 
additional fat do that you lay the
fillet<00:01:45.240> flat<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.380> cutting<00:01:46.740> boards<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.190> a
