00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.720
 hi to all and mechanics so 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:14.780
 today we find ourselves on pokemon 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:21.289
 white your black and white pokemon here and there 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:23.269
 for a small studio for how 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.050
 raise his level pokemon 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:31.250
 quickly so you know very simple for 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.840
 that it will take you a simple regrowth 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.360
 1 2 regrowth d max repels you 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.219
 want a lucky egg so the absence 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.600
 it's just for the poleman to win + 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.210
 22 for the experience 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.339
 if he did not have to and the multi 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.769
 experts expert trades it's just for 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.659
 train the little ones even weak what 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:54.619
 the weak pokemons they will have 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:56.720
 struggling to defend himself and that became an example 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.790
 late room that will not take much 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.670
 attacked that really has some level 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.070
 and so suddenly it will not be possible to 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.360
 defend 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.520
 so the expert muc can be 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.880
 contractor so has the material so 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.560
 that's all so to do that it's very 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.920
 simple you have to go into a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.860
 road 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.860
 so any of the herbs do not 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.409
 not according to example without passion 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.780
 now here is my resume 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.490
 that's like no in the face that's 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.820
 absent there is in there is no 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.020
 trees 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.450
 ebay who let us know in march so 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.830
 you want this method just as you 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.990
 and as I maintain the pokemon I 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.010
 seen that name them yes I really do not have 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
 a lot but a lot of points 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.670
 experience on the trip by the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.790
 quadruple the little words you 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.070
 beat normally so 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.930
 precisely so this method is going to be 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.080
 based on the named yes so have to have the 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.950
 beat I am very simple you go 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.950
 use a 10 inch 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.740
 so I 'm using this repel 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.020
 you will go where you are going 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.430
 run 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.940
 sometimes it can be fast sometimes 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.080
 can be really punctually 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.580
 in the air that moves must know 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 that we do not find names but 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.360
 yes so sometimes we will be able to find 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:32.170
 Roles case of trying finally plays 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.480
 low all here is a little move 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.800
 so you go in when you have 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.730
 a low regrowth is easy right here 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.700
 in place a whole master there are a lot 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:55.020
 experience goes but it's him it's 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:55.020
 rare that I quote did the person 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:07.800
 that her ass is going to annoy me 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:10.110
 So this time it is found a farmhouse 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.610
 all so a soul and yes you have to know 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.180
 that this is the building responds for no 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.890
 the more easily in the herbs 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.950
 and spices so here is the steffi 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.950
 jones 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.500
 I give a little slouch that it me 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.500
 knows 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.150
 so here you can only put yourself 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.530
 the dummy package or the world's at 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.049
 level so to see patrick is so 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.910
 currently it's on the site use 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.720
 the provence you go dancing in 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.380
 the tall grass 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.380
 you live 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.100
 it takes a lot of retouching 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.080
 sometimes it can take a very long time 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.570
 so this method I saw if she 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.630
 did not name 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.199
 and if I was appointed it is called 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.979
 of abuse method 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:27.160
 you drank I'm completely back 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.190
 maybe it's because it's the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.190
 place 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:43.960
 the number of the town hall so he has them 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.490
 so hear it can be practical and 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.440
 Here is city hall therefore has but yes 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.389
 that's a lot of nova we're going to win 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.550
 really the shops are so 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.130
 why we loved it because no and yes 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.220
 as I explained they really won 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.070
 a lot of money a lot of money 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.320
 far too much experience being beaten 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:10.800
 demonstration demonstration hollande 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.130
 because he confesses to be wary today 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:19.740
 at the total ga could beat him 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.740
 quickly he wrong me 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:42.550
 but what we do is they let me 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:43.750
 say here you go see how 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.490
 win the mans a lot of my 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:54.010
 experience should know that light is 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.980
 not luck he was not lucky person 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.950
 at home he would have won 3 me so finally 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.970
 the function of pokemon levels 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.440
 example it's my name but yes 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.110
 six names but where we had beaten 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.170
 summer 1944 jean win 3000 points 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.410
 of experience actually it depends 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.670
 depending on the level of pokemon 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.170
 example there for what if i'm it's too 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.820
 high level compared to montlhÃ©ry so 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.440
 he was not giving him a lot of points 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.840
 of experience my solo if he would have 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.840
 won twice what 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.130
 experience even three times more and he 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.380
 must also know that the two is not 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.700
 chance encounter luck on her birthday 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.180
 who will win a lot more dupes in 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.690
 excluded 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:42.100
 it's very convenient so the multi 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:44.350
 experts here are you then explain by 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.020
 against as I say let's not win 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.240
 a lot of his car experience he 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.349
 is advised to stop increasing his 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.770
 little world 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:59.569
 as for him yes all and level above 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.949
 pokemon no name but yes so me 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.479
 I continue to train because of 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:06.319
 that's it, you're going to face the 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:08.210
 league etc the herbs with the little ones 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:11.240
 the highest male that not many 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.659
 but we find the chance there the absence is 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:19.039
 found in the box and ultra 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:21.759
 electoral boundaries and who too much liszt and 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:25.389
 she offered by the teacher category 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:28.009
 konare so it increases by 50% 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:34.190
 the experience we gained we know 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:38.419
 really and well here I hope that 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:43.090
 rather, it will have helped you to 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:43.090
 you well and then
