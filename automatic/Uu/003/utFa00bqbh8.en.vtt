00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 all youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.480
 further technique sloth video with the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.980
 wet by junip so that with the second 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.410
 hard disk has no rest for me now 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 So let it all open again 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 and rausgeholt and then I have me 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.230
 bay closer look here you see 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 now a picture of the bay he 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 has worked hard drive slot 1 was 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 I believe that there on the ground 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.769
 black plastic part that is ours 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.779
 connector we float in the air 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.789
 and that worked and now 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 Let's take a look in the second 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.440
 bay pure and if there down 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.450
 pressure then you are right 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.270
 but what not the connector is below 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.280
 I did that on the floor on something like that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.280
 have the whole thing careful but 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.750
 something of careful up in the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 Russell I want to say not bent 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.879
 but pushed and the second hard drive 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.289
 pushed in and now we are sitting here 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.899
 and I already have a little bit of it 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.969
 played around and now if we have one 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 go to the control panel and then to the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.939
 memory manager then comes now a na 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.270
 where do we have it summary on 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.750
 left edge and we see hard disk 1 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 hard disk 2 both are now recognized 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.270
 heureka so it works 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.290
 a bit annoying but well now 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.540
 it works 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.540
 I then just started the trial 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.159
 in and failed miserably either 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.619
 because it does not work or because I am 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.990
 but hired and wanted out 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.369
 my just make a raid 1 here 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.520
 So a very simple hard disks 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.200
 Spiegelung speaks now on the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.150
 second hard disk one to one exactly 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.979
 the same so that already the energy 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.540
 drink video on it so that's it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.180
 just being mirrored if just mine 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.740
 hard disk fails that the data stop 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 still on the other are on it 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.040
 that did not work out right now 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.049
 I have activated two here 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.320
 formatted hard drives and he tries 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.909
 now to make my raid1 out of it 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.680
 I have to apparently volume synonymous 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.969
 I do not go and there is no japan 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.579
 of course googled a bit and 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.890
 apparently not everything dominate that 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.360
 afterwards from a single hard disk 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.430
 a raid 1 to tinker 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.930
 then in that case you just have to stop 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.150
 again the data from the hard disk 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.680
 on a third hard drive so pull 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.030
 any external or on the computer 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.880
 if not so much and 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.230
 then shut down first and in the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.610
 make raid1 out of it 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.680
 now we have under volume 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.550
 possibility to add a new volume 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.140
 create 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.440
 and there is now the possibility 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.720
 instead of static single volume one 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.470
 no, we want one of these multi 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.480
 volume 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.220
 where I confess myself there now 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.620
 me now not enough out to this 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 tell the difference from the memory 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.330
 pool with pre-assigned 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.489
 memory space or without advance 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.350
 allocated space so i say 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.700
 now just tens of times the volume 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.350
 maybe the other one is better too 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.150
 and here we can only say yes and 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.550
 if we go to the next page 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.959
 can go select the hard drives 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.790
 and we'll be down below 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.700
 suggested as what we put it together 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.580
 bio want to add the just a bunch of 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.650
 so do not just put everything on it 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.310
 raid 0 in the end yes actually exactly 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.680
 the same 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.300
 and then our reflection with the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.269
 raid 1 and then could that down times 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.330
 see bio that brings us 18 terabytes 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.970
 Data raid 0 brings us 1.8 terabytes 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.170
 data and raid 1 brings and then 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.090
 Of course only half 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.130
 I'll have a replacement for that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.900
 yes I do not have banias and now 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.730
 I can not do any higher race either 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.570
 So this is physical me 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.820
 not possible at all 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.030
 So now we are doing our raid 1 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.060
 then we get the infos 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.680
 volume capacity no no no at max 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.900
 We want full carrot 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.090
 expose and then the maximum volume 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.860
 capacity of the current memory space 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.690
 is yes, yes, yes it was tuned 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.160
 Note that if it is full then 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.840
 we can still do it all 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.420
 somehow call a coati or something 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.739
 encrypt release name but no 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.489
 I am not interested in everything now 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.190
 I also hang on and say her baby 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.590
 bastl me my advice together 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.200
 Of course, all data is deleted 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.750
 I mean again the same can 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.660
 install the hd apps here and then 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.620
 still cody and cromcast and airplay and 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.260
 what I do not already know 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.220
 but I wanted that 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.620
 show you if you have something like that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.540
 or so you know now why this 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.550
 If the second hard disk is not 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.990
 it will not be pushed in 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.670
 then it can be pushed down 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.590
 the connector the black plastic part 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.550
 which is not right at the right time 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.560
 position is and well that now you know 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.570
 Maybe I'm on Mondays 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.800
 get model of tuneup yes that wanted 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.770
 I just now just deliver 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.200
 So it works and you can now 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.660
 even as it was planned a raid 1 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.520
 from tinkering so many thanks for 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.970
 watching is good and the next one 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.970
 Video
