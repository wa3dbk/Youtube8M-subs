running the offense if you foul or you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.400 
running the offense if you foul or you
argue<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.239> coaches<00:00:52.110> about<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
argue with you with the coaches about a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.279 
argue with you with the coaches about a
call<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.520> team<00:00:53.760> gets<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.090> point<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
call the other team gets a point if you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.779 
call the other team gets a point if you
turn<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> ball<00:00:55.739> over<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.309> other<00:00:56.430> team<00:00:56.640> gets

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
turn the ball over the other team gets

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.420 
turn the ball over the other team gets
two<00:00:57.059> points<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.079> whatever<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.309> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
two points so whatever you think is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
two points so whatever you think is
important<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.629> specific<00:01:01.260> week<00:01:01.469> we

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
important that specific week we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.799 
important that specific week we
emphasize<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.579> maybe<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.600> need<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
emphasize you know maybe you need to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
emphasize you know maybe you need to
often<00:01:04.080> maybe<00:01:04.619> you're<00:01:04.769> laying<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.010> team<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.369> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
often maybe you're laying a team and you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.740 
often maybe you're laying a team and you
really<00:01:05.729> need<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.119> some<00:01:06.270> offensive

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
really need to get some offensive

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.240 
really need to get some offensive
rebounds<00:01:07.200> maybe<00:01:07.380> that'll<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.710> three<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.070> four

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
rebounds maybe that'll be three or four

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.390 
rebounds maybe that'll be three or four
points<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> key<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.710> point<00:01:10.979> values

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
points so the key is to put point values

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.890 
points so the key is to put point values
on<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.939> trying<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> emphasize<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
on what we're trying to emphasize we

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
on what we're trying to emphasize we
call<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> cut-throat<00:01:13.619> because<00:01:14.520> basically

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
call a cut-throat because basically

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.130 
call a cut-throat because basically
there<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.210> any<00:01:15.420> rules<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
there are any rules you know if the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.149 
there are any rules you know if the
coaches<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.259> blow<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> whistle<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
coaches don't blow the whistle if the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.550 
coaches don't blow the whistle if the
coaches<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.700> call<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.380> it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
coaches don't call it then you know it's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
coaches don't call it then you know it's
fair<00:01:22.740> game<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.159> ball<00:01:23.340> came<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.270> Bounce<00:01:24.450> or

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
fair game the ball came out of Bounce or

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
fair game the ball came out of Bounce or
whatever<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:25.890> lose<00:01:26.070> there's<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
whatever and when they lose there's a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
whatever and when they lose there's a
consequence<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.840> probably<00:01:28.140> some<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
consequence so you know probably some of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.440 
consequence so you know probably some of
the<00:01:28.680> most<00:01:28.890> intense<00:01:29.310> times<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> we've<00:01:30.030> had<00:01:30.060> in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the most intense times that we've had in

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.830 
the most intense times that we've had in
our<00:01:30.540> practices<00:01:31.460> at<00:01:32.460> least<00:01:33.030> over<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> last<00:01:33.509> ten

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
our practices at least over the last ten

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
the offense a little bit more so it all

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.140 
the offense a little bit more so it all
kind<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.200> managed<00:03:30.500> all<00:03:30.620> right<00:03:30.709> that's<00:03:30.920> good<00:03:31.150> so

what<00:03:33.049> we<00:03:33.260> do<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:34.310> again<00:03:34.820> like<00:03:35.180> I've<00:03:35.329> stated

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
what we do and again like I've stated

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.410 
what we do and again like I've stated
before<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:36.140> think<00:03:36.470> every<00:03:36.739> good<00:03:36.920> drill<00:03:37.280> has<00:03:37.519> some

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
before I think every good drill has some

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.300 
before I think every good drill has some
sort<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.810> competition<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.680> some<00:03:39.920> sort<00:03:40.220> of

there<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.390> it's<00:04:00.350> again<00:04:00.650> whatever<00:04:00.920> you

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
there so it's again whatever you

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.789 
there so it's again whatever you
emphasize<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:01.910> your<00:04:02.030> drills<00:04:02.530> kids<00:04:03.530> are<00:04:03.680> pretty

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
emphasize in your drills kids are pretty

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.080 
emphasize in your drills kids are pretty
smart<00:04:04.160> they're<00:04:04.400> going<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.579> figure<00:04:04.760> out<00:04:04.940> what

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
smart they're going to figure out what

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.000 
smart they're going to figure out what
you<00:04:05.209> think's<00:04:05.510> important<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.739> know<00:04:06.859> we

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
you think's important and you know we

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.130 
you think's important and you know we
always<00:04:07.190> think<00:04:07.340> digging<00:04:07.850> charges<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:09.049> then

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
always think digging charges and then

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.020 
always think digging charges and then
that<00:04:09.350> great<00:04:09.620> added<00:04:10.010> recently<00:04:10.609> but<00:04:10.790> we<00:04:10.880> always

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
that great added recently but we always

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.699 
that great added recently but we always
think<00:04:11.299> taking<00:04:11.540> charges<00:04:11.989> are<00:04:12.139> important<00:04:12.590> and

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
think taking charges are important and

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.900 
think taking charges are important and
getting<00:04:13.010> obviously<00:04:13.549> getting<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.820> the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
getting obviously getting to the

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.550 
getting obviously getting to the
offensive<00:04:14.389> glass

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
offensive glass

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.650 
offensive glass
so<00:04:16.100> again<00:04:16.640> you<00:04:16.790> got<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:16.940> be<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.150> little<00:04:17.420> creative

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
so again you got to be a little creative

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.360 
so again you got to be a little creative

whatever point value whatever you think

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.630 
whatever point value whatever you think
is<00:04:21.350> important<00:04:21.830> that's<00:04:21.920> what<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.190> got<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.400> do
