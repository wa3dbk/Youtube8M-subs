00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi guys okay is fast and became 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.189
 right and I come to talk about the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 subject that is law 2 with more books to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.980
 same time I received the email from the open 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.960
 asking me to talk about it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.940
 asking if I and the level of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.769
 I crabs and several books to the same 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.449
 time then there are some situations 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 depends a lot on the situation depends a lot 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 for example if one day I was 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.199
 learning a lot and I'm enjoying it 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.880
 much of the story or so of killing each 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.570
 Sodium with the forgiveness of chaotic suit nothing 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.809
 of this type 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.770
 Then I looked at his name and everything. 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.520
 wonderful law taking place one day 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.020
 Someday someday. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.079
 Now for me and two books at the same time. 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 time I did not miss two books and sometimes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.000
 three books at the same time sometimes I 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 I have a book for school here. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.809
 but I also want a level that I 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.739
 I want to see then I read both of them at the same time. 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.650
 time 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 eleven eleven is very very annoying to do 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.520
 blue is a book like neither make two 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.970
 names a little is he to take a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.080
 annoying book holidays and also if the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.430
 level is too large too slow too much 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 before you need an interpretation 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.590
 You better read it slowly. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.680
 I feel I have difficulty reading some 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 thing also a book to the same 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.509
 time for example the call of the cuckoo I 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.740
 'tÃ´' watching the cast take advantage of a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.740
 reading so much liking 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.259
 I got the second place went up with 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.570
 haptic letter know is because like all of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 Strawberry I believe I do not want to delay 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.579
 my readings 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.890
 so I intercall then I do at 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.479
 times with two books of the first 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.610
 two chapters of the first two 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.299
 the second two chapters of the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.719
 first and so goes the law one in the morning and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.719
 at night 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.330
 I make these rules in the fight but anyway 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.160
 there are also those people who speak here 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.480
 better read when you're reading the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.690
 books at the same time is better than 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.560
 genres or 23 for example of roriz 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.990
 romance 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.300
 well I do not think that way I do not 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.080
 I confuse the stories at least 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.590
 I think I'll never mistake history. 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.670
 but I caught two genres is done to power 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.550
 be able to have a variation of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.190
 January this type of reading then by 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.920
 example one called the cuckoo and gossip girl 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.950
 called the police commander but the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.060
 biotic a glamor and something like that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.500
 then for example the blue zone and zombie 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.820
 feast of corneas 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.790
 I've been people and sa 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.230
 sophie kinsella understood then there is this 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.620
 this difference and this helps me a lot 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.120
 because you still do not get the crazy lyrics 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.980
 among the fastest 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.720
 I do not get sick of a book either. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.330
 just there reading 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.670
 so I recommend yes of stickers to 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.500
 same time of different genres to 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.140
 can vary because for example if you 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.360
 pick up two detective novels like 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.200
 cops you go one time or another 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.940
 confuse 118 made there and I like 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.920
 quite normally when I'm in a 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.060
 book of tales also I'll take another 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.760
 going to him 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.290
 for example to help with abortion and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.769
 Which are the most points? 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.709
 so I gave a story a book the story 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.680
 the book and helps you not to get tired and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.330
 not always stay in that same reading 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.760
 so I I hope you 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.670
 liked I want to know is what you 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.230
 You do not even at the same time if you 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.940
 read one at a time 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.860
 so only down here how 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.780
 you do and why ? 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.840
 What do you think of this business of you? 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.959
 confuse the stories and get you 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.239
 of the genre is good, there is one already 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.849
 a video to subscribe to the channel as the 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.430
 social networks to be favorites and 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.430
 many many a kiss, bye
