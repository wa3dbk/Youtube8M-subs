and we're here with the knife so um why
are<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.859> weird<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:24.199> think<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.350> try<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
are you so weird I think we try to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.040 
are you so weird I think we try to
illustrate<00:00:26.160> our<00:00:26.910> music<00:00:28.099> as<00:00:29.179> well<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.480> possible

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
illustrate our music as well as possible

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.280 
illustrate our music as well as possible
and<00:00:31.969> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.559> while<00:00:34.559> doing<00:00:34.950> pop<00:00:35.340> music<00:00:35.790> in

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
and I think while doing pop music in

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.119 
and I think while doing pop music in
like<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.879> pop<00:00:38.879> cultural<00:00:40.879> context<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.090> it's

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
like a pop cultural context I think it's

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.389 
like a pop cultural context I think it's
important<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.219> me<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:45.170> kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> take<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> stand

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
important for me to kind of take a stand

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.600 
important for me to kind of take a stand
from<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.370> there's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
from it in the way all right there's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
from it in the way all right there's
this<00:00:50.789> band<00:00:51.090> called<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.960> Insane<00:00:52.320> Clown<00:00:52.350> Posse

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and their music isn't good but the fact

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.119 
and their music isn't good but the fact
that<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.670> dress<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.239> clowns<00:01:01.100> kind<00:01:02.100> of

that they dress up like clowns kind of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.830 
that they dress up like clowns kind of
kind<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> takes<00:01:02.579> away<00:01:02.699> from<00:01:02.879> their<00:01:03.210> music<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
kind of takes away from their music and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
kind of takes away from their music and
a<00:01:03.930> gig<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:06.570> good<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.200> marketing<00:01:07.680> how<00:01:08.159> would

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
a gig is good for marketing how would

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190 
a gig is good for marketing how would
you<00:01:08.369> say<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> people<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.630> define<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you say to people that would define the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.789 
you say to people that would define the
band<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.950> gimmicky<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.260> using<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
band as gimmicky as a you using the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.480 
band as gimmicky as a you using the
masks<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.540> just<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> atmosphere<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> take

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
masks and just the atmosphere to a take

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
masks and just the atmosphere to a take
away<00:01:17.520> from<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> music<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.509> opposed<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> add<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
away from the music as opposed to add to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
away from the music as opposed to add to
it<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.820> worse<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.540> see

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it I think it's worse if you have to see

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.980 
it I think it's worse if you have to see
people<00:01:25.409> less<00:01:25.650> how<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.939> look<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.420> private

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
people less how they look as private

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.230 
people less how they look as private
persons<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:28.860> listening<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.460> music<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.030> think

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
persons when listening to music I think

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.109 
persons when listening to music I think
good<00:01:30.810> music<00:01:31.320> makes<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:32.790> gives<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> lot<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
good music makes it gives you a lot of

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.160 
good music makes it gives you a lot of
own<00:01:36.119> pictures<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.200> head<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
own pictures in your head and I think it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
own pictures in your head and I think it
has<00:01:40.439> nothing<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.720> with<00:01:42.979> how<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.299> person

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
has nothing to do with how the person

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.859 
has nothing to do with how the person
behind<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.380> looks<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> trying<00:01:48.810> to
