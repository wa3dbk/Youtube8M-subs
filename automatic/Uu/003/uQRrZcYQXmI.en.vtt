00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.259
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.630
 Paul 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.440
 and today another monologue no replays 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.260
 order bayan gaets but precisely monologue you but 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.520
 I still can not get a processor 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.109
 why is tearing my farts just life 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 I can't promise anything with deadlines either 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.630
 since I really don't know anything either 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.519
 I can't rely honestly I 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.380
 didn't know at all whether to write something down or not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 so just asked a question to the group 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 VKontakte where I was asked to write 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.200
 what they love about effective action 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 on light tank battles without artillery 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.730
 earlier this topic was raised repeatedly 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.149
 but I answered somehow either in lichku or 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.309
 the forum already do not even remember to be honest 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.949
 so if up to patch 086 such fights 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.879
 it would be very little then the current realities 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.260
 This problem is very relevant today. 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.079
 very clean case of fighting with one 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 artillery or without it at all so i 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.229
 thought so why not write 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.299
 some thoughts on this 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.790
 let's call fights of this kind 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.890
 active fights as conditions 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.619
 force us out of the bushes or 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.939
 knead your bones well maybe not 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.100
 Only your own this is somehow a video 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.799
 active fight can be divided into two 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.750
 conditional categories 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.220
 the first category is open battles 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.720
 maps 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.520
 such a plan as a robin or 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 prokhorovka 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.829
 the second category is urban fights 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.220
 maps 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.770
 aplana as ruinberg or same 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.490
 himmelsdorf so let's get started 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.939
 analyze 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 The first type is how cards are generally 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.070
 open and often tanks fired 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.700
 without any opportunity to hide behind 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.890
 the obstacle is passive light 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.729
 or active light but very important to us 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.960
 closer to enemy positions 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.320
 by itself somehow save some 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 reasonable distance if such 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.989
 there is no possibility then do not lie such 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.550
 the possibility is always of course if you 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.080
 have not forgotten that we will consider a warrior 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.510
 open five at pro flank depression 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.110
 sides of the enemy or allies we are only 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.890
 change position neglecting running from 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.980
 bush acoustics 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.200
 but as you yourself understand the whole fight so 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.879
 can not continue sooner or later 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.099
 we will still need to take 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.590
 some important decision to retreat or 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.480
 and so and in the first case, I would 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.000
 advised to retreat on pretty 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.000
 long distance take a position somewhere 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.730
 there on the side of some possible 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.019
 enemy offensive is generally done 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.629
 this is so that at the moment of their movement 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.360
 opponents we gradually gradually 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.420
 turned out to be behind and somehow possible 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.489
 critical situation could you unexpectedly 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.900
 on the art market and divert attention to 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.629
 generally people themselves in such moments usually 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.540
 get lost and nervously smoking tower case 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.420
 active allied offensive and peacefully 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.409
 I love to shine first go to the rear 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.170
 the enemy so we do more damage ourselves 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.870
 caused by light will be more well 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.909
 and accordingly experience more opponents 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.849
 at this moment immediately distracted by us 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.890
 starts to turn the towers and during 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.200
 lighted already allied tanks they need 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.569
 there will be time to turn around and understand 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.849
 what to them 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.629
 yes, how often it is generally deadly 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.310
 tactic but rather effective yes and 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.790
 shoot you can raise the average damage and 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.310
 increasing your pipisku but you already have 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.260
 lucky and we survived then we go fast 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.659
 on the pipes flank and help deal with 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.470
 remnants of enemy equipment if we have time 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.720
 of course I will complain about this kind of fights on 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.629
 that's all so let's go to 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.159
 the second namely the urban battles 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.930
 maps 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:07.200
 would be a tactic should be similar 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.560
 but no she dreams almost in the bud 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.049
 excellent thing is that being close 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.139
 to the enemy and remain not illuminated 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:19.139
 we certainly won't succeed therefore we 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.919
 should come up with something else let's 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.380
 think about what you can do 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.229
 initial light but yes it is possible 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.750
 what's next the whole problem is 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.610
 that we are too fixated on the name 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.620
 light tank city map light tank 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.620
 intelligence yes what kind of intelligence all tanks 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.520
 no matter how in the palm everyone knows this 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.409
 where are we 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.300
 so 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.759
 in general it is worth throwing out the fun itself 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.739
 light tank concept on city map 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.379
 regardless of the presence of artillery in 

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:53.739
 teams we turn into small 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.259
 compact medium 

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:58.819
 for those who are too categorical not 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.050
 I agree with this opinion 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.449
 consider some light tanks 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.110
 for example t71 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.929
 at st rache he can do quite well for himself 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.129
 annoy the drums bar sneaking by myself 

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:12.830
 the drum even gives some advantages 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:16.009
 over our medium tanks in high 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.829
 opportunities to set fire to the enemy but if 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:22.879
 we will begin to focus it is also a principle 

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:25.849
 not bad as top damage tanks 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.149
 just avoided if you take the same chuffey 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.089
 and 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:32.269
 Chinese will cause a chisel stopper to 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:34.819
 any slt then they are basically nothing 

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:38.300
 serious and t71 and do not differ unless 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.769
 that the tree of course there is generally specific 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.800
 machine with 1 mushroom 

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:44.509
 that is to say roughly any any 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.039
 light tank turns into a small 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:51.499
 small group of those more honest 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.909
 let's do nothing but what's not worth it 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:55.879
 miss the opportunity to patrol with 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.009
 an adversary to cause his anal field 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.829
 distract him from the top tanks well I think 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.229
 it chevy of course if he is strong 

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:05.509
 get mad and wants to show you what 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.059
 he has a big fat then you yourself 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.449
 blame in general on urban fights 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:14.659
 cards could not make some 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.909
 separate tactics but as I think is just 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.739
 light tanks as technology just 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.599
 disappear they turn into hands 

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:24.079
 medium tank well and accordingly 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:26.209
 partially take their gameplay, well 

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:27.889
 seems to be sorted out with active battles 

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:29.449
 I hope you were interested and 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.459
 informative if you have appeared 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.380
 any questions or possible addition 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:36.730
 I will 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.980
 very happy and answer and read all 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.960
 thanks for watching if you liked 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.890
