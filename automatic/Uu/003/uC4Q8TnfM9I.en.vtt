marbles and I have circled mine so I

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.190 
marbles and I have circled mine so I

other<00:01:19.200> than<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.890> pretty<00:01:20.040> straight

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
other than that it's pretty straight

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
other than that it's pretty straight
forward<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.299> kind<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> guesstimate<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
forward you can kind of guesstimate the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.010 
forward you can kind of guesstimate the
size<00:01:22.920> depending<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.000> how<00:01:24.240> big<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.689> little

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
marbles are and then just cut them out

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
marbles are and then just cut them out
of<00:01:28.320> course<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> use<00:01:29.400> words<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.630> pictures

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

in<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.840> whatever<00:01:55.020> shape<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.799> tell

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
in it whatever shape as you can tell

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.249 
in it whatever shape as you can tell
some<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> these<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.939> circles<00:01:57.750> they're

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
some of these are not circles they're

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
some of these are not circles they're
just<00:01:58.469> weird<00:01:58.649> funky<00:01:59.100> shapes<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.240> that's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
just weird funky shapes but that's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.330 
just weird funky shapes but that's
because<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.560> way<00:02:01.680> they<00:02:01.860> look<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> other

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
because the way they look on the other

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
because the way they look on the other
side<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.939> kind<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.390> matters<00:02:03.659> more<00:02:03.899> than

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
side is kind of what matters more than

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.260 
side is kind of what matters more than
what<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.259> look<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> back<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.820 

I cut<00:02:07.509> them<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.840> whatever<00:02:08.019> suited<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.649> back

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
I cut them to whatever suited the back

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.190 
I cut them to whatever suited the back
and<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.459> course<00:02:09.489> I<00:02:09.879> used<00:02:10.090> my<00:02:10.360> lovely<00:02:10.869> Mod

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
and then of course I used my lovely Mod

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.420 
and then of course I used my lovely Mod
Podge<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:13.290> well<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.560> first<00:02:14.769> ones<00:02:15.099> I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
Podge and I well for the first ones I

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.940 
Podge and I well for the first ones I
decided<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:16.030> just<00:02:16.209> Mod<00:02:16.480> Podge<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.959> back<00:02:17.110> as

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
decided to just Mod Podge the back as

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.630 
decided to just Mod Podge the back as
you<00:02:18.160> can<00:02:18.310> see<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:19.560> then<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.590> thought<00:02:20.890> hey<00:02:21.220> why

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
you can see but then I thought hey why

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.229 
you can see but then I thought hey why
not<00:02:21.670> Mod<00:02:22.120> Podge<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.840> actual<00:02:23.379> fronts<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.819> you

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
not Mod Podge the actual fronts so you

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.809 
not Mod Podge the actual fronts so you
can<00:02:25.480> see<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.620> they<00:02:26.920> would<00:02:27.069> stick<00:02:27.310> better<00:02:27.519> for

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
can see so they would stick better for

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.580 
can see so they would stick better for
starters<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:29.019> can<00:02:29.140> still<00:02:29.349> see<00:02:29.470> it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
starters and you can still see it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.070 
starters and you can still see it
because<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.860> dries<00:02:30.040> clear<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.599> Mod<00:02:31.599> Podge<00:02:31.810> is

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
because it dries clear so Mod Podge is

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.330 
because it dries clear so Mod Podge is
just<00:02:32.349> an<00:02:32.470> amazing<00:02:32.830> product<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:34.000> use<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.340> so

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
just an amazing product to use and so

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.789 
just an amazing product to use and so
eventually<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:37.239> learned<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.530> what<00:02:38.769> I

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
eventually I learned that that's what I

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.870 
eventually I learned that that's what I
should<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.129> using<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:41.349> also<00:02:41.799> use<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.579> the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
should be using is to also use it on the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.729 
should be using is to also use it on the
front<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.569> as<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.989> can<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:44.290> they<00:02:44.440> stick

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
front so as you can see they stick

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.930 
front so as you can see they stick
they're<00:02:45.010> all<00:02:45.760> pretty<00:02:46.890> after<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.489> might<00:02:48.700> watch

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
they're all pretty after you might watch

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.610 
they're all pretty after you might watch
the<00:02:49.360> picture<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.019> gotta<00:02:50.200> let<00:02:50.349> it<00:02:50.440> dry

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
the picture to it you gotta let it dry

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.860 
the picture to it you gotta let it dry
for<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.829> little<00:02:50.950> bit<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:52.450> kind<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.660> hard<00:02:52.840> to

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
for a little bit it's kind of hard to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.089 
for a little bit it's kind of hard to
see<00:02:53.049> what<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> reflection<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.799> some<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.040> these

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
see what the reflection of some of these

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.289 
see what the reflection of some of these
but<00:02:56.040> after<00:02:57.040> dries<00:02:57.310> you're<00:02:57.640> gonna<00:02:57.760> take<00:02:58.060> your

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
but after dries you're gonna take your

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.509 
but after dries you're gonna take your
white<00:02:58.510> glue<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.470> can<00:02:59.530> use<00:02:59.650> Mod<00:03:00.040> Podge<00:03:00.250> again

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
white glue you can use Mod Podge again

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.430 
white glue you can use Mod Podge again
but<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.760> think<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:01.269> white<00:03:01.660> glues<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.079> little

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
but I think a white glues a little

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.309 
but I think a white glues a little
stronger<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.510> you're<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.690> gonna<00:03:04.840> dab<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.230> on

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
stronger and you're just gonna dab it on

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.160 
stronger and you're just gonna dab it on
the<00:03:05.410> back<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.540> then<00:03:07.540> you're<00:03:07.660> gonna<00:03:07.750> take<00:03:07.989> your

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
the back and then you're gonna take your

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.860 
the back and then you're gonna take your
magnets<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.980> stick<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:10.269> magnet<00:03:10.569> on<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.720> back

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
magnets and stick the magnet on the back

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.229 
magnets and stick the magnet on the back
and<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.110> course<00:03:11.350> just<00:03:11.650> let<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.010> dry<00:03:12.239> very

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
and of course just let it dry very

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.180 
and of course just let it dry very
