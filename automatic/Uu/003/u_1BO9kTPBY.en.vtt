00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
but all the fats are gone then it looks

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.130 
but all the fats are gone then it looks
to<00:00:49.570> other<00:00:50.070> sources<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.489> energy<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:52.809> will<00:00:52.930> break

to other sources of energy it will break

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.290 
to other sources of energy it will break
down<00:00:53.199> everything<00:00:53.739> or<00:00:54.100> break<00:00:54.250> down<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:55.030> you

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
down everything or break down the you

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.470 
down everything or break down the you
know<00:00:55.359> just<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.260> bone<00:00:56.590> tissue<00:00:57.030> everything<00:00:58.030> and

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
know just the bone tissue everything and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.479 
know just the bone tissue everything and
that's<00:00:58.629> why<00:00:58.780> we<00:00:59.170> get<00:00:59.379> so<00:00:59.710> emaciated<00:01:00.309> and

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
that's why we get so emaciated and

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.200 
that's why we get so emaciated and
everything<00:01:00.850> but<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:02.289> body<00:01:02.530> knows<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:04.000> you

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
everything but the body knows and you

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.870 
everything but the body knows and you
talk<00:01:04.420> about<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:05.320> survival<00:01:05.890> instinct<00:01:06.340> the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
talk about the survival instinct the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.710 
talk about the survival instinct the
body<00:01:07.120> knows<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:07.810> needs<00:01:08.160> muscle<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.510> old

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
body knows that it needs muscle the old

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.230 
body knows that it needs muscle the old

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
survival it needs muscle to either fight

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.500 
survival it needs muscle to either fight
or<00:01:16.000> flee<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:18.070> doesn't<00:01:18.610> want<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.210> break<00:01:19.480> down

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
or flee so it doesn't want to break down

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.780 
or flee so it doesn't want to break down
that<00:01:20.070> muscle<00:01:21.070> tissue<00:01:21.340> on<00:01:21.700> us<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.870> not

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that muscle tissue on us it's not

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.580 
that muscle tissue on us it's not
programmed<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:25.180> break<00:01:25.810> down<00:01:26.050> muscle<00:01:26.380> tissue

programmed to break down muscle tissue

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.760 
programmed to break down muscle tissue
that's<00:01:27.190> didn't<00:01:27.730> that's<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:28.450> know

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that's didn't that's you know

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.720 
that's didn't that's you know
cannibalizing<00:01:29.770> itself<00:01:30.070> that's<00:01:30.280> destroying

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
cannibalizing itself that's destroying

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.150 
cannibalizing itself that's destroying
itself<00:01:31.090> doesn't<00:01:31.570> want<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.930> do<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:32.920> when

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
itself doesn't want to do that so when

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.880 
itself doesn't want to do that so when
we<00:01:33.310> put<00:01:33.580> down<00:01:33.760> muscle<00:01:34.360> tissue<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.470> body<00:01:35.680> is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
we put down muscle tissue the body is

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.940 
we put down muscle tissue the body is
not<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.790> doesn't<00:01:37.120> want<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.330> do<00:01:37.480> that<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.740> what

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
not it doesn't want to do that so what

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.180 
not it doesn't want to do that so what
it<00:01:39.070> has<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.790> do<00:01:39.970> is<00:01:40.210> pull<00:01:40.600> out<00:01:40.710> its<00:01:41.710> dumping

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
it has to do is pull out its dumping

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.630 
it has to do is pull out its dumping
tons<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:43.230> hydrochloric<00:01:44.230> acid<00:01:44.740> tons<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.430> acid

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
tons of hydrochloric acid tons of acid

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.270 
tons of hydrochloric acid tons of acid
because<00:01:46.120> that's<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.450> only<00:01:46.540> thing<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:47.350> that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
because that's the only thing and that

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.090 
because that's the only thing and that
will<00:01:48.430> enable<00:01:48.820> us<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.590> digest<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:52.980> being<00:01:53.980> an

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
will enable us to digest it and being an

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.490 
will enable us to digest it and being an
alkaline<00:01:54.610> system<00:01:55.210> when<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:55.390> acid<00:01:55.990> comes<00:01:56.260> in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
alkaline system when that acid comes in

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.320 
alkaline system when that acid comes in
there<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:57.660> not<00:01:58.660> only<00:01:59.430> digests<00:02:00.430> tears<00:02:00.820> down<00:02:01.120> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
there it not only digests tears down the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.540 
there it not only digests tears down the
muscle<00:02:01.510> tissue<00:02:01.870> but<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:03.340> burns<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.720> stomach

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
muscle tissue but it burns the stomach

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.510 
muscle tissue but it burns the stomach
because<00:02:06.550> it's<00:02:06.730> in<00:02:06.940> an<00:02:07.090> alkaline<00:02:07.450> it's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
because it's in an alkaline it's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.620 
because it's in an alkaline it's
at<00:02:09.200> atmospheric<00:02:10.200> environment<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.760> burns<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
at atmospheric environment it burns the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.140 
at atmospheric environment it burns the
stomach<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.890> that's<00:02:14.790> why<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.690> call<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
stomach and that's why we we call it a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.660 
stomach and that's why we we call it a
heartburn<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:19.230> feels<00:02:19.560> fun<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.310> here's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
heartburn because it feels fun in here's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.150 
heartburn because it feels fun in here's

only the esophagus and everything it's a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.300 
only the esophagus and everything it's a
burning<00:02:23.460> sensation<00:02:24.320> because<00:02:25.320> it's<00:02:25.530> acid<00:02:25.980> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
burning sensation because it's acid you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.510 
burning sensation because it's acid you
know<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:28.280> will<00:02:29.280> take<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> pill<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.980> acid

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
know and we will take a pill for acid

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.020 
know and we will take a pill for acid
indigestion<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.560> whole<00:02:35.190> phrase<00:02:35.550> tells

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
indigestion and the whole phrase tells

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.070 
indigestion and the whole phrase tells
you<00:02:36.240> what's<00:02:36.600> what<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> problem<00:02:37.740> is

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you what's what the problem is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.150 
you what's what the problem is
indigestion<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:41.670> begin<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:43.640> excessive<00:02:44.640> acid

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160
