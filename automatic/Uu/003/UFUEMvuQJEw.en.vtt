00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 Talking galley on channel on skateboard 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.970
 Who's talking guilherme ab4? 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.839
 fundamental in the air to say something that 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.189
 I'm the first with enough 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.320
 frequency in video comments 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.320
 not explaining to me how europe 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.690
 good people before you start trading 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 the independent rooms at the time 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.699
 It was good that you know how to get down to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.080
 ramp straight 45 then I will 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.960
 indicate to you started winning 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.859
 first straight to 45 and then docking 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.119
 I have cloth 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 the first has to have a notion of how 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.430
 go down the ramp to beat the principal 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 coming from above the platform and passing 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 ramp and then you can start and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.770
 if I fit then I will be the same 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.770
 When you go to the room, will you? 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.440
 I fit it here, put your foot in the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.989
 position just behind the screws goes with 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.699
 shoulder does not let the contrast is the part 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.870
 that galera enough and leave the body 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.550
 back in europe 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.649
 So you go with your shoulder and then 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.899
 You're going to lower your front foot. 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.449
 goes with the shoulder down foot that is the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.309
 sense as drug before changing the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.140
 europe room all 45 arrive in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.200
 track including the largest 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.119
 this will give you greater security to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.830
 the time you change the room because the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.540
 room he has a very fast move to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729
 45 she's always soft the same 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.890
 difference in the room and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.920
 when he makes the transition from the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.650
 straight and gives you a move and this on 45 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.630
 You're taking the balance of the body. 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.060
 so you can keep it when it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 move from project 45 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 so what do you do the same thing in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.110
 Cachoeiro goes with the first one 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.329
 motogp goes something that can facilitate 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.630
 When you have time to learn 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.009
 you give a fake consult your can 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.110
 be in the middle of the ramp until you get there 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.939
 on top and this will get you back 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.619
 because your body is already inside the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.350
 ramp and this will make it easier because 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.479
 will not get to rise there in the body then 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.799
 What are you going to do , fuck you? 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.799
 to the ramp and go for a walk 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.020
 So you're taking courage to 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.890
 down the ramp and you can go until you reach 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.890
 there near the point 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.560
 is what the guys miss the most in the hour of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.240
 to drop is to leave the body behind I speak 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.490
 this is because it is the main mistake of 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.530
 who is learning rump at the time that 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.700
 you're the pass you leave your body 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.900
 behind 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.120
 the body will stay there on top of the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.620
 platform that we go forward in 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.270
 that the customers still stayed for 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.370
 He said that we're going on the ramp and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.020
 you're going to fall into that sense here it is 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.150
 more dangerous that can cause 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.100
 You fall for the cope then more 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.240
 important in this country , you have to 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.010
 go with the body 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.420
 The worst fall is the one you fall for. 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.890
 back to front 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.489
 there in the worst case 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.650
 put your hand then go colombo and drugs 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.709
 So, guys, 40 and then you 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.000
 took the morning to get off in the 45th room 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.340
 It's more important that you keep your 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.050
 weight does not leave the body to 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.450
 back and found that everybody else misses 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.520
 when you troop without the confidence of 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.440
 Body forward you get the 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.540
 body behind the skateboard go body drops to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.790
 and it is dangerous to end up falling 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.260
 back to the body or even to hit the head 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.090
 more dangerous yet 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.549
 So when you're learning, it's not 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.470
 ugly and do not feel ashamed if you go 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.060
 hold someone's hand to hold the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.560
 Dad, I learned that way in Europe. 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.049
 fourth holds in his hands is that when you 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.239
 have never used after that is the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.780
 same thing I 'm going to pay 45 position in 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.709
 foot goes with shoulder already its position does not 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.750
 sprout straight 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.630
 goes that we are in position 10 pigeon and 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.760
 after this 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.620
 This is what I see as worrying soon. 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.540
 We're starting transitions from 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.209
 frame maneuvers toshiba will start roque 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.610
 enrow is testing you where several 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.720
 Transition maneuvers to is already in the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.790
 process also because it does not 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.290
 teach very difficult solo maneuver 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.709
 also that will intersperse with all this 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.360
 so 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.220
 ronaldo skateboard you got any 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.200
 doubt about skateboarding with our nets 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.210
 social coupon talked to the next round 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.140
