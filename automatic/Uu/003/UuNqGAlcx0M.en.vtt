I got a big box from middle and one of
those<00:00:28.590> fruit<00:00:28.949> boxes<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.699> has<00:00:29.910> these<00:00:30.179> holes

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
those fruit boxes that has these holes

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.069 
those fruit boxes that has these holes
in<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.210> don't<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> holes<00:00:33.870> in

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
in so see if you don't have the holes in

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.049 
in so see if you don't have the holes in
make<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.860> straight<00:00:35.219> away<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> beginning

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
make them straight away at the beginning

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.959 
make them straight away at the beginning
and<00:00:36.440> you'll<00:00:37.440> need<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> turn<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> top<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.879> at

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and you'll need to turn the top to at

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
and you'll need to turn the top to at
the<00:00:39.030> bottom<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> left<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.559> sides

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the bottom on the left and right sides

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.630 
the bottom on the left and right sides
so<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.030> put<00:00:42.210> straight<00:00:42.510> through

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
so that you can put straight through

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.979 
so that you can put straight through
okay<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.700> next<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.750> painted<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> shell<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
okay so next I painted the shell I

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.340 
okay so next I painted the shell I
generally<00:00:48.989> buy<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.250> paint<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:51.030> works<00:00:51.780> which

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
generally buy the paint from works which

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.369 
generally buy the paint from works which
is<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.739> kids<00:00:52.980> pain<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
is just kids pain you get like a

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
is just kids pain you get like a
reasonable<00:00:55.379> size<00:00:55.590> bottles<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> couple<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
reasonable size bottles like a couple of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.170 
reasonable size bottles like a couple of
quid<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.800> much<00:00:59.070> cheaper<00:00:59.399> than<00:01:00.000> buying

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
quid and it's much cheaper than buying

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.020 
quid and it's much cheaper than buying
from<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.600> paint<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.879> something<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
from a paint and something to do a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.490 
from a paint and something to do a
couple<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> layers<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.930> will<00:01:04.019> come<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.170> quite

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
couple of layers it will come out quite

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
couple of layers it will come out quite
a<00:01:04.530> dark<00:01:04.830> green<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.510> leave<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
a dark green and then just leave it to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
a dark green and then just leave it to
dry<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.740> does<00:01:07.890> take<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.159> couple<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> layers

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
dry if it does take a couple of layers

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.060 
dry if it does take a couple of layers
once<00:01:09.119> again<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.750> writing<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
once again if you have writing on it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.359 
once again if you have writing on it
you<00:01:11.610> mean<00:01:11.909> quite<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> few<00:01:12.540> layers<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.369> then

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you mean quite a few layers and then

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
you mean quite a few layers and then
make<00:01:14.880> sure<00:01:14.909> you've<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.299> plenty<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.659> time<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
make sure you've got plenty of time and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.219 
make sure you've got plenty of time and
then<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.890> leave<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.189> dry<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.670> while

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
then just leave it to dry for a while

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.630 
then just leave it to dry for a while
okay<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.290> next<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> want<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
okay so next you're going to want to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
okay so next you're going to want to
draw<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> patch<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.570> shell<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.979> can

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
draw a patch on your shell and you can

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.630 
draw a patch on your shell and you can
choose<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.820> pattern<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
choose what pattern you do and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
choose what pattern you do and
personally<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.939> did<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
personally I did this one because I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.310 
personally I did this one because I
think<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.590> looks<00:01:28.770> quite<00:01:28.950> shellack<00:01:29.729> listen<00:01:30.720> but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
think it looks quite shellack listen but

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.580 
think it looks quite shellack listen but
you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.710> boxes<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.579> whatever

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
you can do all boxes on it or whatever

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
you can do all boxes on it or whatever
it's<00:01:34.590> quite<00:01:34.860> easy<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.729> start<00:01:36.119> off

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
it's quite easy to do you just start off

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.469 
it's quite easy to do you just start off
with<00:01:36.360> an<00:01:36.600> oval<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.220> draw<00:01:38.490> an<00:01:39.299> oval

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
with an oval and then you draw an oval

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.840 
with an oval and then you draw an oval
inside<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> connecting<00:01:41.579> lines

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
inside and then do the connecting lines

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.780 
inside and then do the connecting lines
out<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.470> much<00:01:43.680> easier<00:01:44.070> if<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.220> find<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
out there it's much easier if you find a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
out there it's much easier if you find a
picture<00:01:44.970> online<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.780> follow<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.439> an<00:01:46.590> actual

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
picture online to follow of an actual

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.450 
picture online to follow of an actual
turtle<00:01:47.790> shell<00:01:48.170> or<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.680> pause<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.220> video

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
turtle shell or you can pause this video

and<00:01:51.030> Serapis<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.409> copy<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.810> last<00:01:55.049> step

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and Serapis and copy that the last step

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.460 
and Serapis and copy that the last step
is<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.700> add<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.030> string

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
is to add your string

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.270 
is to add your string
