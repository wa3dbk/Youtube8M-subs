00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.719
 hello friends glad to see you again 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.179
 on my channel you probably more than once 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.020
 watched awesome videos shot 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.340
 gopro camera and completely understandable 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.949
 why do people buy this camera 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.800
 however, taking the first hand camera 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 man gets lost and wonders a 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.230
 How to shoot this camera in goupro no 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.910
 unusual display and even simple 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.390
 viewfinder 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.969
 one of the emerging questions is the question of how 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.340
 find out what gets in the frame and the other not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.680
 less important question how not to fill up 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.350
 horizon when shooting that is 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.510
 Orient the camera parallel to the line. 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 horizon not controlling 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.290
 this is visually foreseeing such a situation 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.850
 camera manufacturers and released monitor 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.610
 for camera goupro 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.140
 which can be purchased separately but 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 is it worth doing since i own 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.790
 gopro 3 black camera 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.119
 I will only talk about this model 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.540
 consider the first question how to find out what 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.700
 will fall when shooting in the frame in the camera there 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.340
 great opportunity thanks 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.100
 Wi-Fi functions to manage all 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.640
 camera settings using a smartphone 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.130
 or tablet for this just need 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.750
 install on the gadget free 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.630
 software 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.390
 by downloading it from the official site goupro 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.740
 or using the play application 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.700
 market in our smartphone by installing it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.009
 attachment 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 we will get access to all settings 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:03.890
 cameras and we can use 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.200
 smartphone or tablet as a monitor 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.130
 open the tab responsible for the viewing angle 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.680
 cameras 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.250
 see what space in different 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.850
 modes 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.660
 enters the frame while you can see 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.390
 that the wider we choose the angle of capture 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.660
 the more objects fall into the frame and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 the smaller they become and vice versa than 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.320
 angle is smaller the closer and larger objects 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.800
 in the frame in other words 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.320
 reducing or increasing the viewing angle we 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.020
 can zoom in or out objects in 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.330
 frame turns peculiar step by step 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.770
 zoom 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.060
 sometimes it can be very 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.310
 useful having conducted such an experiment we 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.500
 note that in the widest mode 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.400
 angle to frame 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.830
 more than enough space after 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.860
 a few trial shootings the picture will become 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.970
 even more understandable and hardly an absence 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.800
 the monitor will be a problem for us 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.130
 now let's talk how not to fill up 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.430
 when shooting the horizon in fact I 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.220
 I think this is not so important because 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.400
 action camera that involves shooting 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.100
 movement adventure some kind of continuously 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.740
 changing with being however i agree 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.810
 that sometimes the beveled horizon line in 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.210
 frame may be annoying 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.330
 especially if someone focuses on this 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.700
 attention in many cases is small 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.540
 the problem is solved and the subsequent 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.990
 processing video for example I took filmed 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.270
 1 video horizon littered and try 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.860
 fix it in the popular sony editor 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:54.080
 vegas here is a fragment of a video that i 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:59.370
 going to fix you see here 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.850
 the skyline is littered and now i'm 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.410
 I will try to align it with 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.810
 ivan punks tool 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:14.400
 clicking on this icon has a window 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:23.540
 tool and here hooking here for this 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:23.540
 corner i start to turn the frame 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:34.520
 our horizon 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:41.480
 I corrected now grabbing the corner I 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:47.480
 starting to pull it in with this video 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:54.830
 slightly increased and the last me 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:58.780
 I take the whole frame and align and like this 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.780
 so he filled the whole space 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:12.080
 fragment corrected let's see what 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:15.039
 It turned out now I will select it 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.039
 play 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.150
 Well, everything seems to be in order 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:44.650
 here so pay attention to this 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:50.460
 lock so that this button was not 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:56.650
 pressed if we press this button then 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:58.810
 video in the punk rock tool and our 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.790
 timeline video will be 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:08.340
 sync and any change 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.340
 which we will do will create a key 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.170
 let's say 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:23.340
 appears keys still increase appears 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:32.090
 another key is valid 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:36.840
 increase the key again what happens 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:39.510
 if the lock is pressed and melted 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:44.420
 keys as the video changes we will 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.420
 see right in real time 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.620
 which is pretty interesting too 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.180
 Well, with the help of such uncomplicated 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:10.560
 manipulations can be corrected littered 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:14.780
 horizon in your successful video shoot 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.780
 bye see you all
