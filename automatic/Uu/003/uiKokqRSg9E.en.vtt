 packaging in hand in the packaging 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.850
 we will therefore be provided with this headset in 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.830
 case that will communicate with the latter 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 as well as a small notice and a microphone 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.059
 detachable already connected to this case is fixed 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 digital this headset being intended for 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.379
 fully of his functions I you 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 really invite to install the software 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.860
 available free from the site 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.079
 of the constructor is super easy to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.850
 handle this headset so has a listening 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.500
 5 points which means five high 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.020
 speakers and a base by headset 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.280
 the sound is fully customizable 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.110
 however, I did not notice a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
 special sound stands out 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.890
 other 5.1 headset really the same 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.810
 time is done for video games not 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.220
 to listen to mozart as a whole 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.119
 reassured you listen to it anyway 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.950
 Very kind 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.080
 we have a clear sound according to our settings 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.850
 and it is well harmonize we get 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.410
 almost a little sensation of a 3d sound 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 following the movies we will watch 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.940
 the housing managing everything will allow us 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.710
 to disable or not our microphone 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.869
 detachable that there is a quality 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.220
 rather amazing for god roccat and yes 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 I say that because the previous models 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.450
 whose xt of the stereo I had tested 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.020
 and less successful on the side of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.030
 microphone 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 I leave you listening to my sweet voice 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.479
 with the microphone that embarks this helmet I 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.549
 so is talking with the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.860
 microphone that embarks this ring headset 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 calixte and the five digital points the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.159
 quality is very correct i will you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.330
 give my opinion in a few moments 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.920
 but for my first 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.479
 very satisfied impressions of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.560
 the improvement that roccat to bring to the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.240
 microphone level 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.530
 even if I have to admit it's not the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.780
 best of all I have already 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.040
 tested on the chain he defends himself all 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.390
 very good 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.100
 as you could see the quality 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.869
 will be perfect for commenting 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.909
 or discussed during a livestream or in 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.439
 a video we can apprehended in blue 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.880
 all our smartphone with the case 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.500
 to answer calls in full 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.730
 game from a little button and that I 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.560
 have to say it's pretty cool 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.000
 a button will also allow us to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.100
 choose the way you want to do 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 get the sound another to adjust the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.660
 costs in movie mode in order to feel at 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.460
 are more bitter 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.140
 cif and a speaker button all 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.920
 simply to send the sound on 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.240
 external speakers 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.310
 if we connected them through 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.900
 embedded connector and yes a plug 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.550
 jack a microphone jack as well 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.260
 that another auxiliary socket will be 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.460
 available at the back of the case this 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.290
 which is pretty cool to handle 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.480
 all our inputs and outputs 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.520
 from one and the same case the helmet 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.440
 will be connected to the housing by a cable 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.300
 no gain what I find super 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.470
 damage by cons it's really there 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.420
 for once a week 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.280
 of use the only small criticism that 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.780
 I could find why did not they 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.210
 put a nice braided cable on this 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.710
 version 5.1 small improvements so to 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.300
 plan for the next models 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.770
 you can imagine that all 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.620
 specifications quoted from the beginning have 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.390
 a price therefore about 145 euros 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.100
 to offer it on amazon 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.630
 a rather expensive price but compared to 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.100
 other helmets in the same budget I 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.600
 have to say that this case avoid five 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 digital points is doing very well 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.200
 I was very satisfied overall 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.550
 about this helmet at first sight the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.110
 fontas and low-end materials 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.060
 actually it is mainly 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.140
 composed of plastic but the comfort and 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.730
 the same after several hours 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.120
 of use so no worries 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.310
 thereupon 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.050
 I hope my opinion the presentation 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.340
 as well as this product will have pleased you if 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.780
 you never have it do not hesitate to
