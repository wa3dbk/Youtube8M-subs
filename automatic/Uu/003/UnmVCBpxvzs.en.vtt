00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.590
 hi everyone i hope it's okay 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.019
 well so today I present to you 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.410
 my routine conquest for the return 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.060
 school 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.220
 so tonight and here I'm going to decide 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.330
 to go to the restaurant and I'm going 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.310
 recommend tortellini once 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.230
 arrived home I prepared my school 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.089
 I do not advise to bring a lot of 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.529
 things in the first day because 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.749
 you are going to understand yourself for nothing 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.800
 I only took my pencil case 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:37.989
 my padlock and my calendar is my 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.940
 schedule and a little money if you 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.719
 would you like to buy a meal at the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.219
 cafeteria 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.980
 thereafter I advise you to come 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.899
 choose your set the day before as 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.320
 it's going to be a lot more in the morning 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.809
 quick 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.609
 also if you wear makeup you can 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.399
 go get inspiration on 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.589
 penneteau remains and with the same principle 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.010
 that I looked for simple hairstyles 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.269
 for the return to school except at all 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.570
 Then I came to the kitchen 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.360
 fill a men's kettle 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.450
 that is to say 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.409
 a good day 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.409
 Ayew 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.180
 I warmed up my name and that night 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.870
 I decided to make an herbal tea 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.430
 chamomile 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.660
 here I advise you to take a 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.730
 herbal tea because it's a lot more 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.210
 relaxing worship and that contains some 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.280
 caffeine 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.090
 so here I am pouring no into a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.070
 cup is there 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:37.119
 and I add the sachet of chamomile 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.439
 during that time I took the opportunity to 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.500
 go on social networks 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.250
 so you can follow me on this match 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.369
 added a friend on facebook and me 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.360
 follow on instagram 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.100
 then I went back to the shower 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.240
 I use this young star shampoo 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.280
 is super d will be vitalising the power 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.939
 male I know ask environt 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:11.519
 five minutes while my mask and 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:15.660
 pause I cleaned the body and shave 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.660
 also was sublime brushing teeth 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.049
 I apply a moisturizer a 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.049
 anti imperfections cream on my boujard 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.540
 I did not mix the hair the most 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.410
 gently possible from the tip to 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.940
 roots and I apply an oil for them 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.940
 rows of soyal and sweet for them 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:50.070
 I will also miss my body with 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.070
 a dubai world moisturizer 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.689
 then I sit in my bed 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:08.499
 I light a candle to make the 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:09.310
 all more cute and I take my 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:13.590
 reading the moment 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.590
 so me it's the hidden side of Margaux 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.350
 because I'm getting tired I've been 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.350

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.620
 15 then to wake up 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.120
 I made a little top a little trick 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.319
 on my cell but not too much 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.420
 a long time because I know I'm going 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:43.690
 to be ready is a game without 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.640
 hard of my bed and I'm going to 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:04:02.410
 clean the face with my cleanser and 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:04:04.480
 it's a movie I get dressed and for the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.670
 makeup i keep this simple so game 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.980
 but only a little cachet gives a 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.410
 little compact powder and a bit math 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.380
 in the raw of the eye to give an air 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.209
 awake and a touch of mascara 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.829
 I was already in a hurry so I 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.590
 decided to keep this simple for the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.780
 hairstyle I just have scrums and 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.550

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.050

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.470

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.039
