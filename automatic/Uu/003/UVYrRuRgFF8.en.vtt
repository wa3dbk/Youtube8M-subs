00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hi, I'm excited again 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.380
 as you already could read and title 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.349
 it will be up to the requested one today 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.299
 instagram dm hall requested 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.699
 I'm probably on favorites 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.619
 because we just noticed that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 my favorite mascara I before 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.990
 week about question task is me 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 I am as talented as I said 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.300
 I'm a little bit upset because of me 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.320
 somehow I believe one first 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 dm hall and that was before 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 one comma something year and there have 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 I bought another way so others 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.510
 products that I might not be 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.550
 would use more and I would say 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.660
 I start because we shit 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.660
 is the same over the whole period 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.610
 does not show points or shows that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.550
 First thing I bought is totally 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.500
 boring that's a normal one 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.320
 rutz brush with wood as they are called because 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.180
 New boston bristles wood bristles 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 I just wanted one for the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.720
 have handbag and brush wood are 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.630
 extremely super because the wooden posts 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.119
 just the natural feather of the hair 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.909
 save and thus lengthen 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 and that make plastic bristles and 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.810
 Synthetic fiber bristles and co make that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.299
 Do not hold everything he should this one 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.430
 because I'm just back on it right now 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.680
 waived 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.040
 every one to two days the hair too 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.950
 to wash 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.799
 I was not even the hair like that anymore 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 is that no , of course I wanted to say 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.090
 that I do not have hair every day anymore 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.890
 wash every other or two 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.720
 third day depending on the type of hair 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.610
 Look and if I turned it into suit too 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.479
 carry 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.509
 simply because it's healthier for the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.220
 scalp is and i can protect that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.380
 Take me directly to the next point 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 I'm currently in which measure 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.119
 that means yes I just do it again 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.219
 a separate video over it leaves 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.110
 your hair up to within a week 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.180
 grow two centimeters and that is 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.860
 twice as much as a month 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.179
 and yet from a week I have to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.259
 Try it now and I'm pretty 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.640
 excited 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.890
 next, I'll just have a look 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.000
 Get away from here again my god like 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.800
 Guardian Angel 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.860
 If I have my hair again 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 Once upon a time I just wanted to fill 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.420
 stand on the shelf again that I then 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 not when it's empty so shit 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.959
 well then i see today shit out no 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 then I have that in the shelf hey 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.330
 somehow I do not come from the hard ones 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.570
 away and then I thought to myself what 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.489
 somehow need a flush again 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.380
 because from time to time be my hair yet 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.360
 full of hot air dry 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.489
 and there jump helps me always great 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.680
 and since I am irritated by and 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.989
 Sensitive scalp have talked of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.570
 all just become the sensitive rinse 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.100
 brought with sage and birch and up 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.190
 I have not tested them yet 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.780
 court relatively normal and of course that 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.940
 good at alverde is of course that no 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.209
 silicones are included that it mostly 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.270
 all natural oils are and that 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.610
 I use like I said like that 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.430
 and flushing almost only in the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.340
 winter and actually in the summer 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.260
 if I'm in the outdoor pool because chlorine and 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.510
 Hair is good then I use rinse then 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.190
 probably the whole year the next two 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.660
 Products are from a series to the me 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.200
 I would have grabbed you from 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.269
 seen at the beginning that actually 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.890
 is familiar but good why we have in 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.320
 winter usually all a bit 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.440
 dry skin and that's what it's made for 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.170
 Really well helped so far and me 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.870
 I thought in the winter I use 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.280
 mostly either or very fatty 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.910
 eight krems the beauty effect 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.420
 night cream on pull-up effects higher and 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.930
 though the age of 35 45 I'm not that old 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.640
 but that is really really good 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.760
 I looked at the ingredients 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.500
 Of course there are many chemicals in it 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.690
 but are chemicals with those of me 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.480
 can live personally if again at 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.940
 term chemicals it's really okay 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.330
 and my skin is after the shower 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.330
 not so much tension anymore 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.160
 at least my skin is not stretched anymore 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.270
 since I used this cream it stops 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.730
 rich and in winter why not 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.980
 What's on it I'm hot 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.930
 you anyway no matter what it said 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.970
 stands for me for four years that is and 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.070
 for ops is for mature skin or not 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.720
 Look at the ingredients 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.220
 your skin tolerates men tolerates 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.020
 That's pretty good, too 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.460
 is rich and maybe easy 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.020
 it's going to be popular or not nice 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.580
 youthful look now 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.350
 yes fine and then of course I could 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.810
 not different and have me here 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.870
 seadream would be taken away once 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.310
 very very rich so really 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.380
 really good i feel like that 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.090

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.360

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.020
 I have the feeling I'm too bright for 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.310
 this one i will test again or 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.440

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.270

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.789

 people waterproof that keeps the momentum 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.050
 I can not find you anymore 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.700
 Now just show the other mascara 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.400

 currently have this is the miss manga 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.120
 mascara I am a very blatant 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.840
 stragglers you may already have 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.010
 noted by l'orÃ©al paris with manga s 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.930

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.860
 the cool thing about the part here is now 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.700
 that the so with but moved to the 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.580
 cut reese was just great 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.730
 the brush is pretty standard and me 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.900
 had taken that easy now and 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.490
 waterproof just because I took 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.750
 wanted to have a waterproof mascara 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.760
 because adults are in it 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.650
 keep your momentum going only one last time 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.990
 my eyelashes always so extremely canceled 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.700
 if I'm somehow maskawa on it 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.970
 did or eyelashes somehow 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.440
 I thought so blatant he had bent 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.970
 I think I need it again 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.730
 water resistant and then I had the 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.950
 patrice's last one is taken and he 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.840
 was just so nice and he is also 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:32.460
 so hard from the eyes and that is 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:34.590
 so wonderful what fixed however only have 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.970

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.310
 Today I have the eyelashes with the 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.450

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.210
 Manhattan extreme love less in what 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.470
 is that cool for everyone on a color 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.970
 case it is such a blue and 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.620
 dark blue so metallic 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:55.620
 dark blue and I was thinking 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.190
 I always like one here 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.720
 blue eyeliner times because the one 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.130
 good contrast to my green eyes 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.830
 forms and I already have that 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.830
 tried and it is great if 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.010
