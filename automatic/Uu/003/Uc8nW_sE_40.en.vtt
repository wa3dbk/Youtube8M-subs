square about one and a quarter inches
smaller<00:01:07.350> than<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> first<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.340> decided<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
smaller than the first one I decided to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.090 
smaller than the first one I decided to
angle<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> corners<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.409> aesthetics<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
angle the corners for aesthetics and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
angle the corners for aesthetics and
support<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> markings<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
support and now all the markings and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
support and now all the markings and
measurements<00:01:13.439> look<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.180> alright<00:01:15.180> it's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
measurements look like this alright it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
measurements look like this alright it's
time<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> cut<00:01:15.840> ourselves<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> hole<00:01:16.560> let's<00:01:17.400> start

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
time to cut ourselves a hole let's start

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
time to cut ourselves a hole let's start
by<00:01:17.729> using<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.060> large<00:01:18.299> drill<00:01:18.689> bit<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> make<00:01:19.259> holes

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
by using a large drill bit to make holes

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
by using a large drill bit to make holes
on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> inner<00:01:20.009> sides<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> angled<00:01:20.820> lines

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on the inner sides of the angled lines

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.600 
on the inner sides of the angled lines
this<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> insert<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.890> jigsaw<00:01:23.310> blade

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this way we can insert the jigsaw blade

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
this way we can insert the jigsaw blade
and<00:01:23.790> begin<00:01:24.180> cutting<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.720> away

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and begin cutting right away

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
and begin cutting right away
the<00:01:25.860> goal<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.549> cut<00:01:26.729> each<00:01:26.880> line<00:01:27.150> as

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the goal here is to cut each line as

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.999 
the goal here is to cut each line as
straight<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.750> possible<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.470> when<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.799> make<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
straight as possible and when we make it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.200 
straight as possible and when we make it
back<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> starting<00:01:29.850> point

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
back to the starting point

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.789 
back to the starting point
the<00:01:30.479> center<00:01:30.780> piece<00:01:30.960> should<00:01:31.200> fall<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.619> out

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the center piece should fall right out

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.249 
the center piece should fall right out
now<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.610> still<00:01:32.909> need<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.210> plastic<00:01:33.720> plate<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
now we still need this plastic plate to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
now we still need this plastic plate to
sink<00:01:34.500> down<00:01:34.619> flush<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> top<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.670> the

screws<00:02:37.170> holding<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.530> base<00:02:37.740> plate<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
screws holding the base plate on and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.980 
screws holding the base plate on and
when<00:02:38.760> those<00:02:38.880> are<00:02:39.090> removed<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.570> comes<00:02:39.780> off<00:02:39.959> very

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
when those are removed it comes off very

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.770 
when those are removed it comes off very
easily<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.550> Center<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.000> our<00:02:42.150> square<00:02:42.510> we

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
easily if we Center it on our square we

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.390 
easily if we Center it on our square we
can<00:02:42.900> use<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.350> template<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.010> mark<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
can use it as a template to mark the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
can use it as a template to mark the

them<00:02:46.350> out<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> 7/32<00:02:47.400> inch<00:02:47.520> drill<00:02:47.970> bit<00:02:48.050> now

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
them out with a 7/32 inch drill bit now

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.600 
them out with a 7/32 inch drill bit now
I<00:02:49.080> tried<00:02:49.410> taking<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.800> little<00:02:49.950> off<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.130> top<00:02:50.250> with

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
I tried taking a little off the top with

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
I tried taking a little off the top with
a<00:02:50.670> 3/8<00:02:51.150> inch<00:02:51.360> drill<00:02:51.690> bit<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.959> ended<00:02:52.500> up<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:52.800> a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
a 3/8 inch drill bit and ended up with a

clean professional look to it I also

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.610 
clean professional look to it I also
rigged<00:04:09.090> up<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.330> switch<00:04:09.570> box<00:04:09.870> for<00:04:10.140> electrical

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
rigged up a switch box for electrical

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.199 
rigged up a switch box for electrical
power<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:11.250> will<00:04:11.370> give<00:04:11.489> us<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.760> option<00:04:12.090> of

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
power that will give us the option of

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.970 
power that will give us the option of
turning<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> backlight<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.230> starting<00:04:13.890> up

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
turning on a backlight and starting up

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.460 
turning on a backlight and starting up
the<00:04:14.070> router<00:04:14.280> from<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.670> safer<00:04:15.000> distance<00:04:15.260> now<00:04:16.260> one

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
the router from a safer distance now one

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.870 
the router from a safer distance now one
of<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.650> things<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.010> like<00:04:17.190> best<00:04:17.220> about<00:04:17.579> this

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
of the things I like best about this

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.640 
of the things I like best about this
design<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.870> bit<00:04:19.049> can<00:04:19.260> be<00:04:19.350> fully

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
design is that the bit can be fully

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.050 
design is that the bit can be fully
retracted<00:04:20.250> when<00:04:20.400> we<00:04:20.489> don't<00:04:20.700> need<00:04:20.820> it

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
retracted when we don't need it

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.029 
retracted when we don't need it
this<00:04:21.630> means<00:04:21.870> we<00:04:22.020> still<00:04:22.200> have<00:04:22.260> full<00:04:22.590> access<00:04:22.770> to

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
this means we still have full access to
