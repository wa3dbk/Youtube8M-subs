up positions position one is gonna be

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.750 
up positions position one is gonna be
the<00:00:27.869> full<00:00:28.109> bridge<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.710> itself<00:00:29.130> which<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.640> going

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the full bridge by itself which is going

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:41.780 
the full bridge by itself which is going
to<00:00:29.820> sound<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.359> you'd<00:00:30.510> expect<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> sound

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.010 

now<00:00:42.790> position<00:00:43.180> number<00:00:43.300> two<00:00:43.630> is<00:00:43.780> going<00:00:43.960> to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
now position number two is going to

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.360 
now position number two is going to
introduce<00:00:44.230> some<00:00:44.559> of<00:00:44.650> that<00:00:44.739> unique<00:00:45.010> switching

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
introduce some of that unique switching

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.560 
introduce some of that unique switching
I<00:00:45.460> was<00:00:45.579> talking<00:00:45.940> about<00:00:46.090> it's<00:00:46.270> going<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.450> be

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
I was talking about it's going to be

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.020 
I was talking about it's going to be
these<00:00:46.720> two<00:00:46.960> inside<00:00:47.470> coils<00:00:48.010> in<00:00:48.220> series<00:00:48.790> now

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
these two inside coils in series now

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.180 
these two inside coils in series now
what<00:00:49.210> series<00:00:49.629> means<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.650> creates

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
what series means is it creates

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.500 
what series means is it creates
something<00:00:51.400> that<00:00:51.580> feels<00:00:51.760> like<00:00:52.030> one<00:00:52.300> big

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
something that feels like one big

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.750 
something that feels like one big
humbucker<00:00:53.080> between<00:00:53.379> those<00:00:53.530> two<00:00:53.739> coils<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.640> it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
humbucker between those two coils so it

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.780 
humbucker between those two coils so it
is<00:00:54.790> kind<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.180> wooly<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.690> swampy<00:00:56.170> sounding

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:14.210 

you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.380 

position<00:01:15.220> number<00:01:15.310> three<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.940> going<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.210> give

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
position number three is going to give

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.510 
position number three is going to give
us<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.750> full<00:01:17.020> neck<00:01:17.409> but<00:01:17.890> also<00:01:18.130> add<00:01:18.490> that

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
us the full neck but also add that

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.790 
us the full neck but also add that
inside<00:01:19.060> coil<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.540> bridge<00:01:19.810> now<00:01:20.380> what's<00:01:20.590> cool

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
inside coil the bridge now what's cool

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.290 
inside coil the bridge now what's cool
about<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:21.190> position<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.970> gives<00:01:22.180> you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
about this position is it gives you

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.719 
about this position is it gives you
everything<00:01:22.720> that<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.590> kind<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.920> syrupy<00:01:24.490> and

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
everything that is kind of syrupy and

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.670 
everything that is kind of syrupy and
sweet<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.300> warm<00:01:25.630> about<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.170> neck<00:01:26.440> humbucker

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
sweet and warm about a neck humbucker

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.290 
sweet and warm about a neck humbucker
but<00:01:27.369> it's<00:01:27.520> going<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.729> add<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> little<00:01:27.940> bit<00:01:28.240> of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
but it's going to add a little bit of

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.760 
but it's going to add a little bit of
clarity<00:01:28.780> up<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.110> top<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.350> little<00:01:29.619> bit<00:01:29.710> of

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
clarity up on top a little bit of

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.180 
clarity up on top a little bit of
sparkle<00:01:30.160> up<00:01:30.310> top<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.990> great<00:01:35.860> for<00:01:36.040> like<00:01:36.159> a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
sparkle up top and great for like a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:50.580 
sparkle up top and great for like a
finger<00:01:36.550> style<00:01:36.759> kind<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.060> thing<00:01:49.289> that<00:01:50.289> kind<00:01:50.530> of

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
finger style kind of thing that kind of

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.050 
finger style kind of thing that kind of
thing<00:01:50.770> if<00:01:50.920> we<00:01:51.039> go<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.190> position<00:01:51.550> number<00:01:51.580> four

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
thing if we go to position number four

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.820 
thing if we go to position number four
it's<00:01:52.420> going<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.750> give<00:01:52.930> us<00:01:52.960> these<00:01:53.200> two<00:01:53.470> inside

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
it's going to give us these two inside

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's going to give us these two inside
coils<00:01:54.250> in<00:01:54.399> parallel<00:01:54.970> now<00:01:55.450> what's<00:01:55.660> great<00:01:55.810> about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
coils in parallel now what's great about

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.320 
coils in parallel now what's great about
that<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.590> parallel<00:01:57.009> switching<00:01:57.670> cleans<00:01:58.090> up

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
that is parallel switching cleans up

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.749 
that is parallel switching cleans up
really<00:01:58.720> really<00:01:59.080> well<00:01:59.229> so<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:00.340> roll<00:02:00.550> off

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
really really well so if you roll off

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.919 
really really well so if you roll off
some<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.119> gain<00:02:01.300> on<00:02:01.330> your<00:02:01.600> amplifier

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
some of the gain on your amplifier

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.120 
some of the gain on your amplifier
you're<00:02:02.259> going<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.440> get<00:02:02.500> some<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:02.890> almost

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
you're going to get some that almost

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:18.820 
you're going to get some that almost
feels<00:02:03.369> like<00:02:03.399> an<00:02:03.580> acoustic<00:02:04.000> guitar

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.660 

position<00:02:19.830> number<00:02:19.890> five<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.340> going<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.550> give<00:02:20.640> us

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
position number five is going to give us

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.700 
position number five is going to give us
that<00:02:20.880> neck<00:02:21.180> all<00:02:21.390> by<00:02:21.660> itself<00:02:22.050> now<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> neck

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
that neck all by itself now a neck

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.310 
that neck all by itself now a neck
humbucker<00:02:23.000> sounds<00:02:24.000> huge<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:24.930> great<00:02:25.260> for

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
humbucker sounds huge and it's great for

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:47.240 
humbucker sounds huge and it's great for
some<00:02:25.710> solo<00:02:26.040> tones

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
