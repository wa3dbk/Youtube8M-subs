00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.550
 Hello everybody 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:12.070
 my name is Konstantin I live in Tver 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.070
 I recently bought a bicycle 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.680
 I'll tell you what is called jamis durango 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:22.869
 29 sport that is the most budget 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:27.769
 Niner model and here is the American brand 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:33.130
 although china is bent at a discount in 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:35.390
 sportmaster he worth 12500 roughly speaking 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.980
 let's see what kind of money we are 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:45.500
 we get its appearance 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.589
 let's say this is one of the reasons why 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.589
 I took what's good here 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.830
 Well the fact that 29 wheels rented this video for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.380
 to help people who have not yet 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.290
 decided whether to take the brothers 29 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.420
 wheels or not I can immediately say that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.420
 definitely yes here is next 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.579
 stern 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.499
 on the twenty-sixth wheel, we would not 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.549
 we will now about the brand is that it is a sport 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:21.850
 master and all things just back sixth 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.789
 effort is applied much more than 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.740
 I still want to say the main thing 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.859
 the difference is that on this bike you 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.560
 trying to ride but on this you are not 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.679
 what are you going to fly that is three times 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:41.799
 pedals spun you already got good 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.869
 speed so go for a closer gun that 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.270
 I still liked 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.719
 wide wheel pretty straight very 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.530
 comfortable saddle comfortable enough by the way 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:58.179
 very long stretch tire pin 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.479
 2 and 10 inches how would they be universal and 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:05.789
 on the way they are very chic rides and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.789
 so say bye to this is wonderful 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.440
 tektro disc mechanical brakes 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.240
 novela 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.010
 plug as you see rst place well read 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.610
 not a lot of bad 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.920
 comments that it is the cheapest 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:32.380
 no but really suit me 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:35.490
 so far frame aluminum 6061 size me 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.810
 frame 19 i have a meter eighty three and 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.470
 I must say that here I am on this frame 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.280
 feel very very very comfortable 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.900
 plastic pedals well this 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.650
 critics of pedals me plastic 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.000
 arrange 24 speeds 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.100
 shimano acera rear switches 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.770
 front 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.300
 also a shaman well some kind of budget 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.110
 both yes it seems like double although they are not 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.690
 written but if you look at them 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.340
 they are very similar to the doubles in trial to me 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.040
 never said double or not 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.709
 tire by the way tires are very high quality 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.850
 very soft grip cool just 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.420
 wonderful 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:22.600
 Well, I already told the color of the fork 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.600
 certainly not 100 millimeters but 80 holds 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.540
 how much i ride the second day 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.070
 rear transmission is just great 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.680
 for some reason the front switches today 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.900
 after one fall, not me so to speak 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.460
 my second half front 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.590
 switch somehow work now not 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.490
 very big star does not switch 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.350
 but this is a fixable thing with a fork with us 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.350
 here, only blocking the course and 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.799
 course setting softness 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.260
 hold the steering wheel and aluminum with one 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.569
 hexagon 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.939
 seat here is such that it may be 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.430
 I see once again I say takes pictures for those who 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.140
 as if looking at this model does not bite 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.220
 nails worth taking or not taking and generally 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.730
 about 29 wheels yet did not understand whether 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.730
 give money 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.659
 so you do not come you something 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:29.789
 unpleasant well, what are my impressions yes 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:32.659
 once again a very good bike ride 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.659
 very light 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.680
 Well, 15 kilograms for me so 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.999
 easy that is i'm not feeling at all on 8 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.999
 our floor is just calm 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:52.030
 system by the way pedals are not the cheapest 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.500
 suntour what is interesting they are on 6 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.800
 granite before this i only saw here 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.800
 the bolts 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.390
 here 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:05.930
 By the way the wheel is spinning for a very long time. 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:10.220
 that is, ki's chair is also not the most 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.800
 so to say simple protection if at once 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.280
 Pen try to recommend because 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.460
 the goal is beating and the novel is spoiled for now 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:25.540
 I have not yet decided what to do with these 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.900
 scratches which are those shirts 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.970
 rub the frame 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:34.870
 can tape the wires themselves and tape 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.870
 I do not know the frame yet, I will consult 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:43.829
 but basically everything is in the next video 

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:46.939
 I hope to show you the following 

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:50.849
 video show it in action and so guys 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:53.279

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.649
 Well, I mean cheaper jamis about anything other 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.779

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:59.459
 him 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:04.289
 triple triangle from which sense 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:06.950
 There is no very pretty tough from the morning 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.500
