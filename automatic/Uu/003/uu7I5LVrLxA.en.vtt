00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.970
 There are gonçalo in amarante value 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.249
 can inscribe today an interesting question of paulo silva 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.899
 which are the strongest winds that exist in the planet 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:21.380
 and he even imagined some myths associated with actor-narrator hurricane 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.400
 in romania 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.859
 but not paulo 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.599
 these intense though intense winds near here from the surface they 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.169
 if not him 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.619
 the friction issue 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.619
 the surface itself surface of the planet 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.500
 the seizure of narcotics 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 so if the winds are not near the surface events are 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.449
 are they staying 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.070
 up there in the atmosphere 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.050
 up to 15 kilometers in height, these winds are not influenced by the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.160
 surface then 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.420
 these constant winds known as jet stream 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.050
 these winds can reach a speed of 100 200 up to 300 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.170
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.910
 and it's not taxed not I was constant even there is a difference reiterate 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.340
 there is a constant uproar that we usually feel here on the floor. 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.330
 burst 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.160
 the militant is the chest 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.670
 is constant is weaker in terms of a more intense burst often ended 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.840
 provoking disorders no more if the constant wind dies 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.020
 you have to arrive 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.850
 to value and descend saints up to 300 kilometers per hour those winds they 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.159
 more or less at the time of the projects of both the tropics of 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.380
 capricorn that the mystery south as in the tropic of cancer up there and the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.950
 figure shows this shows that they are made this jet stream 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.770
 kandahar in the southern hemisphere near the western line of the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.560
 Capricorn 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 are these 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.210
 - said days 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.399
 but strong and more vibrant colors sousa cintra 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.670
 except in the pacific passing also by the beach by the south america 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.299
 also reaching the end 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.170
 next to the atlantic next martinho these winds they are constant them 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 second goal of Flemish 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.340
 these winds exist there are also none in the northern hemisphere in the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.390
 Oceania 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.500
 there are some curiosities about the game current 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.919
 every once in a while we hear someone talk about wanting to give 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.379
 balloon laura 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.229
 and what does this staff do? 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.189
 personnel and looking for meteorological 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.480
 Brazil is in the key. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.969
 there is much that this position of the jet stream 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.680
 nothing simpler if you can get to são paulo to do tests 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.389
 so we will not close 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.109
 unable to reach the region of the accident 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.219
 great you'll end up traveling so 200 to 300 miles per hour you 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.789
 will achieve 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.669
 to your goal in a few days 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.749
 there are also some other curiosities related to aviation 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.450
 Make up the planes when they arrive 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.639
 the cruise level 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.699
 imprisonment of members of the round table with and from now 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:53.819
 for example each 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.099
 acted in three são paulo and santiago chile he is purest 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.479
 when you have to sant'iago own brazil to são paulo 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:02.990
 There is no way you will talk. 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.130
 precisely because of the jet stream 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.269
 and always has a sense coming 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.659
 12 years pacific from west to east 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.609
 and of course when the plane has to cross 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.940
 this region of the jet stream there is much turbulence 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.170
 In many cases, the turbulence that occurs on airplanes is associated 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.649
 to the plane perpendicularly crossed that region of the jet stream 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:30.319
 and also of course good this jet stream can be used in favor if you 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.169
 have a long-term trip 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.599
 it's simpler you try to find answer do not divert much ball but it's 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.579
 the easier you find in this region of the jet stream 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.319
 it's a breakthrough you end up saving a lot of fuel 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.299
 and if you have any questions about meteorology contact us 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.769
 through time now here time has no mystery cyril despres
