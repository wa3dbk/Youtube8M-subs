00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.100
 hello guys from meres to my channel today 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.480
 I come with a special video similar to 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.160
 I did with sparks a while ago 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.660
 I asked for instagram if they wanted to know 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.190
 the story of chanel a bunny who 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.440
 I came to my house and it was like one or two 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.730
 weeks and how did they say yes 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.050
 I bring them here so if you want 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.550
 know a little more about it you can 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.750
 who know from time to time I like it 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.370
 do this kind of videos for 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.440
 raise awareness that the 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.880
 abandonment and animal abuse is not something 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.190
 so so isolated but it's pretty 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.200
 common in fact I've already found that way 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.430
 of cases and takes a little time in 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.719
 this so I imagine the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.860
 protect all the cases that have 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.210
 had to see I'm always 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.800
 pending of these facebook pages 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.079
 in which they put animals that have 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.430
 lost they need adoption and so on and 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.960
 especially in my area because it's the area 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.760
 that more or less I can control and which 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.260
 I can personally help one day 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.850
 looking on a facebook page this 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.980
 I saw that a girl had published 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.140
 a picture of a bellie bunny and the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.760
 had taken out of his previous house in the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.020
 previous owner's house 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.399
 he simply paid all his 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.750
 frustrations for the poor rabbit the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.880
 had locked in a cage this 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.559
 size and every time I took to work 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.530
 and he was angry because he paid for it with 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.059
 the rabbit and hit her maintained mistreatment 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.100
 in full rule the owner simply the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.500
 I had like a boxing bag 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.659
 to their food and looked at their hygiene and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.119
 I looked for his health I just had it 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.680
 in house locked up and when he got frustrated 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.909
 Well I paid it with the poor bunnies 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.250
 thanks to a girl that saw that 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.930
 situation spoke with the owner to be able 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.549
 take the bunny to her house and 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.229
 it cost but in the end he could take it to 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.840
 his house the total owner did not care 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.240
 so I just took her home and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 I'm looking for an adoption house at least 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.690
 temporary or definitive was with that girl 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.159
 with whom I contacted to see 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.960
 picture because she can not take charge 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.610
 of the bunny for a long time then 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.229
 I decided to stay with her for a while 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.700
 at home when he got home he takes in the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.039
 tiny cage that was the one that had him 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.780
 the owner previously in life 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.179
 would have probably taken off simply 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.950
 he had her there to hit him and when the 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.170
 take out, well, apart from being very 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.810
 scared and had the typical squeak of 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.280
 nerves and the super-agitated nose I left her 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.780
 a little while in the house so he left 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.640
 familiarizing outside walking and 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.590
 recognizing everything because there was going to be a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.869
 season here and more or less it was 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.759
 reassuring but that trauma I had 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.140
 for having hit him because he was not removed 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.060
 because every time I would bring it the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 hand or ran out I tried 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.250
 attack the first day I did a checkup 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.050
 general for 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.760
 it was all good that you have to take it 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.550
 running to the vet and he did not have 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.230
 diarrhea, I cut his nails, I cleaned his 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.970
 private parties because I had them fatal 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.390
 he had a lot of letters stuck in the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.250
 Culete the toilet and hygiene of that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.130
 animal had been null in all its 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.480
 I stayed with the owner so I did all 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.250
 check class to check that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.320
 it was all good to brush it off the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.940
 knots I had and when it was good 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.250
 I left her quiet at home 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.570
 and he continued to familiarize himself with all 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.220
 first days I was very scared and 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.930
 also quite unfriendly did not let me 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.489
 closer, let alone the dwarves to the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.860
 dwarves I had to have separated all the 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.230
 while outside on the terrace and in there 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.090
 because you could not even see how he had the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.730
 jealousy so stressed did not 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.290
 castrated obviously every time he raped 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.790
 mine did not try to attack so 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.920
 I decided to keep them separated at all 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.720
 moment although normally it is usually 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.280
 good to interact with other rabbits 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.959
 that are castrated to help her 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.430
 socialize but in the case this 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.930
 Bunny not because of the trauma I had 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.790
 He was very big and I tried to earn his 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.860
 trust little by little sitting down to your 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.720
 side so much to his height giving him food from 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.660
 my hand and on a lot of occasions 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.540
 I was trying 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.160
 to bite me one of those times he bit me 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 but good you have to stay calm and 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.580
 you have to understand that the bunny 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.260
 have a trauma then you have to have 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.700
 patience with the process little by little it 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.350
 was adapting and being free by the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 room like it felt better 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.680
 because when he arrived he had enough 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.380
 overweight and the fact of making her walk 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.570
 and being agile because it made her more 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.180
 happy or at least that seemed 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.950
 I was by curious room gave everything 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.180
 you know, it was quiet the truth that I 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.140
 would have liked a lot to stay the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.840
 because as you are seeing the images 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.280
 It was beautiful and with mine 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.050
 probably over time they would have 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.750
 carried well but my abilities I 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.830
 they leave enough doses after a 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.330
 time I talked to the girl who told me 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.650
 had brought home that is what 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.480
 had taken from the house of the previous 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.190
 owner and we reached an agreement 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.840
 we managed to find a better house 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.610
 so that it was loose so that 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.830
 had a better life and out 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.420
 getting more confidence from the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.860
 human beings we must bear in mind that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.420
 these bunnies that have traumas then 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.040
 at the end they will always have something of 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.450
 fear of humans but if it is dedicated 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.860
 time and patience, they can 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.900
 recover so nothing 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.310
 a new home and I hope me great 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.690
 like to do this kind of videos because 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.549
 I think it's important that everyone 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.930
 put a grain of sand if we 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.850
 that any animal needs our 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.530
 help because he has been in bad hands 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.290
 because it has been abandoned or because 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.490
 any other reason should we 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.590
 try to help even with the minimum 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.120
 I stayed for two weeks but it was 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.890
 enough to improve your state of 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.600
 health so I'm super happy 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.250
 so if you see something similar in your 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.260
 area because it tries to help even if it's 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.820
 minimum possible because in the end the 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.830
 everyone's small actions they can 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.090
 do something big and as I always say yes 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.470
 you are not qualified to have a 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.330
 pet or give him a good feed 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.830
 nor give a good hygiene or about 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.860
 good veterinary care and if on 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.650
 you mistreat it, do not have it simply 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.510
 or give it up for adoption or let it be vouchers for 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.040
 Trust, do not have it if you do not 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.690
 you are trained to have it because it happens 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.280
 in this kind of thing and in the end that 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.690
 you suffer the animal when it does not deserve it 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.250
 well nothing guys this was all for today 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.110
 I hope you liked it just 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.430
 I wanted to bring the history of chanel to 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.919
 that you can also put a 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.840
 granite of sand and if they can resort to 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.280
 the associations or protectors because 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.830
 there are a lot of protectors that 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.449
 they need shelters because they have 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.029
 a limited space and they have too many 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.889
 day after day because they collaborate because 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.240
 I sincerely thank you so nothing 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.199
 dismissal as always until the next 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.199
 video and a huge kiss 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.160
 Y 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
 do not
