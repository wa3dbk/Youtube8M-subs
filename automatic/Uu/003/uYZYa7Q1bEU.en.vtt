the<00:00:10.809> frontside<00:00:11.259> flip<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:13.480> frontside<00:00:13.900> flip<00:00:14.230> is

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
the frontside flip the frontside flip is

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.499 
the frontside flip the frontside flip is
when<00:00:14.679> you<00:00:14.769> do<00:00:14.889> a<00:00:14.920> frontside<00:00:15.340> 180<00:00:15.699> and<00:00:16.150> the

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:16.509 
when you do a frontside 180 and the

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.499 
when you do a frontside 180 and the
kickflip<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.140> you<00:00:17.349> put<00:00:17.590> them<00:00:17.710> together<00:00:18.509> some

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
kickflip and you put them together some

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.999 
kickflip and you put them together some
people<00:00:19.840> do<00:00:19.960> this<00:00:20.140> trick<00:00:20.410> with<00:00:20.439> more<00:00:20.829> of<00:00:20.919> a

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
people do this trick with more of a

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.490 
people do this trick with more of a
kickflip<00:00:21.369> motion<00:00:21.849> and<00:00:22.090> others<00:00:22.960> do<00:00:23.169> it<00:00:23.320> with

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
kickflip motion and others do it with

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.819 
kickflip motion and others do it with
more<00:00:23.680> of<00:00:23.770> a<00:00:23.829> hard<00:00:24.070> flip<00:00:24.279> motion<00:00:24.730> I<00:00:25.469> think<00:00:26.469> that

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
more of a hard flip motion I think that

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.280 
more of a hard flip motion I think that
mine<00:00:27.040> are<00:00:27.460> maybe<00:00:27.759> somewhere<00:00:28.270> in<00:00:28.329> between<00:00:28.509> but

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
mine are maybe somewhere in between but

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.100 
mine are maybe somewhere in between but
I'm<00:00:29.619> just<00:00:29.800> going<00:00:29.950> to<00:00:29.980> show<00:00:30.160> you<00:00:30.189> how<00:00:30.399> I<00:00:30.430> do<00:00:30.610> them

some tricks that you should probably

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.819 
some tricks that you should probably
have<00:00:33.129> down<00:00:33.520> before<00:00:34.030> trying<00:00:34.329> this<00:00:34.540> one<00:00:34.780> are<00:00:35.370> all

have down before trying this one are all

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.330 
have down before trying this one are all
the<00:00:38.829> frontside<00:00:39.399> 180<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.940> need<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.180> kick<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
the frontside 180 you need to kick and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.160 
the frontside 180 you need to kick and
also<00:00:46.060> with<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.420> way<00:00:46.510> I'm<00:00:46.690> going<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:46.930> show<00:00:47.140> you

also with the way I'm going to show you

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.770 
also with the way I'm going to show you
how<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.410> do<00:00:47.650> these<00:00:47.829> it<00:00:48.520> may<00:00:48.850> be<00:00:48.910> helpful<00:00:49.390> if<00:00:49.660> you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
how to do these it may be helpful if you

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.600 
how to do these it may be helpful if you
can<00:00:49.960> do<00:00:50.079> hard<00:00:50.350> flips<00:00:50.620> but<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.040> is<00:00:51.160> definitely

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
can do hard flips but it is definitely

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.600 
can do hard flips but it is definitely
not<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.820> requirement<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.340> three<00:00:54.579> main

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
not a requirement so the three main

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.690 
not a requirement so the three main
components<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.450> this<00:00:55.660> trick<00:00:55.960> are<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.890> pop<00:00:57.130> the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
components to this trick are the pop the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.930 
components to this trick are the pop the
flick<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.780> rotation<00:00:59.260> of<00:00:59.320> your<00:00:59.380> body<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.340> the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
flick and rotation of your body and the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.870 
flick and rotation of your body and the
landing<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.920> foot<00:01:03.130> positioning<00:01:03.610> for<00:01:03.790> this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
landing the foot positioning for this

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.609 
landing the foot positioning for this
trick<00:01:04.149> can<00:01:04.509> vary<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:05.320> kind<00:01:05.560> of

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
trick can vary and it's kind of

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.350 
trick can vary and it's kind of
dependent<00:01:06.189> on<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.729> want<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:06.939> do<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:07.149> more

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
dependent on if you want to do it more

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.819 
dependent on if you want to do it more
of<00:01:07.450> like<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.630> kickflip<00:01:08.140> or<00:01:08.380> more<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.680> like<00:01:08.799> a

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
of like a kickflip or more of like a

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.280 
of like a kickflip or more of like a
hard<00:01:09.130> flip<00:01:09.340> but<00:01:10.119> here's<00:01:10.450> how<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.659> set<00:01:10.930> my<00:01:11.079> feet

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
hard flip but here's how I set my feet

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.800 
hard flip but here's how I set my feet
up<00:01:11.439> I<00:01:11.710> put<00:01:12.460> my<00:01:12.579> front<00:01:12.820> foot<00:01:12.969> in<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.420> center<00:01:13.780> of

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
up I put my front foot in the center of

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.140 
up I put my front foot in the center of
the<00:01:13.990> board<00:01:14.229> sort<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:15.040> angled<00:01:15.460> about<00:01:15.670> 45

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
the board sort of angled about 45

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.420 
the board sort of angled about 45
degrees<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.860> you're<00:01:18.040> having<00:01:18.159> trouble

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
degrees if you're having trouble

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.950 
degrees if you're having trouble
flipping<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.120> board<00:01:19.299> all<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.600> way<00:01:19.690> around

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
flipping the board all the way around

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.660 
flipping the board all the way around
you<00:01:20.229> may<00:01:20.409> need<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.680> alter<00:01:20.890> this<00:01:21.190> position

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
you may need to alter this position

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.870 
you may need to alter this position
slightly<00:01:22.320> from<00:01:23.320> my<00:01:23.440> back<00:01:23.680> foot<00:01:23.920> I'm<00:01:24.250> standing

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
slightly from my back foot I'm standing

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.910 
slightly from my back foot I'm standing
almost<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.450> edge<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.960> tail<00:01:26.200> with<00:01:26.890> the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
almost on the edge of the tail with the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.370 
almost on the edge of the tail with the
ball<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.280> my<00:01:27.520> foot<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:28.180> line<00:01:28.630> just<00:01:28.659> about<00:01:29.229> in

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
ball of my foot in line just about in

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.200 
ball of my foot in line just about in
the<00:01:29.409> center<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.040> board<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.460> my<00:01:30.909> toes<00:01:31.180> a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
the center of the board in my toes a

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.380 
the center of the board in my toes a
little<00:01:31.540> bit<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.049> toe<00:01:32.229> side<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.770> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
little bit to the toe side of that I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.760 
little bit to the toe side of that I
find<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.479> this<00:01:34.690> helps<00:01:35.080> me<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.320> flip<00:01:35.619> the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
find that this helps me to flip the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.039 
find that this helps me to flip the
board<00:01:35.950> upward<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.610> way<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.729> need<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.420> also

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
board upward the way I need to and also

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.070 
board upward the way I need to and also
turn<00:01:38.290> 180<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:40.150> again<00:01:40.420> here's<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.810> foot

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
turn 180 so again here's the foot

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.170 
turn 180 so again here's the foot
positioning<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.740> kind<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.640> just<00:01:42.790> notice<00:01:43.060> my

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
positioning and kind of just notice my

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.969 
positioning and kind of just notice my
back<00:01:43.210> foot<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.869> how<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:44.170> off<00:01:44.350> towards<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
back foot and how it's off towards the

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.950 
back foot and how it's off towards the
end<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.310> tail<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.549> it's<00:01:46.270> almost<00:01:46.450> angled

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
end of the tail and it's almost angled

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.100 
end of the tail and it's almost angled
slightly<00:01:47.170> forward<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.630> way<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:49.810> this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
slightly forward so the way that this

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.590 
slightly forward so the way that this
trick<00:01:50.409> works<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:51.040> when<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.670> pop<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:51.970> board<00:01:52.390> it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
trick works is when you pop the board it

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.020 
trick works is when you pop the board it
ends<00:01:53.409> up<00:01:53.470> kind<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.830> doing<00:01:53.890> almost<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.580> back<00:01:54.790> flip

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
ends up kind of doing almost a back flip

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.050 
ends up kind of doing almost a back flip
rotation<00:01:55.630> up<00:01:55.990> into<00:01:56.619> your<00:01:56.740> foot<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.250> once<00:01:57.909> it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
rotation up into your foot and once it

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.940 
rotation up into your foot and once it
greets<00:01:58.299> your<00:01:58.540> foot<00:01:58.780> from<00:01:59.110> there<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.560> flick

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
greets your foot from there you flick

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.800 
greets your foot from there you flick
and<00:02:00.159> that's<00:02:00.520> how<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:00.729> get<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.030> full<00:02:01.240> rotation

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
and that's how you get the full rotation

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.840 
and that's how you get the full rotation
and<00:02:01.960> this<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.890> all<00:02:03.009> happening<00:02:03.250> while<00:02:03.670> your

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
and this is all happening while your

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.540 
and this is all happening while your
whole<00:02:04.000> bodies<00:02:04.330> turning<00:02:04.630> frontside

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.760 

the<00:02:10.030> first<00:02:10.330> step<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.720> learning<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:11.230> is

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
the first step to learning this is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.950 
the first step to learning this is
figuring<00:02:12.040> out<00:02:12.310> how<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.610> pop<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.150> board<00:02:13.420> so

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
figuring out how to pop the board so

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.930 
figuring out how to pop the board so
it's<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.620> flop<00:02:15.040> over<00:02:15.310> backflip

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
it's going to do that flop over backflip

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's going to do that flop over backflip
combination<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:19.480> basically<00:02:19.930> want<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> be

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
combination you basically want to be

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.350 
combination you basically want to be
able<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.710> pop<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.160> board<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.820> have<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.210> look

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
able to pop the board and have it look

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.320 
able to pop the board and have it look
like<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:30.550> sort<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.970> like<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
like this it's sort of like the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.080 
like this it's sort of like the
beginning<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.870> hard<00:02:32.140> flip<00:02:32.430> except<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.790> add

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
beginning of a hard flip except you add

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.120 
beginning of a hard flip except you add
in<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.390> front<00:02:34.630> side<00:02:34.840> body<00:02:35.110> varial<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.980> that's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
in a front side body varial and that's

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.470 
in a front side body varial and that's
how<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.310> complete<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.880> frontside<00:02:37.240> flip<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.450> I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
how you complete the frontside flip so I

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.500 
how you complete the frontside flip so I
would<00:02:43.870> suggest<00:02:44.050> before<00:02:44.770> anything<00:02:45.250> go<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:46.210> and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
would suggest before anything go out and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.070 
would suggest before anything go out and
do<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> bunch<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.080> frontside<00:02:47.560> 180s<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.840> do

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
do a bunch of frontside 180s and then do

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.410 
do a bunch of frontside 180s and then do
a<00:02:50.110> bunch<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.470> clips<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:51.970> be<00:02:52.120> really

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
a bunch of clips and just be really

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.850 
a bunch of clips and just be really
comfortable<00:02:52.690> with<00:02:53.080> both<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.440> those<00:02:53.590> feelings

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
comfortable with both of those feelings

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.700 
comfortable with both of those feelings
so<00:02:54.510> get<00:02:55.510> your<00:02:55.630> feet<00:02:55.930> into<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.440> foot

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
so get your feet into that foot

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.100 
so get your feet into that foot
positioning<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.430> said<00:02:57.670> earlier<00:02:58.110> we're

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
positioning that I said earlier we're

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.480 
positioning that I said earlier we're
going<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.290> start<00:02:59.560> learning<00:02:59.710> that<00:03:00.070> flip

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
going to start learning that flip

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.030 
going to start learning that flip
rotation<00:03:01.290> basically<00:03:02.290> if<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.500> put<00:03:02.740> your<00:03:02.860> foot

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
rotation basically if you put your foot

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.520 
rotation basically if you put your foot
in<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:03.280> position<00:03:03.790> give<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> nice<00:03:04.720> pop<00:03:05.050> off<00:03:05.350> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
in this position give a nice pop off the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.070 
in this position give a nice pop off the
tail<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.010> then<00:03:06.700> don't<00:03:06.940> flick<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.480> board<00:03:07.720> just

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
tail and then don't flick the board just

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.050 
tail and then don't flick the board just
lift<00:03:08.290> your<00:03:08.380> front<00:03:08.590> foot<00:03:08.860> straight<00:03:09.250> up<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
lift your front foot straight up the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.940 
lift your front foot straight up the
board<00:03:10.360> should<00:03:10.630> give<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.990> proper<00:03:11.410> back<00:03:11.710> flip

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
board should give the proper back flip

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.580 
board should give the proper back flip
rotation<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.570> see<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.050> as<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.200> board

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
rotation you can see that as the board

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.690 
rotation you can see that as the board
flips<00:03:14.860> over<00:03:15.040> backwards

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
flips over backwards

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.970 
flips over backwards
it<00:03:16.180> kind<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.570> greets<00:03:17.200> your<00:03:17.410> front<00:03:17.709> flip

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
it kind of just greets your front flip

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.150 
it kind of just greets your front flip
and<00:03:18.220> from<00:03:18.580> there<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.300> flips<00:03:19.600> over<00:03:20.070> so<00:03:21.070> you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
and from there it flips over so you

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.740 
and from there it flips over so you
basically<00:03:21.490> just<00:03:21.820> want<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.209> practice<00:03:22.600> that

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
basically just want to practice that

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.420 
basically just want to practice that
motion<00:03:23.200> at<00:03:23.320> first<00:03:23.560> until<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:23.980> get<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.280> down

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
motion at first until you get it down

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.060 
motion at first until you get it down
also<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.540> can<00:03:25.720> try<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.080> do<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.350> while<00:03:26.590> turning

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
also you can try and do it while turning

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.370 
also you can try and do it while turning
our<00:03:27.250> body<00:03:27.459> 90<00:03:27.850> degrees<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.930> will<00:03:29.110> help<00:03:29.290> you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
our body 90 degrees this will help you

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.020 
our body 90 degrees this will help you
start<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.830> be<00:03:29.920> used<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> rotation<00:03:30.910> you're

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
start to be used to the rotation you're

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.860 
start to be used to the rotation you're
going<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.270> do<00:03:32.760> unlike<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.790> kickflip<00:03:34.330> you're<00:03:34.750> not

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
going to do unlike a kickflip you're not

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.270 
going to do unlike a kickflip you're not
really<00:03:35.050> going<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.290> want<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> flick<00:03:35.860> your<00:03:35.890> front

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
really going to want to flick your front

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.820 
really going to want to flick your front
foot<00:03:36.550> out<00:03:36.580> too<00:03:36.940> hard<00:03:37.150> that's<00:03:38.140> most<00:03:38.440> likely

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
foot out too hard that's most likely

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.170 
foot out too hard that's most likely
going<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.010> cause<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.459> board<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.730> flip<00:03:40.030> out

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
going to cause the board to flip out

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.170 
going to cause the board to flip out
away<00:03:40.420> from<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.830> like<00:03:41.830> I<00:03:41.980> said<00:03:42.190> before<00:03:42.340> it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
away from you like I said before it

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.270 
away from you like I said before it
really<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.630> more<00:03:43.959> about<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.410> board<00:03:44.680> coming<00:03:45.010> up

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
really is more about the board coming up

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.220 
really is more about the board coming up
to<00:03:45.459> meet<00:03:45.700> your<00:03:45.850> front<00:03:46.120> foot<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.540> then<00:03:47.110> your

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
to meet your front foot and then your

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.140 
to meet your front foot and then your
front<00:03:47.500> foot<00:03:47.709> kicking<00:03:48.130> off<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.670> side<00:03:48.880> from

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
front foot kicking off to the side from

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.510 
front foot kicking off to the side from
there<00:03:51.959> next<00:03:52.959> I'd<00:03:53.140> say<00:03:53.380> kind<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.950> do<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.220> same

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
there next I'd say kind of do the same

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.540 
there next I'd say kind of do the same
motion<00:03:54.910> except<00:03:55.209> practice<00:03:55.720> while<00:03:55.900> moving<00:03:56.550> you

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
motion except practice while moving you

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.190 
motion except practice while moving you
might<00:03:57.580> notice<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.480> board<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.020> was

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
might notice that the board and I was

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.600 
might notice that the board and I was
kind<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.590> going<00:03:59.800> out<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.130> front<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.520> you

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
kind of going out in front of you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.880 
kind of going out in front of you
instead<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.150> staying<00:04:01.480> underneath<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:02.080> and

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
instead of staying underneath you and

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.560 
instead of staying underneath you and
that<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.459> another<00:04:03.730> way<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.120> point<00:04:04.300> of<00:04:04.390> this

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
that is another way to the point of this

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.440 
that is another way to the point of this
trick<00:04:04.900> once<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.070> actually<00:04:06.280> start<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:07.060> flip

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
trick once you actually start to flip

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.840 
trick once you actually start to flip
this<00:04:07.660> trick<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.230> jump<00:04:08.739> with<00:04:08.800> it<00:04:09.100> you're<00:04:09.730> going

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
this trick and jump with it you're going

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.090 
this trick and jump with it you're going
to<00:04:09.910> want<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.120> stay<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.480> top<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.140> which<00:04:11.830> at

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
to want to stay on top of it which at

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
to want to stay on top of it which at
first<00:04:12.160> can<00:04:12.760> seem<00:04:13.030> kind<00:04:13.330> of<00:04:13.450> scary<00:04:15.120> especially

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
first can seem kind of scary especially

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.460 
first can seem kind of scary especially
if<00:04:16.209> you're<00:04:16.359> doing<00:04:16.570> it<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.840> more<00:04:17.020> hard<00:04:17.290> flip

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
if you're doing it the more hard flip

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.400 
if you're doing it the more hard flip
kind<00:04:17.770> of<00:04:17.859> boy<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.810> would<00:04:19.810> say<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:20.169> if<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.380> are

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
kind of boy I would say that if you are

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.200 
kind of boy I would say that if you are
understanding<00:04:21.400> how<00:04:21.520> to<00:04:21.549> flip<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.030> board

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
understanding how to flip the board

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.420 
understanding how to flip the board
correctly<00:04:22.810> start<00:04:23.560> trying<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.950> land<00:04:24.160> it<00:04:24.310> with

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
correctly start trying to land it with

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.210 
correctly start trying to land it with
just<00:04:24.669> one<00:04:24.910> foot<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:26.380> should<00:04:26.620> get<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:26.950> bit

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
just one foot this should get you a bit

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.890 
just one foot this should get you a bit
more<00:04:27.400> comfortable<00:04:27.820> until<00:04:28.270> it's<00:04:28.450> time<00:04:28.660> to

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
more comfortable until it's time to

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.460 
more comfortable until it's time to
fully<00:04:29.140> commit<00:04:33.240> for<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.360> frontside<00:04:34.780> 180<00:04:35.169> part

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
fully commit for the frontside 180 part

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.560 
fully commit for the frontside 180 part
of<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:35.710> trick<00:04:36.040> you're<00:04:37.030> going<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.360> want<00:04:37.510> to

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
of this trick you're going to want to

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.770 
of this trick you're going to want to
spin<00:04:37.840> your<00:04:37.990> shoulders<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.740> similar<00:04:39.100> motion

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
spin your shoulders in a similar motion

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.150 
spin your shoulders in a similar motion
you<00:04:40.780> can<00:04:40.930> see<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.229> when<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.380> do<00:04:41.470> my<00:04:41.590> frontside

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
you can see that when I do my frontside

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.090 
you can see that when I do my frontside
flips<00:04:42.520> my<00:04:43.210> body<00:04:43.539> is<00:04:43.810> almost<00:04:44.410> turned<00:04:44.800> 90

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
flips my body is almost turned 90

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.860 
flips my body is almost turned 90
degrees<00:04:45.460> while<00:04:45.729> I'm<00:04:45.850> still<00:04:46.090> popping<00:04:46.720> off<00:04:46.840> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
degrees while I'm still popping off the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.340 
degrees while I'm still popping off the
ground<00:04:47.970> also<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.000> open<00:04:49.479> my<00:04:49.600> shoulders<00:04:50.050> up<00:04:50.200> as

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
ground also I open my shoulders up as

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.140 
ground also I open my shoulders up as
I'm<00:04:50.470> swinging<00:04:50.890> them<00:04:51.039> just<00:04:51.610> like<00:04:51.700> I'm<00:04:51.880> doing<00:04:51.970> a

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
I'm swinging them just like I'm doing a

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.420 
I'm swinging them just like I'm doing a
frontside<00:04:52.510> 180<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:53.620> way<00:04:53.770> my<00:04:53.950> hips<00:04:54.190> will

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
frontside 180 that way my hips will

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.550 
frontside 180 that way my hips will
follow<00:04:54.700> with<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.030> rotation<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.750> then<00:04:56.289> I<00:04:56.350> can

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
follow with the rotation and then I can

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.730 
follow with the rotation and then I can
just<00:04:56.710> land<00:04:56.979> it<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.250> follow<00:04:57.430> through

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.680 

so<00:05:04.280> once<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.730> get<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.120> point<00:05:05.420> where<00:05:05.600> you

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
so once you get to the point where you

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.950 
so once you get to the point where you
think<00:05:05.720> you're<00:05:06.110> ready<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.530> land<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.950> trip

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
think you're ready to land the trip

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.240 
think you're ready to land the trip
you're<00:05:08.960> going<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.260> have<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.560> be<00:05:09.680> confident

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
you're going to have to be confident

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.520 
you're going to have to be confident
jump<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.120> with<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.480> board<00:05:11.750> keeping<00:05:12.410> your

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
jump it with the board keeping your

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.920 
jump it with the board keeping your
weight<00:05:12.680> centered<00:05:12.980> over<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.700> just<00:05:14.510> kind<00:05:14.870> of

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
weight centered over it and just kind of

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.040 
weight centered over it and just kind of
go<00:05:15.140> for<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.790> somewhat<00:05:17.180> scary<00:05:17.570> because<00:05:17.810> you

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
go for it is somewhat scary because you

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.480 
go for it is somewhat scary because you
don't<00:05:18.080> want<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.470> get<00:05:18.590> credit<00:05:18.830> card<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:19.310> or

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
don't want to get credit card it or

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.360 
don't want to get credit card it or
split<00:05:19.910> in<00:05:20.000> half<00:05:20.230> but<00:05:21.230> you'll<00:05:21.440> be<00:05:21.470> surprised<00:05:22.040> at

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
split in half but you'll be surprised at

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.310 
split in half but you'll be surprised at
how<00:05:22.400> easy<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.060> can<00:05:23.210> flip<00:05:23.480> if<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:23.930> just<00:05:24.110> keep

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
how easy it can flip if you just keep

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.860 
how easy it can flip if you just keep
your<00:05:24.350> weight<00:05:24.680> above<00:05:25.010> the<00:05:25.190> board<00:05:25.460> I<00:05:25.780> think<00:05:26.780> a

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
your weight above the board I think a

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.720 
your weight above the board I think a
large<00:05:27.080> part<00:05:27.170> of<00:05:27.470> this<00:05:27.560> trick<00:05:27.890> is<00:05:28.100> just<00:05:28.190> about

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
large part of this trick is just about

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.300 
large part of this trick is just about
committing<00:05:29.500> you<00:05:30.500> might<00:05:30.680> be<00:05:30.800> kicking<00:05:31.040> your

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
committing you might be kicking your

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.700 
committing you might be kicking your
board<00:05:31.580> too<00:05:31.850> far<00:05:32.120> away<00:05:32.240> from<00:05:32.540> you<00:05:32.660> or<00:05:32.870> might<00:05:33.530> not

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
board too far away from you or might not

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.950 
board too far away from you or might not
be<00:05:33.890> flipping<00:05:34.280> over<00:05:34.400> all<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.760> way<00:05:34.850> but<00:05:35.720> if<00:05:35.840> you

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
be flipping over all the way but if you

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600 
be flipping over all the way but if you
really<00:05:36.260> have<00:05:36.440> that<00:05:36.650> flip<00:05:37.040> with<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.430> one

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
really have that flip with the one

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.000 
really have that flip with the one
footed<00:05:37.970> landing<00:05:38.330> down<00:05:38.480> I<00:05:38.870> think<00:05:39.410> it<00:05:39.680> really<00:05:39.830> is

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
footed landing down I think it really is

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:49.110 
footed landing down I think it really is
just<00:05:40.130> about<00:05:40.520> trying<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.060> stick<00:05:41.360> it<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.720> commit

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.850 

also<00:05:50.120> a<00:05:50.150> little<00:05:50.420> side<00:05:50.630> note<00:05:50.660> you<00:05:51.080> can<00:05:51.560> see<00:05:51.710> that

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
also a little side note you can see that

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.410 
also a little side note you can see that
some<00:05:52.160> of<00:05:52.190> these<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.430> feel<00:05:52.910> like<00:05:53.030> they<00:05:53.150> look<00:05:53.330> a

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
some of these I feel like they look a

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.760 
some of these I feel like they look a
little<00:05:53.540> more<00:05:53.690> like<00:05:54.140> they're<00:05:54.260> flipped<00:05:54.590> like

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
little more like they're flipped like

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.580 
little more like they're flipped like
instead<00:05:55.670> of<00:05:55.730> a<00:05:55.880> hard<00:05:56.090> flip<00:05:56.300> and<00:05:56.590> sometimes

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
instead of a hard flip and sometimes

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.500 
instead of a hard flip and sometimes
it's<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.920> other<00:05:57.950> way<00:05:58.160> around<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.730> think<00:05:59.390> this

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
it's the other way around I think this

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.480 
it's the other way around I think this
really<00:05:59.660> depends<00:06:00.290> on<00:06:00.470> how<00:06:00.770> fast<00:06:01.100> you're

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
really depends on how fast you're

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.540 
really depends on how fast you're
flicking<00:06:01.910> it<00:06:02.360> flips<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:02.960> board<00:06:03.230> I<00:06:03.500> think<00:06:04.430> the

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
flicking it flips the board I think the

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.400 
flicking it flips the board I think the
faster<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.180> more<00:06:05.240> deliberately<00:06:05.810> you<00:06:06.080> flick

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
faster and more deliberately you flick

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.620 
faster and more deliberately you flick
like<00:06:07.070> a<00:06:07.160> kick<00:06:07.340> they're<00:06:07.520> going<00:06:07.730> to<00:06:07.790> be<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.180> the

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
like a kick they're going to be and the

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.150 
like a kick they're going to be and the
longer<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:09.020> wait<00:06:09.170> for<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:09.500> board<00:06:09.860> to<00:06:10.010> flip

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
longer you wait for that board to flip

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.400 
longer you wait for that board to flip
up<00:06:10.430> backwards<00:06:10.940> and<00:06:11.180> hit<00:06:11.270> your<00:06:11.420> foot<00:06:11.630> then<00:06:12.260> the

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
up backwards and hit your foot then the

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.560 
up backwards and hit your foot then the
more<00:06:12.560> like<00:06:12.710> a<00:06:12.740> hard<00:06:13.010> walk<00:06:13.130> with<00:06:13.340> me<00:06:13.550> so<00:06:14.240> keep

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
more like a hard walk with me so keep

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.970 
more like a hard walk with me so keep
that<00:06:14.720> in<00:06:14.780> mind<00:06:14.870> depending<00:06:15.290> on<00:06:15.590> what<00:06:15.740> style

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
that in mind depending on what style

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.340 
that in mind depending on what style
you're<00:06:16.250> trying<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.580> learn<00:06:16.840> but<00:06:17.840> either<00:06:18.080> way

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
you're trying to learn but either way

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.879 
you're trying to learn but either way
the<00:06:18.620> rest<00:06:18.800> of<00:06:18.950> this<00:06:19.040> should<00:06:19.310> still<00:06:19.550> apply

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
the rest of this should still apply

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.629 
the rest of this should still apply
a<00:06:20.979> frontside<00:06:21.759> flip<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.270> a<00:06:22.300> really<00:06:22.719> fun<00:06:22.990> trick

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
a frontside flip is a really fun trick

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.670 
a frontside flip is a really fun trick
and<00:06:24.639> I<00:06:24.759> think<00:06:24.999> is<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.120> good<00:06:25.360> gateway<00:06:25.689> into<00:06:26.289> 180

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
and I think is a good gateway into 180

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.429 
and I think is a good gateway into 180
flip<00:06:26.979> tricks<00:06:27.389> they<00:06:28.389> may<00:06:28.569> seem<00:06:28.840> hard<00:06:29.110> at<00:06:29.229> first

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:29.439 
flip tricks they may seem hard at first

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:32.040 
flip tricks they may seem hard at first
but<00:06:29.979> just<00:06:30.400> like<00:06:30.550> every<00:06:30.819> other<00:06:30.849> trick<00:06:31.240> practice

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
but just like every other trick practice

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.879 
but just like every other trick practice
makes<00:06:32.289> perfect<00:06:32.529> and<00:06:33.009> you<00:06:33.669> can<00:06:33.999> land<00:06:34.270> them<00:06:34.889> so

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
makes perfect and you can land them so

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.209 
makes perfect and you can land them so
here<00:06:36.279> are<00:06:36.370> a<00:06:36.400> few<00:06:36.460> of<00:06:36.639> my<00:06:36.729> frontside<00:06:37.300> flips

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219 
here are a few of my frontside flips

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.290 
here are a few of my frontside flips
watch<00:06:39.219> what<00:06:39.400> I<00:06:39.460> said<00:06:39.699> about<00:06:39.819> the<00:06:40.060> foot

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
watch what I said about the foot

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.170 
watch what I said about the foot
positioning<00:06:41.009> also<00:06:42.009> the<00:06:42.400> way<00:06:42.550> that<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.909> board

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
positioning also the way that the board

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.170 
positioning also the way that the board
comes<00:06:43.509> up<00:06:43.719> hit<00:06:44.169> my<00:06:44.319> foot<00:06:44.759> the<00:06:45.759> way<00:06:45.879> that<00:06:46.060> my

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
comes up hit my foot the way that my

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.480 
comes up hit my foot the way that my
body<00:06:46.449> turns<00:06:46.900> for<00:06:47.169> the<00:06:47.259> 180<00:06:47.560> with<00:06:47.889> my<00:06:48.039> shoulders
