00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you totally adapt to it through the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.099 
you totally adapt to it through the
whoops<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.729> everything<00:00:57.089> it<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.239> goes<00:00:57.870> right

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
whoops and everything it just goes right

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.899 
whoops and everything it just goes right
through<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.440> no<00:00:58.620> problem<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.460> incredibly

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
through of no problem it's incredibly

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.029 
through of no problem it's incredibly
we've<00:01:00.420> done<00:01:00.600> some<00:01:00.809> drag<00:01:01.049> races<00:01:01.499> and<00:01:01.769> some

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
we've done some drag races and some

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.189 
we've done some drag races and some
side-by-side<00:01:02.780> comparison<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.019> just

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
side-by-side comparison and just

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
side-by-side comparison and just
real-world<00:01:05.159> testing<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.360> thing<00:01:06.540> just

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
real-world testing and this thing just

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780 
real-world testing and this thing just
seems<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.140> win<00:01:07.290> every<00:01:07.650> time<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.190> power<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
seems to win every time is the power it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.609 
seems to win every time is the power it
has<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.240> incredible<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.229> want<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> lift

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
has it's incredible you want to lift

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.920 
has it's incredible you want to lift
before<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.130> wants<00:01:11.399> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
before you it wants to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
before you it wants to
well<00:01:13.290> flairs<00:01:13.560> did<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.160> they<00:01:14.430> quicken<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
well flairs did is they they quicken the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
well flairs did is they they quicken the
steering<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.170> takes<00:01:16.500> less<00:01:16.860> effort<00:01:17.190> in<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
steering so it takes less effort in the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.830 
steering so it takes less effort in the
steering<00:01:17.880> wheel<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.180> make<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> wheels<00:01:18.630> go

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
steering wheel to make the wheels go

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.690 
steering wheel to make the wheels go
from<00:01:19.050> lock<00:01:19.260> to<00:01:19.440> lock<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:20.220> personally<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
from lock to lock which personally I

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
from lock to lock which personally I
like<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.270> more<00:01:21.690> adaptive<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.230> my

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
like because that's more adaptive to my

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
like because that's more adaptive to my
race<00:01:22.530> car<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.890> don't<00:01:23.160> have<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> spend<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:23.910> much

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
race car you don't have to spend as much

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
race car you don't have to spend as much
time<00:01:24.120> steering<00:01:24.660> it<00:01:24.810> makes<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.620> a<00:01:25.680> little

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
time steering it makes it a little

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
time steering it makes it a little
stiffer<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.510> me<00:01:27.660> that<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:28.440> doesn't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
stiffer but to me that that doesn't

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.290 
stiffer but to me that that doesn't
matter<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.040> much<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
matter as much but I like it because you

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.090 
matter as much but I like it because you
can<00:01:30.330> stay<00:01:30.660> on<00:01:30.780> top<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.440> some<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
can stay on top of it in some of the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.530 
can stay on top of it in some of the
