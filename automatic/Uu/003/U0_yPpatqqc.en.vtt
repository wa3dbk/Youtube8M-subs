motion like last time but a lot a lot

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.119 
motion like last time but a lot a lot
less<00:00:58.440> stiffness<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> pain<00:01:00.800> still<00:01:01.800> having<00:01:02.070> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
less stiffness and pain still having to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.729 
less stiffness and pain still having to
do<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.460> everyday<00:01:02.820> stretches<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> downs

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I guess behind the head up here form

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.240 
I guess behind the head up here form
stretches<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:11.729> nerve<00:01:12.650> gliding<00:01:13.650> exercise

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

more throws basically the answer in five
10<00:05:05.610> then<00:05:05.879> 15<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.360> say<00:05:06.659> I<00:05:06.689> feel<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.960> little<00:05:07.229> bit<00:05:07.319> of

stop altogether she wants me to continue
at<00:05:11.699> 15<00:05:12.180> until<00:05:12.539> I<00:05:12.599> can<00:05:12.779> get<00:05:12.960> there<00:05:13.169> without<00:05:13.680> any

pain and then once that happens you know
increase<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.529> workload<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.949> little<00:05:17.219> bit<00:05:20.449> so

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
increase the workload a little bit so

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.420 
increase the workload a little bit so
she<00:05:21.569> wants<00:05:21.779> me<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:21.900> slowly<00:05:22.199> advance<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.919> 50

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
she wants me to slowly advance to 50

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.659 
she wants me to slowly advance to 50
pitches<00:05:23.639> I<00:05:24.150> mean<00:05:24.900> 50<00:05:25.199> throws<00:05:25.439> I'm<00:05:25.620> sorry<00:05:25.860> with

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
pitches I mean 50 throws I'm sorry with

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.179 
pitches I mean 50 throws I'm sorry with
perfect<00:05:27.210> form<00:05:27.419> and<00:05:27.659> no<00:05:27.930> pain<00:05:28.199> and<00:05:28.500> she

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
perfect form and no pain and she

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.700 
perfect form and no pain and she
predicts<00:05:29.909> that<00:05:30.029> this<00:05:30.180> will<00:05:30.330> take<00:05:30.479> about<00:05:30.710> two

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
predicts that this will take about two

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.519 
predicts that this will take about two
months<00:05:32.099> so<00:05:33.089> two<00:05:33.150> months<00:05:33.509> working<00:05:33.870> on<00:05:34.050> perfect

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
months so two months working on perfect

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:35.899 
months so two months working on perfect
nothing<00:05:34.650> but<00:05:34.889> perfect<00:05:35.250> form<00:05:35.490> she<00:05:35.729> doesn't

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
nothing but perfect form she doesn't

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.920 
nothing but perfect form she doesn't
want<00:05:36.029> me<00:05:36.120> throwing<00:05:36.419> very<00:05:36.539> hard<00:05:36.659> and<00:05:37.620> then

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
want me throwing very hard and then

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.980 
want me throwing very hard and then
after<00:05:39.930> that's<00:05:40.080> up<00:05:40.440> on<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:41.099> third<00:05:41.310> month<00:05:41.990> then

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
after that's up on the third month then

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.649 
after that's up on the third month then
I<00:05:43.020> can<00:05:43.259> start<00:05:43.440> working<00:05:43.770> on<00:05:44.009> on<00:05:44.250> speed<00:05:44.699> again

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
I can start working on on speed again

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.140 
I can start working on on speed again
start<00:05:45.960> with<00:05:45.990> five<00:05:46.259> to<00:05:46.409> ten<00:05:46.560> five<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.729> ten

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
start with five to ten five to ten

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.920 
start with five to ten five to ten
throws<00:05:49.639> what's<00:05:50.639> a<00:05:50.759> lot<00:05:50.940> more<00:05:51.240> effort<00:05:51.449> into<00:05:51.810> it

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
throws what's a lot more effort into it

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.610 
throws what's a lot more effort into it
so<00:05:52.469> I<00:05:52.500> worked<00:05:52.830> my<00:05:52.949> way<00:05:52.979> up<00:05:53.159> to<00:05:53.310> fifty<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.620> then

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
so I worked my way up to fifty and then

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.860 
so I worked my way up to fifty and then
she<00:05:56.310> said<00:05:56.580> that<00:05:56.729> I<00:05:56.759> should<00:05:56.819> be<00:05:57.089> at<00:05:57.300> play<00:05:57.659> level

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
she said that I should be at play level

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.450 
she said that I should be at play level
by<00:05:58.289> the<00:05:58.319> end<00:05:58.500> of<00:05:58.740> December

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
by the end of December

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.879 
by the end of December
so<00:06:00.180> basically<00:06:00.599> we're<00:06:01.020> in<00:06:01.110> September<00:06:01.650> August

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
so basically we're in September August

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.619 
so basically we're in September August
September<00:06:02.159> October<00:06:02.669> November

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
September October November

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.279 
September October November
you<00:06:04.439> know<00:06:04.589> mid<00:06:05.250> December<00:06:05.849> it<00:06:06.599> would<00:06:06.719> be<00:06:06.839> three

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
you know mid December it would be three

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.809 
you know mid December it would be three
months<00:06:07.680> so<00:06:07.830> by<00:06:07.979> the<00:06:08.039> end<00:06:08.219> of<00:06:08.310> December<00:06:08.729> I<00:06:08.789> think

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
months so by the end of December I think

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.170 
months so by the end of December I think
it<00:06:09.060> should<00:06:09.210> be<00:06:09.240> pretty<00:06:09.539> well<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:12.060> know

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
it should be pretty well you know

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.519 
it should be pretty well you know
underway<00:06:12.750> to<00:06:12.810> being<00:06:14.870> as<00:06:15.870> close<00:06:16.110> as<00:06:16.289> I'm<00:06:16.409> gonna

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
underway to being as close as I'm gonna

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.659 
underway to being as close as I'm gonna
get<00:06:16.830> to<00:06:18.469> towards<00:06:19.469> where<00:06:19.680> I<00:06:19.710> left<00:06:19.979> off<00:06:20.219> before<00:06:20.430> I

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
get to towards where I left off before I

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.200 
get to towards where I left off before I
got<00:06:20.819> injured<00:06:21.089> then<00:06:21.870> I<00:06:21.900> have<00:06:22.169> to<00:06:22.349> you<00:06:22.919> know

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
got injured then I have to you know

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.100 
got injured then I have to you know
hopefully<00:06:24.210> by<00:06:24.449> then<00:06:24.569> I'll<00:06:24.719> have<00:06:24.870> a<00:06:24.900> few

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
hopefully by then I'll have a few

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.360 
hopefully by then I'll have a few
bullpen<00:06:25.529> sessions<00:06:25.889> in<00:06:26.009> I<00:06:26.219> have<00:06:26.819> bullpen<00:06:27.270> work
