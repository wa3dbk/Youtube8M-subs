you<00:01:04.920> need<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.280> PhD<00:01:05.970> flopper<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.869> unlock

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you need to have PhD flopper to unlock

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.480 
you need to have PhD flopper to unlock
the<00:01:07.290> ray<00:01:07.439> gun<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.250> bus

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the ray gun at the back of this bus

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
the ray gun at the back of this bus
right<00:01:08.760> okay<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.810> PhD

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
right okay and the way you get PhD

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 
right okay and the way you get PhD
flopper<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.490> dolphin<00:01:12.000> dive

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
flopper is you need to dolphin dive

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.660 
flopper is you need to dolphin dive
through<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.960> front<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> window<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.430> if

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
through the front of the window so if

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
through the front of the window so if
you<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:16.130> unlucky<00:01:17.130> unlucky<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
you go here that go unlucky unlucky it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.240 
you go here that go unlucky unlucky it
takes<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.299> couple<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.540> attempts<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.590> just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
takes a couple of attempts so go just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.550 
takes a couple of attempts so go just

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.760 
come on I'm rootin for Europe derp ah
not<00:01:29.610> very<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:31.880> derp<00:01:33.110> hmm

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.469 

right<00:01:37.770> okay<00:01:38.250> nevermind<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.270> need<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
right okay nevermind then we need to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
right okay nevermind then we need to
turn<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> power<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.439> map<00:01:40.650> first<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.009> need

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
turn the power on this map first we need

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
turn the power on this map first we need
to<00:01:41.130> turn<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> power<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.939> map<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
to turn the power on this map so if you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
to turn the power on this map so if you
see<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> free<00:01:43.860> boxes<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
see can you see the free boxes on the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
see can you see the free boxes on the
wall<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.780> there's<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.619> then

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
wall you see there's one there and then

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
wall you see there's one there and then
there's<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.270> there's<00:01:48.450> one

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there's one there and then there's one

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.630 
there's one there and then there's one
there<00:01:48.930> okay<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> power<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.430> aft

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
there okay so that's the power to aft

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
there okay so that's the power to aft
them<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> power<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.020> map

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
them off right it's a power to this map

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.399 
them off right it's a power to this map
so<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.820> each<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.390> these<00:01:54.540> go

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
so if you go up to each of these go

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.319 
so if you go up to each of these go
ahead<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> hold<00:01:56.430> X<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.909> you'll<00:01:57.030> turn<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
ahead and hold X and you'll turn the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.310 
ahead and hold X and you'll turn the
power<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:59.000> right<00:02:00.000> okay<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.869> i<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.049> that's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
power on right okay so i think that's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
power on right okay so i think that's
that<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.310> done<00:02:02.549> did<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> purple

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
that one done did you get like a purple

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.520 
that one done did you get like a purple
flashing<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.290> your<00:02:04.320> screen<00:02:04.439> Oh

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.200 

ok<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.560> got<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:11.950> online<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.490> let's<00:02:12.910> move<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.180> to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
ok I got it online so let's move on to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.580 
ok I got it online so let's move on to
the<00:02:13.300> next<00:02:13.360> one<00:02:13.570> should<00:02:14.290> be<00:02:14.350> done<00:02:16.410> ok<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.530> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the next one should be done ok and I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.220 
the next one should be done ok and I
think<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:17.800> took<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> power<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.640> one

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
think it took the power and for that one

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.920 
think it took the power and for that one
and<00:02:20.730> come<00:02:21.730> ahead<00:02:21.880> go<00:02:22.270> ahead<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.570> do<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.900> on

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
and come ahead go ahead and do it on

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.450 
and come ahead go ahead and do it on
this<00:02:23.050> last<00:02:23.200> one<00:02:23.320> over<00:02:23.500> here<00:02:23.620> over<00:02:23.770> here

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
you might want to try turning that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080 
you might want to try turning that
sensitivity<00:03:20.770> up<00:03:21.070> you're<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.580> bit<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.850> slow

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
sensitivity up you're a bit of a slow

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.470 
sensitivity up you're a bit of a slow
coach<00:03:22.330> like<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.660> slug<00:03:23.490> they're<00:03:24.490> very<00:03:24.850> dirty

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
coach like a slug they're very dirty

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.870 
coach like a slug they're very dirty
dirt<00:03:25.690> all<00:03:26.140> right<00:03:26.370> there<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.400> go<00:03:27.580> there<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.790> go

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
dirt all right there you go there you go

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.820 
dirt all right there you go there you go
all<00:03:28.240> right<00:03:28.390> ok<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.990> then<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.500> want<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.709> go

all right ok and then you want to go

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.440 
all right ok and then you want to go
prone<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.840> cruel<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:32.140> here<00:03:32.470> ok<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.610> then<00:03:34.330> when

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
prone and cruel up here ok and then when

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.820 
prone and cruel up here ok and then when
you<00:03:34.510> get<00:03:34.630> about<00:03:34.810> halfway<00:03:35.110> through<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.680> want

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
you get about halfway through you want

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.800 
you get about halfway through you want
to<00:03:35.890> say<00:03:36.010> i<00:03:36.040> am<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.340> slug<00:03:36.670> it's<00:03:37.240> voice-activated
