 set the speaker in the vehicle interior 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.630

 rear power body which will 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:37.590
 lean columns on brackets 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.899
 seat back mounts set 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.410
 wooden beam which will serve 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.410
 a prop 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:59.929
 on the crossbar of the body amplifier are put 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:07.740

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:13.799
 to wooden support in the rear shelf 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:17.580
 cutouts are important not to confuse with 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.299
 sizes that will look out 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.299
 speakers 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.429
 the shelf is also screwed wooden 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.830

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.780
 shelf inside 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.780
 it would be nice to glue noise insulation 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:53.539
 so that the noise and the trunk did not penetrate 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:59.420
 salon then speakers 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.420
 covered with regular false panels 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.830

 don't mess up the speakers 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.340
 the speakers themselves 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.819
 put the back seat in place and
