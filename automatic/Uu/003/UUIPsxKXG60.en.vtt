00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.780
 no no no no 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.620
 tonight 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.410
 hello everyone very good I'm not anne says 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.780
 and this is the second part of the tutorial 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.820
 how to record studio nfl guitar and good 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.630
 the engraving the second tutorial what 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.279
 equalized taught many things but not 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.740
 has been recorded correctly so 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.030
 well I have everything done and can not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.380
 teach all the steps so I'm going to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.060
 re-record this tutorial 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.100
 I am going to explain a little what I have 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.079
 According fact what I've done before 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 nothing like I said in the previous 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.280
 tutorial if we use qantas since 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.890
 I'm using now sing be for 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.930
 record that will occupy part of asia if you 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 activate then we will not work like this 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 or in the f the study if asia us 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.360
 it works in fl studio is because you're 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 using another program that is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.060
 occupying the sound of the computer 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.650
 well I've had a big shit that I've 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.930
 used like that while I was with him 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.970
 qantas already right now and has not been recorded 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.120
 the tutorial and it has given me a bug it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120
 has closed 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.899
 but good to equalize the guitar 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.579
 to mount the tracks and others we 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.500
 we would go audio settings and we would remove it 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.539
 urgently the if I had activated us 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.249
 me and I've put it in the controller that 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.799
 had by default the primary sound 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.719
 I'm not going to activate Lazio again 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.599
 because I would fuck the recording again 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.880
 well we would go back here again no we 

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.619
 I needed the ace I already once we have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.569
 recorded the guitar 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.709
 good here we had the guitar the channel 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.319
 of the guitar that we had in the 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.869
 number 1 and good I have removed him I have 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.480
 place 1 ne again that he has 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.880
 removed everything 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.160
 the guitar that we recorded with the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.320
 grasita of the mouse here in this section 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.910
 here I put him on channel number 3 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.890
 you can put the one you want but just 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.870
 at number 3 and the back in quiet 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.720
 put in the room according 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.690
 What I have done has been to equalize 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.660
 levels 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.780
 if you notice here we have the back in 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.040
 track that here the guitar sound almost 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.080
 at the same level 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 do not ever make this sound saturated 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.580
 sibal with the reds may sound good and 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.680
 powerful but the sound is broken and not 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.110
 it works I am a little the fool of the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.490
 class on the subject of equalization almost me 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.500
 has given very well but I will teach a 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.900
 little what I know 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.700
 and good you can find the best one is 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.390
 even about cabbage and change and so on 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.090
 but good my appearance 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.490
 good for example the guitar is not 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.480
 very well combined with the back in 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.030
 track with the rhythm 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.540
 for this we go to the alt key and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.830
 we can move it with precision according to 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.250
 until adjust it 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.200
 in the rhythm correctly I am at 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.670
 you and your ear this recording 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.330
 it's not very professional it's not very good anymore 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.620
 I said it's better to record with the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.750
 guitar to the amplifier and the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.530
 amplifier to the computer without using 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.170
 guitar rig no artificial vst always 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.540
 it will be much better and more professional the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.940
 back in track does not need to master it 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.230
 because it's mastered because it's not 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.840
 we have downloaded the internet what will be 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.220
 that equalize forgiveness meant the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.960
 term of poli afternoon policy and 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.880
 mastering two different terms 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.820
 equalize would equalize the channels 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.100
 each instrument and more direct would be 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.390
 master equalize the whole set of 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.370
 good blow so that this does not surpass 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.920
 if I remove the limiter 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.230
 set the levels are going to be taken by the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.420
 ass if we put the limiter on 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.000
 levels are left in a strip and not 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.580
 exceeds and added a limiter in 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.819
 both channels in the back emphasize the 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.950
 guitar 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.480
 what we do is the line 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.909
 of lilac color we have put it here 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.269
 and below a post the color line 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.770
 green so you create this set of that 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.690
 do not exceed the levels 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.910
 so that it does not get saturated in the color of 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.800
 agreement touching the same thing did with the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.630
 back in track we are going to make both 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.090
 clues because they usually on the same level 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.610
 for example for and joins correctly 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.720
 has added an equalizer has 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.720
 lowered the bass 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.800
 I 've done a little semi-serious 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.400
 a little bit the means and the highs very 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.400
 little 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.200
 and we would leave it that way as it is 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.330
 taught here you would not need to equalize 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.910
 nothing I would like the masters according 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.100
 in the shield we have a dominant 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.320
 of serious which elevates lowered because 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.140
 so that all the sounds do not sound good 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.260
 mixed sounds I've raised a bit 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.970
 quite the treble 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.639
 you stopped the instruments 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.499
 perfectly 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.469
 for example the guitar we could 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:05:00.740
 add effects like rivers that comes by 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:03.129
 flaw in the studio puts a little 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.129
 rivero 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.510
 it sounds really bad the truth I'm sorry I did not 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.100
 charges recording a lot 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.920
 I could have made it fit better 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.870
 with the back in track we can not 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.290
 add river plate everything we want 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.810
 be the post-production in the master by 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.240
 example I already taught you 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.850
 in the shield of q2 comes by default 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.190
 but you also have home 4 that this one 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.969
 no longer comes by default this is very 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.759
 well you buy it 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:36.549
 this plugin you buy it is very good 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:40.000
 because when activated 

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:43.930
 they teach us some prices 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.020
 those presets are already calculated for 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.900
 guitar and others then do the same 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.120
 but I will leave in the q2 that I have 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.110
 used to equalize all the 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.840
 channels together the mastering between the more 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.040
 close some 2 the 3 and the 4 what I've 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.560
 fact has been mastering all the 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.480
 agreement set do not confuse 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.070
 mastering with equalize are things 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.660
 different activities all equalize is 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.100
 regardless of everything something that 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.740
 they did not teach me the smarties of 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.510
 hispasonic and iván that they knew a lot and 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.460
 they did not know how to explain something so simple 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.850
 as the difference between equalize and 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.470
 master ignorant shit you are 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.150
 all ignorant shit 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.090
 masonic 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.390
 well up here this tutorial I hope 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.070
 I have served you 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.350
 maybe I left something forgotten 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.090
 well I want you to tell me if you have 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.500
 some doubt do not forget to comment me 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.250
 they send him a private or leave a 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.340
 commentary 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.560
 That lies you liked sharing it with 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.960
 the people who also need it this 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.200
 kind of tutorials wants to learn I think 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.420
 that has served you and I tell you that good 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.930
 my knowledge of equalization are not 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:59.260
 very good but good is what I understand 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.920
 so far of equalization I have more 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.510
 vein of the artistic and creative roll the 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.940
 true but equalization is one thing 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.710
 very dodgy for everyone that you have 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.860
 have good ears, good ones 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.960
 helmets to produce and lots of patience 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.380
 I hope you have served this tutorial 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.690
 see you in another tutorial and if you like 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.180
 none in particular ask me until the 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.410
 next subscribe for god alone is a
