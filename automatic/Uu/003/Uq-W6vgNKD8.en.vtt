00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so the galaxy s4 going up against the

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.269 
so the galaxy s4 going up against the
HTC<00:00:03.149> one<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.570> HTC<00:00:04.410> sweating<00:00:04.890> do<00:00:04.980> they<00:00:05.100> have<00:00:05.250> a

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
HTC one is HTC sweating do they have a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.220 
HTC one is HTC sweating do they have a
reason<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.850> be<00:00:05.970> nervous<00:00:06.210> well<00:00:06.960> we're<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.170> to

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
reason to be nervous well we're going to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.270 
reason to be nervous well we're going to
compare<00:00:07.560> them<00:00:07.740> right<00:00:07.859> now<00:00:08.010> let's<00:00:08.220> take<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.400> look

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.049 

the<00:00:14.280> big<00:00:14.429> difference<00:00:14.519> between<00:00:14.910> these<00:00:15.000> two

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the big difference between these two

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.120 
the big difference between these two
devices<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.719> choice<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.260> materials<00:00:16.740> we've<00:00:16.920> got

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
devices is choice of materials we've got

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.519 
devices is choice of materials we've got
metal<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.730> HTC<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.600> we've<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:18.960> plastic

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
metal on the HTC one we've got plastic

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710 
metal on the HTC one we've got plastic
on<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.770> galaxy<00:00:20.699> s4<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> galaxy<00:00:21.390> s4

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
on the galaxy s4 the galaxy s4

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.150 
on the galaxy s4 the galaxy s4
definitely<00:00:22.230> feels<00:00:22.470> thinner<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> hand

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
definitely feels thinner in the hand

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890 
definitely feels thinner in the hand
although<00:00:23.430> what<00:00:23.939> HTC<00:00:24.359> does<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
although what HTC does is kind of a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.150 
although what HTC does is kind of a
trick<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.320> we've<00:00:25.439> got<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> thinner<00:00:25.890> edge

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
trick here we've got a thinner edge

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
trick here we've got a thinner edge
which<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.820> thinner<00:00:27.060> than<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.449> edge<00:00:27.750> then

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
which is thinner than this edge then

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.450 
which is thinner than this edge then
it's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.619> bit<00:00:28.740> thicker<00:00:28.890> as<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.310> goes

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it's a little bit thicker as it goes

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.790 
it's a little bit thicker as it goes
back<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.939> feels<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.359> thin<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.710> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
back but it feels very thin when you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.620 
back but it feels very thin when you
pick<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> HTC<00:00:32.520> One<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.790> cold<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.510> your

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
pick up the HTC One it's cold in your

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.479 
pick up the HTC One it's cold in your
hand<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.079> metal<00:00:34.469> construction<00:00:35.340> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
hand it's that metal construction that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.970 
hand it's that metal construction that
feels<00:00:35.700> very<00:00:35.940> unique<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.320> galaxy<00:00:37.649> s4

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
feels very unique and on the galaxy s4

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.770 
feels very unique and on the galaxy s4
it's<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.730> expect<00:00:39.540> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it's kind of what you would expect with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.290 
it's kind of what you would expect with
a<00:00:39.930> galaxy<00:00:40.410> s3<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
a galaxy s3 so it's really up to you to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910 
a galaxy s3 so it's really up to you to
determine<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> metal<00:00:43.500> phone<00:00:43.680> do

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
determine do you want a metal phone do

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.889 
determine do you want a metal phone do
you<00:00:44.040> want<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> plastic<00:00:44.850> phone<00:00:45.030> once<00:00:45.539> definitely

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you want a plastic phone once definitely

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
you want a plastic phone once definitely
lighter<00:00:46.170> than<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> galaxy

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

s4<00:00:48.210> being<00:00:48.570> lighter<00:00:48.809> now<00:00:48.989> we've<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> larger

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
s4 being lighter now we've got a larger

power save on on the HTC One which dim
the<00:02:25.740> screen<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:28.050> at

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the screen so now that we have it at

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.740 
the screen so now that we have it at
true<00:02:28.650> maximum<00:02:29.550> screen<00:02:29.850> brightness<00:02:30.090> let's<00:02:30.630> go

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
true maximum screen brightness let's go

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.350 
true maximum screen brightness let's go
into<00:02:30.959> an<00:02:31.050> application<00:02:31.770> where<00:02:32.580> there<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.030> white

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
into an application where there is white

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.760 
into an application where there is white
space<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:34.080> kind<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.290> take<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.470> look<00:02:34.709> at

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
space so we can kind of take a look at

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.370 
space so we can kind of take a look at
the<00:02:34.860> difference<00:02:35.630> LCD<00:02:36.630> gives<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> brighter

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
the difference LCD gives you a brighter

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.740 
the difference LCD gives you a brighter
white<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:37.950> AMOLED<00:02:38.580> gives<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> darker

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
white but AMOLED gives you a darker

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.350 
white but AMOLED gives you a darker
black<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.380> all<00:02:40.500> kind<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.830> matters<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.580> what

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
black so it all kind of matters on what

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.820 
black so it all kind of matters on what
you're<00:02:42.540> looking<00:02:42.870> for<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.200> terms<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.530> screen

you're looking for in terms of screen

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.580 
you're looking for in terms of screen

the<00:02:58.080> page<00:02:58.290> HTC<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.850> doesn't<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.480> so

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
the page HTC one just doesn't do that so

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.259 
the page HTC one just doesn't do that so
overall<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.650> think<00:03:02.070> these<00:03:02.370> devices<00:03:02.760> are<00:03:02.940> really

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
overall I think these devices are really

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.520 
overall I think these devices are really
going<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.660> ahead<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> lot<00:03:04.350> of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
going to go ahead and I think a lot of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.020 
going to go ahead and I think a lot of
people<00:03:04.650> were<00:03:04.950> scared<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.340> HTC<00:03:05.580> was

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
people were scared I think HTC was

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.940 
people were scared I think HTC was
scared<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.600> galaxy<00:03:07.019> s4<00:03:07.320> would<00:03:07.470> blow<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.860> out

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
scared the galaxy s4 would blow it out

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.910 
scared the galaxy s4 would blow it out
of<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.190> water<00:03:08.370> with<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.300> galaxy<00:03:09.840> s4<00:03:10.410> but<00:03:10.830> you

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
of the water with the galaxy s4 but you

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.890 
of the water with the galaxy s4 but you
know<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.370> are<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.269> very<00:03:12.690> very

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
know these are going to be very very

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.140 
know these are going to be very very
strong<00:03:13.560> contenders<00:03:14.070> they're<00:03:14.430> very<00:03:14.670> different

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
strong contenders they're very different

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.970 
strong contenders they're very different
phones<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:16.110> that's<00:03:16.290> why<00:03:16.440> people

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
phones and I think that's why people

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.410 
phones and I think that's why people
will<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> tough<00:03:17.670> time<00:03:17.730> deciding<00:03:18.090> between

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
will have a tough time deciding between

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.570 
will have a tough time deciding between
them<00:03:18.720> we're<00:03:18.840> going<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.019> have<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.350> much<00:03:20.340> more

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
them we're going to have a much more

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.979 
them we're going to have a much more
deeper<00:03:20.880> comparison<00:03:21.390> than<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.630> quick<00:03:21.840> video
