00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
of traffic at the night time I stood

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
of traffic at the night time I stood
guard<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> realized<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.229> people

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
guard and realized that all these people

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.890 
guard and realized that all these people
are<00:01:22.680> probably<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> lives<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.509> they

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
are probably going to lives that they

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
are probably going to lives that they
didn't<00:01:25.140> choose<00:01:25.380> lives<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:25.920> want<00:01:26.220> but

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
didn't choose lives they don't want but

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
didn't choose lives they don't want but
they<00:01:26.490> find<00:01:26.759> reason<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> meaning<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:28.229> is
