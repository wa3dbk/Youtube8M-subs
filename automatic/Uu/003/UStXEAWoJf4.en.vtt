00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.099
 in each step we take is usually full 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.109
 of doubts like the first steps 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.629
 rose on the moon the future is uncertain 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.579
 certainly so changing no reason to 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.620
 ruin everything you planned before 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.600
 the hours are spent as if they were 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.760
 minutes the days are consumed without 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.159
 can you long in the eyes you're still good 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.839
 things then you take away problems 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.150
 they evaporate like alcohol in the throat 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.309
 the heat of the afternoon is the one that burns 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.739
 my ideas is the smoke of the cigar is the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.960
 that revives the night tide is the reflection 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.360
 and remorse to the mind but for the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.489
 tomorrow we are the same as always 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.939
 it is necessary to give flavor to things 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.409
 just like remembering a loving disappointment 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.750
 looking for treasures as workers in the 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.000
 same here about myself coming out of 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.320
 the routines and our crystals in 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.320
 way of thoughts 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.159
 to the eyes 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.680
 of the eyes and lose food 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.450
 we have the fear of taking bad 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.640
 decisions fabricated my destiny and I analyze 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.010
 my options that have confusions but 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.170
 challenge to be sensible and natural to find 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.120
 fill in the blank pages I'm not 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.280
 activist but active my senses 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.590
 we went ahead no matter how much this is 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.600
 fucked up the blows until 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.450
 we faint but for pride 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.760
 we ended up I enjoy the sound 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.250
 that comes out of my speakers the graphite that 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.650
 as grandma as turbosina seasoning 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.240
 these lines like Chinese food degrees 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.580
 of perfection that not everyone 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.010
 tip does not tip the scales like the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.440
 hurry tower rhymes cross borders what 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.599
 they needed visa ideas they travel fast 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.650
 for all these places like poison 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.239
 they inject today on social networks 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.239
 of thought form 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.590
 eye if we lose with the wind 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.959
 then being is in the form of 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 thoughts 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.730
 I take paragraphs what ever crisis you 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.740
 relaxes neurons with the aroma of a 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.900
 hitler puts the sound and that 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.240
 Feel for my strength I give you a home 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.980
 like taking absinthe drinks inside 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.459
 this effort maybe there is still evil 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.840
 my sins float like those of pennywise 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.390
 he wrote what is your work time 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.209
 complete will cause the ecstasy as if 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.110
 outside sex I raise my fist to the style of 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.150
 a pastel plan 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.100
 here there are no enabling limits 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.290
 hacker wakes up on the board that you 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.150
 kingdom overthrows an imperial flower 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.950
 marking the course to red and yellow 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.730
 Charles Chaplin My victories in 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.590
 silence 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.630
 I am a lost chest that keeps many 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.940
 secrets some talk a lot while 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.770

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.330
 like the tall sword 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.330
 of thought form 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.650
 for the eyes and lose ourselves in the abyss 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.030
 in the form of thoughts 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.310
 close your eyes and missing the attempt 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.670
 how nice
