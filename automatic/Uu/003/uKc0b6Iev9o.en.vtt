to find out if their prediction was

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.319 
to find out if their prediction was
right<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:43.020> drilling<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:43.469> exploration<00:00:43.829> well

but<00:00:51.090> drilling<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.539> well<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> complicated

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
but drilling a well is a complicated

in<00:01:32.640> addition<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.810> site<00:01:34.049> survey<00:01:34.500> has<00:01:34.710> shown

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
in addition the site survey has shown

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890 
in addition the site survey has shown
that<00:01:35.130> corals<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.939> present<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> seabed

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that corals are present on the seabed

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
that corals are present on the seabed
and<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.700> decided<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and because of this we have decided to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.020 
and because of this we have decided to
change<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.990> location<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.340> see

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
change the location for the well I see

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.280 
change the location for the well I see
anything<00:01:42.869> else

anything else

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
anything else
there<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.340> several<00:01:44.700> critical

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
there are several critical

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
there are several critical
specifications<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> taken

this one is all the necessary features

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.870 
this one is all the necessary features
it<00:02:37.500> might<00:02:37.710> be<00:02:37.830> one<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.130> most<00:02:38.220> expensive

it might be one of the most expensive
but<00:02:39.360> meeting<00:02:39.570> specifications<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.590> more

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
but meeting specifications is more

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.740 
but meeting specifications is more
important<00:02:41.160> than<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.340> cost<00:02:41.580> will<00:02:42.330> go<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:42.660> this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
important than the cost will go for this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.700

the<00:05:16.729> first<00:05:16.970> thing<00:05:17.150> we<00:05:17.270> do<00:05:17.449> is<00:05:17.840> close<00:05:18.110> the

the first thing we do is close the

the first thing we do is close the
blowout<00:05:18.470> preventer<00:05:19.060> we<00:05:20.060> then<00:05:20.270> increase<00:05:20.900> the

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
blowout preventer we then increase the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.570 
blowout preventer we then increase the
density<00:05:21.199> of<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.680> drilling<00:05:21.889> fluid<00:05:22.280> and

gas and the drilling fluid are then

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.110 
gas and the drilling fluid are then
separated<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.680> gas<00:05:27.860> is<00:05:28.069> vented<00:05:28.430> out<00:05:28.580> and

thanks to the detailed planning carried
out<00:05:46.759> before<00:05:46.940> the<00:05:47.240> operation<00:05:47.629> the<00:05:48.229> team<00:05:48.440> knew

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
out before the operation the team knew

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.870 
out before the operation the team knew
exactly<00:05:49.069> what<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.610> do<00:05:49.789> to<00:05:49.819> regain<00:05:50.330> control

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
exactly what to do to regain control

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.450 
exactly what to do to regain control
finally<00:05:52.880> we<00:05:53.509> reach<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.900> reservoir<00:05:54.220> it<00:05:55.220> looks

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
finally we reach the reservoir it looks

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.610 
finally we reach the reservoir it looks
like<00:05:55.669> this<00:05:55.909> one<00:05:56.150> contains<00:05:56.539> a<00:05:56.720> lot<00:05:57.050> of<00:05:57.229> oil<00:05:57.380> and

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
like this one contains a lot of oil and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.279 
like this one contains a lot of oil and
gas<00:05:57.940> as<00:05:58.940> we<00:05:59.150> drill<00:05:59.449> through<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.840> reservoir<00:06:00.199> to

the last thing to do is plug in a band
in<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.530> well<00:06:18.710> we<00:06:19.009> plug<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:19.940> well<00:06:20.090> using

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
in the well we plug the well using

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.469

proved that the earth scientists were

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.649 
proved that the earth scientists were
right<00:07:07.379> and<00:07:07.770> now<00:07:08.129> have<00:07:08.460> concrete<00:07:08.940> evidence<00:07:09.240> of

right and now have concrete evidence of

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:11.899 
right and now have concrete evidence of
where<00:07:09.930> the<00:07:10.110> oil<00:07:10.139> and<00:07:10.440> gas<00:07:10.560> reservoir<00:07:11.159> is<00:07:11.340> the

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909 
where the oil and gas reservoir is the

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.300 
where the oil and gas reservoir is the
next<00:07:12.240> step<00:07:12.419> is<00:07:12.840> to<00:07:13.080> extract<00:07:13.590> the<00:07:13.680> oil<00:07:13.919> and<00:07:14.099> gas

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
next step is to extract the oil and gas

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.670 
next step is to extract the oil and gas
from<00:07:14.520> the<00:07:14.669> reservoir<00:07:15.030> join<00:07:15.840> me<00:07:16.020> next<00:07:16.169> time<00:07:16.349> and

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
from the reservoir join me next time and

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.849 
from the reservoir join me next time and
I'll<00:07:17.129> show<00:07:17.159> you<00:07:17.430> how
