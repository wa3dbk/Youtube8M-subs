00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 And then, folks, we 're going to be there today. 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.610
 talking about the displacement technique 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.070
 in octaves she is very interesting 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.620
 because it is for you to walk in the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.020
 arm of the instrument and so that you 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.779
 can you amend a scale drawing 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.699
 in the other a chip in the other we will get 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.150
 basis of our study today in this 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.349
 here chip the open shape on the tondela 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.349
 typing three notes per strings 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.410
 who thinks you have three groups of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.570
 grades 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.570
 Let's count it until 6 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 6 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:04.190
 again is is three groups each group with 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 six notes only who 3 and 3 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.650
 So you're going to do the following, will you? 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.440
 pick up this first pattern and 8th and 8th 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.300
 again 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.000
 realize you've come from here until 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.050
 You have practically passed a two 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.050
 three regions 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.820
 and you can make your way back 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:34.539
 also there you say the following then and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.190
 with this pattern here of the same thing 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:49.460
 only now you have the option to go or 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:52.009
 They already came back and it 's very cool here too. 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.280
 This is very cool here, not only for 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:00.770
 standards fast but also for you 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.000
 one drawing on the other 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.130
 one region to the next 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.619
 especially if you are a beginner and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.290
 has not yet been able to decorate all 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.329
 drawings or go from a shape of a region 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.690
 for the other is a very 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:17.290
 interesting is the cool thing is that it is 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.530
 easy for you to visualize this here 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.489
 I realize that the standard O where is my 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.130
 Finger 2 will see my finger 1 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.470
 the only change will be here at O 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.870
 following the pitch of the string is then 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.790
 You're going to have to come home. 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.870
 ok realize people that drawing is 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.239
 always the same the drawing will not change 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.730
 because the notes are the same 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.549
 you simply locate the tonic as a point 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.100
 in this case, right here. 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.739
 it gets super simple look the grades will be 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.739
 always the same 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.739
 over there 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:06.400
 if our boys re my f 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:18.620
 I jumped here again, there, there, there. 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.210
 new with a little training this 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.030
 here it becomes easy for you 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.820
 making in all designs and illogical 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.010
 try to do and if this idea 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.990
 other drawings in the pentatonic 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.350
 very cool, too 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.160
 and it's just split the pattern every two 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.170
 ropes 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.270
 Okay, so I hope you liked it. 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.270
 A hug and see you tomorrow
