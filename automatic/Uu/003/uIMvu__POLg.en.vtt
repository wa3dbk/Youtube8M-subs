00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 the stirling engine was invented in 1816 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.740
 by Robert Sterling the goal was 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
 have a less dangerous engine than 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 steam engine the principle of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.099
 operation is the work done by 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 the expansion and contraction of a gas at 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.090
 be forced to follow a cycle of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.279
 cooling in a cold bulb with which 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.220
 it contracts and warms up in a focus 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.109
 hot with which it expands that is to say 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.970
 the presence of a 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.970
 temperature difference between two 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 spotlights and it's a thermal engine the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 Stirling engine is the only one capable of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 Approaching maximum performance 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.559
 theoretical known as performance of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 coal so as far as 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.969
 performance of thermal engines is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 refers is the best option suitable 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.110
 warn that it would serve as an engine for 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.539
 car because although its performance is 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 higher its power is lower and the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.460
 optimal performance is only achieved at 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.440
 low speeds I hope that still 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.250
 someone is awake up to this point 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.520
 Well let's continue now I will explain the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.159
 different types of stirling engine 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.049
 high this type of engine does not use 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.600
 displacer as in the original patent 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.520
 of stirling but from the point of view 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.020
 thermodynamic operation is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 similar was designed by leader in usa 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 It consists of two independent cylinders 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 connected by a tube in which it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.580
 places the regenerator that stores and transfers 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.710
 the heat in each of the cylinders 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.650
 there is a piston that moves 90 degrees 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 out of phase with the other one of the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.280
 cylinders is heated by a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.890
 gas or alcohol lighter and the other one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.990
 cooled by alerts or water the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.000
 mismatch between the two pistons makes 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.549
 the air passes from one cylinder to another 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 warming up cooling down and performing the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.159
 work that allows the operation 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.710
 of the beta engine the original engine of 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.930
 stirling was of this type consists of a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.810
 cylinder with a hot zone by 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.509
 a gas burner alcohol etcetera a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.870
 cold zone cooled by fins water 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.610
 etc 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.800
 inside the cylinder is the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.360
 displacer whose mission is to pass the air 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.510
 from the cold zone to the hot zone and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.550
 vice versa, small engines do not usually 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.200
 get regenerator only one 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.570
 Slack of a few tenths of a millimeter 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.390
 between the displacer and the cylinder for 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.220
 allow engines to pass through the air 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.350
 large usually carry a regenerator 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.180
 externally through which the air must pass in 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.210
 your way from the cold to the hot zone 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.220
 interest from the point of view 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.350
 thermodynamic is the most effective engine 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.270
 but its construction is complicated already 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.370
 that the piston must have two batteries and 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.370
 allow the passage of the rod that moves 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.350
 the displaced there is another type of engine more 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.010
 which is the gamma but it gives me egg 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.010
 explain it
