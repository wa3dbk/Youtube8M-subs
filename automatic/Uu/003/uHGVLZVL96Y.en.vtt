00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.690 

know<00:00:00.659> that<00:00:03.830> there<00:00:04.830> there's<00:00:05.310> two<00:00:05.370> different

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
know that there there's two different

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.950 
know that there there's two different
probes<00:00:06.230> that<00:00:07.230> when<00:00:08.150> when<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> five<00:00:09.450> pin<00:00:09.690> falls

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
probes that when when the five pin falls

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.120 
probes that when when the five pin falls
in<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.759> if<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.940> probes<00:00:12.210> are<00:00:12.389> walking<00:00:13.130> it

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
in that if the probes are walking it

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.959 
in that if the probes are walking it
won't<00:00:14.370> drop<00:00:14.610> it

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
won't drop it

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.630 
won't drop it
that's<00:00:15.330> all<00:00:15.570> right<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.190> probe<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
that's all right now the one probe is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.130 
that's all right now the one probe is
going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.060> down<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.750> deck<00:00:18.960> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
going to be down because the deck is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
going to be down because the deck is
full<00:00:19.380> there's<00:00:19.980> another<00:00:20.310> probe<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.119> tells<00:00:21.420> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
full there's another probe that tells it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.890 
full there's another probe that tells it
when<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> deck<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.289> down<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:23.160> zero<00:00:23.760> how<00:00:24.750> many

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
when the deck is down from zero how many

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
when the deck is down from zero how many
pins<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.410> Terry<00:00:25.650> well<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.519> run<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:26.880> 22

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
pins is this Terry well we run with 22

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
pins is this Terry well we run with 22
22<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.050> couldn't<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> mmm

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
22 you couldn't do that with a mmm

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030 
22 you couldn't do that with a mmm
now<00:00:30.170> how<00:00:31.170> maybe<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.830> would<00:00:31.920> ease

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
now how maybe you could it would ease

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.750 
now how maybe you could it would ease
rattled<00:00:32.460> around<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> wheel<00:00:34.190> has<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.370> whole

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
rattled around in the wheel has a whole

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.000 
rattled around in the wheel has a whole
don't<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.870> exactly

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:01:16.410 

but<00:00:43.430> now<00:00:43.550> if<00:00:50.530> all<00:00:51.530> right<00:00:51.739> knows<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.670> GMO

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:02:12.370 

different

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.050 

all<00:02:13.790> touring<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.910> part<00:02:15.240> here<00:02:16.910> all<00:02:17.910> right

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
all touring this part here all right

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.700 
all touring this part here all right
that's<00:02:18.600> all<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.870> brain<00:02:21.530> lowered<00:02:22.530> you're

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
that's all the brain lowered you're

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.680 
that's all the brain lowered you're
gonna<00:02:22.800> see<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.280> dip<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.300> kind<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.170> turn

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
gonna see this dip in here kind of turn

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.530 
gonna see this dip in here kind of turn
that<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.840> turn<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:28.470> right<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:30.240> then<00:02:30.420> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
that one turn in there right and then it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.199 
that one turn in there right and then it
comes<00:02:30.750> back<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.590> all<00:02:31.740> based<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.250> deck

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
comes back up it's all based on deck

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.270 
comes back up it's all based on deck
like<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:34.140> all<00:02:34.230> runoff<00:02:34.560> cams<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.070> years

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
like so it's all runoff cams and years

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.320 
like so it's all runoff cams and years
basically<00:02:35.520> yeah<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.240> timing<00:02:36.660> yeah<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:39.270> know

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
basically yeah all timing yeah you know

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.620 
basically yeah all timing yeah you know
I<00:02:39.360> talked<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.110> split-second<00:02:41.100> timing

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
I talked about like split-second timing

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.140 
I talked about like split-second timing
this<00:02:42.630> here<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.230> rod<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.890> see<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.640> hook<00:02:44.940> up

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
this here this rod here see that hook up

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.500 
this here this rod here see that hook up
there

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
there

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.290 
there
that's<00:02:45.690> what<00:02:45.900> pulls<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.320> sweet<00:02:46.850> it's<00:02:47.850> going<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
that's what pulls it sweet it's going to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.290 
that's what pulls it sweet it's going to
go<00:02:48.470> it's<00:02:49.470> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.830> go<00:02:49.920> forward<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:51.000> hook

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
go it's going to go forward and not hook

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.260 
go it's going to go forward and not hook
then<00:02:52.110> go<00:02:52.230> forward<00:02:52.650> again<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:52.950> pluck<00:02:56.060> now<00:02:57.060> it's

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
then go forward again and pluck now it's

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.580 
then go forward again and pluck now it's
going<00:02:57.450> to<00:03:02.000> okay<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.270> that's<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.630> second

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
going to okay and that's all second

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.330 
going to okay and that's all second
time<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:05.010> definitely<00:03:06.769> they<00:03:07.769> would<00:03:07.920> try<00:03:08.310> to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
time is definitely they would try to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:27.030 
time is definitely they would try to
pull<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.790> right<00:03:08.970> back

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.500 

the<00:03:28.040> machine<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.549> mean<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:28.940> put<00:03:29.060> any<00:03:29.239> math

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
the machine I mean you can put any math

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.900 
the machine I mean you can put any math
right
