quiz<00:00:06.839> six<00:00:07.049> number<00:00:07.440> 13<00:00:07.940> here<00:00:08.940> we're<00:00:09.090> asked<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
quiz six number 13 here we're asked to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.709 
quiz six number 13 here we're asked to
simplify<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:10.290> key<00:00:10.800> route<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.519> has<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:12.030> number

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
simplify a key route that has a number

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.640 
simplify a key route that has a number
and<00:00:12.929> also<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.320> variable<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.040> inside<00:00:14.540> so

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
and also a variable on the inside so

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.540 
and also a variable on the inside so
because<00:00:16.650> we're<00:00:16.800> dealing<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> cube<00:00:17.460> root

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
because we're dealing with the cube root

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.429 
because we're dealing with the cube root
the<00:00:18.359> first<00:00:18.600> thing<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.289> take

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the first thing you want to do is take

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.920 
the first thing you want to do is take
the<00:00:19.590> number<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.359> let's<00:00:21.359> make<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> work<00:00:21.750> space

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the number and let's make a work space

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.230 
the number and let's make a work space
over<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:23.750> take<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> number<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.260> 70<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
over here take the number to 70 and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
over here take the number to 70 and
break<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> down<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.920> product<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
break it down so that it's a product of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.179 
break it down so that it's a product of
two<00:00:30.449> numbers<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.230> which<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> highest

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
two numbers one of which is the highest

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.180 
two numbers one of which is the highest
possible<00:00:32.790> cube<00:00:33.030> root<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.390> could<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:34.130> now<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
possible cube root you could have now to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.560 
possible cube root you could have now to
70<00:00:36.000> factors<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.690> nicely<00:00:36.960> into<00:00:37.350> 27<00:00:37.950> times<00:00:38.160> 10

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
70 factors down nicely into 27 times 10

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.900 
70 factors down nicely into 27 times 10
well<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.930> works<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.290> well<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:40.790> 27<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
well that works out well because 27 is a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.100 
well that works out well because 27 is a
perfect<00:00:42.300> cube<00:00:42.469> cube<00:00:43.469> root<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> twenty-seven

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
perfect cube cube root of twenty-seven

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.950 
perfect cube cube root of twenty-seven
is<00:00:46.110> 3<00:00:46.700> now<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.120> didn't<00:00:48.360> work<00:00:48.480> out<00:00:48.719> on

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is 3 now if that one didn't work out on

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720 
is 3 now if that one didn't work out on
the<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:49.410> factoring<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> would<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.579> try

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the first factoring I would just try

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
the first factoring I would just try
other<00:00:50.969> factoring<00:00:51.510> zuv<00:00:51.660> 270<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.010> i

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
other factoring zuv 270 and see what i

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.750 
other factoring zuv 270 and see what i
could<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> work<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> 270<00:00:56.370> i'm<00:00:56.610> going

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
could get to work out so 270 i'm going

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.020 
could get to work out so 270 i'm going
to<00:00:56.850> rewrite<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:59.210> 27<00:01:00.210> times<00:01:01.050> 10<00:01:01.760> now<00:01:02.760> i<00:01:02.789> also

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
to rewrite it as 27 times 10 now i also

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.640 
to rewrite it as 27 times 10 now i also
want<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> rewrite<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.960> X<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.439> eighth

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
want to rewrite the X to the eighth

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.090 
want to rewrite the X to the eighth
power<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:06.140> again<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> rewrite<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
power and again I want to rewrite it so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.679 
power and again I want to rewrite it so
that<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> perfect<00:01:09.360> cube<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.510> i

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that I have a perfect cube so if i

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
that I have a perfect cube so if i
rewrite<00:01:13.610> X<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:14.970> 8th<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.650> X<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> six

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
rewrite X to the 8th as X to the six

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
rewrite X to the 8th as X to the six
times<00:01:17.880> x<00:01:18.150> squared<00:01:19.820> this<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.659> X<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
times x squared this right here X to the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.350 
times x squared this right here X to the
6<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> perfect<00:01:23.130> cube<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:24.030> remember

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
6 is a perfect cube because remember

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.730 
6 is a perfect cube because remember
when<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> variable<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.560> an

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
when you have a variable with an

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.410 
when you have a variable with an
exponent<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:27.570> cube<00:01:27.990> root<00:01:28.490> divides<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
exponent the cube root divides the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.540 
exponent the cube root divides the
exponent<00:01:34.189> by<00:01:35.189> three

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
exponent by three

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.070 
exponent by three
alright<00:01:38.550> so<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.760> cube<00:01:39.030> root<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> x<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.630> 6th

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
alright so the cube root of x to the 6th

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.660 
alright so the cube root of x to the 6th
is<00:01:40.260> X<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.980> 6<00:01:41.820> divided<00:01:42.180> by<00:01:42.240> 3<00:01:42.300> or<00:01:42.660> x<00:01:43.080> squared

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
is X to the 6 divided by 3 or x squared

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.880 
is X to the 6 divided by 3 or x squared
if<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.850> had<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> square<00:01:45.210> root<00:01:45.330> in<00:01:45.540> said<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.710> would

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
if I had a square root in said it would

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340 
if I had a square root in said it would
be<00:01:47.010> 6<00:01:47.580> divided<00:01:47.970> by<00:01:48.000> 2<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.780> whatever<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.200> root

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
be 6 divided by 2 so whatever the root

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.590 
be 6 divided by 2 so whatever the root
is<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.980> divide<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.340> exponent<00:01:50.490> by<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:53.600> so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
is you divide the exponent by that so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
is you divide the exponent by that so
I'm<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.870> to<00:01:54.990> rewrite<00:01:55.140> X<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.770> 8th<00:01:55.980> as<00:01:56.250> X

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
I'm going to rewrite X to the 8th as X

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640 
I'm going to rewrite X to the 8th as X
to<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:56.940> 6th<00:01:57.450> because<00:01:58.080> that's<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.380> highest

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
to the 6th because that's the highest

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.300 
to the 6th because that's the highest
cube<00:01:59.100> root<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.370> can<00:01:59.550> make<00:02:00.590> with<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> leftover

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
cube root I can make with the leftover

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.090 
cube root I can make with the leftover
of<00:02:02.520> x<00:02:02.790> squared<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.440> identify<00:02:08.040> the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
of x squared and then identify the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.960 
of x squared and then identify the
perfect<00:02:08.640> cube<00:02:08.850> root<00:02:09.050> 27<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:11.160> X<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.550> sixth

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
perfect cube root 27 and X to the sixth

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
perfect cube root 27 and X to the sixth
they're<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.960> come<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.440> cube

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they're going to come out of the cube
