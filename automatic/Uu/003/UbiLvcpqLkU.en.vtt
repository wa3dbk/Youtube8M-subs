00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
package sort side i'm not a big fan of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.460 
package sort side i'm not a big fan of
sword<00:02:21.370> side<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.910> don't<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:22.960> it's<00:02:23.050> worth<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
sword side I don't think it's worth it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.690 
sword side I don't think it's worth it
but<00:02:23.740> uh<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.790> works<00:02:25.060> sometimes<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:29.700> getting

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
but uh it works sometimes so getting

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.100 
but uh it works sometimes so getting
control<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.210> green<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.630> cameras<00:02:31.930> out<00:02:32.080> of

control of the green and cameras out of
Matt<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.850> most<00:02:34.030> important<00:02:34.420> thing

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.890 

Rockets<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:38.920> become<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.340> soon<00:02:39.900> unfortunately

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
Rockets can become up soon unfortunately

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.460 
Rockets can become up soon unfortunately
they<00:02:41.050> actually<00:02:41.380> dirtied<00:02:41.800> earlier<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:44.170> dirty

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
they actually dirtied earlier to dirty

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.070 
they actually dirtied earlier to dirty
the<00:02:44.650> Rockets<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.310> when<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.330> pick<00:02:46.540> them<00:02:46.690> up<00:02:46.840> in

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
the Rockets is when you pick them up in

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.050 
the Rockets is when you pick them up in
the<00:02:47.500> air<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:47.920> immediately<00:02:48.340> as<00:02:48.640> they<00:02:48.670> spawn

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
the air right immediately as they spawn

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.390 
the air right immediately as they spawn
and<00:02:49.410> what<00:02:50.410> happens<00:02:50.740> is<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.980> messes<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
and what happens is it messes up the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.330 
and what happens is it messes up the
spawn<00:02:51.730> time<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.500> Rockets<00:02:53.860> usually<00:02:54.130> spawn

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
spawn time and the Rockets usually spawn

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.180 
spawn time and the Rockets usually spawn
a<00:02:54.370> lot<00:02:54.580> later<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:56.200> Rockets<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.740> order<00:02:56.980> for

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
a lot later the Rockets in order for

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.490 
a lot later the Rockets in order for
them<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.340> be<00:02:57.459> reset<00:02:58.030> or<00:02:58.240> to<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:59.110> their<00:02:59.260> spawn

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
them to be reset or to have their spawn

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.410 
them to be reset or to have their spawn
time<00:02:59.709> counter<00:03:00.040> go<00:03:00.160> down<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.550> they<00:03:01.209> have<00:03:01.300> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
time counter go down is they have to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.390 
time counter go down is they have to
stop<00:03:01.660> moving<00:03:02.050> they've<00:03:02.350> become<00:03:02.650> stationary<00:03:02.890> so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
stop moving they've become stationary so

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.370

either the Rockets on the ground becomes

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.830 
either the Rockets on the ground becomes
stationary<00:03:05.590> or<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.820> your<00:03:07.030> hand<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.510> stop

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.600 
you can run it through green you know
you're<00:03:35.830> probably<00:03:36.010> going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.459> all<00:03:36.580> the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
you're probably going to get it all the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.729 
you're probably going to get it all the
way<00:03:36.760> back<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.030> your<00:03:37.180> green<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.780> it's<00:03:38.470> pretty

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
way back to your green and it's pretty

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.110 
way back to your green and it's pretty
easy<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.010> guard<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> mean<00:03:42.430> if<00:03:42.550> you<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:42.730> you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
easy to guard so I mean if you if you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.580 
easy to guard so I mean if you if you
guys<00:03:43.239> don't<00:03:43.390> know<00:03:43.570> there's<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.870> jump<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.410> you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
guys don't know there's a jump that you

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.390 
guys don't know there's a jump that you
can<00:03:44.800> go<00:03:44.950> all<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.640> way<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:47.130> from<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> platform

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
can go all the way to from the platform

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.280 
can go all the way to from the platform
into<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.880> green<00:03:49.120> with<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.360> flag<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:50.050> i'd

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
into the green with the flag so i'd

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.009 
into the green with the flag so i'd
recommend<00:03:50.440> learning<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.130> job<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.780> there<00:03:52.930> we

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
recommend learning that job and there we

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.100 
recommend learning that job and there we
go<00:03:53.050> playing<00:03:53.769> defense<00:03:54.220> i<00:03:54.840> managed<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.900> pick<00:03:56.019> up

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
go playing defense i managed to pick up

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.390 
go playing defense i managed to pick up
a<00:03:56.170> triple<00:03:56.470> kill<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.769> now<00:03:56.799> we're<00:03:57.010> back<00:03:57.130> on<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
a triple kill and now we're back on the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.820 
a triple kill and now we're back on the
offense

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.160 

the<00:04:01.670> time<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.120> go<00:04:02.210> for<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.420> counter<00:04:02.690> cap<00:04:02.870> in

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
the time to go for a counter cap in

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.950 
the time to go for a counter cap in
these<00:04:03.410> games<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:04.220> kind<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.270> moment<00:04:05.660> that

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
these games is kind of a moment that

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.690 
these games is kind of a moment that
it's<00:04:06.440> kind<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.710> an<00:04:06.830> intuitive<00:04:07.250> moment<00:04:07.610> you

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
it's kind of an intuitive moment you

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.490 
it's kind of an intuitive moment you
kind<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.970> have<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.150> just<00:04:08.240> think<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.780> on<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.290> fly

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
kind of have to just think it on the fly

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.630 
kind of have to just think it on the fly
I<00:04:09.530> mean<00:04:09.770> if<00:04:09.860> you're<00:04:09.980> on<00:04:10.100> their<00:04:10.280> side<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.550> the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
I mean if you're on their side of the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.260 
I mean if you're on their side of the
base<00:04:10.850> either<00:04:11.510> side<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.960> map<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:13.640> see

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
base either side of the map and you see

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.580 
base either side of the map and you see
that<00:04:14.390> your<00:04:14.540> teammates<00:04:14.840> are<00:04:14.990> killing<00:04:15.260> them<00:04:15.380> or

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
that your teammates are killing them or

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.470 
that your teammates are killing them or
you<00:04:15.680> kind<00:04:15.890> of<00:04:15.920> notice<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.940> you're<00:04:17.090> all<00:04:17.209> alone

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
you kind of notice that you're all alone

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.060 
you kind of notice that you're all alone
and<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:18.260> just<00:04:18.350> have<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.530> good<00:04:18.650> feeling<00:04:18.709> about

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
and you just have a good feeling about

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.710 
and you just have a good feeling about
it<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:19.549> mean<00:04:19.790> that's<00:04:19.940> that's<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.450> time<00:04:20.600> to

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
it I mean that's that's the time to

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.840 
it I mean that's that's the time to
counter<00:04:20.959> cat<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.410> mean<00:04:22.160> it's<00:04:22.310> really<00:04:22.550> up<00:04:22.670> to<00:04:22.760> the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
counter cat I mean it's really up to the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.550 
counter cat I mean it's really up to the
instincts<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.420> player<00:04:26.260> right<00:04:27.260> way<00:04:27.380> there

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
instincts of the player right way there

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.430 
instincts of the player right way there
oh<00:04:27.590> they're<00:04:27.950> all<00:04:28.040> in<00:04:28.160> our<00:04:28.250> camo<00:04:28.580> green<00:04:28.820> and

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
oh they're all in our camo green and

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.660 
oh they're all in our camo green and
they're<00:04:30.440> trying<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.710> control<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.430> side<00:04:31.640> of

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
they're trying to control that side of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.550 
they're trying to control that side of
the<00:04:31.730> map<00:04:31.910> luckily<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.600> think<00:04:32.990> Carlos<00:04:33.290> got<00:04:33.530> a

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
the map luckily I think Carlos got a

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.470 
the map luckily I think Carlos got a
kill<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.070> I'm<00:04:34.640> native<00:04:34.970> got<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.120> pretty<00:04:35.300> sweet

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
kill and I'm native got a pretty sweet

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.690 
kill and I'm native got a pretty sweet
he'll<00:04:35.780> stop<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:36.920> rush<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.400> then<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.640> one

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
he'll stop that rush and then this one

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.150 
he'll stop that rush and then this one
native<00:04:38.330> side<00:04:38.540> strong<00:04:38.870> side<00:04:39.200> he's<00:04:39.950> got<00:04:40.130> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
native side strong side he's got the

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.870 
native side strong side he's got the
rockets<00:04:40.670> and<00:04:40.910> uh<00:04:41.770> at<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:42.980> point<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.520> remember

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
rockets and uh at this point I remember

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.780 
rockets and uh at this point I remember
thinking<00:04:45.220> we're<00:04:46.220> probably<00:04:46.400> going<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.700> play

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
thinking we're probably going to play

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.390 
thinking we're probably going to play
defense<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.420> next<00:04:47.630> minute<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:48.110> mean<00:04:48.890> we've

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
defense to the next minute I mean we've

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.980 
defense to the next minute I mean we've
been<00:04:49.430> managing<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:50.180> stop<00:04:50.480> him<00:04:50.660> on<00:04:50.780> all<00:04:50.870> their

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
been managing to stop him on all their

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.140 
been managing to stop him on all their
flag<00:04:51.200> runs<00:04:51.410> so<00:04:51.590> far<00:04:51.880> probably<00:04:52.880> not<00:04:52.940> be<00:04:53.090> the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
flag runs so far probably not be the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.880 
flag runs so far probably not be the
best<00:04:53.330> idea<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.840> just<00:04:54.020> charge<00:04:54.290> them<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:54.740> try<00:04:54.860> to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
best idea to just charge them and try to

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.460 
best idea to just charge them and try to
go<00:04:55.070> on<00:04:55.220> like<00:04:55.460> an<00:04:55.700> all-out<00:04:55.910> attack<00:04:56.300> maybe<00:04:57.260> get

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
go on like an all-out attack maybe get

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.660 
go on like an all-out attack maybe get
caught<00:04:57.650> off<00:04:57.800> guard<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.250> have<00:04:58.370> them<00:04:58.490> run<00:04:58.610> a

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
caught off guard and have them run a

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.470 
caught off guard and have them run a
flag<00:04:58.940> back<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:01.670> I'm<00:05:01.790> kind<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.090> I'm<00:05:02.240> not<00:05:02.360> going

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
flag back so I'm kind of I'm not going

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.420 
flag back so I'm kind of I'm not going
to<00:05:02.540> be<00:05:02.630> charging<00:05:03.020> down<00:05:03.170> camo<00:05:03.440> kind<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.190> staying

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
to be charging down camo kind of staying

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.030 
to be charging down camo kind of staying
back<00:05:05.200> natives<00:05:06.200> doing<00:05:06.380> this<00:05:06.440> thing<00:05:06.650> over<00:05:06.890> there

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
back natives doing this thing over there

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.640 
back natives doing this thing over there
so<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.640> mean<00:05:08.450> we'll<00:05:08.720> let<00:05:08.870> him<00:05:09.020> distract<00:05:09.380> them

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
so I mean we'll let him distract them

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.020 
so I mean we'll let him distract them
but<00:05:09.860> me<00:05:09.980> and<00:05:10.100> Carlos<00:05:10.430> probably<00:05:10.730> gonna<00:05:10.820> sit

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
but me and Carlos probably gonna sit

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.540 
but me and Carlos probably gonna sit
back<00:05:11.180> here<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.450> play<00:05:11.600> defense<00:05:12.280> it's<00:05:13.280> working

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
back here and play defense it's working

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.500 
back here and play defense it's working
out<00:05:13.610> for<00:05:13.850> us<00:05:15.520> there<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:16.790> jump<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.240> wasn't
