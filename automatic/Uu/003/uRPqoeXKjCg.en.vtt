00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
let you know pretty much everything was

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
let you know pretty much everything was
covered<00:00:55.410> properly<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.670> much<00:00:56.879> skip

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
covered properly there was not much skip

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.010 
covered properly there was not much skip
there<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> little<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> inner

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
there was a little bit of inner

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.750 
there was a little bit of inner
monologue<00:00:58.410> skip<00:00:58.649> which<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.039> understandable

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
monologue skip which is understandable

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.490 
monologue skip which is understandable
but<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.210> feel<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.510> they<00:01:00.660> handled<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
but I feel like they handled it for the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
but I feel like they handled it for the
most<00:01:01.800> part<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.370> body<00:01:02.760> movements<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
most part with the body movements and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.429 
most part with the body movements and
the<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> characters<00:01:03.870> acted<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.320> their

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the way the characters acted with their

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.230 
the way the characters acted with their
emotions<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.920> their<00:01:05.010> face<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> eyes<00:01:05.640> which

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
emotions in their face and eyes which

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.450 
emotions in their face and eyes which
they<00:01:06.450> portrayed<00:01:06.900> correctly<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:08.040> there's<00:01:08.280> one

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
they portrayed correctly now there's one

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.010 
they portrayed correctly now there's one
thing<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> bring<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.659> they

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820 
highly doubt they're gonna cover it
again<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.470> skip<00:01:16.740> the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.900 
used like I guess a flashback and they
used<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.100> in<00:05:14.130> place<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.490> an<00:05:14.580> inner<00:05:14.730> monologue

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910

which is fine I like how they did that

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.320
