15 and a half minutes to actually cut
this<00:00:20.100> out<00:00:20.359> I'm<00:00:21.359> using<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.900> my<00:00:22.050> eighth<00:00:22.260> inch

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this out I'm using one of my eighth inch

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.410 
this out I'm using one of my eighth inch
two<00:00:22.920> flutes<00:00:23.220> straight<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.910> Mills<00:00:24.150> from

inventables<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.920> cut<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:27.140> had<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> lot

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
inventables to cut this out I had a lot

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
inventables to cut this out I had a lot
of<00:00:28.380> fun<00:00:28.619> making<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.130> project<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
of fun making this project so in the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
of fun making this project so in the
future<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.960> probably<00:00:31.289> gonna<00:00:31.500> try<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.070> at

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
future I'm probably gonna try to do at

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.069 
future I'm probably gonna try to do at
least<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.700> couple<00:00:32.850> more<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.270> these<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
least a couple more of these kind of

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.010 
least a couple more of these kind of
things<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:35.700> disappointment<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.750> I've

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
things the one disappointment that I've

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.869 
things the one disappointment that I've
had<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.710> video<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.489> fact<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
had with this video is the fact that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
had with this video is the fact that
there's<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.239> much<00:00:39.360> sawdust<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.020> continually

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
there's so much sawdust that continually

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
there's so much sawdust that continually
was<00:00:40.890> collecting<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> acrylic<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.540> dust

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
was collecting on the acrylic of my dust

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.260 
was collecting on the acrylic of my dust
shoe<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.800> kind<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> made<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> video<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> little

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
shoe it kind of made the video a little

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.160 
shoe it kind of made the video a little
bit<00:00:45.450> blurry<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:46.200> times<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.510> I<00:00:48.510> think<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
bit blurry at times and I think that in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.510 
bit blurry at times and I think that in
the<00:00:49.289> future<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.680> gonna<00:00:49.800> try<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> figure<00:00:50.370> out

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the future I'm gonna try to figure out

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970 
the future I'm gonna try to figure out
some<00:00:50.789> better<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> recording<00:00:51.829> footage<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
some better way of recording footage of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.040 
some better way of recording footage of
my<00:00:53.129> machine<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.579> action<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
my machine in action but for right now I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.600 
my machine in action but for right now I
guess<00:00:55.350> we'll<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.829> bear<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
guess we'll have to just bear with it I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
guess we'll have to just bear with it I
suppose<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> say

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
suppose that's all I really need to say

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.930 
suppose that's all I really need to say
about<00:00:58.440> everything<00:00:58.920> until<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> end<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
about everything until the end of the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
about everything until the end of the
video<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> talk<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.260> being<00:01:01.680> all

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
video where I talk about it being all

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
video where I talk about it being all
cut<00:01:02.129> out<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.670> I'll<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.120> leave<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> watch

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
cut out so I'll just leave you to watch

00:01:03.840 --> 00:05:39.510 
cut out so I'll just leave you to watch
the<00:01:04.049> rest<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> it

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.689 

well<00:05:40.520> there<00:05:41.060> we<00:05:41.210> go<00:05:41.389> all<00:05:41.750> done<00:05:42.250> made<00:05:43.250> a<00:05:43.280> couple

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
well there we go all done made a couple

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.249 
well there we go all done made a couple
of<00:05:43.789> them<00:05:43.910> actually<00:05:44.090> even<00:05:44.870> though<00:05:44.990> you<00:05:45.139> only

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
of them actually even though you only

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.279 
of them actually even though you only
saw<00:05:45.560> one<00:05:45.830> made<00:05:46.479> they<00:05:47.479> turned<00:05:47.720> out<00:05:47.900> pretty<00:05:47.930> nice

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
saw one made they turned out pretty nice

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.809 
saw one made they turned out pretty nice
after<00:05:48.740> a<00:05:48.770> little<00:05:48.979> bit<00:05:49.130> of<00:05:49.250> light<00:05:49.460> sanding<00:05:51.819> and

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:52.819 
after a little bit of light sanding and

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.140 
after a little bit of light sanding and
as<00:05:53.360> far<00:05:53.539> as<00:05:53.630> I'm<00:05:53.750> concerned<00:05:54.199> they're<00:05:55.150> quite

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
as far as I'm concerned they're quite

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.439 
as far as I'm concerned they're quite
simple<00:05:56.509> to<00:05:56.599> make<00:05:57.160> they<00:05:58.160> took<00:05:58.340> about<00:05:58.520> 16

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
simple to make they took about 16

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.900 
simple to make they took about 16
minutes<00:05:59.660> or<00:06:00.020> so<00:06:00.229> or<00:06:00.500> maybe<00:06:00.889> a<00:06:01.069> little<00:06:01.250> under<00:06:01.550> 16

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
minutes or so or maybe a little under 16

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.870 
minutes or so or maybe a little under 16
minutes<00:06:02.210> with<00:06:03.139> the<00:06:03.289> eighth<00:06:03.380> inch<00:06:03.680> bit<00:06:04.039> I<00:06:04.310> have

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
minutes with the eighth inch bit I have

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.210 
minutes with the eighth inch bit I have
a<00:06:05.000> feeling<00:06:05.389> that<00:06:05.539> I<00:06:05.750> will<00:06:05.960> be<00:06:06.680> running<00:06:06.889> them

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
a feeling that I will be running them

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.339 
a feeling that I will be running them
with<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.180> quarter<00:06:08.479> inch<00:06:08.599> bit<00:06:08.840> for<00:06:09.050> at<00:06:09.199> least

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
with the quarter inch bit for at least

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.740 
with the quarter inch bit for at least
this<00:06:09.620> larger<00:06:10.130> operation<00:06:10.729> clear<00:06:11.210> out<00:06:11.360> all<00:06:11.539> that

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
this larger operation clear out all that

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.879 
this larger operation clear out all that
faster<00:06:12.880> so<00:06:14.259> basically<00:06:15.259> that's<00:06:15.470> it

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
faster so basically that's it

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.730 
faster so basically that's it
hopefully<00:06:16.310> have<00:06:16.970> a<00:06:17.000> good<00:06:17.240> time<00:06:17.479> making<00:06:18.440> that

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
hopefully have a good time making that

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.760 
hopefully have a good time making that
project<00:06:19.280> if<00:06:19.430> you<00:06:19.580> opted<00:06:19.970> to<00:06:20.509> do<00:06:20.990> it<00:06:21.169> and<00:06:21.380> if<00:06:21.680> you

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
project if you opted to do it and if you

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.240 
project if you opted to do it and if you
don't

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
don't

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.879
