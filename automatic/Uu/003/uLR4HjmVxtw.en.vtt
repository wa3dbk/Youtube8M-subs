00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.389
 I will supplement the interpretation of the factor definition 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.049
 So as a way of looking at this, first of all, it 's a way of thinking of solving equations 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:17.110
 It is fine if you understand it, for example 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.410
 x shaped plus x minus 2 = 0 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.060
 If it is normal when solving the equation 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.759
 Do factoring 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.220
 That is that it is times of that in Noto minus to that x = 1 on that in such form 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:36.489
 It is not seen 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:40.129
 If you try to put in the original expression that Ekko's x = 1 or minus is true 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:44.970
 It means that it has become zero 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:51.060
 Though in is not stepping on this kind of step I when solving the normal equation 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.950
 On the other hand, the idea of the factor TV this time is the first to hit the sea 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:01:01.320
 It is said that 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:07.670
 If it was already zero when we warmed x = 1 appropriately as well 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.670
 It is such an idea that it has a factor of negative position x 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:18.100
 It is put putt of Tteyuu to minus for in guesswork to a little while ago It is c in 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.100
 It is fine even if you say that you have become zero 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:33.260
 From leather or I mean the idea that the actress 's theorem is often zero case 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:36.710
 But it is intended to say in me theorem of the gift and say what it 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:41.360
 It's Tteyuu original polynomial is Waal formula 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.150
 Or is though is a city two-color answering machine multiplied by the small + too much 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:51.240
 It is here at the time of rewriting in the form of say, Well 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.560
 The value calculated with the fur at the original expression -x is the value of the last r 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.290
 Well last but not least 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.520
 It is equally Do Rutteyuu of the Miss-like bottom Date ne men and women 2 in the will to 0 is part of yellow 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.500
 p alpha 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.500
 It is a relationship that = r 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.280
 In the case of factor theorem day 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.730
 It means that we understood that the last r was 0 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.890
 That 's fine for px -x , though 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 It means that it became zero after assigning something . 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:30.030
 Squirrel that p alpha is zero means that r is zero 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:35.400
 That means that r is zero and it should be like this 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.120
 Rutte have to factor from that alpha - Since the festival's say the original polynomial x 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.120
 It is to say
