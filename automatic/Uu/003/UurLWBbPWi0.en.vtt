cylinder or rock bearing moving an awful
lot<00:03:09.769> in<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:11.060> cylinder<00:03:11.510> walls<00:03:11.780> they<00:03:12.170> all<00:03:12.319> kind

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
lot in the cylinder walls they all kind

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.970 
lot in the cylinder walls they all kind
of<00:03:12.769> look<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.130> same<00:03:13.160> although<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:14.060> one<00:03:14.360> Oh

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
of look the same although this one Oh

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.910 
of look the same although this one Oh
probably<00:03:15.980> because<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:16.549> one<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:17.799> you<00:03:18.799> know

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
probably because this one is you know

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.559 
probably because this one is you know
all<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.160> way<00:03:19.280> up<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.819> can<00:03:20.000> see<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.390> more

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
all the way up so you can see it more

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.500 
all the way up so you can see it more
clearly<00:03:21.080> but<00:03:21.670> kind<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.760> looks<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.090> same<00:03:23.269> as

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
clearly but kind of looks the same as

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.350 
clearly but kind of looks the same as
this<00:03:23.660> one<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.349> don't<00:03:24.650> know<00:03:24.799> if<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:25.360> actually

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.680 
this one I don't know if I can actually
move<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.019> engine<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:28.510> there's<00:03:29.950> some

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
