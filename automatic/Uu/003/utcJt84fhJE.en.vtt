00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
same thing for a while maybe they would

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.380 
same thing for a while maybe they would
call<00:01:15.130> them<00:01:16.079> recertified<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:18.400> what<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.270> really

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
call them recertified but what it really

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.850 
call them recertified but what it really
comes<00:01:19.600> down<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.200> these<00:01:20.320> are<00:01:20.470> refurbished

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
comes down to is these are refurbished

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.230 
comes down to is these are refurbished
parts<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.729> what<00:01:24.850> you're<00:01:25.000> getting

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
parts and that's what you're getting

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.370 
parts and that's what you're getting
you're<00:01:25.540> not<00:01:25.600> getting<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.990> brand<00:01:26.200> new<00:01:26.259> machine

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
you're not getting a brand new machine

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.899 
you're not getting a brand new machine
when<00:01:26.799> you<00:01:26.829> buy<00:01:27.009> from<00:01:27.220> them<00:01:27.400> each<00:01:27.549> one<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.850> these

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
when you buy from them each one of these

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.960 
when you buy from them each one of these
parts<00:01:28.299> are<00:01:28.710> discounted<00:01:29.710> which<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:30.850> why

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
parts are discounted which is why

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.389 
parts are discounted which is why
they're<00:01:31.090> able<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.329> keep<00:01:31.450> their<00:01:31.570> costs<00:01:31.750> alone

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
they're able to keep their costs alone

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.789 
they're able to keep their costs alone
so<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.600> must<00:01:34.600> have<00:01:34.720> gotten<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:35.140> refurbished

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
so I must have gotten a refurbished

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.020 
so I must have gotten a refurbished
harddrive<00:01:36.220> right<00:01:36.430> why<00:01:36.610> else<00:01:36.790> would<00:01:37.000> a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
harddrive right why else would a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.109 
harddrive right why else would a
harddrive<00:01:37.710> fail<00:01:38.710> after<00:01:38.920> six<00:01:39.310> months<00:01:39.750> well

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
harddrive fail after six months well

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.249 
harddrive fail after six months well
what's<00:01:43.119> left<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.479> break<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:43.840> here<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.020> guess<00:01:44.200> I

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
what's left to break it here I guess I

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.249 
what's left to break it here I guess I
got<00:01:44.409> motherboard<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.189> went<00:01:45.880> twice<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.689> it

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
got motherboard that went twice so it

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.600 
got motherboard that went twice so it
was<00:01:47.380> when<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.740> mo<00:01:48.100> something<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.430> back<00:01:48.579> a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
was when the mo something it back a

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.450 
was when the mo something it back a
couple<00:01:48.700> times<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.829> kind<00:01:51.040> of<00:01:51.130> waiting

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
couple times but just kind of waiting

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.289 
couple times but just kind of waiting

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
for the rest of the parts to break down

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.819 
for the rest of the parts to break down
at<00:01:55.299> this<00:01:55.479> point<00:01:55.750> if<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:55.960> got<00:01:56.079> my<00:01:56.200> money<00:01:56.380> back<00:01:56.649> I
