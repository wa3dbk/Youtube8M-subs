00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.790
 in diavel a bike that was one 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.920
 bet for ducati bet won 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.539
 considering that since 2011 the year in which it was 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.199
 presented to date they have been sold 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.840
 over 20,000 half 2014 ducats decided 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.029
 to anticipate 2015 by renewing the 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.070
 diavel which now has a new engine a 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.539
 dual ignition has a new design more 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.259
 aggressive and has been made more 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.259
 comfortable 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:43.100
 but what is a diavel 21,500 euros for? 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.860
 bikes 162 horses are bikes so that not 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:53.140
 is a sport is not a naked is not 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.140
 good for touring and noisy 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.500
 under the saddle that is barely space 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.240
 to put the documents and it's not there 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.910
 not even the keyhole because 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.910
 I should buy it when the brand counts 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.030
 well it is a ducati and a ducati has not 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.190
 only the name on the tank but also 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.460
 all the values ​​of sportiness of the brand 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.220
 bolognese which are the soil that for 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.680
 Borgo Panigale is a trademark 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.119
 supersport motorcycle suspension 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.040
 brakes that are the same as one 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.320
 superbike but not enough because from 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.270
 this year ducati also full led headlight 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.240
 which is a new value for the brand 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.090
 bolognese therefore those looking for this bike 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.000
 the segment for also wants a ducati 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.649
 holds the diavel is a unique bike because 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.780
 does not fall into any category of 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.490
 currently known market 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.290
 this is because it can do aesthetically 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.050
 think of a capstone but it's not a custom 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.600
 you drive with a naked is a motor from 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.149
 superbike so that's the beauty here 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.340
 of diavel because it brings everyone together 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.830
 the emotional aspects of different motion 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.420
 becoming automatically unique and who 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.050
 Buy this bike I made 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.050
 become extinct 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.230
 moment matters is style in fact 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.000
 the diavel is not a motorcycle is an object of 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.350
 design and could easily be 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.240
 exhibited in an art museum 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.910
 contemporary because it does not look like 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.730
 no other existing bikes looked at 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.720
 conveyors the pigtail and the shape of the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.210
 tank 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 have you ever seen them only ducats could 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.860
 think so and those who do it do it too 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.930
 because he wants to get excited every time 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.170
 lifting the garage door that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.760
 engine with character 162 horses delivered 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.470
 from an engine that up to two years ago 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.010
 won the world superbike championship 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.210
 the testastretta 11 degrees to a pair 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.100
 scary in this new version a 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.290
 double ignition is further 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.570
 increased torque that is delivered 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.120
 through a huge rear tire 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.640
 on a bike that is low and long 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.480
 try to challenge it on the 400 meters is not 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.480
 his ideal path 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.290
 this the key does a little magic le 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.180
 his cycling odds would make one think 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.489
 to a bike made just to go straight 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.000
 and instead the diavel bends like a naked 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.080
 when cornering it is fast and braking ago 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.519
 fright 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.650
 then if I wanted to go and get it 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.330
 the aperitif today the engine is also 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.340
 decidedly more tractable 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.700
 but you are still convinced that it is a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.700
 helmet 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.730
 and do not forget that the bike a 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.860
 162 horses however calm because 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.170
 this they also know in ducati diavel 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.810
 it is not a motorcycle for novice but the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.400
 bsd series selectable riding modes e 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.980
 also adjustable traction control 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.590
 they make everything so much easier 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.930
 what you don't like doing surely 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.670
 it is not a motorcycle born to travel e 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.220
 even if today the engine supply is 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.440
 very pleasant to face in the long ones 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.770
 highway transfers are not certain 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.770
 the maximum 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.650
 ducati then offers a catalog of 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.480
 very stocked accessories where to improve 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.100
 this aspect of the diavel making it 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.470
 look like the previous version 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.810
 road even if in any case the DNA 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.810
 tourist will find it hard to emerge 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.510
 how much 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.539
 the basic version of the diavel is in the price list 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:54.650
 at € 17,990 while the carbon version 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:57.710
 which we have here costs € 21,490 not 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.819
 it is cheap but if you did 30 then 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.819
 why not do thirty-one 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.150
 recapitulate is a ducati has a design 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.210
 which you will not find anywhere else at 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.139
 world has an engine that is scary is 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.150
 big time why buy it 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.810
 why diavel and if you don't believe us go 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.810
 to find her
