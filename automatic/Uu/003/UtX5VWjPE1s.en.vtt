00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to color since we're going to be

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.840 
to color since we're going to be
applying<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.640> color<00:00:50.940> overlay<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.370> here

applying a color overlay so go up here
to<00:00:53.879> image<00:00:54.149> mode<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.640> if<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:56.969> already<00:00:57.149> an

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to image mode and if it's not already an

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
to image mode and if it's not already an
RGB<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.590> change<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.309> i've<00:00:59.579> already<00:00:59.760> changed

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
RGB then change it i've already changed

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.680 
RGB then change it i've already changed
this<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:01.190> okay<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> next<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.180> access

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this one okay so the next we can access

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
this one okay so the next we can access
the<00:01:03.870> color<00:01:04.080> overlay<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> FX<00:01:05.700> button

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the color overlay from the FX button

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.050 
the color overlay from the FX button
down<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> layer<00:01:06.930> panel<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
down here in the layer panel but as you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.870 
down here in the layer panel but as you
can<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.189> letting<00:01:11.460> me<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
can see it's not letting me do that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.600 
can see it's not letting me do that
that's<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> only<00:01:13.439> apply<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> layer

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that's because we can only apply a layer

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.999 
that's because we can only apply a layer
style<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.210> actual<00:01:15.570> layer<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.799> now

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
style to an actual layer and right now

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.880 
style to an actual layer and right now
our<00:01:17.159> image<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.210> background<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.830> to

and<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.370> a<00:02:08.490> matter<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.790> kind<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.180> playing

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
and this is a matter of kind of playing

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.470 
and this is a matter of kind of playing
around<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.790> getting<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> tone<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.240> you

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
around and getting the tone that you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.960 
around and getting the tone that you
want<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.790> also<00:02:18.090> use<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.240> slider<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
want it also use a slider to get a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.650 
want it also use a slider to get a
different<00:02:21.390> tone<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.660> kind<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.200> liked<00:02:22.440> that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
different tone I kind of liked that

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.930 
different tone I kind of liked that
aquamarine<00:02:24.660> color<00:02:27.020> looks<00:02:28.020> good<00:02:28.380> hit<00:02:28.770> okay<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940

aquamarine color looks good hit okay and
you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.600> also<00:02:30.960> change<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.680> opacity<00:02:31.710> here<00:02:32.670> if

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
you can also change the opacity here if

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.370 
you can also change the opacity here if
you<00:02:33.030> want<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.660> more<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.020> black<00:02:34.350> and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
you can change a different color okay a

couple<00:03:03.840> more<00:03:04.020> tips<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:05.060> modifying<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.330> color

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
couple more tips on modifying this color

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.590 
couple more tips on modifying this color
now<00:03:07.590> i<00:03:07.770> found<00:03:08.130> when<00:03:08.280> i<00:03:08.340> use<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.850> color<00:03:09.120> overlay

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
now i found when i use the color overlay

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.580 
now i found when i use the color overlay
i<00:03:10.050> have<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> hard<00:03:11.250> time<00:03:11.520> getting<00:03:12.320> sometimes<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
i have a hard time getting sometimes a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.630 
i have a hard time getting sometimes a
saturated<00:03:14.550> enough<00:03:14.820> color<00:03:15.560> without<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:17.190> going

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
saturated enough color without it going

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.830 
saturated enough color without it going
to<00:03:18.540> murky<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.570> what<00:03:21.870> i<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.010> do

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
to murky so this is what i like to do

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.320 
to murky so this is what i like to do
you<00:03:24.840> can<00:03:24.870> duplicate<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.830> layer<00:03:27.860> okay<00:03:29.330> change

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
you can duplicate the layer okay change

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.830 
you can duplicate the layer okay change
that<00:03:30.540> duplicate<00:03:30.959> layer<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.470> multiply<00:03:31.620> and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
that duplicate layer to multiply and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.800 
that duplicate layer to multiply and
this<00:03:33.840> will<00:03:34.020> bump<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.500> saturation<00:03:35.100> way<00:03:35.640> up<00:03:35.910> and

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
this will bump the saturation way up and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.360 
this will bump the saturation way up and
you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.110> change<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.530> opacity<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:38.220> that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
you can change the opacity of that

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.130 
you can change the opacity of that
duplicate<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> layer<00:03:39.150> as<00:03:40.190> well

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.040 

okay<00:03:46.140> or<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:47.580> could<00:03:47.760> also<00:03:48.000> add<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.450> levels

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
okay or you could also add a levels

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:58.270 
okay or you could also add a levels
adjustment<00:03:49.550> layer<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:53.150> increase<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.950> darks

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.230 

now<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.340> difference<00:03:59.790> between<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.060> two

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
now the difference between the two

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.540 
now the difference between the two
methods<00:04:00.570> so<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.870> find<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.070> using

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
methods so that I find is that using

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.420 
methods so that I find is that using
levels<00:04:03.120> increases<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.080> contrast<00:04:04.740> does<00:04:05.250> give

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
levels increases the contrast does give

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.730 
levels increases the contrast does give
you<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.640> more<00:04:06.450> saturated<00:04:06.630> image<00:04:07.320> but<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.560> also

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
you a more saturated image but it also

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.030 
you a more saturated image but it also
gives<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.130> contrast<00:04:08.760> or<00:04:09.510> as<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.200> duplicated

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
gives you contrast or as the duplicated

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.390 
gives you contrast or as the duplicated
layer<00:04:11.070> I<00:04:11.670> think<00:04:12.300> gives<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.630> more<00:04:13.400> saturation

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
layer I think gives you more saturation

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.289 
layer I think gives you more saturation
with<00:04:14.610> less<00:04:14.850> contrast

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
with less contrast

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.789 
with less contrast
okay<00:04:18.299> I've<00:04:18.419> paused<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.989> recording<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.650> went

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
okay I've paused the recording and went

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.440 
okay I've paused the recording and went
ahead<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.250> made<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.400> layer<00:04:20.669> mask<00:04:21.030> for<00:04:21.269> this

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
ahead and made a layer mask for this

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.530 
ahead and made a layer mask for this
image<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.700> think<00:04:23.880> I'm<00:04:24.000> going<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.210> bring

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
image and I think I'm going to bring

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.909 
image and I think I'm going to bring
down<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:25.110> opacity<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:26.400> little<00:04:26.430> bit<00:04:26.850> on<00:04:27.150> the

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
down the opacity a little bit on the

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.740 
down the opacity a little bit on the
color<00:04:28.919> overlay<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:30.169> there<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.260> go<00:04:32.690> from<00:04:33.690> a

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
color overlay and there you go from a

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.140 
color overlay and there you go from a
black<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.169> white<00:04:34.290> texture<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:34.860> now<00:04:35.160> have<00:04:35.610> a

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
black and white texture I now have a

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.960 
black and white texture I now have a
light<00:04:37.110> summery<00:04:37.980> aqua<00:04:38.730> colored<00:04:39.210> color<00:04:39.630> wash

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
light summery aqua colored color wash

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.810 
light summery aqua colored color wash
okay<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.180> want<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.419> leave<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.660> with<00:04:42.930> one<00:04:42.960> final

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
bonus tip and you can also apply a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.870 
bonus tip and you can also apply a
gradient<00:04:48.330> overlay<00:04:49.160> I'm<00:04:50.160> going<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.430> turn<00:04:50.700> off

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
gradient overlay I'm going to turn off

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.460 
gradient overlay I'm going to turn off
this<00:04:51.090> layer<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.690> just<00:04:51.900> turn<00:04:52.080> on<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.260> black

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
this layer and just turn on the black

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.900 
this layer and just turn on the black
and<00:04:52.620> white<00:04:52.680> copy<00:04:53.100> I've<00:04:53.370> already<00:04:53.490> set<00:04:53.729> it<00:04:53.760> to

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
and white copy I've already set it to

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.440 
and white copy I've already set it to
multiply

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
multiply

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.300 
multiply

green here go back down here to the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.800 
green here go back down here to the
layer<00:05:04.320> Styles<00:05:05.040> button<00:05:05.430> again<00:05:05.910> select

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
layer Styles button again select

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.530 
layer Styles button again select
gradient<00:05:07.260> overlay<00:05:10.010> let's<00:05:11.010> go<00:05:11.220> ahead<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:12.180> put

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
gradient overlay let's go ahead and put

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.070 
gradient overlay let's go ahead and put
the<00:05:12.660> blend<00:05:12.930> mode<00:05:13.140> to<00:05:13.169> overlay<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.870> then<00:05:15.870> you

the blend mode to overlay and then you

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.340 
the blend mode to overlay and then you
want<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.350> in<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.919> gradient<00:05:17.460> button<00:05:18.360> here<00:05:18.660> you

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
want to in the gradient button here you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.510 
want to in the gradient button here you
want<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.620> select<00:05:19.860> your<00:05:20.100> gradient<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:22.520> I'm

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
want to select your gradient and I'm

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.909 
want to select your gradient and I'm
going<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.760> reverse<00:05:24.330> this<00:05:27.260> if<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.410> wanted<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.800> I

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
going to reverse this if I wanted to I

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.320 
going to reverse this if I wanted to I
could<00:05:29.130> also<00:05:29.340> change<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.820> opacity<00:05:30.120> here<00:05:32.330> I'm

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
could also change the opacity here I'm

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.940 
could also change the opacity here I'm
going<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.570> put<00:05:33.660> it<00:05:33.750> down<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.110> 85%<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:37.800> can

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
going to put it down to 85% you can

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.650 
going to put it down to 85% you can
change<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.280> angle<00:05:38.430> all<00:05:38.700> that<00:05:38.880> stuff<00:05:39.360> as<00:05:39.510> well

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
change the angle all that stuff as well

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.330 
change the angle all that stuff as well
too<00:05:39.930> but<00:05:40.110> I'm<00:05:40.260> gonna<00:05:40.350> leave<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.650> like<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.800> hit

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
too but I'm gonna leave it like that hit

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.810 
too but I'm gonna leave it like that hit
OK

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
OK

and that's pretty cool I like that made
drag<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.170> layer<00:05:47.470> mask<00:05:47.800> from<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.190> other<00:05:48.370> layer

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
drag the layer mask from the other layer

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.510 
drag the layer mask from the other layer
and<00:05:48.850> see<00:05:49.030> how<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.150> looks

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
and see how that looks
