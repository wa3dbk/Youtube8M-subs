house not a lot of difference there

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.349 
house not a lot of difference there
between<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.609> know<00:04:01.670> just<00:04:01.820> having<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.150> piece<00:04:02.329> of

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
between you know just having a piece of

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.390 
between you know just having a piece of
paper<00:04:02.540> but<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.470> think<00:04:03.739> actually<00:04:03.890> more<00:04:04.160> people

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
paper but I think actually more people

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.430 
paper but I think actually more people
would<00:04:04.489> be<00:04:04.579> willing<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.329> sign<00:04:05.540> up<00:04:05.780> using<00:04:06.170> the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
would be willing to sign up using the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.930 
would be willing to sign up using the
iPad<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.040> think<00:04:07.100> you<00:04:07.340> actually<00:04:07.519> be<00:04:07.760> able<00:04:07.820> to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
iPad so I think you actually be able to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.150 
iPad so I think you actually be able to
show<00:04:08.150> some<00:04:08.359> better<00:04:08.510> results<00:04:08.959> with<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.320> so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
show some better results with that so

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.199 
show some better results with that so
that's<00:04:10.310> what<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.489> does<00:04:10.640> as<00:04:10.760> far<00:04:10.940> as<00:04:11.060> your

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209

that's what it does as far as your
sellers<00:04:11.750> are<00:04:11.930> concerned<00:04:12.350> as<00:04:13.280> far<00:04:13.340> as<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:14.239> as

something<00:06:49.620> that<00:06:49.650> Realtors<00:06:50.550> can<00:06:50.729> use<00:06:50.940> you<00:06:51.630> know

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
something that Realtors can use you know

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.420 
something that Realtors can use you know
it's<00:06:51.810> not<00:06:51.900> going<00:06:52.020> to<00:06:52.110> be<00:06:52.169> a<00:06:52.199> game-changer<00:06:52.470> but

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
it's not going to be a game-changer but

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.159 
it's not going to be a game-changer but
it's<00:06:53.580> certainly<00:06:53.789> something<00:06:53.970> to<00:06:54.330> make<00:06:54.569> it<00:06:54.720> your

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
it's certainly something to make it your

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.029
