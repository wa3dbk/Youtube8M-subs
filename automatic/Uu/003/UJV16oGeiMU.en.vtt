00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.570
 what's going on and we're already on day 105 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.309
 that day he enters the house was good my 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 goal was to continue with the sets so 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:25.650
 started to warm up I did a little bit of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:27.240
 freestyle football later I got to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.690
 continue with the frizz combo is of the day 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.580
 previous 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.150
 that one that started with baby elbow and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.150
 all the move 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.110
 it occurred to me after the setter 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.730
 freeze pass it to halo freeze but as 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.470
 I did not go out I was trying the congo 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:11.060
 just leave it freeze has placed 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:13.100
 freeze as a human so I left 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.810
 but not the other way around and that was because when 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.280
 I did not put my hand down enough 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.280
 back and correct that already happens league 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:56.470
 and later the head problems and 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.470
 then all the whole combo 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.450
 later he wanted to learn to leave it freeze 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.450
 James 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.269
 and I realized that when he looked 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.099
 leave it cold imbert was going up from 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.540
 side and the hyper is focused leave it 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.830
 freese of side and helimer centered to 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.830
 come back and it would happen 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.840
 later I tried baby to make the ice 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.940
 and it will happen with frizz to then try 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.940
 the inverse 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.100
 but it 's quite slow so by now 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.780
 final provide good teaser trying 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.780
 add halo face and then limber 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.980
 he ended up dating once but he was 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.540
 bursting so already to finish 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.069
 stretch that day finish they engineered that 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.780
 some pain in the right knee but 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.099
 go out a bunch of new combos and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.950
 I think nothing more here while 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.760
 the 105 days so see you tomorrow to 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.760
 cares and louise
