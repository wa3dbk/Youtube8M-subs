overview<00:00:10.869> of<00:00:11.110> my<00:00:11.500> RC<00:00:11.920> collection<00:00:12.430> again

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
overview of my RC collection again

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.240 
overview of my RC collection again
because<00:00:13.509> I've<00:00:13.660> got<00:00:13.839> another<00:00:14.139> 15<00:00:14.709> and<00:00:15.040> if<00:00:15.129> you

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
because I've got another 15 and if you

because I've got another 15 and if you
haven't<00:00:15.519> seen<00:00:15.700> my<00:00:15.730> um<00:00:16.090> first<00:00:16.480> collection

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
haven't seen my um first collection

haven't seen my um first collection
video<00:00:17.439> I'll<00:00:18.039> leave<00:00:18.279> a<00:00:18.310> link<00:00:18.520> down<00:00:18.730> below<00:00:18.880> but

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
video I'll leave a link down below but

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.960 
video I'll leave a link down below but
every<00:00:19.539> 15<00:00:20.020> I<00:00:20.050> do<00:00:20.230> one<00:00:20.560> so<00:00:20.829> let's<00:00:21.400> start<00:00:21.699> off<00:00:21.820> at

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
every 15 I do one so let's start off at

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.710 
every 15 I do one so let's start off at
the<00:00:22.060> bottom<00:00:22.210> here<00:00:22.599> I<00:00:22.750> have<00:00:23.199> the<00:00:23.560> speedo<00:00:24.310> fq<00:00:25.000> 7<00:00:25.330> 7

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
the bottom here I have the speedo fq 7 7

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.220 
the bottom here I have the speedo fq 7 7
7<00:00:25.869> 1<00:00:26.349> 2<00:00:26.380> 4<00:00:26.830> which<00:00:27.369> is<00:00:27.519> little<00:00:27.759> nano<00:00:28.060> cx-10<00:00:28.840> clone

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
7 1 2 4 which is little nano cx-10 clone

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.980 
7 1 2 4 which is little nano cx-10 clone
um<00:00:29.500> but<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:30.429> has<00:00:30.580> a<00:00:30.609> nice<00:00:30.970> fast<00:00:31.330> y'all<00:00:31.660> rate<00:00:31.839> in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
um but it has a nice fast y'all rate in

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.660 
um but it has a nice fast y'all rate in
good<00:00:32.169> pitch<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:32.589> i<00:00:32.650> really<00:00:32.949> like<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.400> it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
good pitch and i really like that and it

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.430 
good pitch and i really like that and it
can<00:00:33.820> store<00:00:34.089> it<00:00:34.269> inside<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.780> transmitter<00:00:35.230> so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
can store it inside the transmitter so

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.189 
can store it inside the transmitter so
that's<00:00:35.589> a<00:00:35.680> nice<00:00:35.830> function<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.970> here<00:00:37.659> this

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
that's a nice function and here this

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.729 
that's a nice function and here this
technically<00:00:38.710> isn't<00:00:38.979> an<00:00:39.400> RC<00:00:40.150> I<00:00:40.500> tried<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.589> make

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
technically isn't an RC I tried to make

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.270 
technically isn't an RC I tried to make
a<00:00:41.949> nano<00:00:42.250> octocopter<00:00:43.089> and<00:00:43.750> that's<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.229> cyma<00:00:44.680> X

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
a nano octocopter and that's the cyma X

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.270 
a nano octocopter and that's the cyma X
13<00:00:46.030> board<00:00:46.420> there<00:00:46.809> in<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.500> middle<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.040> then

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
13 board there in the middle and then

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.310 
13 board there in the middle and then
these<00:00:48.670> are<00:00:48.879> just<00:00:49.089> nano<00:00:49.390> motors<00:00:49.900> and<00:00:50.170> nano

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
these are just nano motors and nano

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.539 
these are just nano motors and nano
props<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:53.379> I<00:00:53.409> think<00:00:53.650> go<00:00:53.769> out<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.159> you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
props and it that I think go out to you

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:56.130 
props and it that I think go out to you
didn't<00:00:54.879> have<00:00:55.030> enough<00:00:55.269> thrust<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.690> get<00:00:55.809> off<00:00:55.930> the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
didn't have enough thrust to get off the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.039 
didn't have enough thrust to get off the
ground<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.710> I<00:00:56.979> just<00:00:57.010> wired<00:00:57.549> the<00:00:58.180> two<00:00:58.420> motors

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
ground and I just wired the two motors

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.630 
ground and I just wired the two motors
like<00:00:59.320> these<00:00:59.799> are<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.040> front<00:01:00.280> left<00:01:00.460> front

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
like these are the front left front

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.939 
like these are the front left front
right<00:01:00.820> back<00:01:01.239> right<00:01:01.449> back<00:01:01.750> left<00:01:01.960> just<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.769> them

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
right back right back left just to them

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.890 
right back right back left just to them
both<00:01:03.699> of<00:01:03.909> them<00:01:04.000> are<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.210> same<00:01:04.360> ones<00:01:04.629> so<00:01:04.809> they

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
both of them are the same ones so they

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.870 
both of them are the same ones so they
all<00:01:05.019> spun<00:01:05.379> but<00:01:05.590> then<00:01:05.799> when<00:01:05.950> I<00:01:06.040> power<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.850> I

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
all spun but then when I power so I

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.730 
all spun but then when I power so I
hooked<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.150> up<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.479> 2s<00:01:07.900> battery<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.590> then

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
hooked it up to a 2s battery and then

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.609 
hooked it up to a 2s battery and then
the<00:01:08.979> board<00:01:09.490> actually<00:01:09.729> caught<00:01:10.119> on<00:01:10.270> fire<00:01:10.619> so

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
the board actually caught on fire so

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.319 
the board actually caught on fire so
that<00:01:11.649> one<00:01:12.009> never<00:01:12.310> really<00:01:12.399> made<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.850> too<00:01:13.090> far

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
that one never really made it too far

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.760 
that one never really made it too far
but<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.539> thought<00:01:13.719> that<00:01:13.780> was<00:01:14.020> just<00:01:14.229> interesting

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
but I thought that was just interesting

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.249 
but I thought that was just interesting
and<00:01:14.920> just<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.820> include<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.299> here<00:01:16.539> and<00:01:16.960> then<00:01:17.109> we

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
and just to include it here and then we

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.669 
and just to include it here and then we
have<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:18.039> cueing<00:01:18.579> song<00:01:18.840> qx50<00:01:19.840> 13<00:01:20.259> which<00:01:20.499> is<00:01:20.530> a

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
have the cueing song qx50 13 which is a

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.730 
have the cueing song qx50 13 which is a
little<00:01:21.039> nice<00:01:21.969> to<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:22.719> channel<00:01:23.140> helicopter<00:01:23.649> and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
little nice to to channel helicopter and

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.590 
little nice to to channel helicopter and
they<00:01:23.799> call<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.070> 2.5<00:01:24.219> channel<00:01:24.969> because<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.420> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
they call it 2.5 channel because of the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.779 
they call it 2.5 channel because of the
little<00:01:26.560> light<00:01:26.829> there<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.369> pretty<00:01:27.670> nice

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
little light there so a pretty nice

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.779 
little light there so a pretty nice
helicopter<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:28.539> works<00:01:28.749> well<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:30.369> here<00:01:30.549> we

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
helicopter that works well over here we

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.260 
helicopter that works well over here we
have<00:01:30.999> the<00:01:31.240> cement<00:01:32.229> X<00:01:32.409> 13<00:01:32.950> however<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.819> put<00:01:34.149> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
have the cement X 13 however I put the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.510 
have the cement X 13 however I put the
eachine<00:01:34.749> h7<00:01:35.380> board<00:01:35.649> inside<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.189> that<00:01:36.340> so

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
eachine h7 board inside of that so

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.459 
eachine h7 board inside of that so
that's<00:01:36.609> mod<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.939> little<00:01:37.299> because<00:01:37.659> stock<00:01:38.289> it

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
that's mod a little because stock it

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.109 
that's mod a little because stock it
came<00:01:38.619> with<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.829> lot<00:01:39.009> of<00:01:39.039> accelerometer<00:01:39.789> issues

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
came with a lot of accelerometer issues

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.020 
came with a lot of accelerometer issues
which<00:01:40.390> just<00:01:40.689> made<00:01:40.929> a<00:01:40.960> terrible<00:01:41.409> flyer<00:01:41.969> now<00:01:42.969> we

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
which just made a terrible flyer now we

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.859 
which just made a terrible flyer now we
have<00:01:43.390> also<00:01:43.719> the<00:01:44.469> you<00:01:44.829> Diu<00:01:45.549> 27<00:01:46.179> free<00:01:46.420> loop<00:01:46.630> which

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
have also the you Diu 27 free loop which

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.870 
have also the you Diu 27 free loop which
is<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> pretty<00:01:47.289> cool<00:01:47.560> quad<00:01:47.829> and<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.670> can<00:01:48.789> do

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
is a pretty cool quad and it can do

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.999 
is a pretty cool quad and it can do
inverted<00:01:49.479> flight<00:01:49.719> so<00:01:50.109> I<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.350> fly<00:01:50.499> upside<00:01:50.859> down

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
inverted flight so I can fly upside down

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.469 
inverted flight so I can fly upside down
it<00:01:51.219> does<00:01:51.399> that<00:01:51.579> by<00:01:51.729> reversing<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.359> direction

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
it does that by reversing the direction

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.809 
it does that by reversing the direction
of<00:01:52.960> some<00:01:53.079> motor<00:01:53.289> spin<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.130> has<00:01:54.249> 3d<00:01:54.670> with

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
of some motor spin and has 3d with

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.330 
of some motor spin and has 3d with
symmetrical<00:01:55.420> props<00:01:55.749> so<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:56.649> gets<00:01:56.829> thrust<00:01:57.189> in

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
symmetrical props so it gets thrust in

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.739 
symmetrical props so it gets thrust in
both<00:01:57.490> ways<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:57.969> a<00:01:58.030> little<00:01:58.210> bit<00:01:58.299> heavy<00:01:58.509> but

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
both ways it's a little bit heavy but

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.410 
both ways it's a little bit heavy but
because<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.530> symmetrical<00:01:59.950> props<00:02:00.249> just<00:02:01.240> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
because of the symmetrical props just it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.459 
because of the symmetrical props just it
doesn't<00:02:01.569> have<00:02:01.749> a<00:02:01.780> lot<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:02.020> kick<00:02:02.139> but<00:02:02.319> it's

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
doesn't have a lot of kick but it's

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.340 
doesn't have a lot of kick but it's
still<00:02:02.679> really<00:02:02.859> fun<00:02:02.979> cheap<00:02:03.429> inverted<00:02:03.969> flyer

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
still really fun cheap inverted flyer

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.379 
still really fun cheap inverted flyer
and<00:02:05.350> here<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:05.709> have<00:02:05.889> the<00:02:06.039> eachine<00:02:06.579> each<00:02:06.880> seven

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
and here we have the eachine each seven

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:09.300 
and here we have the eachine each seven
now<00:02:07.959> as<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.229> can<00:02:08.380> probably<00:02:08.590> tell<00:02:08.770> this<00:02:09.100> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
now as you can probably tell this is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.010 
now as you can probably tell this is
completely<00:02:09.910> stripped<00:02:10.209> down<00:02:10.300> this<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.869> just

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
completely stripped down this is just

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.380 
completely stripped down this is just
the<00:02:11.200> frame<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:12.190> that's<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.030> motors

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the frame and that's because the motors

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.000 
the frame and that's because the motors
and<00:02:13.540> props<00:02:13.780> actually<00:02:14.230> went<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.620> octa

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and props actually went to this octa

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
and props actually went to this octa
copter<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.550> then<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.240> board<00:02:16.540> actually<00:02:16.810> went

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
copter and then the board actually went

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.100 
copter and then the board actually went
x13<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.700> kind<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.150> got<00:02:19.690> stripped<00:02:20.050> down

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
x13 so that kind of got stripped down

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.020 
x13 so that kind of got stripped down
but<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.379> thought<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.590> include<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.879> then

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
but I thought I include that and then

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.660 
but I thought I include that and then
here<00:02:22.299> is<00:02:22.629> another<00:02:22.659> little<00:02:23.379> quad<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.489> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
here is another little quad this is the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
flyer okay let's move up we got the SEMA

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.619 
flyer okay let's move up we got the SEMA
x2<00:02:39.040> which<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> cool<00:02:39.970> little<00:02:40.090> quad<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.569> I

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
x2 which is a cool little quad that I

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.140 
x2 which is a cool little quad that I
won<00:02:40.900> from<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.560> adecco<00:02:41.980> guys<00:02:42.160> contests<00:02:42.879> I'm

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
won from one adecco guys contests I'm

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.319 
won from one adecco guys contests I'm
pretty<00:02:43.780> nice<00:02:43.959> overall<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.340> little<00:02:45.579> heavy

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
pretty nice overall it's a little heavy

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.300 
pretty nice overall it's a little heavy
on<00:02:46.450> lacking<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.140> power<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:47.530> pitch<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.129> yaw

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
on lacking on power and pitch and yaw

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.400 
on lacking on power and pitch and yaw
and<00:02:48.909> so<00:02:49.209> it's<00:02:49.360> pretty<00:02:49.510> slow<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.079> it'd<00:02:50.170> be<00:02:50.200> good

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
and so it's pretty slow but it'd be good

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.619 
and so it's pretty slow but it'd be good
for<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.680> beginner<00:02:50.940> then<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.180> we<00:02:52.269> have<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629

here<00:03:05.109> we<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.680> SEMA<00:03:06.010> x11<00:03:06.430> clone<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.239> moon

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
here we have a SEMA x11 clone the moon

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.069 
here we have a SEMA x11 clone the moon
top<00:03:07.900> m99<00:03:08.709> 1/6<00:03:09.670> which<00:03:10.209> is<00:03:10.390> pretty<00:03:10.629> cool<00:03:10.900> it's

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
top m99 1/6 which is pretty cool it's

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.640 
top m99 1/6 which is pretty cool it's
got<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.440> geared<00:03:12.269> geared<00:03:13.269> props<00:03:13.599> there<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.560> it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
got the geared geared props there so it

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.259 
got the geared geared props there so it
gets<00:03:14.829> nice<00:03:15.129> long<00:03:15.430> like<00:03:15.730> eight<00:03:15.940> minute

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
gets nice long like eight minute

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.030 
gets nice long like eight minute
efficient<00:03:16.810> flight<00:03:17.019> times<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.769> has

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
efficient flight times and that has

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.680 
efficient flight times and that has
quite<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> bit<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.640> power<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.269> this<00:03:19.480> was

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
quite a bit of power and this was

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.690 
quite a bit of power and this was
upgraded<00:03:20.230> because<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.709> yaw<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.160> pitch<00:03:21.220> over

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
upgraded because the yaw and pitch over

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.680 
upgraded because the yaw and pitch over
the<00:03:21.790> X<00:03:21.940> 13<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.680> here<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.099> have<00:03:24.310> my

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
the X 13 and here we have my

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.759 
the X 13 and here we have my
dreamcatcher<00:03:25.690> frame<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.349> bought<00:03:26.590> from

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
dreamcatcher frame that I bought from

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.740 
dreamcatcher frame that I bought from
micro<00:03:27.069> motor<00:03:27.220> warehouse<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.299> have<00:03:28.540> the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
micro motor warehouse and I have the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.990 
micro motor warehouse and I have the
hubs<00:03:29.109> and<00:03:29.230> export<00:03:29.799> electronics<00:03:30.459> on<00:03:30.639> there<00:03:30.849> and

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
hubs and export electronics on there and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.940 
hubs and export electronics on there and
the<00:03:31.389> frame<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.690> really<00:03:31.959> nice<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:32.709> that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
the frame is really nice it's just that

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.770 
the frame is really nice it's just that
board<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.459> do<00:03:33.519> not<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.180> board<00:03:34.419> so<00:03:34.630> that's

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
board I do not like the board so that's
