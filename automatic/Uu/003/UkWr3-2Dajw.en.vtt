and the e shape Barre chords I'm

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.890 
and the e shape Barre chords I'm
choosing<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.039> at<00:00:17.400> E<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:18.000> me<00:00:18.359> which<00:00:18.720> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
actually a good place to play Barre
chords<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.280> the<00:00:24.060> strings<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.539> easier<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
chords because the strings are easier to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.390 
chords because the strings are easier to
push<00:00:25.140> down<00:00:25.380> they're<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.800> far<00:00:26.039> away<00:00:26.130> from

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
push down they're so far away from

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
push down they're so far away from
either<00:00:26.580> end<00:00:26.880> those<00:00:27.150> frets<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.660> closer

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
either end those frets are closer

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
either end those frets are closer
together<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:31.110> using<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> shape<00:00:32.039> Barre

time and that wouldn't fit what I'm
wanting<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.110> also<00:02:09.530> like<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:09.979> hi<00:02:10.220> sound
