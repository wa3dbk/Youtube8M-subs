00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.770
 here I would stop and shine where 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.380
 to practically the image a 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.150
 hahaha has become a white in black and a reflection of its own 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.259
 we also intervene on opacity - we reduce his 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.259
 impact with 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.839
 as I said drink 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.640
 we can activate a layer mask for 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.059
 hide part snai this part here where there is 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.059
 the pupil which is generally the dark part 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 symbian doesn't reflect if you saw it of - 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.560
 or we can use the eraser 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 surian, master i level waters icons at the bottom 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.590
 on the left, black foreground, we take a brush 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 but size 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 let's reduce a little bit 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.110
 2 din mask for reminder is the one 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.580
 lets you see below 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.460
 to reduce the impact a little should the hairline where two overlap 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.079
 always images with the layer mask 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.930
 however by reducing the opacity we can 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 using a soft gradient brush 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.470
 we manage the opacity of quite a while and intervene on the edge to al per 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.150
 attenuate it because at least the obvious this hahaha this attachment 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 we are a little bit 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.820
 so it is not so clean it does not give the feeling of being cut with one 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.040
 scissors in the same way we can also do on the edge 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.890
 turn a little around the sauce I noticed black skin of formation of 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.830
 not having 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.260
 dimensions 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.240
 perfectly adapted to the eye though 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.850
 as usual when I go fast to have the stay in 10 minutes 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.420
 available for 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.330
 the registration 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.600
 giacomo we will say a pig that is to make more hinted in less 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.669
 terms of colors because this image was 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.219
 overlying 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.629
 if it is still too bright we can intervene 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.250
 marcella its center. to too intense yet just patch ita to reduce 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:27.900
 further because the city lets the eye see more of the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.860
 under question shrubs will also be evaluated basal image with 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:32.879
 image 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.489
 basically dark film 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.279
 goods lite, most of all, a lighter animal will be - 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.509
 this function is evident 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.379
 we also try to apply 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.949
 black and white rom to the eye we see how it can be presented by removing the 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.119
 color that 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:59.339
 film also evaluate this situation so I ticked 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.169
 an adjustment for after I actually apologize 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.109
 one click to activate the background layer 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.049
 we activate level of regulation yet we check black and white 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:22.269
 we value you there may also like black and white always elegant always has 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.459
 one of its charm can also be seen with a journey as it presents itself 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.719
 so we come out with color we have the possibility to furnish an intonation 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.869
 colored this white mirror's edge for facebook link on this square 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.379
 of the color we can 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.230
 also 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.589
 who chooses a different color from the one that looks like 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.569
 images of tifonet 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.189
 and of course, always a matter of taste and of what you do 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.299
 we do not want to keep only I have arrived 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.229
 he has a good look that he can 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.359
 hola 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.229
 more pleasures 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.229
 and I confirm 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:07.779
 close to remove disturbance and I also create a nuance around use for 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:09.859
 refine further 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:10.809
 movie 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:14.279
 wide picture active general picture 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.150
 the highest level 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.069
 small second icons at the bottom right to create a new level 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.009
 I take 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:23.800
 the lasso tool 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.200
 and I create one 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.980
 I am writing to him just an ammore, an outline so irregular around me 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.870
 near the edge, I reverse the selection that would be selected for the area 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.949
 central to me I am interested in that peripheral 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.029
 reverse selection 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.029
 I take white foreground color 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.340
 the bucket as a tool towards the inside 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.690
 as it is it is very clear we will add a blur tera amo rubi 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.400
 say for this that you have to become an ebay nuance incentives re the 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.710
 general framework with against you we select or with selected menus 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.499
 select 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:11.499
 and apply a blur filter 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.249
 blur control 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.870
 - where we are the cursor and see 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.490
 to emphasize or not this effect 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.650
 why it is 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.389
 a visible wine 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.389
 this intervention just done 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.530
 even here it will be a matter of taste if we want to be one 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.530
 a veiled unown eye image so discreet 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.180
 increase the nuance 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.530
 here it is, our punk crio with reflection is not a perfect job like 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.820
 as usual I repeat it again and again someone occasionally points out to me that it shows 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.840
 you see that other one I don't 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.699
 I can't take too long to do 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.779
 but these works suggest you the method to do it 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.770
 we have the possibility to give different intonations then 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.559
 to find 100 a situation maybe even suited to our moretti 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:16.669
 who knows 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.900
 the job is finished we can save in psd format to maintain the levels 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.610
 aperitifs to be able to intervene later we will make unique level 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.779
 level 7 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:31.589
 we are satisfied with the result in order to save little pregnant is x gay point
