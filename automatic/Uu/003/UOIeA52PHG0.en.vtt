and<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:43.920> leap<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.520> people<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.180> young

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and at leap we see people to young

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880 
and at leap we see people to young
people<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> solution<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.649> problem

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
people as a solution and not the problem

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.490 
people as a solution and not the problem
and<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.640> train<00:01:47.909> them<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.810> solve<00:01:49.350> each

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and we train them to and solve each

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
and we train them to and solve each
other's<00:01:49.770> problems<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
other's problems do you think this is a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
other's problems do you think this is a
good<00:01:51.479> approach<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.020> solving<00:01:52.350> young<00:01:52.500> people's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
good approach to solving young people's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.289 
good approach to solving young people's
problems<00:01:53.220> how<00:01:53.369> many<00:01:53.549> young<00:01:53.640> people<00:01:53.790> saw<00:01:54.090> their

problems how many young people saw their

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
problems how many young people saw their
old<00:01:54.420> problems<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:54.960> yeah<00:01:55.470> yeah<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.070> it's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
old problems with yeah yeah I think it's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.590 
old problems with yeah yeah I think it's
all<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.790> poem<00:01:57.149> because<00:01:57.390> there's<00:01:57.540> gonna

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
all going on poem because there's gonna

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.910 
all going on poem because there's gonna
come<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:57.899> when<00:01:58.170> they're<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.619> when
