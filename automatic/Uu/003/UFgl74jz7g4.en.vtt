00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.559
 dead zone truck driver will not 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.809
 concede and not because he himself he you 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.830
 just does not see but pedestrians and drivers 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.990
 cars 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.990
 hard to get under the wheels 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.570
 multi-ton machines when approaching 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 wagon 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.470
 life threatening i didn't see him at all 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.070
 I did not see at all I see in front of the car 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 let's go i started the wagon driver wire 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.629
 proved that he could not notice 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.400
 pedestrian 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.870
 a man died trying to cross the road 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.870
 right in front of the tractor 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 I stand too but then there will still be ahead 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.809
 Almar Samara under the truck got a grandmother 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.790
 and granddaughter 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.120
 two year old girl died for it 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.010
 the court appointed the driver three years in prison 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.559
 the truckers did not accept the courtâ€™s arguments 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.619
 by law starting driving driver 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 must ensure safety 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:10.880
 literally get behind the wheel and see 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.880
 that nobody is in front of the cabin 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.200
 even walking on a zebra pedestrian risks being 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.770
 not seen 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.950
 and pass like that right in front of the cabin 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.340
 put yourself at risk of death though 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.860
 according to the law , the driver is guilty 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.590
 that's just how to become and repeat 10 background 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 I had to change ip office 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.550
 I can almost not notice her 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 uncomfortable and push more energy 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.960
 constantly on each parish if 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:48.750
 let 's change the city get up 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:50.850
 and it just doesn't work because of huge 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.130
 the size of the machine part of the space 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.350
 in front of the cabin and to the right of it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.890
 the driver can only control by 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.979
 mirrors but hurrying drivers of cars 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 don't even think about this dead zone 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.180
 I understand that you just 19 America record 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.180
 voloshin somehow so that 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.760
 truckers put extra 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.580
 mirrors to boost 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.010
 review but it doesn't always help 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.260
 there are a number of mirrors we have distant 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.680
 and near curb so -called but 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.030
 of machines is equal to the case , so 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.340
 just do not have time not noticing 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.860
 see here is one of the latest cases in 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.590
 traffic jam Alexis did not notice tint 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.110
 all on the right car 2 scratched to 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.680
 the car is congested by several 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.740
 o'clock 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.870
 because the occupied two lanes whose food is true 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.959
 who knows one this situation I was 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.510
 innocent of parsing such an accident in traffic police 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.209
 the inspector will first learn 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 position of machines relative marking 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.450
 who is exactly in the band is usually not 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.470
 blame this one here understands this one 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.540
 will be analogs 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.120
 Well, thanks to all three funds, I say 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.630
 avoid such problems are not words 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.180
 experienced car drivers 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.920
 on the right it is advised not to even come near 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.920
 walking not by car
