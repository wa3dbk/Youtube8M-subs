the new duties that screen TVs DVD
machines<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.899> all<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> classrooms<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
machines in all of the classrooms so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.459 
machines in all of the classrooms so
it's<00:01:59.700> those<00:01:59.969> kinds<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> areas<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.200> um

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it's those kinds of areas but it's um

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.520 
it's those kinds of areas but it's um
being<00:02:02.040> defined<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.479> along<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.049> think<00:02:04.380> one

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
being defined as we go along I think one

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.280 
being defined as we go along I think one
of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.860> benefits<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.939> smaller<00:02:06.329> school<00:02:06.990> like

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
of the benefits of a smaller school like

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.199 
of the benefits of a smaller school like
this<00:02:07.439> an<00:02:07.619> independent<00:02:08.340> school<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> isn't

you're<00:02:24.010> talking<00:02:24.310> about<00:02:24.510> our<00:02:25.510> syllabi<00:02:25.960> are

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
you're talking about our syllabi are

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.440 
you're talking about our syllabi are
structured<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.800> such<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:27.010> way<00:02:27.130> as<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.520> be<00:02:27.850> sort

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
structured in such a way as to be sort

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.290 
structured in such a way as to be sort
of<00:02:28.510> modular<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.530> student<00:02:30.460> basically

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
of modular so the student basically

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.680 
of modular so the student basically
experiences<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.870> whole<00:02:32.110> week<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:33.690> whether

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
experiences a whole week and whether

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.020 
experiences a whole week and whether
they<00:02:34.870> sort<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.230> continue<00:02:35.830> or<00:02:36.040> not<00:02:36.070> they<00:02:36.850> don't

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
they sort of continue or not they don't

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.210 
they sort of continue or not they don't
feel<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.660> there's<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.320> cut-off<00:02:38.530> point<00:02:38.950> it's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
feel that there's a cut-off point it's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.520 
feel that there's a cut-off point it's
complete<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.670> its<00:02:40.060> own<00:02:40.180> right<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:41.230> there's

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
complete and its own right so there's

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.100 
complete and its own right so there's
there's<00:02:41.680> absolutely<00:02:42.130> no<00:02:42.310> problem<00:02:42.700> whatsoever

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
there's absolutely no problem whatsoever

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.930 
there's absolutely no problem whatsoever
thus<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.260> care<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.920> know<00:02:45.130> as<00:02:45.550> soon<00:02:45.730> as<00:02:45.820> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
thus the care you know as soon as the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.250 
thus the care you know as soon as the
student<00:02:46.300> comes<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.630> on<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> Monday<00:02:47.050> morning

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
student comes in on the Monday morning

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.820 
student comes in on the Monday morning
they're<00:02:48.010> given<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.370> full<00:02:48.580> induction<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.830> there

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
they're given a full induction and there

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.620 
they're given a full induction and there
are<00:02:50.980> friday<00:02:51.310> tests<00:02:51.880> at<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> end<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.420> week

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
are friday tests at the end of the week

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.540 
are friday tests at the end of the week
so<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.260> there<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> sort<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.100> sense<00:02:54.340> of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
so that there is a sort of sense of

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.210 
so that there is a sort of sense of
completion<00:02:54.970> for<00:02:55.510> every<00:02:56.230> week<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.950> student

and when they arrived in London feel

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.360 
and when they arrived in London feel
that<00:04:44.660> it's<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.930> same<00:04:45.229> service<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:46.100> is<00:04:46.190> being
