00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
video the manmelter that you see there

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
video the manmelter that you see there
and<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:39.090> know<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.480> said<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.899> third<00:00:40.379> degree

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and you know as I said the third degree

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.959 
and you know as I said the third degree
which<00:00:40.829> completes<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> set<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> third

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
which completes the set the third

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
which completes the set the third
degrees<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.570> very<00:00:42.809> special<00:00:43.110> acts<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.680> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
degrees are very special acts it is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
degrees are very special acts it is
actually<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.190> straight<00:00:44.940> upgrade<00:00:45.660> from<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
actually a straight upgrade from the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
actually a straight upgrade from the
default<00:00:46.680> acts<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> sense<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.879> has

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
default acts in the sense that it has

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.790 
default acts in the sense that it has
absolutely<00:00:48.270> no<00:00:49.110> downsides<00:00:50.059> but<00:00:51.800> its

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
absolutely no downsides but its

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.790 
absolutely no downsides but its
usefulness<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.610> very<00:00:53.910> questionable<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
usefulness is very questionable so the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.580 
usefulness is very questionable so the
what<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> does<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
what it does is that when you when you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.279 
what it does is that when you when you
hit<00:00:58.890> someone<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.640> axe<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> being

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
hit someone with the axe that is being

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.650 
hit someone with the axe that is being
healed<00:01:01.590> by<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> medic<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.480> here

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
if I hit if I hit the medic right now

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
if I hit if I hit the medic right now
the<00:01:06.900> person<00:01:07.320> who<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.619> he<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.520> healing<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.090> be

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the person who is he is healing will be

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.100 
the person who is he is healing will be
hurt<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.659> well<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.380> exact<00:01:10.740> definition<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
hurt as well the exact definition is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
hurt as well the exact definition is
players<00:01:13.110> connected<00:01:13.650> by<00:01:13.799> healing<00:01:14.250> beams<00:01:14.610> will

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
players connected by healing beams will

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539 
players connected by healing beams will
be<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.439> damaged<00:01:16.860> by<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.159> weapon<00:01:17.460> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be will be damaged by this weapon that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
be will be damaged by this weapon that
means<00:01:17.729> let's<00:01:18.090> say<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> medic<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.840> healing<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
means let's say a medic is healing a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620 
means let's say a medic is healing a
heavy<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.860> may<00:01:20.070> lay<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> heavy<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
heavy and I may lay down the heavy the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
heavy and I may lay down the heavy the
same<00:01:21.990> damage<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.680> transferred<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
same damage will be transferred to the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
same damage will be transferred to the
medic<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> same<00:01:24.450> time<00:01:24.659> I'll<00:01:24.869> kill<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
medic so at the same time I'll kill the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.230 
medic so at the same time I'll kill the
heavy<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.159> medic<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> same<00:01:26.880> time<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
heavy and the medic at the same time so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.969 
heavy and the medic at the same time so
this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.450> basically<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.960> medic<00:01:28.380> killing<00:01:28.829> weapon

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this is basically a medic killing weapon

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
this is basically a medic killing weapon
or<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.970> hit<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> medic<00:01:30.509> it'll<00:01:30.750> also<00:01:30.900> hurt

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
or if you hit the medic it'll also hurt

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.130 
or if you hit the medic it'll also hurt
the<00:01:31.380> target<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:33.210> know<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> target

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the target that it's you know the target

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.899 
the target that it's you know the target

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that the medic is healing so you gotta

watch out for that this video is not

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
watch out for that this video is not
purely<00:01:39.560> third<00:01:40.560> degree<00:01:40.740> gameplay<00:01:41.280> because

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
purely third degree gameplay because

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.819 
purely third degree gameplay because
basically<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:43.200> didn't<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.500> enough<00:01:43.530> of

sci-fi weapons for the for the pyro

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.630 
sci-fi weapons for the for the pyro
gameplay<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.899> mainly<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.680> find<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> back

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
gameplay because mainly I find the back

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.160 
gameplay because mainly I find the back
is<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:53.970> interesting<00:01:54.600> especially<00:01:54.780> when

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
is really interesting especially when

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.499 
is really interesting especially when
used<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.649> three<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> them<00:01:56.100> together<00:01:56.509> because

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
used all three of them together because

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
used all three of them together because
if<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.719> use<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.899> flow<00:01:58.110> destinator<00:01:58.560> alone

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
if you use the flow destinator alone

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.410 
if you use the flow destinator alone
with<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> shotgun<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.180> sucks

once in a while on a medic and stuff
like<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:51.000> has<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.480> very<00:02:51.930> very

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
like that it has it's a very very

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280 
like that it has it's a very very
situational<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.060> for<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.599> reason<00:02:54.659> i<00:02:55.049> don't

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
situational and for that reason i don't

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
situational and for that reason i don't
think<00:02:55.709> i<00:02:55.799> can<00:02:55.859> recommend<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.639> third<00:02:56.879> degree

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
the with the with a sci-fi pack very

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.849

nice<00:03:51.510> weapon<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:52.019> all<00:03:52.169> in<00:03:52.440> general<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.840> but

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
nice weapon in all in general and but

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.009 
nice weapon in all in general and but
basically<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.180> not<00:03:57.510> good<00:03:57.750> enough<00:03:57.780> to

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
basically it's just not good enough to

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.289 
basically it's just not good enough to
be<00:03:58.169> honest<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.769> more<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.280> novelty<00:03:59.549> weapon

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
be honest it's more of a novelty weapon

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.879 
be honest it's more of a novelty weapon
or<00:04:00.449> something<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.530> genres<00:04:01.889> of

or something like that on the genres of

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.220 
or something like that on the genres of
that<00:04:02.159> but<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.209> very<00:04:03.480> good<00:04:03.629> weapon<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.169> I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
that but it is a very good weapon and I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.289 
that but it is a very good weapon and I
do<00:04:04.290> recommend<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.430> for<00:04:05.579> people<00:04:05.879> who<00:04:05.970> want<00:04:06.150> to
