00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
attainable as well so not something

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.120

excessively muscular so I think it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.499 
excessively muscular so I think it's
very<00:01:56.189> important<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.850> also<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
very important and also you have to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
very important and also you have to
remember<00:01:57.689> we're<00:01:57.899> under<00:01:58.170> these<00:01:58.320> huge<00:01:58.740> Expo<00:01:59.310> you

all this makeup and tan on you wouldn't

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.550 
all this makeup and tan on you wouldn't
be<00:02:03.540> able<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.930> anything<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.259> you'd<00:02:04.439> be

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
be able to see anything because you'd be

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
be able to see anything because you'd be
completely<00:02:04.979> washed<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.329> like

where it's always overdone it's because

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.140 
where it's always overdone it's because

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
but you still need to be fairly lean is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.780 
but you still need to be fairly lean is
it<00:02:25.020> comfortable<00:02:25.110> being<00:02:25.590> most<00:02:26.460> comfortable

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
it comfortable being most comfortable

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
difficult or how how did you describe it

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.930 
difficult or how how did you describe it
well<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.150> find<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.040> Europa<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.550> example

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
well I find like the Europa for example

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.730 
well I find like the Europa for example
they<00:02:36.090> do<00:02:36.150> their<00:02:36.450> shows<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.960> big<00:02:37.110> convention

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
they do their shows in a big convention

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.680 
they do their shows in a big convention
center<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.310> lighting<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.210> generally

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
center and the lighting is it generally

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.360 
center and the lighting is it generally
a<00:02:39.720> little<00:02:39.990> bit<00:02:40.110> harsher<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.160> actually

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
a little bit harsher so you actually

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.040 
a little bit harsher so you actually
have<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.880> come<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.240> little<00:02:42.270> bit<00:02:42.540> leaner<00:02:42.750> for

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
have to come in a little bit leaner for

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.830 
have to come in a little bit leaner for
these<00:02:43.170> shows<00:02:43.410> because<00:02:43.700> everything<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:45.690> not

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
these shows because everything it's not

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.720 
these shows because everything it's not
generous<00:02:46.320> whereas<00:02:46.770> if<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> show<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:47.640> a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
generous whereas if you do a show in a

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.790 
generous whereas if you do a show in a
theater<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.330> professional<00:02:48.959> lighting<00:02:49.200> it's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
theater with professional lighting it's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.860 
theater with professional lighting it's
a<00:02:49.920> little<00:02:50.130> bit<00:02:50.220> softer<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.570> little<00:02:51.810> bit

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
a little bit softer and a little bit

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.020 
a little bit softer and a little bit
more<00:02:52.020> complementary<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> find<00:02:53.640> even<00:02:53.910> with

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
more complementary so I find even with

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.520 
more complementary so I find even with
the<00:02:54.150> pictures<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.810> pictures<00:02:54.840> always<00:02:55.380> look

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the pictures the pictures always look

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
in an expo it's so hard because it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.740 
in an expo it's so hard because it's
under<00:02:59.370> these<00:02:59.490> huge<00:02:59.790> flood<00:03:00.030> lights<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.420> as<00:03:00.570> well

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
under these huge flood lights so as well

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.180 
under these huge flood lights so as well
as<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> professional<00:03:01.590> lighting<00:03:01.740> is<00:03:01.950> at<00:03:02.100> the

as the professional lighting is at the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.740 
as the professional lighting is at the
