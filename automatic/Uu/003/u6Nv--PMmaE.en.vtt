00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
that and I'm a man I remember seeing it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.170 
that and I'm a man I remember seeing it
in<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.710> book<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:28.010> long<00:01:28.160> time<00:01:28.400> ago<00:01:28.550> was<00:01:28.850> like<00:01:29.000> 10

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
in the book a long time ago was like 10

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.880 
in the book a long time ago was like 10
bucks<00:01:29.330> or<00:01:29.570> something<00:01:29.690> so<00:01:30.380> I'm<00:01:30.440> guessing<00:01:30.620> it's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
bucks or something so I'm guessing it's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.320 
bucks or something so I'm guessing it's
around<00:01:31.070> ten<00:01:31.250> bucks<00:01:31.430> though<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.090> think<00:01:32.270> the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
around ten bucks though but I think the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.050 
around ten bucks though but I think the
best<00:01:32.480> fine<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.080> far<00:01:33.260> was<00:01:33.610> sleep<00:01:34.610> water<00:01:34.850> number

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
best fine so far was sleep water number

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.180 
best fine so far was sleep water number
one<00:01:36.160> pretty<00:01:37.160> good<00:01:37.990> condition<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.560> they<00:01:40.010> don't

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
one pretty good condition and they don't

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.120 
one pretty good condition and they don't
have<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.460> maggot<00:01:40.970> border<00:01:41.270> in<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.600> store<00:01:41.870> but

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
have a maggot border in the store but

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.040 
have a maggot border in the store but
like<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.280> spine<00:01:43.580> has<00:01:43.790> very<00:01:44.180> minimal<00:01:44.630> creases

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
like the spine has very minimal creases

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.170 
like the spine has very minimal creases
on<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.350> corners<00:01:45.740> like<00:01:45.770> kind<00:01:46.040> of<00:01:46.100> sharp<00:01:46.370> call<00:01:47.060> it

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180
