glove<00:01:42.689> line<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.170> fact<00:01:43.680> Wilson<00:01:44.130> brought<00:01:44.310> them

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
glove line in fact Wilson brought them

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
glove line in fact Wilson brought them
to<00:01:44.880> spring<00:01:45.149> training<00:01:45.329> gave<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> all

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
to spring training gave them out to all

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
to spring training gave them out to all
the<00:01:46.500> pros<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.670> everything<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.479> great

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the pros and everything was going great

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.980 
the pros and everything was going great
until<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.320> mobi<00:01:49.649> said<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.189> they<00:01:50.909> will<00:01:51.450> mo<00:01:51.750> be

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
until I mobi said that they will mo be

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.499 
until I mobi said that they will mo be
outlawed<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> white<00:01:52.920> silver<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:53.970> gray

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
outlawed the white silver and gray

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.480 
outlawed the white silver and gray
colorway<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.530> Wilson<00:01:55.799> ought<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> completely

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
colorway so Wilson ought to completely

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
colorway so Wilson ought to completely
scratch<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:58.049> sucks<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.799> think

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
scratch this which sucks because I think

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
scratch this which sucks because I think
that<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.850> probably<00:02:00.390> Wilson's<00:02:01.049> best

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that this is probably Wilson's best

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.620 
that this is probably Wilson's best
color<00:02:01.469> wherever<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.880> white<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.360> black

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
color wherever the white with the black
