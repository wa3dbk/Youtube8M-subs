Greybeards are ancient people assumed to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
Greybeards are ancient people assumed to
be<00:00:41.579> Nords<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.379> idea<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
be Nords and this is my idea of what a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.250 
be Nords and this is my idea of what a
great<00:00:44.190> beard<00:00:44.430> might<00:00:44.730> look<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.930> live<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
great beard might look like they live in

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.490 
great beard might look like they live in
a<00:00:46.350> temple<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.390> structure<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.260> called

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
a temple like structure and it's called

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.860 
a temple like structure and it's called
high<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.039> oath<00:00:50.219> guard<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:51.510> pictures

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
high here oath guard and these pictures

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139 
high here oath guard and these pictures
are<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> actual<00:00:52.829> pictures<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.030> an

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
are not the actual pictures it's just an

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.790 
are not the actual pictures it's just an
idea<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> might<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.739> like

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
idea of what I think it might look like

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.430 
idea of what I think it might look like
in<00:00:56.190> high<00:00:56.969> he<00:00:57.270> wrote<00:00:57.420> guards<00:00:57.780> located<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
in high he wrote guards located at the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
in high he wrote guards located at the
highest<00:00:58.710> mountain<00:00:59.219> peak<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.550> Skyrim<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.210> it's

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
highest mountain peak in Skyrim and it's

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.869 
highest mountain peak in Skyrim and it's
called<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> throat<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.949> world<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
called the throat of the world the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
called the throat of the world the
Greybeards<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.600> absolute<00:01:04.199> masters<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
Greybeards are absolute masters of the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
Greybeards are absolute masters of the
voice<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.360> live<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.540> absolute<00:01:07.200> silence

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
voice and they live in absolute silence

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.990 
voice and they live in absolute silence
so<00:01:08.010> I'm<00:01:08.070> guessing<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.520> means<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:08.880> don't

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so I'm guessing that means they don't

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
so I'm guessing that means they don't
talk<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.330> much<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.799> speak

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
talk very much but when they do speak

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.570 
talk very much but when they do speak
storms<00:01:12.180> happen<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.560> top<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.010> mountain<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
storms happen on top of the mountain and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.840 
storms happen on top of the mountain and
it<00:01:14.729> causes<00:01:14.930> avalanches<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.610> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it causes avalanches and this is the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
it causes avalanches and this is the
idea<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.110> an<00:01:19.229> idea<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> inside

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
idea this is an idea of what the inside

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
idea this is an idea of what the inside
of<00:01:20.520> high<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.330> our<00:01:21.479> might<00:01:21.630> look<00:01:21.750> like

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of high here with our might look like

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
of high here with our might look like
but<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> temple<00:01:23.310> looking

here if car and be trained by the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.819 
here if car and be trained by the
Greybeards<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> guess<00:01:46.110> these<00:01:46.290> guys<00:01:46.350> are

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

master<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> Dragon<00:01:48.659> language<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> was

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
master of the Dragon language so I was

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.109 
master of the Dragon language so I was
