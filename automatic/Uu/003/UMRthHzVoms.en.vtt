00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 to youtube 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.840
 hello how about my dear but crazy today 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.360
 it's a Christmas tutorial Thursday 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.760
 course and we're going to make a super 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320
 easy and fast but not so easy 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.780
 if you are going to do many many for 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.640
 decorating your Christmas tree is about 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.500
 how to make some snowflakes with 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.150
 hot silicone 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.460
 surely many of you may already know 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.159
 this idea because I found it in painters 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.509
 but I said then let's take it to the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.420
 people who see me and who do not 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.729
 you know this idea so it's very easy 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.950
 to do very carefully and see you 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.570
 next Thursday or in the next video 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 good vibes bye 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.300
 to start you need to draw a snowflake 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.880
 of snow or print one you find yourself in 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.310
 google images first I make a 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 vertical line of 10 centimeters 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.560
 and he marked the center at 5 centimeters 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 then we draw two more lines 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 diagonal of 10 centimeters crossing the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.330
 center of them or the 5 centimeters 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.750
 by the point at 5 centimeters from the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.750
 vertical 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.229
 now we will make three lines of 6 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.360
 centimeters each two diagonals and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.860
 a horizontal one we go to the center of 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.150
 them at three centimeters by the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.150
 center of which we already marked 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.830
 finally draw the twigs in each 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.830
 line 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.740
 since you have your snowflake drawn 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 we will place waxed paper on top and 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.400
 we stick with some tape 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.260
 If you do not have paper, you can draw your 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.900
 snowflake in a glass or mirror 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.380
 put a little cream and so do your 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.380
 snowflake day 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.950
 Well now we start putting the cid 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.340
 and the silicon above the lines of 10 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.340
 centimeters 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.359
 we wait for it to dry in a little and then 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.519
 we put more silicon on top of 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.170
 the ones that we already put so that we have 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.750
 thicker and more resistant 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.280
 and before I know it sprays a lot of 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.280
 keeps mostly silicone 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.610
 all right 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.270
 since you have removed the excess 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.340
 diamond now follows that we review with 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.560
 silicon small lines those of 6 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.270
 centimeters when putting these atlas lines 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.190
 from above the silicon that is already 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.400
 put so that they can hold on and stick 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.400
 all right 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.310
 again once you wait for it to dry 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.160
 little and repeat do not forget the second 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.530
 once put the diamond now follow the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.660
 twigs these also put them from 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.580
 above the silicon that is already on and 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.489
 try the fresh silicone next door 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.169
 opposite join with the one in front to 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.669
 these twigs just put a layer of 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.669
 silicon and do not forget the diamond 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.469
 when you 're done and it's dry, it's still 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.750
 detach the codend very carefully 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:38.599
 first sheds all the ends and 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.699
 the twigs little by little if it breaks 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.120
 one just goes back to paste with a bit of 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.120
 silicone 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.050
 when you have it unfolded removes 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.620
 all the silicon and short yarns 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.620
 The excesses 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.840
 finally flip your codend and hit him with 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.120
 the same silicon a wire and then 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.120
 ribbon to hang it and ready
