you<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.979> when<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> first<00:01:11.430> saw<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.909> image<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you see when I first saw this image on

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
you see when I first saw this image on
the<00:01:12.570> new<00:01:12.689> indie<00:01:12.960> DV<00:01:13.229> page<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.710> kind<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> thought

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the new indie DV page I kind of thought

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
the new indie DV page I kind of thought
that<00:01:14.340> maybe<00:01:14.729> he's<00:01:15.180> almost<00:01:15.420> doing<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> add

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that maybe he's almost doing this to add

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.140 
that maybe he's almost doing this to add
a<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> suspense<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.009> each<00:01:17.159> image<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.820> yeah

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
a bit of suspense to each image so yeah

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.460 
a bit of suspense to each image so yeah
thought<00:01:18.450> he<00:01:18.570> would<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:18.960> post<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.380> on

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
thought he would kind of just post up on

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.690 
thought he would kind of just post up on
Scott<00:01:19.710> games<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> everyone<00:01:20.460> would<00:01:20.610> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Scott games and everyone would be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.859 
Scott games and everyone would be
pondering<00:01:21.000> over<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> could<00:01:21.600> mean<00:01:21.630> I'm

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
pondering over what it could mean I'm

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.179 
pondering over what it could mean I'm
finding<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> clues<00:01:22.500> within<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> then

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
finding all the clues within and then

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.289 
finding all the clues within and then
the<00:01:23.310> image<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.580> kind<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.939> tossed<00:01:24.150> aside

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the image would kind of be tossed aside

characters seem to be from the Freddy
fazbear's<00:03:17.280> pizza<00:03:17.489> chain<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.570> could<00:03:18.720> be

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
fazbear's pizza chain so it could be

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.240 
fazbear's pizza chain so it could be
referring<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.410> Fred<00:03:19.620> best<00:03:19.799> family<00:03:20.070> diner

referring to the Fred best family diner

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.100 
referring to the Fred best family diner

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
company possibly being the more deranged

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.440

side<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.590> Freddy<00:03:22.829> fazbear's<00:03:23.160> pizza<00:03:23.400> we<00:03:24.180> don't

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
side of Freddy fazbear's pizza we don't

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.850 
side of Freddy fazbear's pizza we don't
really<00:03:24.630> know<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.140> could<00:03:25.290> mean<00:03:25.320> but<00:03:25.709> I

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
really know what it could mean but I

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.050 
really know what it could mean but I
definitely<00:03:26.100> think<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.579> these<00:03:26.670> guys<00:03:26.910> are

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
definitely think that these guys are

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.670 
definitely think that these guys are
coming<00:03:27.239> back<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.780> presence<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.290> whenever

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.990 
coming back in the presence of whenever
this<00:03:28.799> new<00:03:29.040> game<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.340> set<00:03:29.489> rather<00:03:29.670> than<00:03:29.880> a

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
this new game is set rather than a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.370 
this new game is set rather than a
sequel<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:30.540> anything<00:03:30.720> because<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.230> their

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
sequel or anything because of their

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.350 
sequel or anything because of their
witness<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.040> design<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.820> actually<00:03:32.970> think

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
witness and design and I actually think

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.600 
witness and design and I actually think
regardless<00:03:34.079> of<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> whole<00:03:34.530> nightmare<00:03:34.860> naming

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
regardless of the whole nightmare naming

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.440 
regardless of the whole nightmare naming
that<00:03:35.700> these<00:03:35.850> guys<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.180> got<00:03:36.299> they're

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
that these guys have got they're

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.880 
that these guys have got they're
definitely<00:03:36.660> going<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:36.989> be<00:03:37.110> real<00:03:37.320> characters

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
definitely going to be real characters

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.500 
definitely going to be real characters
definitely<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.700> makes<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.269> where

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
definitely and it makes you think where

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.120 
definitely and it makes you think where
the<00:03:39.690> location<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.350> this<00:03:40.500> game<00:03:40.650> will<00:03:40.799> be<00:03:40.829> safe

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the location of this game will be safe

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.440

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
it is actually in the present day

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.449 
it is actually in the present day
because<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:43.140> know<00:03:43.320> all<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.860> previous

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
because we know all the previous

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.979 
because we know all the previous
pizzerias<00:03:45.060> have<00:03:45.269> been<00:03:45.390> closed<00:03:45.750> for

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
sanitation reasons fires etc etc so just

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.840 
sanitation reasons fires etc etc so just
make<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.739> think<00:03:49.980> maybe<00:03:50.220> they'll<00:03:50.430> go<00:03:50.610> back<00:03:50.820> to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
make you think maybe they'll go back to

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.000 
make you think maybe they'll go back to
the<00:03:51.060> origins<00:03:51.600> maybe<00:03:51.870> they'll<00:03:52.170> open<00:03:52.350> up<00:03:52.799> this

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
the origins maybe they'll open up this

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.140 
the origins maybe they'll open up this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
maybe we'll see this establishment we

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.590 
maybe we'll see this establishment we
never<00:03:55.739> saw<00:03:55.980> before<00:03:56.160> for<00:03:56.700> all<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:56.910> know<00:03:57.120> yes

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
never saw before for all we know yes

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.390 
never saw before for all we know yes
exactly<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.350> could<00:03:58.380> be<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.590> whole<00:03:58.769> multitude<00:03:58.980> of

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
exactly it could be a whole multitude of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.009 
exactly it could be a whole multitude of
things<00:03:59.579> but<00:03:59.790> until<00:04:00.030> Scott<00:04:00.540> believes<00:04:00.660> his<00:04:00.900> new

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
things but until Scott believes his new

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.120 
things but until Scott believes his new
teasers<00:04:01.320> on<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.560> we<00:04:01.799> can't<00:04:02.040> really

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
teasers on this we can't really

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.500 
teasers on this we can't really
speculate<00:04:02.459> too<00:04:02.730> much<00:04:02.850> because<00:04:03.180> these

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
speculate too much because these

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.759 
speculate too much because these
characters<00:04:03.840> are<00:04:04.140> all<00:04:04.260> coming<00:04:04.500> from<00:04:04.620> an

characters are all coming from an

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.590 
characters are all coming from an
entirely<00:04:05.160> new<00:04:05.489> background<00:04:05.730> yeah<00:04:06.299> all<00:04:06.570> of
