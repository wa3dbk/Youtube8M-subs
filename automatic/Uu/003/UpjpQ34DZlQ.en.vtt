00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.070 

one<00:00:01.909> alright<00:00:02.909> for<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.240> next<00:00:03.570> experiment

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
one alright for this next experiment

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.369 
one alright for this next experiment
we're<00:00:04.410> gonna<00:00:04.560> use<00:00:05.250> some<00:00:05.700> zinc<00:00:06.150> metal<00:00:06.569> and

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
we're gonna use some zinc metal and

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.440 
we're gonna use some zinc metal and
we're<00:00:07.560> gonna<00:00:07.680> mix<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.400> zinc<00:00:08.639> metal<00:00:08.970> solid

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
we're gonna mix the zinc metal solid

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.589 
we're gonna mix the zinc metal solid
here<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:10.410> some<00:00:10.769> hydrochloric<00:00:11.550> acid<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
here with some hydrochloric acid so the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.209 
here with some hydrochloric acid so the
concentration<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> hydrochloric<00:00:13.950> acid

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
concentration of the hydrochloric acid

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.519 
concentration of the hydrochloric acid
we'll<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.400> using<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.940> three<00:00:15.269> molars<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.379> what

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
we'll be using is three molars so what

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.720 
we'll be using is three molars so what
are<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.490> we're<00:00:17.699> going

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
are we going to do is that we're going

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.910 
are we going to do is that we're going
to<00:00:17.910> put<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> zinc<00:00:18.779> metal<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.289> we're

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
to put some of the zinc metal and we're

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.370 
to put some of the zinc metal and we're
going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.070> put<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.369> into<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.210> balloon<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
going to put it into the balloon so you

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
going to put it into the balloon so you
want<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:23.340> small<00:00:23.699> pieces<00:00:24.029> because

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
want to have really small pieces because

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.179 
want to have really small pieces because
you<00:00:24.539> want<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> increase<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> surface<00:00:25.830> area

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
you want to increase the surface area

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.269 
you want to increase the surface area
and<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.510> react<00:00:27.930> faster<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and you want it to react faster if you

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.240 
and you want it to react faster if you
have<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.730> big<00:00:29.939> chunks<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.539> zinc<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.740> your

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
have really big chunks of zinc then your

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
have really big chunks of zinc then your
reaction<00:00:32.700> will<00:00:32.790> still<00:00:33.059> occur<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> will

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
reaction will still occur but it will

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.770 
reaction will still occur but it will
just<00:00:34.230> take<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> little<00:00:34.800> bit<00:00:34.950> more<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.270> now

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
just take a little bit more time so now

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.470 
just take a little bit more time so now
I'm<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.399> try<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> stuff<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.120> balloon

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I'm just gonna try to stuff this balloon

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.410 
I'm just gonna try to stuff this balloon
with<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.379> more<00:00:40.530> zinc<00:00:41.360> trying<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
with a little bit more zinc trying to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.799 
with a little bit more zinc trying to
put<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.719> many<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:43.230> pieces<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.770> possible

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
put as many little pieces as possible

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.860 
put as many little pieces as possible
and<00:00:45.809> once<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.469> balloon<00:00:47.629> once<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> have

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and once you have balloon once you have

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
and once you have balloon once you have
the<00:00:49.020> zinc<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> balloon<00:00:50.719> then<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.930> need

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the zinc into the balloon then you need

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
the zinc into the balloon then you need
to<00:00:53.840> put<00:00:54.840> your<00:00:54.989> hydrochloric<00:00:55.739> acid<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to put your hydrochloric acid I think I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
to put your hydrochloric acid I think I
have<00:00:56.789> enough<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:57.649> put<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.890> your

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
have enough here put some of your

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.150 
have enough here put some of your
hydrochloric<00:00:59.550> acid<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.620> arm<00:01:01.800> iron

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
hydrochloric acid in to your arm iron

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.080 
hydrochloric acid in to your arm iron
flask<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.909> pour<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> little

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
flask so I'm just gonna pour a little

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.219 
flask so I'm just gonna pour a little
bit<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:09.110> would<00:01:10.110> say<00:01:10.229> roughly<00:01:10.860> about<00:01:11.630> 50<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> 70

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
bit I would say roughly about 50 to 70

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
bit I would say roughly about 50 to 70
millimeters<00:01:13.799> depending<00:01:14.610> upon<00:01:14.970> how<00:01:15.330> much<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
millimeters depending upon how much of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.690 
millimeters depending upon how much of
the<00:01:15.750> zinc<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> use<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.250> second

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the zinc that you use and the second

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.050 
the zinc that you use and the second
step<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> try<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.909> this

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
step of this is going to try to put this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
step of this is going to try to put this
balloon<00:01:21.390> over<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.900> moat<00:01:22.140> off<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.650> Arlen

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
balloon over the moat off your Arlen

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
balloon over the moat off your Arlen
Myra<00:01:23.100> flask<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.759> once<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> over<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
Myra flask and once you have it over and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.010 
Myra flask and once you have it over and
you're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.650> empty<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.840> zinc<00:01:27.840> metal

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
you're going to empty your zinc metal

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
you're going to empty your zinc metal
into<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> flask<00:01:29.009> alright<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.299> question

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
into the flask alright so the question

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
into the flask alright so the question
here<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> single

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
here is that this is a single

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.210 
here is that this is a single
displacement<00:01:33.030> reaction<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.590> HCl

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
displacement reaction so we have HCl

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
displacement reaction so we have HCl
plus<00:01:35.880> zinc<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.900> single<00:01:37.259> displacement

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
plus zinc in a single displacement

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260 
plus zinc in a single displacement
reaction<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
reaction so what do you think the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.130 
reaction so what do you think the
products<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.020 

so<00:01:46.140> after<00:01:46.470> five<00:01:46.770> minutes<00:01:47.160> or<00:01:47.310> even<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.850> if

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so after five minutes or even more if

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.000 
so after five minutes or even more if
you<00:01:48.150> want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.630> wait<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.770> just

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
you want to wait a little bit more just

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.400 
you want to wait a little bit more just
to<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.370> balloon<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> little<00:01:50.910> bit<00:01:51.000> bigger

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
to get the balloon a little bit bigger

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.050 
to get the balloon a little bit bigger
that's<00:01:52.410> fine<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.580> after<00:01:53.880> five

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that's fine but this is after five

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.490 
that's fine but this is after five
minutes<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.600> see<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:54.990> balloon<00:01:55.140> has

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
minutes you can see the balloon has

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.070 
minutes you can see the balloon has
inflated<00:01:56.220> quite<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.700> again<00:01:57.510> this<00:01:57.870> is<00:01:58.050> a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
inflated quite a bit again this is a

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.930 
inflated quite a bit again this is a
single<00:01:58.440> displacement<00:01:58.740> reaction<00:01:59.400> so<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.610> can

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
single displacement reaction so you can

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.910 
single displacement reaction so you can
see<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.330> this<00:02:00.510> reaction<00:02:00.840> actually<00:02:01.470> gives

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
see that this reaction actually gives

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.850 
see that this reaction actually gives
you<00:02:02.100> h2<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.180> hydrogen<00:02:03.540> gas<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.170> zinc

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you h2 which is a hydrogen gas and zinc

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.860 
you h2 which is a hydrogen gas and zinc
chloride<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.730> this<00:02:05.910> zinc<00:02:06.390> chloride<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
chloride so this zinc chloride is

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.090 
chloride so this zinc chloride is
actually<00:02:07.170> still<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.440> solution

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
actually still in solution

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.040 
actually still in solution
what's<00:02:08.580> collected<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.899> be

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
what's collected here is going to be

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.440 
what's collected here is going to be
your<00:02:10.350> hydrogen<00:02:10.649> gas<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.670> how<00:02:11.850> can<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.120> test

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
your hydrogen gas so how can we test

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760 
your hydrogen gas so how can we test
this<00:02:12.690> hydrogen<00:02:13.230> gas

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this hydrogen gas

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
this hydrogen gas
well<00:02:14.340> first<00:02:14.610> I'm<00:02:14.820> gonna<00:02:15.030> try<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.300> take<00:02:15.840> this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
well first I'm gonna try to take this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.100 
well first I'm gonna try to take this
off<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.770> put<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.370> into<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.850> fume<00:02:18.120> hood<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
off and put this into the fume hood and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
off and put this into the fume hood and
then<00:02:20.070> I'm<00:02:20.280> gonna<00:02:20.430> tie<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:20.880> up<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> test

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
then I'm gonna tie this up so to test

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.450 
then I'm gonna tie this up so to test
this<00:02:33.410> because<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.440> know<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.860> properties<00:02:35.430> of

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
this because I know the properties of

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.560 
this because I know the properties of
hydrogen<00:02:36.330> hydrogen<00:02:36.990> gas<00:02:37.730> move<00:02:38.730> out<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
hydrogen hydrogen gas move out of the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.920 
hydrogen hydrogen gas move out of the
way<00:02:40.670> I'm<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:41.820> sure<00:02:41.940> you're<00:02:42.090> gonna<00:02:42.180> light<00:02:42.780> it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
way I'm not sure you're gonna light it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.740 
way I'm not sure you're gonna light it
and<00:02:43.320> put<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:43.980> open<00:02:44.280> flame<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.450> I'm<00:02:45.570> gonna

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
and put it into open flame so I'm gonna

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.870 
and put it into open flame so I'm gonna
take<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.410> balloon<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.400> very<00:02:47.580> important

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
take this balloon this is very important

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.220 
take this balloon this is very important
because<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.300> not<00:02:48.450> want<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.930> hold<00:02:49.110> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
because you do not want to hold this

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.380 
because you do not want to hold this
balloon<00:02:49.530> over<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.550> open<00:02:50.820> flame<00:02:50.970> because

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
balloon over the open flame because

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.810 
balloon over the open flame because
that's<00:02:51.600> very<00:02:51.780> dangerous<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:53.040> I'm<00:02:53.130> gonna<00:02:53.280> put

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
that's very dangerous so I'm gonna put

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.250 
that's very dangerous so I'm gonna put
this<00:02:54.030> at<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.630> end<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.020> meter<00:02:55.260> stick<00:02:57.260> I'm

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
this at the end of a meter stick I'm

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.220 
this at the end of a meter stick I'm
just<00:02:58.500> gonna<00:02:58.650> tape<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:58.920> down<00:03:03.290> out<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> way

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
just gonna tape it down out of the way

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.870 
just gonna tape it down out of the way
and<00:03:07.230> here<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.590> my<00:03:07.800> candle<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> I'll<00:03:08.580> light<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
and here is my candle and I'll light the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.580 
and here is my candle and I'll light the
candle<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.450> now<00:03:12.690> I'm<00:03:12.750> gonna<00:03:12.870> put<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.140> balloon

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
candle and now I'm gonna put the balloon

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.250 
candle and now I'm gonna put the balloon
over<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.310> candle<00:03:14.940> all<00:03:15.239> over<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> open<00:03:16.110> flame

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
over the candle all over the open flame

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.100 
over the candle all over the open flame
if<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.340> hydrogen<00:03:17.730> gas<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.660> should<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.080> a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
if it is hydrogen gas you should see a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.680 
if it is hydrogen gas you should see a
pretty<00:03:19.769> strong<00:03:20.070> reaction<00:03:20.360> alright<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.630> I'm

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
pretty strong reaction alright so I'm

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.020 
pretty strong reaction alright so I'm
gonna<00:03:21.810> put<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.110> over<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.680> catwalk<00:03:26.030> and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
gonna put this over the catwalk and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.940 
gonna put this over the catwalk and
that's<00:03:27.269> there<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.840> go<00:03:27.989> single<00:03:28.350> displacement

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
that's there you go single displacement

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.370 
that's there you go single displacement
