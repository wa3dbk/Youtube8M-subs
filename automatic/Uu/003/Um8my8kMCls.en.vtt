to glitch the system so basically what
happens<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:20.310> soon<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.270> die<00:01:21.570> if

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
happens is that as soon as you die if

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.749

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 

I've<00:01:30.000> dated<00:01:30.180> some<00:01:30.420> history<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.870> it<00:01:31.050> works

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
I've dated some history and it works

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.920 
I've dated some history and it works
great<00:01:31.800> I'm<00:01:32.520> guessing<00:01:33.150> it'll<00:01:33.300> work<00:01:33.660> just<00:01:33.690> fine

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
great I'm guessing it'll work just fine

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.640 
great I'm guessing it'll work just fine
for<00:01:34.260> Xbox<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.010> ps4<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:36.060> Xbox<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.530> all<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
for Xbox and ps4 and Xbox one all you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.960 
for Xbox and ps4 and Xbox one all you
have<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.800> do<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.190> just<00:01:38.400> shut<00:01:38.730> down<00:01:38.760> your

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
have to do is just shut down your

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
have to do is just shut down your
console<00:01:39.330> or<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.960> got<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> internet<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
console or this got the internet but I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.310 
console or this got the internet but I
think<00:01:41.790> happens<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> shut<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
think happens is that you shut down the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740 
think happens is that you shut down the
console<00:01:43.650> so<00:01:43.800> fast<00:01:44.100> II<00:01:44.400> do<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:44.970> let<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
console so fast II do not let the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.830 
console so fast II do not let the
Rockstar<00:01:46.350> servers<00:01:46.860> sync<00:01:47.190> with<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:48.180> death<00:01:48.510> or

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
Rockstar servers sync with your death or

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.400 
Rockstar servers sync with your death or
your<00:01:49.530> progress<00:01:50.780> therefore<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.110> does<00:01:52.380> not

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
your progress therefore it does not

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.350 
your progress therefore it does not
reset<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.010> criminal<00:01:53.430> mess<00:01:53.580> from<00:01:53.700> each<00:01:53.850> other

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
reset your criminal mess from each other

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.720 
reset your criminal mess from each other
so<00:01:54.600> once<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.440> die<00:01:55.620> power<00:01:56.220> off<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.460> console

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
so once you die power off your console

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.560 
so once you die power off your console
so<00:01:59.730> as<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.150> can<00:02:00.300> see<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:01.170> died<00:02:01.590> quite<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.790> few
