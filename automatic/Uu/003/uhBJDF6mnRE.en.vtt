00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.910
 Drinkable water can be found at 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 Survive in the wilderness probably 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 one of the toughest ones as well 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.039
 key challenges that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.810
 problem even if I'm on me 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.240
 I can not drink it around 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 always as yet to potable 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 water the sign come now briefly 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.300
 before the leaves sprout is the birch 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.790
 a fantastic aquatic environment 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 I have to get a good two 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.380
 centimeter deep hole born 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.899
 Now I have a kitchen towel or just 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.450
 something else absorbent in front of the hole 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.160
 tie around all the water now what 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.840
 to pick up the tree 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.489
 The kitchen towel can be slow now 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 soak in the birch with the water 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.270
 spring is up to three liters 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.210
 day and i can get the water right away 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.590
 drink that already contains minerals 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.480
 But I can also equipped with 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.030
 a cotton kitchen towel t shirt or 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.520
 other absorbent fabric sheets and 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.980
 Dab off grasses so that the cloth 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.980
 slowly soaked with the morning dew 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.010
 rescued is relatively unscrupulous 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.170
 fresh spring water or rainwater 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.450
 I can almost snow that 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.520
 I should always drink everything else 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.120
 either I cook it up 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.100
 or I take one of these 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.660
 disinfectant tablets dirty 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.000
 or salt water has to change 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.979
 I'll do that by putting it up 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.220
 come and then a victorious one 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.720
 keep cottoncloth over it that catches the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.210
 water vapor on and as soon as I enough 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.460
 i can put it in an extra 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.110
 to containers deploy advantage is that since 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.420
 really no germs are in there anymore 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.250
 disadvantage is there are no trace element 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 they are not minerals 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.240
 that means I have to water 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.750
 mineralized in which I have a stone 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.970
 with purely casual or some paper 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.970
 that's possible too
