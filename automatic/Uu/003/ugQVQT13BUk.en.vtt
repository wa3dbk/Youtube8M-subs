 such as, for example, no longer responsible for a certain 10 though 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.989
 The growth teaches these reforms were for the 43 year old trustfull 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.380
 reason for choosing a different future 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.560
 such a club 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.830
 ajax is leaving in my case yes then that is something you are good about 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.980
 think and I did 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.900
 ajax is going to work in a slightly different way yes 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.370
 and there you have a choice of that will I can come in for more 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.670
 your hand and well i thought it was for me personal and and my 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.150
 develop my ambition 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.050
 is in a different area and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.220
 he has made the choice to make 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.450
 this one 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.930
 to extend this fantastic club 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.020
 then soul worked for four years in the youth of ajax 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.180
 in 2010 both the role and assistant trainer at ah one of sparta for 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.350
 the ajax c2 trainer who was transferring was therefore without mercy 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.100
 it was a fantastic 10 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 that's one of the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.910
 yes, much more fun and years I have experienced as a trainer 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.870
 it was a really great age 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.750
 with hunger incredibly alone full group 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.730
 and satisfy that hunger come to the goal 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.180
 and here are completely full of them allowed to train and are super like jason 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.730
 that gives a lot of energy 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.579
 after a year at the c2 the un fought 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.869
 in the two years that russell was in charge of this team how we, among other things 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.540
 against on youtube cup 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.890
 that's an age group that just 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.470
 martin boys nevertheless appeal to fall at a slightly different age 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.240
 she did something 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.410
 within the time with all 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.540
 well problem of that with all 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.940
 with terms of use, stars 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.460
 so that was 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 yes that was very nice and challenging, just a lot spicier 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.510
 the biggest challenge for trustfull at aex in advance 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.350
 as a trainer of that team, he saw one after the other in the past year 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.700
 top talent pass the championship with was of trust 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.809
 feels the third title in the last four years 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.479
 the beautiful honors list 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.800
 that's great fun 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.690
 in the end it is too simple and everyone knows that we hope within Ajax 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.319
 it is not the priority 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.929
 and that doesn't lie there either 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:33.890
 I have been there three times in my life and also became champion 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.910
 i can do all three times i can and up so often 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.880
 for the way that is happening and that we are in this DJ now at Ajax for it 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.769
 first and 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.279
 that's a live fish concert 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.539
 in the end i believe that too 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.609
 that experience ensure that when you are older 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.069
 That kind of competitions play that the experiences you father for that 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.709
 with the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.039
 who can help enormously in this way 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.850
 it is it is not the most important thing 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.319
 but if you can play that kind of law 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.289
 then you have to go for it 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.559
 it was a young players to doctor soul over the years a lot 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.579
 experience 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.349
 Well the nice thing about such a process is that you have an idea of ​​that beforehand 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.650
 only in the end it always turns out to be just that 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.650
 to be different 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.469
 and the things that followed sets the knees must be very flexible and and 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.179
 that is of course that is or is not the case 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:33.259
 what you learn along the way 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.259
 and that too is something i have that of course 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:41.729
 years of necessity in certain situations it has learned and 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.729
 yes that is something i think in the future the absolute 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.849
 wherever 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.949
 yes absolutely what you take with you and the construction that has helped me a lot 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.039
 paterson continuing his career must prove later 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.039
 yes that is still in the dark right now and 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.870
 what looks like now is the e 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.700
 German with his remote control in his own house 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.529
 that's one of the suspects 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:12.209
 so that's right now as it stands for men 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.589
 it is a matter of waiting 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.589
 olyphia bizzy wrong preference police 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.419
 to the extent that I want to do that because obama heart is and where I am completely 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.360
 stand behind 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.300
 and for which months commit 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.169
 and what exactly lies through this depends on the hope of course 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.169
 of the offers you receive 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.039
 So that is just waiting
