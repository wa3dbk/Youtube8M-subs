techincal<00:00:57.180> I've<00:00:57.809> said<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> before<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.859> not

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
techincal I've said that before I'm not

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.950 
techincal I've said that before I'm not
too<00:00:59.399> good<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> computer<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.539> my

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
too good with the computer but my

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
too good with the computer but my
printer<00:01:01.350> has<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> few<00:01:02.039> different<00:01:02.219> options<00:01:02.520> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
printer has a few different options of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.469 
printer has a few different options of
sizes<00:01:04.019> i<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.530> choose<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.820> i<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.240> click

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sizes i can choose from so i just click

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
sizes i can choose from so i just click
on<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.840> size<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> print<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
on that size and then I print it up and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
on that size and then I print it up and
I<00:01:08.580> hope<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.119> size<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> want

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I hope it's the right size that I want

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
I hope it's the right size that I want
because<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.920> don't<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.159> how<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
because I don't know how to make it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.490 
because I don't know how to make it
larger<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.420> smaller<00:01:12.630> besides<00:01:13.229> these

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
larger and smaller besides these

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.640 
larger and smaller besides these
standard<00:01:13.950> sizes<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.970> i<00:01:15.170> printed<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
standard sizes so i printed up for that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
standard sizes so i printed up for that
reason<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.220> make<00:01:17.310> sure<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:17.790> size

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
reason to make sure I get the right size

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740 
reason to make sure I get the right size
and<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> base<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.420> attach

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and so I have a base of what to attach

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.920 
and so I have a base of what to attach

videos is I also like to shade my

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.610 
videos is I also like to shade my
pattern<00:04:25.909> paper<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.750> pieced<00:04:27.110> on

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
pattern paper that I pieced on

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.770 
pattern paper that I pieced on
here<00:04:27.740> we<00:04:28.160> put<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:28.550> much<00:04:28.729> effort<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.389> so<00:04:29.600> much

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
here we put so much effort and so much

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.469 
here we put so much effort and so much
work<00:04:30.050> into<00:04:30.350> coloring<00:04:31.190> our<00:04:31.310> images<00:04:31.820> that

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
work into coloring our images that

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.750 
work into coloring our images that
sometimes<00:04:32.900> if<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.139> just<00:04:33.350> add<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:34.280> paper

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
sometimes if we just add the paper

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.670 
sometimes if we just add the paper
without<00:04:35.150> shading<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:35.900> looks<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.169> little<00:04:36.290> flat

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
without shading it looks a little flat

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.010 
without shading it looks a little flat
whereas<00:04:37.550> when<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:37.760> add<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.090> shading<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.750> just

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
whereas when you add the shading it just

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.350 
whereas when you add the shading it just
it<00:04:39.410> makes<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.160> image<00:04:40.310> flow<00:04:40.820> more<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.300> it

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
it makes the image flow more and it

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.390 
it makes the image flow more and it
looks<00:04:41.540> like<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.900> paper<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.889> pattern<00:04:43.220> paper

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
looks like the paper the pattern paper

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.790 
looks like the paper the pattern paper
is<00:04:43.580> supposed<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.060> be<00:04:44.180> this<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.690> how<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:45.260> paper
