00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello friends with you max lions 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.400
 and today I decided to gash another such 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.330
 a small little vidosik which 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 must occur at the end of the last 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.949
 episode 1 of the walking dead season 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.109
 me in the comments one person 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.050
 indignant wrote they say what the fuck are you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.080
 watched the credits and in short not 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.930
 saw the scene where to feed clementine 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 meets with amide and crista well and here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.439
 Now I hope all the same thing 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.969
 see I asked 0 notebooks tetra 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 there we turn off this whole thing 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.340
 we cut down all the game is over game over 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 as they say d and but at 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.190
 least i hope that now 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.680
 see it and let it so small 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.989
 Vidosik will be such a small 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.670
 cut scene but for now 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.440
 I can still say that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.199
 which I generally feel about this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.640
 games and in fact I feel the same 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.050
 most feel most of those 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.300
 who watched at least judging by 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.789
 comments all very sad all 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.780
 they say that a very sad end is that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.189
 just creepiness from tears flowed from the eyes and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.619
 it was hard just not no 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.750
 cry in general my life such 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.970
 There were two cases when I cried well 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.680
 actually crying over things like that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.360
 that is, over movies or what type of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.000
 the first time is when watching a movie 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.150
 hah and the second time is when i watched 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.159
 the final series of the series friends of friends in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.710
 2000s, that is, this one started 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.049
 2000s 2 this series when growing up and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.900
 Rachel embraced and said that we will 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.939
 together forever and this one walking 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.229
 dead the scene goodbye li and clementines 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.490
 in general, I am also very much 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 touched and in fact I don't know i would 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.720
 developer damn usatat for such 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.420
 damn thing but more but could not hoped 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 do well what the fuck is a nightmare 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.659
 simply 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.810
 and here are such here we had 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.040
 worry this whole parting 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.380
 farewell I actually had to 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.640
 relive it again since I could not 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 upload there somewhere in the very 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 late to run these here caption to me 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 I had to upload one of the last 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.090
 where I mean clementine 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.860
 whether she locked in this crap here and they 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 then tried to get out of there and there 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.540
 not all had to go through again only 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.189
 thanks to that i could on 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.609
 Bottom view here these titles 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.409
 End captions in this game and we are waiting 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.019
 We are waiting for when it's all over the titer of 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.760
 damn as much as nonsense in blockbusters 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.579
 Hollywood never damn see 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.980
 just in some star wars 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.569
 or I do not know where in the hobby can be 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 as much to see how many people 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.760
 worked on this game you can 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.750
 but the game is of course very very touching 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.730
 very powerful 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.790
 takes she can say clings to the soul 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.150
 and well, I don’t know if it’s good or bad 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.090
 at least it helps us but not 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.760
 I know how something new can be brighter 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.620
 feel life is so or hell knows what 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.569
 but in any case of games this art is 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.810
 art as well as paintings as well as 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.540
 music is also like poetry and the like 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.840
 things but art is in my opinion 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.239
 great everyone ran out of credits and what 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.859

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.750

 without it, the game is somehow incomplete 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.760
