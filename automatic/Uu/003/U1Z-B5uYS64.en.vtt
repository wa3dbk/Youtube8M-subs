00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:14.690
 and for all 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:25.199
 and so much wind because you see we come to the sun 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.080
 and where it was then is very important 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.080
 that you take responsibility for your letters 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.059
 tonight I sing more tell me that I 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.059
 you want 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.940
 I want that as something that was mine in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.079
 our portal is far away that if I 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.079
 in this match 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:00.719
 I want to hear that I will always love afloat 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.809
 while you failed me forgive me is what 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.809
 our crop suffered the night 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.650
 and half 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.820
 and I stayed 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.600
 if life does not help 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:36.310
 so in a way that they are followed by Latinos and 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:41.860
 after being with you we are passive 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.860
 and he tells me that he already has life 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.860
 possibility 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 Y 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.960
 with you only with you 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.369
 if I tell you that I love you we're going to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.039
 listen to the jury from the first time 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.200
 I would stay with all that is this 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.140
 formerly orita you had a stage 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.410
 and a nice one for you I do not know maybe you'll 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.980
 you got nervous or something but it's a lot 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.379
 value what you did you did not have to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.920
 do it you have to be obvious that you 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.120
 you forget no but you did it very well 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.880
 when he incorporates this again 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.930
 you grab phone and with strength with 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.239
 value this is me you go no I can not no 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.700
 I can close my eyes and say oh no 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.160
 It was wrong because I gas told me but 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.160
 I trust you are a guy with a good 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.310
 small talent and great apart to the 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.310
 then as an artist then very well 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.030
 I am going 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.850
 Well, look, when you started your 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.860
 song came up wow 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.840
 you are dancing you were singing and I 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.270
 I was thinking he learned all his 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.510
 low song is a song of many 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.520
 letters and that is a bit complicated a 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.820
 child so small because when you 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.800
 stop there and see your mom then waters 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.500
 we should not be distracted we must be 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.720
 always thinking very well what is being 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.150
 doing because he 's watching you 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.330
 a lot of people then you have to be more 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.880
 responsible for agreement in the next 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.650
 Once I hope that please there is no 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.730
 again that you will forget the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.560
 song do not turn around and that you tapes better 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.330
 remember me ok and fast agree 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.450
 because maybe someone else to the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.450
 door 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.830
 The most important thing is that they know how to solve 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.590
 and repeat 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.930
 Please know one that have class 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.790
 to resolve 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.590
 we need classes on how to solve how 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.420
 get out of the problem when we are in the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.860
 scenario because they are learning 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.410
 and we need to teach them that 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.870
 This is a child I like to see in 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.220
 the scenario that I have all the confidence 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.220
 that everything will turn out well 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.730
 but it's good it 's obvious everything 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.580
 It happened and I can not let it go 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.430
 it demands because you are very good if I 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.620
 I would have you do not give for more not you 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.080
 I would demand nothing, I would not care 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.260
 even see you but as I know you are very 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.230
 well that's why I'm going to demand more 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.430
 and more and more 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.430
 lola your vote 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.599
 your vote who are red are you at 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.429
 wait for the final decision runs with your 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.209
 mobile says that the next you're going to take 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:55.209
 more eager 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.350
 encouragement
