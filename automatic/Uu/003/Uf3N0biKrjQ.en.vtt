knotweed this is really my favorite
plant<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.710> plant<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.869> so

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
plant and it's the plant that so

writing a book and I got to know
Japanese<00:00:28.170> knotweed<00:00:28.470> many<00:00:29.340> years<00:00:29.640> ago<00:00:29.789> when<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
Japanese knotweed many years ago when I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.569 
Japanese knotweed many years ago when I
first<00:00:30.720> started<00:00:31.109> treating<00:00:31.380> Lyme<00:00:31.769> disease<00:00:32.189> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
first started treating Lyme disease and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.540 
first started treating Lyme disease and
learned<00:00:33.359> from<00:00:33.449> Steven<00:00:33.960> Buhner<00:00:34.289> that<00:00:34.589> this<00:00:35.370> was

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
learned from Steven Buhner that this was

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.910 
learned from Steven Buhner that this was
the<00:00:35.699> most<00:00:35.879> important<00:00:36.359> herb<00:00:37.139> to<00:00:37.379> use<00:00:37.589> in<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the most important herb to use in the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.309 
the most important herb to use in the
treatment<00:00:38.159> of<00:00:38.460> Lyme<00:00:38.639> disease<00:00:39.139> since<00:00:40.139> then

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:40.319 
treatment of Lyme disease since then

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.410 
treatment of Lyme disease since then
I've<00:00:40.469> learned<00:00:40.729> many<00:00:41.729> things<00:00:41.819> about<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
I've learned many things about the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.759 
I've learned many things about the
plants<00:00:42.839> not<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.139> how<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:44.479> helping<00:00:45.769> humans

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
plants not only how it's helping humans

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.000 
plants not only how it's helping humans
heal<00:00:47.010> from<00:00:47.339> disease<00:00:48.269> but<00:00:48.569> also<00:00:48.629> how<00:00:49.499> it<00:00:49.530> helps

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
heal from disease but also how it helps

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.180 
heal from disease but also how it helps
rehabilitate<00:00:51.350> lands<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.619> lives<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
rehabilitate lands where it lives and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.469 
rehabilitate lands where it lives and
helps<00:00:53.459> clean<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.699> environment<00:00:54.389> for<00:00:54.629> us<00:00:54.659> and

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
helps clean the environment for us and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.959 
helps clean the environment for us and
helps<00:00:57.479> protect<00:00:57.719> these<00:00:58.139> areas<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.549> been

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
helps protect these areas that have been

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.299 
helps protect these areas that have been
disturbed<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:00.839> human<00:01:01.529> development<00:01:02.069> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
disturbed by human development and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.000 
disturbed by human development and
pollution<00:01:02.729> so<00:01:03.269> it's<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.320> important<00:01:04.769> plant

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
pollution so it's a very important plant

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.499 
pollution so it's a very important plant
and<00:01:05.339> there's<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> good<00:01:05.700> reason<00:01:05.759> why<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.359> grows

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
and there's a good reason why it grows

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.279 
and there's a good reason why it grows
here<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.430> flourishes<00:01:08.430> where<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.759> does<00:01:09.200> it's<00:01:10.200> a

you<00:02:35.430> take<00:02:35.579> a<00:02:35.640> look<00:02:35.939> over<00:02:36.209> here<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:37.319> can<00:02:37.349> also

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you take a look over here you can also

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.979 
you take a look over here you can also
see<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.099> some<00:02:38.900> folks<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.109> tried<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.879> really

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
see that some folks have tried to really

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.530 
see that some folks have tried to really
try<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.019> get<00:02:43.170> rid<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:43.409> this<00:02:43.620> plant<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:45.209> fact

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
try to get rid of this plant and in fact

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.300 
try to get rid of this plant and in fact
this<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.989> second<00:02:46.590> cutting<00:02:46.799> they've<00:02:47.069> done

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
this is the second cutting they've done

this is the second cutting they've done
this<00:02:47.549> year<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.540> still<00:02:48.840> coming<00:02:49.079> back<00:02:49.349> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
this year and it's still coming back and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.030 
this year and it's still coming back and
really<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:51.720> cuttings<00:02:52.049> don't<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.409> much<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
really the cuttings don't do much to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.789 
really the cuttings don't do much to
keep<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.549> check<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.349> cuts<00:02:55.349> them<00:02:55.590> back

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
keep it in check it just cuts them back

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.550 
keep it in check it just cuts them back
and<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.930> still<00:02:58.349> flourishes<00:02:58.950> here<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
and and it still flourishes here so the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:12.410 
and and it still flourishes here so the
roots<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:02.099> where<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.549> find<00:03:04.129> medicine<00:03:07.519> and

diseases and that was through looking at
the<00:04:33.150> diet<00:04:33.390> of<00:04:33.890> europeans<00:04:34.890> who<00:04:35.340> ate<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:36.050> rich

red wine and in that red wine was found

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.950 
red wine and in that red wine was found
resveratrol<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.479> was<00:04:48.720> the

resveratrol and so that was the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.659 
resveratrol and so that was the
component<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.620> they<00:04:49.830> found<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.310> was

pieces<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.660> dry<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.320> then<00:05:20.039> further

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
pieces and dry it and then further

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.600 
pieces and dry it and then further
powder<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.349> and<00:05:22.740> put<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.070> into<00:05:23.340> capsules

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
powder that and put it into capsules

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.180 
powder that and put it into capsules
that<00:05:24.479> has<00:05:24.659> been<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.960> easiest<00:05:25.289> way

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
that has been the easiest way

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.350 
that has been the easiest way

people do make tinctures out of it

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.080 
people do make tinctures out of it
though<00:05:33.650> Buhner<00:05:34.650> does<00:05:34.860> not<00:05:35.070> recommend<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.670> in

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
though Buhner does not recommend that in
