00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
see here this is a bit harder to sort of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.039 
see here this is a bit harder to sort of
determine<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.850> assess<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
determine or assess because in the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.399 
determine or assess because in the
beginning<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:17.119> he<00:01:18.119> had<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> horrible<00:01:18.780> signal<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
beginning I he had a horrible signal and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
beginning I he had a horrible signal and
was<00:01:19.560> lagging<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.070> crazy<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.970> only<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
was lagging like crazy so not only is it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.609 
was lagging like crazy so not only is it
difficult<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:23.090> Cheyenne<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.330> kill<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
difficult for Cheyenne to kill the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.320 
difficult for Cheyenne to kill the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
quite frankly you know if we're in a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
quite frankly you know if we're in a
game<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:42.299> something<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> assess

game that's something I have to assess

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.069 
game that's something I have to assess
as<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.310> person<00:01:44.700> has<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
as well if the person has and this is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.050 
as well if the person has and this is
the<00:01:46.170> second<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.250> Apple<00:01:47.670> where's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the second I think this is Apple where's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
the second I think this is Apple where's
example<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:49.049> cocky<00:01:49.320> i<00:01:49.590> can't<00:01:49.860> remember<00:01:49.950> i

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
example don't cocky i can't remember i

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
example don't cocky i can't remember i
think<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.520> apple<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.149> two<00:01:51.329> three<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.740> one

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
think it's apple one two three are one

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.850 
think it's apple one two three are one
of<00:01:52.860> our<00:01:52.920> elite<00:01:53.189> snipers<00:01:53.700> anyway<00:01:54.509> um<00:01:55.610> basically

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
of our elite snipers anyway um basically

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.050 
of our elite snipers anyway um basically
you<00:01:58.860> know<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.340> look<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.640> them<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.969> have

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you know we have to look at them we have

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.870 
you know we have to look at them we have
to<00:02:00.210> say<00:02:00.360> okay<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.770> internet<00:02:02.130> signal<00:02:02.759> going

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
to say okay is the internet signal going

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.310 
to say okay is the internet signal going
to<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> problem<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.960> can't<00:02:04.170> have

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
though that's not going to be a good a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.470 
though that's not going to be a good a
good<00:02:23.070> thing<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.700> I'm<00:02:23.820> not<00:02:23.970> saying<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.300> we're

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
good thing and I'm not saying that we're

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.620 
good thing and I'm not saying that we're
not<00:02:24.600> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> use<00:02:24.870> them<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.350> again<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:27.510> know

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
not going to use them but again you know

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.090 
not going to use them but again you know
we<00:02:27.780> look<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.110> stability<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.860> sort<00:02:29.040> of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
we look for stability and that sort of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.950 
we look for stability and that sort of
thing<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.460> if<00:02:29.550> your<00:02:29.730> signals<00:02:30.210> really<00:02:30.450> bad<00:02:30.630> it

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
thing so if your signals really bad it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.810 
thing so if your signals really bad it
may<00:02:31.140> deter<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.950> or<00:02:32.190> prevent<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.790> from

on which is kind of an honorary member
of<00:02:59.040> NZT<00:02:59.450> he's<00:03:00.450> another<00:03:00.990> he<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.440> during<00:03:01.740> the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
of NZT he's another he was during the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.620 
of NZT he's another he was during the
sniper<00:03:02.100> tryouts<00:03:02.880> anyway<00:03:03.860> when<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:05.010> did<00:03:05.220> that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
sniper tryouts anyway when we did that

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.420 
sniper tryouts anyway when we did that
his<00:03:06.630> signal<00:03:06.990> is<00:03:07.110> fine<00:03:07.320> like<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.980> didn't<00:03:08.310> really

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
his signal is fine like I didn't really

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.400 
his signal is fine like I didn't really
notice<00:03:08.940> anything<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:09.900> bad<00:03:10.110> about<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
notice anything really bad about a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.500 
notice anything really bad about a
signal<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> matter<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.340> fact<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.390> only

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
signal as a matter of fact the only

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.840 
signal as a matter of fact the only
reason<00:03:13.020> why<00:03:13.200> he<00:03:13.230> didn't<00:03:13.770> make<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.220> is

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
reason why he didn't make it in is

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.640 
reason why he didn't make it in is
because<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.390> were<00:03:15.510> looking<00:03:15.780> for<00:03:15.810> gb's<00:03:16.410> which

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
because we were looking for gb's which

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.370 
because we were looking for gb's which
we<00:03:16.830> don't<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.220> any<00:03:17.400> more<00:03:17.610> for<00:03:18.200> certain<00:03:19.200> reasons

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
we don't do any more for certain reasons

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.640 
we don't do any more for certain reasons
but<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:21.300> know<00:03:21.450> his<00:03:21.690> signal<00:03:22.020> was<00:03:22.170> fine<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.560> he

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
but you know his signal was fine and he

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.110 
but you know his signal was fine and he
would<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.830> made<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.430> jeebies<00:03:23.760> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
would have made it in but in jeebies you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.330 
would have made it in but in jeebies you
can't<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.690> someone<00:03:25.320> from<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.800> European

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
can't have someone from the European

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.000 
can't have someone from the European
sort<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.270> connection<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.840> whatever<00:03:28.110> actually

play with North American teams it was

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.380 
play with North American teams it was
unfortunate<00:03:31.410> that's<00:03:32.190> why<00:03:32.400> i<00:03:32.430> say<00:03:32.700> honorary

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
unfortunate that's why i say honorary

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.199 
unfortunate that's why i say honorary
and<00:03:34.380> i<00:03:34.410> think<00:03:34.620> i<00:03:34.709> had<00:03:34.830> another<00:03:35.100> into<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.640> number

and i think i had another into a number
anyway<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.980> case<00:03:38.160> here<00:03:38.370> we're<00:03:38.520> not<00:03:38.610> going

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
to be doing gb so I'm not worried as

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.630 
to be doing gb so I'm not worried as
long<00:03:40.290> as<00:03:40.410> your<00:03:40.500> signals<00:03:40.890> fine<00:03:41.100> then<00:03:41.340> we<00:03:41.459> don't

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640

worry about it and like here Cheyenne at

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.910 
worry about it and like here Cheyenne at
first<00:03:45.209> had<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> rough<00:03:45.750> start<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.350> can<00:03:46.709> see

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
first had a rough start but you can see

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.490 
first had a rough start but you can see
that<00:03:46.950> his<00:03:47.340> signals<00:03:47.760> improved<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:49.170> it's<00:03:49.380> about
