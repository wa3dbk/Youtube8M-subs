I<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:49.860> totally<00:00:50.070> Jack<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> Beanstalk<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I was totally Jack and the Beanstalk I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.639 
I was totally Jack and the Beanstalk I
would<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.079> instead<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> coming

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
would go there and instead of coming

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.229 
would go there and instead of coming
home<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.920> mining<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:53.850> come<00:00:53.969> home<00:00:54.090> with

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
home with mining I would come home with

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.819 
home with mining I would come home with
motorcycle<00:00:54.360> parts<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> could<00:00:55.350> sell<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
motorcycle parts but I could sell the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
motorcycle parts but I could sell the
motorcycle<00:00:56.219> parts<00:00:56.430> easier<00:00:56.670> than<00:00:56.879> could<00:00:57.059> my

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
motorcycle parts easier than could my

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.619 
motorcycle parts easier than could my
art<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:58.829> came<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.250> where<00:00:59.460> it

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
art and then there came a time where it

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.420 
art and then there came a time where it
changed<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.469> people

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
changed and I could actually people

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.700 
changed and I could actually people
wanted<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.879> art<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> sake<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
wanted my art for the sake of that and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.770 
wanted my art for the sake of that and
that<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.250> interesting<00:01:05.400> moment<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.240> never

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that was an interesting moment I never

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.060 
that was an interesting moment I never
give<00:01:06.930> myself<00:01:07.110> enough<00:01:07.350> credit<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.650> having

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
give myself enough credit for having

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
give myself enough credit for having
enough<00:01:08.369> balance<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.939> life<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.659> think

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
enough balance in life but I think

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
enough balance in life but I think
that's<00:01:10.080> false<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.650> strive<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.189> balance

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that's false I strive for balance

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.760 
that's false I strive for balance
because<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.600> family<00:01:12.900> gives<00:01:13.350> me<00:01:13.650> balance

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
because my family gives me balance

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.179 
because my family gives me balance
because<00:01:14.549> I'm<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.119> polarized<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.770> love<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
because I'm so polarized in my love of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.100 
because I'm so polarized in my love of
motorcycling<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.119> sculpting<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
motorcycling and sculpting and that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.770 
motorcycling and sculpting and that
motorcycle<00:01:19.320> culture<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> find<00:01:20.850> refuge<00:01:21.180> in

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
motorcycle culture that I find refuge in

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
motorcycle culture that I find refuge in
the<00:01:21.840> church<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.650> my<00:01:22.680> family<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.759> I'm

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the church and in my family I know I'm

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.780 
the church and in my family I know I'm
most<00:01:24.840> certainly<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.220> perfect<00:01:26.490> Mormon

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
most certainly not the perfect Mormon

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
most certainly not the perfect Mormon
and<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> guy<00:01:28.080> teaching<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.650> lesson

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and I know the guy teaching the lesson

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
and I know the guy teaching the lesson
at<00:01:29.040> churches<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.490> either<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.630> he

at churches in either and so when he
makes<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.049> mistake<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:31.860> relish<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.790> but

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
makes a mistake I don't relish in it but

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
makes a mistake I don't relish in it but
I<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.240> oh<00:01:33.270> I'm<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> only<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.560> messes

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.940
