00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.800
 if you treat yourself to something good 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.939
 would like to get away with it for example 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.949
 It is important today if you already have money 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
 Spending that was just good 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.599
 quality has and that begins with the meat 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.410
 easy with the bottle line to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.900
 yes of course you need to be alive that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.400
 grew up well and in addition to steel from 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.930
 inside but then after that 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.610
 Butchering meat is just the thing 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.190
 very important and we have here now 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.829
 rib eye steak 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.409
 this part of the so between the wood and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.940
 the countries and that is wonderful now 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.710
 it is about six weeks 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 Hanging in the cold house you can see school 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.269
 should get outside for easy food 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.939
 but inside if you have that cut on 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.220
 it looks wonderfully pink and above all 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:06.330
 the meat is nice tender you notice 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.640
 because if you push the finger then 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.130
 this trough remains because it gives 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 never on and that means that's meat 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 very nice and delicate and above all things 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.009
 no more tension 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.079
 That's because after the slaughter 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.000
 that one sets it must I believe it 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:25.680
 really season a dead rigid 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.460
 valve and that means the muscles that is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.170
 yes muscle meat 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 the muscles are no longer with you 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.340
 so oxygen supplies are getting hard 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.520
 and if we go right after that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.930
 eating meat meat would be roast 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 then that would just be c out of the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 we are totally tense about the muscles 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.780
 become and therefore very important meat 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.270
 let mature rest 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 And then certain enzymes have that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.570
 chance these muscle fibers again 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.540
 I would split up the muscle fibers 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.060
 let's say that cut through and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.130
 This makes the meat extremely soft 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 extremely tasty so 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.509
 if you want to treat yourself go 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.400
 they just look more euro-wise though 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.700
 then they really enjoy what they are doing 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.700
 to have
