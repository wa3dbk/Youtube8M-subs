00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but the effort is extraordinary and one

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.529 
of the things that's doing is building
up<00:02:06.930> quad<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.590> glute<00:02:07.950> strength<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
up quad and glute strength because the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.029 
up quad and glute strength because the
snow<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.810> always<00:02:10.170> slipping<00:02:10.590> out<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:10.739> under

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
snow is always slipping out from under

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.979 
snow is always slipping out from under
my<00:02:11.160> feet<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.970> instead<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.330> getting<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.690> solid

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
my feet so instead of getting a solid

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.820 
my feet so instead of getting a solid
push

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
push

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
push
the<00:02:14.100> energy<00:02:14.490> goes<00:02:14.670> down<00:02:14.970> into<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> smell<00:02:15.720> and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the energy goes down into the smell and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.690 
the energy goes down into the smell and
sucks<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.500> energy<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.250> quads<00:02:17.490> and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
sucks more energy out of the quads and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.030 
sucks more energy out of the quads and
out<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:17.970> glutes<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.830> because<00:02:19.830> I'm

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
out of the glutes and because I'm

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.800 
out of the glutes and because I'm
wearing<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> big<00:02:20.460> heavy<00:02:20.670> boots<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.480> snow

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
wearing the big heavy boots in the snow

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.770 
wearing the big heavy boots in the snow
it<00:02:22.170> causes<00:02:22.800> me<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.370> lift<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:23.970> leg<00:02:24.210> higher<00:02:24.510> to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
it causes me to lift my leg higher to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.350 
it causes me to lift my leg higher to
get<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.140> above<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.770> snow<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.340> weight<00:02:27.180> of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
get up above the snow and the weight of

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.940 
get up above the snow and the weight of
the<00:02:27.450> boot<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.750> also<00:02:28.080> building<00:02:28.470> those<00:02:28.650> same

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the boot is also building those same

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.280 
the boot is also building those same
muscles<00:02:29.130> my<00:02:29.460> hip<00:02:29.610> abductors<00:02:30.090> which<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:30.960> me<00:02:31.080> up

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
muscles my hip abductors which get me up

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.140 
muscles my hip abductors which get me up
and<00:02:31.560> over<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> snow<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.340> pushing<00:02:32.730> me<00:02:32.790> towards

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and over the snow and pushing me towards

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.600 
and over the snow and pushing me towards
the<00:02:33.480> next<00:02:33.810> step<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.860> those<00:02:35.070> muscles<00:02:35.460> are

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the next step so those muscles are

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.450 
the next step so those muscles are
becoming<00:02:36.000> very<00:02:36.150> very<00:02:37.020> strong<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:37.620> fit

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
becoming very very strong and very fit

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.060 
becoming very very strong and very fit
and<00:02:38.700> studies<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.840> shown<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.530> limiting

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
and studies have shown that the limiting

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.090 
and studies have shown that the limiting
factor<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.150> human<00:02:42.450> speed<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.290> not<00:02:43.500> quad<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
factor in human speed is not quad and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.370 
factor in human speed is not quad and
glute<00:02:44.280> strength<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.850> not<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> push<00:02:45.390> off<00:02:45.630> it's

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
glute strength it's not to push off it's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.170 
glute strength it's not to push off it's
the<00:02:46.620> leg<00:02:46.830> lift<00:02:47.130> that's<00:02:47.520> what<00:02:47.730> slows<00:02:48.000> us<00:02:48.150> down

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
the leg lift that's what slows us down

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.900 
the leg lift that's what slows us down
so<00:02:49.080> all<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.380> my<00:02:49.860> training<00:02:50.190> right<00:02:50.460> now<00:02:50.490> is

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
so all of my training right now is

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.120 
so all of my training right now is
focused<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.780> building<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.230> strongest<00:02:52.920> hip

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
focused on building the strongest hip

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.670 
focused on building the strongest hip
abductors<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.820> can<00:02:54.000> possibly<00:02:54.630> build<00:02:55.050> by<00:02:55.350> doing

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
abductors I can possibly build by doing

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.090 
abductors I can possibly build by doing

these<00:03:09.300> boots<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.810> snow<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.100> when<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.400> first

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
these boots in the snow and when I first

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330 
these boots in the snow and when I first
started<00:03:11.820> doing<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.570> back<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.290> January<00:03:14.040> I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
started doing this back in January I

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.460 
started doing this back in January I
would<00:03:15.180> go<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:15.390> 20<00:03:15.870> minutes<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.320> would

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
would go for 20 minutes and that would

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.320 
would go for 20 minutes and that would
be<00:03:16.560> all<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.740> could<00:03:16.980> take<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.190> was<00:03:17.459> exhausting

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
be all I could take it was exhausting

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.930 
be all I could take it was exhausting
and<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.709> do<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.370> two<00:03:20.519> or<00:03:20.610> three<00:03:20.670> times

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
and then I do it like two or three times

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.910 
and then I do it like two or three times
a<00:03:21.150> week<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.570> then<00:03:21.840> when<00:03:22.200> februari<00:03:22.680> came

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
a week and then when februari came

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.590 
a week and then when februari came
around<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.459> was<00:03:23.489> doing<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.910> five<00:03:24.150> days<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.450> week

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
around I was doing it five days a week

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.410 
around I was doing it five days a week
and<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.590> got<00:03:25.769> up<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.010> 40<00:03:26.400> minutes<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.910> now<00:03:27.120> i'm

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
and I got up to 40 minutes and now i'm

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.390 
and I got up to 40 minutes and now i'm
almost<00:03:27.630> at<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> end<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.140> March<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.890> 29th

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.300 
almost at the end of March it's the 29th
today<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:30.930> do<00:03:31.080> three<00:03:31.470> hours<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.100> these

today and I can do three hours in these
boots<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.910> feel<00:03:33.690> okay<00:03:34.080> I'm<00:03:34.350> getting<00:03:34.739> really

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
boots and feel okay I'm getting really

boots and feel okay I'm getting really
really<00:03:35.820> fit<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.780> because<00:03:37.739> I'm<00:03:38.070> just

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
really fit and because I'm just

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.120 
really fit and because I'm just
exploring<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.150> wilderness<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:40.040> looking<00:03:41.040> at

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
exploring the wilderness and looking at

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.759 
exploring the wilderness and looking at
beautiful<00:03:41.250> places<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:42.239> inspiring<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.840> me<00:03:42.959> to

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
beautiful places it's inspiring to me to

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.440 
beautiful places it's inspiring to me to
run<00:03:44.070> through<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.519> snow<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.910> makes<00:03:45.090> me<00:03:45.239> feel

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
run through the snow it makes me feel

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.180 
run through the snow it makes me feel
good<00:03:45.600> for<00:03:45.750> some<00:03:45.900> reason<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.709> keeps<00:03:46.890> me

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
good for some reason so it keeps me

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.130 
good for some reason so it keeps me
