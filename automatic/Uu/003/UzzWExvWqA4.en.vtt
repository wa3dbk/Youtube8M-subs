keep my line somewhat thin but I'm not
too<00:00:30.029> too<00:00:30.210> worried<00:00:30.480> about<00:00:30.570> them<00:00:30.900> being<00:00:31.080> perfect

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
too too worried about them being perfect

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
too too worried about them being perfect
because<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.460> are<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> clean<00:00:33.210> them<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.510> as

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
because we are going to clean them up as

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.350 
because we are going to clean them up as
we<00:00:34.020> add<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> color<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> nail<00:00:35.219> I'm<00:00:35.579> also

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we add the color to the nail I'm also

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
we add the color to the nail I'm also
making<00:00:36.630> sure<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.320> each<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> mushrooms<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
making sure that each of the mushrooms I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.490 
making sure that each of the mushrooms I
sketch<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:39.120> slightly<00:00:39.510> different<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.200> size

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
sketch are slightly different in size

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.040 
sketch are slightly different in size
and<00:00:40.890> shape<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> nail<00:00:42.629> isn't

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and shape just so that the nail isn't

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
and shape just so that the nail isn't
too<00:00:43.260> uniform<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:44.219> everything's<00:00:44.760> said<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
too uniform when everything's said and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.979 
too uniform when everything's said and
done<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.910> speed<00:00:48.180> things<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.840> can

of<00:01:58.910> topcoat<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.290> reason<00:02:00.620> for<00:02:00.650> this<00:02:00.950> we're

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
of topcoat and the reason for this we're

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.280 
of topcoat and the reason for this we're
going<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.640> add<00:02:01.700> some<00:02:01.820> white<00:02:02.240> dots<00:02:02.540> on<00:02:02.780> top<00:02:02.840> of

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
going to add some white dots on top of

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.710

those<00:02:03.380> red<00:02:03.770> mushroom<00:02:04.190> caps<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.729> if<00:02:05.300> we<00:02:05.450> didn't

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
those red mushroom caps and if we didn't

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.270 
those red mushroom caps and if we didn't
add<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.900> topcoat<00:02:06.440> eventually<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.070> red

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
add the topcoat eventually that red

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.980 
add the topcoat eventually that red
polish<00:02:07.700> would<00:02:07.910> bleed<00:02:08.179> through<00:02:08.420> turning<00:02:08.869> those

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
polish would bleed through turning those

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.920 
polish would bleed through turning those
dots<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.590> pink<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.270> trick<00:02:11.570> from<00:02:11.720> oh
