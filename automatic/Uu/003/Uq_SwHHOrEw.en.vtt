afford it I mean the calories um not the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.860 
afford it I mean the calories um not the
price<00:01:51.790> because<00:01:52.060> they<00:01:52.150> cost<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.420> same<00:01:52.600> so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
price because they cost the same so

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.750 
price because they cost the same so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
about half this will save that for

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.100 
about half this will save that for

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
kind of acts as a binder so that your

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.310

that doesn't do eggs you could probably

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.020 
that doesn't do eggs you could probably
just<00:02:32.590> sprinkle<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> teaspoon<00:02:33.820> of

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
flour in with this and that would help

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.289 
flour in with this and that would help
to<00:02:36.850> bind<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.360> all<00:02:37.450> together<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.250> handy<00:02:40.120> tip

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
this shortcut then I'm actually helping

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.970 
this shortcut then I'm actually helping
the<00:03:54.400> planet<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.720> should<00:03:56.590> probably<00:03:56.680> get

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
the planet so I should probably get

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.390 
the planet so I should probably get
award<00:03:57.370> an<00:03:57.720> award<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.870> should<00:03:59.049> say<00:03:59.230> all<00:04:00.190> right

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400

then<00:04:00.670> kind<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.890> spread<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.100> around<00:04:03.519> there's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
then kind of spread this around there's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.789 
then kind of spread this around there's
not<00:04:03.940> really<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.299> neat<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:04.959> tidy<00:04:05.260> way<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.590> do

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
not really a neat and tidy way to do
