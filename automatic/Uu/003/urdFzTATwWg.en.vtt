come<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:05.340> right

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.800 

check<00:02:20.400> our<00:02:21.140> battery<00:02:22.140> usage<00:02:22.709> action<00:02:26.810> really

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
check our battery usage action really

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.420 
check our battery usage action really
yeah

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
happen as the suit subjects will get off

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.679 
happen as the suit subjects will get off
with<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.799> rover<00:02:50.099> put<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.939> backpacks<00:02:51.390> and

with a rover put on the backpacks and

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.420 
with a rover put on the backpacks and
then<00:02:51.900> they'll<00:02:52.110> be<00:02:52.200> able<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.650> do<00:02:52.769> an<00:02:52.890> hour<00:02:53.069> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
then they'll be able to do an hour to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.330 
then they'll be able to do an hour to

Traverse<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.450> there's<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.720> science<00:03:07.049> team<00:03:07.230> that

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
Traverse so there's a science team that

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.589 
Traverse so there's a science team that
goes<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.769> does<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:08.370> do<00:03:08.549> scouting<00:03:09.180> trips<00:03:09.450> we

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
goes and does we do scouting trips we

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.890 
goes and does we do scouting trips we
look<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:09.930> imagery<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:11.340> plan<00:03:11.790> where<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.780> go

the<00:03:49.560> frame<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.389> I<00:03:51.389> had<00:03:51.780> some<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.049> source<00:03:52.319> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the frame and I had some a source you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.610 
the frame and I had some a source you
support<00:03:52.859> for<00:03:52.889> other<00:03:53.370> mechanical<00:03:54.030> things<00:03:54.620> so

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
support for other mechanical things so

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.409 
support for other mechanical things so
just<00:03:55.859> getting<00:03:56.159> all<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.430> lined<00:03:56.699> up<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.269> where

just getting all that lined up to where

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.270 
just getting all that lined up to where

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
cool points loaded and they can go right

cool points loaded and they can go right
there<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.949> then<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.159> audio<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.550> there<00:04:32.820> they

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
there and then the audio is there they

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.430 
there and then the audio is there they
don't<00:04:33.060> have<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.389> remember<00:04:33.599> what<00:04:33.840> they<00:04:33.930> saw<00:04:34.169> and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
don't have to remember what they saw and

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.010 
don't have to remember what they saw and
it's<00:04:34.860> just<00:04:35.039> a<00:04:35.130> very<00:04:35.699> good<00:04:36.030> concise<00:04:36.539> way<00:04:36.720> of

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
it's just a very good concise way of

it's just a very good concise way of

main<00:04:39.900> thing<00:04:40.080> we<00:04:40.139> had<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.289> design<00:04:40.440> from<00:04:40.770> scratch

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
main thing we had to design from scratch

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.950 
main thing we had to design from scratch
was<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.789> software<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.510> runs<00:04:42.659> the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
was just the software that runs the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.370 
was just the software that runs the
voice<00:04:43.110> over<00:04:43.409> IP<00:04:43.610> computer<00:04:44.610> that's<00:04:45.210> all<00:04:45.479> custom

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
voice over IP computer that's all custom

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.439 
voice over IP computer that's all custom
done<00:04:46.409> and<00:04:46.710> KSC<00:04:47.130> well<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.789> desert<00:04:48.120> there's

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
done and KSC well in the desert there's

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.700 
done and KSC well in the desert there's
there's<00:04:48.779> nothing<00:04:49.260> there's<00:04:49.529> no

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
there's nothing there's no

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.950 
there's nothing there's no
infrastructure<00:04:50.010> no<00:04:50.400> power<00:04:50.909> no<00:04:51.240> nothing<00:04:51.659> so<00:04:51.840> we

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
infrastructure no power no nothing so we

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.210 
infrastructure no power no nothing so we
bring<00:04:52.279> generators<00:04:53.279> we

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
bring generators we

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.590 
bring generators we
bring<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.490> network<00:04:54.760> connection<00:04:54.880> down<00:04:55.270> from<00:04:55.540> a

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
bring a network connection down from a

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.360 
bring a network connection down from a
mountain<00:04:55.960> it's<00:04:56.380> mountain<00:04:56.680> eldon<00:04:56.980> it's<00:04:57.160> it's

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
mountain it's mountain eldon it's it's

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.550 
mountain it's mountain eldon it's it's
several<00:04:57.880> several<00:04:58.090> miles<00:04:58.360> away<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.720> think<00:04:58.840> 30

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
several several miles away I think 30

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.710 
several several miles away I think 30
miles<00:04:59.830> away<00:05:00.040> so<00:05:00.910> we<00:05:01.000> bring<00:05:01.150> network<00:05:01.510> we're

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
miles away so we bring network we're

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.810 
miles away so we bring network we're
being<00:05:01.870> power<00:05:02.110> we<00:05:02.410> bring<00:05:02.710> you<00:05:03.310> know<00:05:03.430> there's

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
being power we bring you know there's

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.430 
being power we bring you know there's
phones<00:05:04.210> there's<00:05:04.570> everything<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.320> would

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
phones there's everything that you would

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.110 
phones there's everything that you would
have<00:05:05.650> if<00:05:05.980> you're<00:05:06.610> sitting<00:05:06.820> in<00:05:06.940> your<00:05:07.000> office

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
have if you're sitting in your office

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.910 
have if you're sitting in your office
and<00:05:07.570> it's<00:05:07.750> more<00:05:07.900> about<00:05:08.020> making<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.410> test<00:05:08.710> team

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
and it's more about making the test team

think<00:05:18.430> there's<00:05:18.730> over<00:05:18.910> 100<00:05:19.240> people<00:05:19.390> that<00:05:19.810> are

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
think there's over 100 people that are

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.410 
think there's over 100 people that are

part of this field test to make sure
that<00:05:22.690> they<00:05:22.870> can<00:05:23.110> do<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.470> everything<00:05:23.920> they

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
that they can do that everything they

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.550 
that they can do that everything they
