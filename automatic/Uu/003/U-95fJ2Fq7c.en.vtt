00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.150
 It is severely price of a dreamy nerve crisis which is enough for me 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:06.600
 poker daniele 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.260
 I had this sannio crisis 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.930
 I gave birth to a brilliant idea on how to store earrings 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.670
 because I know full enough but I don't put them on because I do 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.159
 I forget about my heart with 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:23.230
 being the damned well hidden in their little box 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.689
 so to always have them in sight and considering that they are home bijou facts 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.170
 of rieti of nothing practically are not the precious co 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.410
 I thought you could put them on 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.300
 in plain sight using this is a strip of cock 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.040
 now I explain to you how to do it first of all we need it 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.400
 a portion of wall of variable width and height all depends on 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.960
 how much wall layout you have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.380
 that you can puncture with a pin then 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.040
 I think the wall is pierced with a needle I ran off plasterboard 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.710
 or corinna 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.110
 with a match 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.680
 if you do not have the availability of a device for a wall to cuddle 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.380
 you can sabe contar of 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.470
 a slate like that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.300
 and its true 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.550
 often surpasses maybe I learn 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.550
 eye on the 5 euros maybe six 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.780
 then you always say you can 3 to the earrings of course that seemed to me 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.780
 superficial to say it 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.490
 a strip 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.300
 of this type this was here is okay any other material as long as 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.750
 both fairly light and durable 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.479
 you can use for example if you have to throw away some tichet read some 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.520
 but they are not t-shirts in what is also cotton that ages very much 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.820
 resistant then 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.140
 throw away something that I don't need so cut some strips of 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.350
 whip particular pains 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.689
 what we have to do prepare these strips or buy them jaffa 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.330
 the length depends on your needs I could not cut them 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.639
 in the sense that 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.399
 they had arrived in this package already so cut of this length 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.070
 then 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.059
 I owed myself a yellow page 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.059
 you must then and join the ends 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.379
 and fold it all 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.189
 come even if it is not a precise job it is very fine 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:35.010
 you can make cl6 close down here with a thumbtack 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.570
 no needle and thread with sewing machine 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.739
 or more spartan mind with one 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.459
 pencils license on the surface 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.599
 or leave it free like this 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.109
 I prefer it so because I try so much that I try the 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.419
 sewing machine at the height of the stapler still 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.339
 minetti is really anguish no I can't do it so I fought like this 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.619
 what you have to do now to take your eyes 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:02.919
 I will use these in what year you come 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.709
 the hook 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.589
 and stuck for pc carli in the vast choice 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:14.869
 you must take into account however that whatever you use to attack it will have 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:16.809
 still need one 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.509
 anm 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.120
 of space, therefore, a little care space 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.360
 do not start to attach it from here ie 2 mm apartments from 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.990
 board 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.129
 but from an inch below the sea except that it is the little jewel ooh the needle 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.429
 you can feel good cracking 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:40.049
 and then use terrazzo don't think you can stick it with but the patafix ad 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.909
 example because it does not hold 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.469
 or better or worse is aside 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.159
 this part behind here therefore that which comes into contact with the slate but a 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.459
 front part now 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.279
 so that I frankly recommend the pins that are also coming 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.959
 much better the patafix 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.069
 there are no more good names 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.079
 amelia 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.930
 then then we said let's take our earring but 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.150
 and we hang it about a centimeter from the upper edge 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 oops 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.449
 unfortunately got the pair of earrings that bastard of history because I don't know if 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.860
 you can see it but here to the open hook for which it gets caught 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.870
 here on the sides there are open hooks for which it gets tangled I look for minimoto practically 

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:31.490
 hangs me 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.460
 I have to think that 35 are missing 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.460
 for my love others do the same thing 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.870
 urine 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.990
 maybe reader too soon 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.069
 no, bye 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.370
 ok 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.740
 make sure that 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.809
 the tips will not do well on this side 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.809
 that remain so because otherwise the odds 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.849
 the odds that 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.479
 but watch it 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.620
 don't be the dark president I said I miss you 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.800
 so because otherwise the odds of fishing 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.680
 and I am for plants 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.919
 practically very high 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.639
 for then continue so obviously for the whole length of the strip 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.169
 you can even get the fifth 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.629
 but frankly I like to stop more buy a cell height share a 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.860
 lower minimum edge 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.509
 immortal you can put yourself that you were born for example stud earrings type 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.650
 this 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.380
 if I really want to put something in the house for me and the ribbon 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.590
 they blasted the colors of the independent 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.080
 increases and 2 other explanations in regards to hello from being active 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.500
 of the tutorial we concluded then it will be enough for me to get to the end 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.689
 who pays to take it to your bulletin board - strobe 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:01.930
 as for motivation for which ask i advise you to get in 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:03.400
 vertical 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.340
 so they actually take up more space than putting them in 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.889
 horizontal 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.889
 here is this fascism 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.740
 I give good advice but if the applications that would be anyway 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.139
 here we are 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.919
 because essential 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.960
 ah well of course I had taken the contrary, oh well I said why my once 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.580
 that you go to wait besides the fact that pisa are more v 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:39.210
 this choice makes me much more ar map in the legs much more established 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.600
 while instead they have been only one city in horizontal therefore putting 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.949
 this is practically 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.250
 your 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.199
 sea ​​monsters don't know what they look like in my opinion 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.029
 because I can't print 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.029
 but then they cry much less 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.869
 then with the participation of having shown tutorial 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.430
 you can put those with the hook 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.210
 you can safely put even those with 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.119
 tap at the closure 

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:15.080
 cossia farfallina 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.240
 meritene is simple because you only have to support them with kawasaki 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.569
 and then you decide here obviously Anna Anna fewer chances of falling 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.559
 and we like this a lot 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:30.189
 hot for this tutorial I think I said all I think I also have 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:33.980
