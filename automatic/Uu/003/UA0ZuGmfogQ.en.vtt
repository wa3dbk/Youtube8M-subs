and<00:03:22.300> quarks<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.050> all<00:03:23.200> these<00:03:23.350> things<00:03:23.410> instead

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
and quarks and all these things instead

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
of this then lean assassin like he fills

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.850 
of this then lean assassin like he fills
out<00:03:27.220> his<00:03:27.280> coat<00:03:28.210> is<00:03:28.420> just<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.960> warrior<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.590> every

of new animations just for Connor alone
we<00:03:49.019> started<00:03:49.470> by<00:03:49.590> looking<00:03:49.799> at<00:03:50.040> lots<00:03:50.640> of

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
we started by looking at lots of

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.119 
we started by looking at lots of
military<00:03:51.420> moves<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.349> using<00:03:52.950> traditional

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
military moves and using traditional

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.949 
military moves and using traditional
ones<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.849> how<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.480> would<00:03:54.569> fight<00:03:54.780> with<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
ones of how you would fight with the

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.929 
ones of how you would fight with the
tomahawk<00:03:55.379> we<00:03:55.799> looked<00:03:56.069> at<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.549> we<00:03:56.640> just

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
tomahawk we looked at that and we just

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.119 
tomahawk we looked at that and we just
thought<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.209> wasn't<00:03:57.689> awesome<00:03:57.930> enough<00:03:58.170> so<00:03:58.739> we

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
thought it wasn't awesome enough so we

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.119 
thought it wasn't awesome enough so we
went<00:03:59.310> really<00:03:59.640> brutal<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.390> wasn't<00:04:00.569> just

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
went really brutal and it wasn't just

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:10.789 
went really brutal and it wasn't just
throwing<00:04:02.129> in<00:04:02.250> board<00:04:09.079> we<00:04:10.079> put<00:04:10.379> a<00:04:10.409> lot<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.680> time

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
throwing in board we put a lot of time

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.190 
throwing in board we put a lot of time
into<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.310> navigation<00:04:11.940> elements<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.540> we've

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
into the navigation elements and we've

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.530 
into the navigation elements and we've
completely<00:04:13.739> redone<00:04:14.250> our<00:04:14.459> climb<00:04:14.700> system<00:04:15.180> we

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
completely redone our climb system we

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.770 
completely redone our climb system we
really<00:04:15.930> wanted<00:04:16.199> it<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.470> be<00:04:16.590> much<00:04:16.799> more<00:04:16.829> organic

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
really wanted it to be much more organic

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.300 
really wanted it to be much more organic
there's<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.079> much<00:04:19.289> variety<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.949> what<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.160> can

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
there's so much variety and what you can

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.090 
there's so much variety and what you can
climb<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:20.850> how<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.120> can<00:04:21.299> do<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.800> Connor<00:04:22.800> moves

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100
