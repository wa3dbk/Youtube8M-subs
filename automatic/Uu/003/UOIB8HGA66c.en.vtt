00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello everyone and all begin 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 day for this new series where we 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 learn to build our expectations so 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.570
 if you already have all your pieces and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.610
 just wanted to know how 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.590
 builds what pays all the videos 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.089
 which explain how to choose your 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.699
 pieces went right away to the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.680
 part where we build so much so 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.109
 in this video we want to choose the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.410
 most important part again is to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.140
 to say the trial seems so that's what 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.880
 a processor of participating parties 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:38.850
 to the operations one inch per inch or to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:47.730
 just about it's a bet almost got 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 take again for cause and here is the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.920
 ready to sit and if the dhow the most 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.129
 is for 24 hours it's the cpu 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.350
 processor unit info about what his 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.359
 girl that's all you're saying that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.379
 cliché that in 30 years has done everything 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.570
 that's when I said it's the brain 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.060
 so it takes us to the brain then saint 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 to manage our increasingly tender which 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.500
 is more and more that your hears see 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.060
 how fast does it take us 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.140
 a good question by passing here we have 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.869
 an intel of two main brands of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.509
 processor be intel and amd 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.650
 both are very good I think we 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.600
 will say one more than the others it's 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.310
 sure I already see who I like holy 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.020
 and they become more amd where I am 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.180
 Saturday but if I was this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 So here the lozère we will have fun 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 with us anyway brands like 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.189
 nike or ribat sidi silly smile that's my 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.799
 presence and a processor that does what 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.320
 it's to believe it so here we want 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.899
 know how to choose and these people without 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.570
 to be in point 4 geurts rigor it's a 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.850
 such measure that measure the speed of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.170
 the processor just too good for you it 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.090
 said nothing you know not it's good for 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.079
 explain yourself on 1.5 to 2 gerz it's 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.940
 true the speed that you go to your 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.140
 lights the needs of your internet 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.500
 emails by a few word documents 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.070
 then 2 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.750
 3 cd little game that would be like time 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.670
 where the coaster tycoon three 90s 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.180
 with little young people during a day 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 a child and two-slice children 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.590
 gerz like the one we see here it's 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.330
 to play big games battlefield 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.260
 crisis all kinds the players is this 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.650
 a bioshock 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.570
 have fun all you know 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.489
 I'm well past it's not funny 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.760
 and I know a big start in the background 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.070
 you are interested in a series of short tubes 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.360
 no matter what if you have yet 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.850
 know our processor when we 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.010
 choose her stockings it's important but 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.620
 must know the soc is so here I feel 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.540
 what can we see she plays at 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.310
 11 55 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.130
 so the fifth is of importance and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.140
 know it's not important if he or that 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.540
 the bonuses are placed that will take the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.060
 time to choose our other pieces 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.100
 in the background the motherboard for his daughter 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.180
 on it thoroughly we're worried it's just 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.739
 how does that small pieces in 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.049
 below this processor they are placed 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:36.900
 that's all but in this trial are 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:39.410
 expected octo core coming soon 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.019
 olivier deschacht already exists at amd 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.260
 intel I think not yet after we have them 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.880
 two agree with two brief oscars if 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.500
 the future it's coming soon 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:56.730
 volcanic is more than just a decoration 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.090
 ha yes more than it's good make it a 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.620
 runner was not much that player 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.329
 as anyone can in time 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.840
 I had that it's too beautiful penneteau 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:11.940
 at the same pyatt pensum because I had a 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:17.190
 speech but it's more than that 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.949
 long time did at least 10 years in 2003 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.060
 more than she said 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.500
 in short plus four riders 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.760
 understand multi tasking understand - 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.169
 tintin au aude and applications 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.540
 because every application to its own 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.270
 will still be distributed and well done 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.520
 wrong is processors in the 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.570
 processor depressed the number of patients 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.260
 who die in the same lawsuit are 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:42.150
 involved in there 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:49.139
 here I feel though running his right 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:52.770
 a quad core yes I do believe because 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.470
 multitasking whip processing neurology 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.560
 four hearts set to battery pro 4 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.010
 processors in this little piece of metal 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.570
 do not live what is more obvious 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.030
 since it fast plus which avoids 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.100
 the info what we want is the biggest 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.310
 number of digits it's the numbers 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.450
 are important 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.380
 so that's our past night one 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.760
 that I used it today takes to 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.440
 complicate gaming is positioning itself 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:24.030
 entrusted with gaming rafa is free of the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.979
 hoist 35-5-0 body which means we 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.970
 can open it slammed what I will not do 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:34.440
 a step without being later but not at 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.389
 jean and the socket 11 55 to do with the 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.800
 maquis map just so sometimes I had my 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.910
 treasure of the next video on his cheek 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.910
 first to the next
