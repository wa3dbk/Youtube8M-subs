00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.750
 but it's not an image problem and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.519
 me that I have with them and see but it's 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.800
 the stupidity they could do in the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.840
 purpose of never that for me I'm in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.980
 talk about the left-back if 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.639
 we were closing on a purely 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.260
 athletic 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.830
 when you come my granny but in addition I 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.680
 repeat I repeat and I therefore advise 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.260
 those who want to understand me I do not 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.609
 am a small coach to do 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
 are still aiming for a screwdriver 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 to fix a lot of things 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.630
 a word game burning the vix 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.219
 sincerely me who still have the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.590
 claim to have a little bit of humor 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.239
 I have already found better so to arrive 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
 at an intellectual level and do this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.360
 comparison must understand that I 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 can only have laughter 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.190
 the problem for me is that I have the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.399
 claim to know what must 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.670
 do a left-back evra for me 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.469
 it's a middle winger means of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 from time to time this reminder that plays 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.480
 back left that accompanies his 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.030
 opponents without preventing them from centering 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.949
 and who speaks of himself by saying I 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 am a warrior and who turns his back 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.030
 whenever there is a penalty shootout 2 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.299
 afraid of times to take it in the in 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.850
 the chest voice on the face and who in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.830
 most of it has no knowledge and there 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 it's sad for me anyway 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.520
 colleagues by profession even though I 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.780
 am a little coach that you do 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.590
 have the ball at the left-back position 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.270
 you do not go trotting without getting 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 worry about anything 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 the ball to the one in front of you and 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.369
 without knowing if to master the action from 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.549
 behind him in position de faith of off 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.710
 evra game it's the only left-back at 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.350
 world to be out of play from time to time 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.680
 it's a feat happened happened 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.460
 if you want to make a career of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.280
 defender 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.909
 with as little quality without a game of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.070
 head without speed without distance 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.770
 tagging this by knowing this 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.120
 closures and then sincerely it's a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.710
 exploit that I salute king left 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.260
 two times better left back but 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.650
 but to me I salute those Tinto 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.440
 they had this player there better back 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.870
 left and one from england it would suffice 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.300
 that they spend an hour with me and we 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.340
 look at me watching I'm going to spend a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.980
 sweeping is done there is little wax 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.950
 there under the table and we look and we 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.960
 look if you want what must a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.630
 left rear as much on the plane 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.290
 defensive as offensive 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.430
 Hail and well precisely I stress 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.250
 and I congratulate a player who does this 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.200
 career there with so few qualities 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.660
 defender is a feat 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.660
 since this morning it became my idol
