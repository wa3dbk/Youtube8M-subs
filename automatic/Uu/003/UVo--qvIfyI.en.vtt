00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
on a small plane the fear of a small

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.440 
on a small plane the fear of a small
plane<00:01:40.100> made<00:01:40.370> me<00:01:40.490> forget<00:01:40.670> about<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.150> crazy

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450

traffic<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:42.110> Nairobi<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:43.070> an<00:01:43.190> amazing<00:01:43.730> sight

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
traffic in Nairobi it's an amazing sight

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.700 
traffic in Nairobi it's an amazing sight
of<00:01:44.150> controlled<00:01:44.540> chaos<00:01:44.600> if<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.380> makes<00:01:45.590> any

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
of controlled chaos if that makes any

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.220 
of controlled chaos if that makes any
sense<00:01:46.010> so<00:01:46.700> there<00:01:46.910> she<00:01:47.120> was<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.630> small<00:01:47.900> plane

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
sense so there she was the small plane

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.140 
sense so there she was the small plane
the<00:01:48.740> plane<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.130> would<00:01:49.250> take<00:01:49.430> us<00:01:49.460> out<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:49.760> lay

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
the plane that would take us out to lay

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.970 
the plane that would take us out to lay
it<00:01:50.330> down<00:01:50.480> so<00:01:50.900> quickly<00:01:51.140> we<00:01:51.380> were<00:01:51.470> up<00:01:51.650> in<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.830> air

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
it down so quickly we were up in the air

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.710 
it down so quickly we were up in the air
and<00:01:52.070> on<00:01:52.160> our<00:01:52.310> way<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.850> seems<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.270> every<00:01:53.480> trip

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
and on our way it seems that every trip

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.270 
and on our way it seems that every trip
takes<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.140> little<00:01:54.290> longer<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.800> get<00:01:54.920> out<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.130> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
takes a little longer to get out of the
