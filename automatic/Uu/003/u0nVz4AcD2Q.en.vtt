00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
as the engine of my other tractor but

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.189 
as the engine of my other tractor but
this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> start<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> big<00:00:28.560> engine<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
this is just to start the big engine and

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.389 
this is just to start the big engine and
first<00:00:31.199> reading<00:00:31.470> I've<00:00:31.619> sparked<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:32.160> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
first reading I've sparked there and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.680 
first reading I've sparked there and
then<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.640> cleaned<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> points<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.510> everything

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
then I cleaned the points and everything

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.360 
then I cleaned the points and everything
and<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:33.930> got<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.260> thing<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> spark<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> then

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and we got that thing to spark and then

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.150 
and we got that thing to spark and then
the<00:00:36.239> diesel<00:00:36.540> wouldn't<00:00:36.780> start<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.590> we

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the diesel wouldn't start and then we

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
the diesel wouldn't start and then we
decided<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> shoot<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.180> ether<00:00:39.329> put

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
decided to shoot it with some ether put

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
decided to shoot it with some ether put
some<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> air<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> take<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.750> she

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
some in the air and take there and she

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
some in the air and take there and she
fired<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.170> after<00:00:43.710> sitting<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.040> about<00:00:44.399> three

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
fired up after sitting for about three

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
fired up after sitting for about three
years<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.770> makes<00:00:46.950> power<00:00:47.570> only<00:00:48.570> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
years so then that makes power only that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
years so then that makes power only that
light<00:00:49.230> works<00:00:49.500> everything<00:00:50.039> else<00:00:50.219> doesn't<00:00:50.579> work

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
light works everything else doesn't work

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.930 
light works everything else doesn't work
but<00:00:51.110> I'll<00:00:52.110> figure<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.710> eventually<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.680 

yeah<00:00:56.940> well<00:00:57.090> start<00:00:57.420> her<00:00:57.510> up

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
yeah well start her up

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.660 
yeah well start her up
Oh<00:00:58.309> see<00:00:59.309> how<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> start<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.000> you've<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.020 

first<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.850> start<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.650> pump<00:01:07.650> motor<00:01:08.030> now

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
first you start up the pump motor now

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.850 
first you start up the pump motor now
this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.159> this<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.909> actually<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
this is the this this is actually the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
this is the this this is actually the
adjustment<00:01:13.860> screw<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.729> good<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.509> run

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
adjustment screw for a good for to run

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.380 
adjustment screw for a good for to run
and<00:01:16.080> that's<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.830> shut<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.390> mine

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and that's also you shut it off so mine

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.280 
and that's also you shut it off so mine
you<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.689> boat<00:01:19.350> only<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:20.880> third<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.780> turn<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you do boat only a third of a turn and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.390 
you do boat only a third of a turn and
you<00:01:23.220> got<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> choke<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> starter<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.189> I'll

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you got the choke in the starter so I'll

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:49.510 
you got the choke in the starter so I'll
start<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> up

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.860 

I've<00:02:25.400> see<00:02:25.760> definitely<00:02:26.060> Kentucky<00:02:26.510> Dodgers

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
I've see definitely Kentucky Dodgers

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.290

was<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> higher-end<00:02:35.560> one

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
was a higher-end one

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.730 
was a higher-end one
I<00:02:38.040> think<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.489> way<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.849> want<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.060> lot

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
I think this way we want a lot

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:50.870 
I think this way we want a lot

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:15.850 

there's

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:04:14.070 

our<00:03:16.280> gauge<00:03:16.580> is<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:17.000> order

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:05:19.250 

they're<00:04:14.650> too<00:04:14.830> easy

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.680 

shut<00:05:19.710> lock<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.190> just<00:05:20.430> push<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.330> button<00:05:21.630> on

I<00:05:31.469> wonder<00:05:32.159> if<00:05:32.249> some<00:05:32.429> bigger

market

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.190 

I'll<00:05:48.970> see<00:05:49.120> if<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:49.270> can<00:05:49.420> squish<00:05:49.660> both<00:05:49.870> of<00:05:50.050> these

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
I'll see if I can squish both of these
