00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.390
 the series the cars have yet to come in they have a good one 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500
 Match one of the few moments that we speak to you and work 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.450
 constant 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 I believe the Netherlands is going to solve that 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.700
 the police suggested that the athlete 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.740
 yes i'm a pretty big to go with it 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.269
 know this man at the same time 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.189
 large event to be organized again very naturally also every day events 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.700
 but this is normal man that gives the band and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.789
 I am a bit accommodating 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.389
 to set up the tent but also to better the treble shooters so if anything 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:14.100
 is like the club is 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.350
 it was difficult for me to make those guys the mechanics 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.300
 then I'm going to give it a try 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.340
 because ride twice 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.299
 what is your background what is that for companies 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.640
 he had a bit of a nonsense sporting natural event 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.190
 broadest sense of the word all 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.500
 The aversion to this will be a great adventure for fourteen days 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.890
 and there brand dispute that with that something always happens that you do not 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 expected 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.340
 well that is here 24 hours a day every day that something happens that you don't 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 expected 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 and that makes it very special and also fun to do 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.100
 on the other hand, for a top 10 position at rtl 4 why 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.430
 very easily 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.240
 a lot of attention was given to problems 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.510
 weather or not 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.119
 those who are stopped to time is crazy to drive 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.900
 For years they have clogged the meal 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.229
 we had to stand the three times 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:21.739
 after the cyclocross world problems problems started with the name at antwerp 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.489
 we hit the thief behind the thief, after which they hit the kilometer south of the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.049
 last eleven kilometers away there is none 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.070
 for the edition 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.559
 this does not concern anything at all 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.589
 I also wonder 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.879
 a pop up to date for pet magazines going in the right direction with me 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.149
 my job of mine has the chance to be thousands of beautiful damme but he has it there 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:45.949
 in german duisburg essen as soon as i get my hands free again this is not possible 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:46.740
 say other than that 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.469
 use you go to extinguish the fifa year old elm after 44 years of abuse 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:52.779
 I have experienced everything 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.089
 actually 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.899
 yes maybe one of those guys will come from 2 pm on to the physical 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.969
 remains and a 500 throw alert alert again just before they entered 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.829
 in addition, his thing 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 all for the good that there are another 40 and 55 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.850
 once died in the direction of tom bean and place 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.890
 but yes the vvd are too good that is in my opinion 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.079
 you might be proud of this site 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.819
 years I did not expect that he would lead in that place 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.809
 so it is very nice result 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.629
 it is nice that the intention has expired we are not really in the spotlight 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.349
 but you learn your own field from what made it a chance 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.869
 is this also requested to win fell 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:32.399
 yes of course 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.399
 need to keep rolling natural it's not just the man behind the wheel 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.369
 so it is also those boys that I have not done alone 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.959
 this is how things have been improved 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 that's right now 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:56.110
 6 Alex Pettyfer The stabbing is a way that wants to know 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.519
 what a fuss is true means 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.709
 where can you sometimes get the abbreviation of your own 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.399
 that's it for me where I own your own name and together with jansen jan hope it 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.189
 also 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.729
 only as a very old factory that makes a cross sidecar and cross flatted 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.239
 and he thereby picked up six cups that audience was a bit like Janita 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.259
 say a little bit of fraud became a complaint last year 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.819
 and there is a one-on-one bonus that has recently taken new place and now again 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.919
 sidecars and therefore once on our evil between the Christian nabil it 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:28.270
 straight 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.270
 jaap de keijzer if you want to reach the man strong 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.680
 jeroen again today 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.110
 I do not know what to shorten the cars won by the test 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.080
 but you put that is not cut how dangerous 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 it's a day like today 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.249
 this makes absolutely no sense that I really think I have today 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.130
 I got you that route last week I am with 66 kilometers and two 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.669
 time and time now 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.539
 that they now say what he is allowed to do again 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.770
 I really miss we have put a clear on the album a good one 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.249
 rows of dunes and I have 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.249
 really i have been stuck i have two years ago i have 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.289
 just could not drop finally succeeded 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.689
 you are not friends but they must have been split up 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.330
 real mountains 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.990
 that is where most of the damage comes from and they were all right again 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.550
 medication against the most important things affecting us here in the rally 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.000
 and that not only the communication that own home when we talk to it 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.009
 Four satellites really seemed like they were standing in the middle of the desert there 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.680
 we must still be able to call the service 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.040
 on those guys can let them know what happened thereby the counter of 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.240
 sport 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.740
 sassenpoort hotel van 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.670
 take your clothes off 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.320
 Tintin the satellite images 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.689
 wherever you are 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.930
 in the world it is not that you do not feel like you are really one 

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:53.509
 satellite telephone 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:54.719
 helps us with this 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.879
 but this not only makes this midpoint also possible to view all photos and 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.570
 movies 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.680
 but you get 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.680
 thank you guys you can also breakpoints thanks 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.729
 the singer 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.379
 how tough it was today 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.169
 we were very tough 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.219
 seen the plans enough for the time being 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.330
 what a disgrace 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.889
 but I still wanted to be clear that we will all have it afterwards 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.289
 a few hours 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.719
 just i think i'm part of the loan myself 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:47.719
 a spokesperson down the mountain and 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.610
 it is not always the case that the big boss of the 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.550
 from this i just wanted to tell the helicopter myself it is for 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.809
 brought before today 

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:00.770

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.719
