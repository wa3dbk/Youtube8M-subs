workshop doing a few changes the water
temperature<00:01:33.649> is<00:01:33.799> staying<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.030> 70s<00:01:35.509> which

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
temperature is staying in the 70s which

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.840 
temperature is staying in the 70s which
is<00:01:35.810> perfect<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.950> makes<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.459> nice<00:01:37.609> and
