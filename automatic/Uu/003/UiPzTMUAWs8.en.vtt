that we need to consider with macro I'm
not<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.949> depth<00:00:32.189> because

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
not going to go really in depth because

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
not going to go really in depth because
we<00:00:32.610> cover<00:00:32.850> more<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.900> in<00:00:34.050> our<00:00:34.140> actual<00:00:34.530> main

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
we cover more of that in our actual main

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.590 
we cover more of that in our actual main
courses<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> main<00:00:35.670> programs<00:00:36.150> but<00:00:36.330> I'm<00:00:36.450> just

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
courses and main programs but I'm just

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
courses and main programs but I'm just
going<00:00:36.720> to<00:00:36.750> give<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.110> few<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.500> pointers

you've got lots of flowers coming out
insect<00:00:47.070> activity<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.820> sorts<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
insect activity all sorts going on and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
insect activity all sorts going on and
macro<00:00:50.250> subjects<00:00:51.030> all<00:00:51.840> around<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.560> can

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
macro subjects all around you and can

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.060 
macro subjects all around you and can
make<00:00:53.130> great<00:00:53.490> material<00:00:54.150> for<00:00:54.180> photography<00:00:55.170> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
make great material for photography so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.120 
make great material for photography so
what<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> wanted<00:00:56.580> to<00:00:56.700> speak<00:00:57.150> about<00:00:57.300> was

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
what I wanted to speak about was

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.100 
what I wanted to speak about was
different<00:00:59.130> macro<00:00:59.790> options<00:01:00.330> and<00:01:00.630> what<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.930> can

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
different macro options and what you can

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.710 
different macro options and what you can
do<00:01:01.290> with<00:01:01.830> lenses<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.580> get<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.180> good<00:01:03.300> macro

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
do with lenses to get really good macro

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.310 
do with lenses to get really good macro
shots<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:04.110> macro<00:01:04.830> shots<00:01:05.159> basically<00:01:05.729> mean

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
shots now macro shots basically mean

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.880 
shots now macro shots basically mean
magnifying<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.530> image<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.189> at<00:01:08.789> least<00:01:09.240> it's

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
magnifying an image to at least it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.779 
magnifying an image to at least it's
actual<00:01:10.890> relative<00:01:11.579> size<00:01:11.880> compared<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
actual relative size compared to the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.639 
actual relative size compared to the
recording<00:01:14.789> medium<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.929> example<00:01:16.350> I've<00:01:16.500> got

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
recording medium so for example I've got

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.870 
recording medium so for example I've got
a<00:01:16.710> 20<00:01:17.700> pence<00:01:17.969> coin<00:01:18.929> here<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> wanted

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
a 20 pence coin here and if you wanted

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.810 
a 20 pence coin here and if you wanted
to<00:01:20.939> record<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.289> on<00:01:22.649> a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
to record that one to one on a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.300 
to record that one to one on a
full-frame<00:01:23.820> sensor<00:01:24.329> camera<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
full-frame sensor camera then that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.359 
full-frame sensor camera then that
should<00:01:26.909> appear<00:01:27.390> about<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> same<00:01:28.770> size<00:01:29.100> as

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
should appear about the same size as

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.179 
should appear about the same size as
life-size<00:01:29.999> but<00:01:30.899> with<00:01:31.049> certain<00:01:31.200> macro<00:01:31.740> lenses

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
life-size but with certain macro lenses

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.649 
life-size but with certain macro lenses
and<00:01:32.369> certain<00:01:32.729> teenies<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.179> can<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.390> above

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and certain teenies you can go above

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
and certain teenies you can go above
life-size<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> actually<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.249> even

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
life-size and you can actually get even

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.399 
life-size and you can actually get even
more<00:01:35.880> magnified<00:01:36.539> images<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.109> I'm<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
more magnified images so I'm going to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.489 
more magnified images so I'm going to
show<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.649> a<00:01:38.069> couple<00:01:38.819> of<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.200> quick<00:01:40.200> things

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:40.499 
show you a couple of little quick things

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.050 
show you a couple of little quick things
with<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.009> now

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
with that now

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.779 
with that now
first<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.920> borrowed<00:01:44.219> this<00:01:44.369> camera

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
first of all I just borrowed this camera

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.700 
first of all I just borrowed this camera
off<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> friend<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.569> is<00:01:45.749> an<00:01:46.200> older<00:01:46.560> model

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
off a friend this is an older model

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.859 
Canon EOS 350d some entry-level digital
camera<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:53.009> got<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.369> standard<00:01:53.700> 18<00:01:54.600> to

camera and it's got the standard 18 to
55<00:01:55.409> millimeter<00:01:56.039> lens<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:57.359> that<00:01:58.109> lens

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
55 millimeter lens on it now that lens

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
55 millimeter lens on it now that lens
effectively<00:02:01.350> isn't<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> macro<00:02:02.520> lens<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.689> if

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
effectively isn't a macro lens but if

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.410 
effectively isn't a macro lens but if
you<00:02:04.049> put<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.530> into<00:02:04.889> the<00:02:05.039> 55<00:02:05.549> milf<00:02:05.819> ocol<00:02:06.240> length

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
you put it into the 55 milf ocol length

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.139 
you put it into the 55 milf ocol length
and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.289> switch<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.679> to<00:02:07.889> manual<00:02:08.190> focus<00:02:08.880> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and then switch it to manual focus and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.260 
and then switch it to manual focus and
turn<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> its<00:02:10.319> closest<00:02:11.160> focusing<00:02:11.370> distance

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
turn it to its closest focusing distance

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.390 
turn it to its closest focusing distance
that's<00:02:12.660> don't<00:02:13.110> try<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.740> let<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> autofocus

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
that's don't try and let the autofocus

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.150 
that's don't try and let the autofocus
do<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.880> put<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.150> manual<00:02:15.510> focus

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
do it put it on manual focus

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.310 
do it put it on manual focus
put<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.670> its<00:02:16.820> closest<00:02:17.360> focusing<00:02:17.540> distance

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
put it to its closest focusing distance

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.100 
put it to its closest focusing distance
and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:20.180> can<00:02:20.360> just<00:02:20.540> simply<00:02:20.630> move<00:02:21.080> your

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
and then you can just simply move your

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.780 
and then you can just simply move your
body<00:02:21.590> backwards<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.220> forwards<00:02:22.520> like<00:02:22.550> that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
body backwards and forwards like that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.310 
body backwards and forwards like that
until<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.240> get<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.570> close<00:02:23.750> as<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
until you get as close as you can and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.990 
until you get as close as you can and
then<00:02:24.590> that's<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.250> highest<00:02:25.430> magnification

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
then that's the highest magnification

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.630 
then that's the highest magnification
that<00:02:26.570> you'll<00:02:26.810> get<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.440> lens<00:02:27.740> now

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
that you'll get out of that lens now

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.270 
that you'll get out of that lens now
that<00:02:29.000> gave<00:02:29.210> pretty<00:02:29.960> good<00:02:30.230> close-up<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.040> could

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
that gave pretty good close-up you could

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.010 
that gave pretty good close-up you could
do<00:02:31.400> some<00:02:31.580> interesting<00:02:31.820> flower<00:02:32.360> shops<00:02:32.810> or

do some interesting flower shops or

true macro image and the results are

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.780 
true macro image and the results are
that<00:03:10.640> are<00:03:10.850> quite<00:03:11.210> impressive<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:13.190> actual<00:03:13.730> fact

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that are quite impressive in actual fact

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.110 
that are quite impressive in actual fact
we're<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.210> to<00:03:14.270> do<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:15.580> comparison<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
we're going to do a comparison of the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.490 
we're going to do a comparison of the
results<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:17.930> get<00:03:18.080> out<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.380> these

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
results that you can get out of these

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.580 
results that you can get out of these
different<00:03:18.890> lenses<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:19.970> can<00:03:20.180> watch<00:03:20.590> in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
different lenses that you can watch in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.800 
different lenses that you can watch in
the<00:03:22.220> next<00:03:22.580> episode<00:03:23.030> basically<00:03:23.330> what<00:03:23.690> we're

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
the next episode basically what we're

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.330 
the next episode basically what we're
going<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:23.960> do<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.140> we're<00:03:24.230> going<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.410> use<00:03:24.980> each

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
going to do is we're going to use each

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.280 
going to do is we're going to use each
one<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.730> these<00:03:25.790> lenses<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.360> film<00:03:26.750> through<00:03:27.170> it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
one of these lenses in a film through it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.920 
one of these lenses in a film through it
on<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.440> 7d<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.310> film<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.910> results<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.810> can

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
on a 7d and film the results so you can

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.570 
on a 7d and film the results so you can
see<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.200> different<00:03:30.470> scale<00:03:30.800> of<00:03:31.010> these<00:03:31.100> coins

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
see the different scale of these coins

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.780 
see the different scale of these coins
so<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:33.910> off-the-shelf<00:03:34.910> independent<00:03:35.720> brand

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
so a off-the-shelf independent brand

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.650 
so a off-the-shelf independent brand
reasonably<00:03:37.790> priced<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.180> think<00:03:38.360> something<00:03:38.570> like

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
reasonably priced I think something like

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.120 
reasonably priced I think something like
this<00:03:38.810> will<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:38.990> a<00:03:39.080> couple<00:03:39.410> hundred<00:03:39.500> quid<00:03:39.890> which

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
this will be a couple hundred quid which

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.240 
this will be a couple hundred quid which
is<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.400> know<00:03:40.520> $300<00:03:41.360> that's<00:03:42.050> got<00:03:42.440> telephoto

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
is you know $300 that's got telephoto

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.150 
is you know $300 that's got telephoto
features<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.820> macro<00:03:44.480> features<00:03:44.990> now<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.040> can

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
features and macro features now you can

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.280 
features and macro features now you can
go<00:03:46.250> all<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.490> way<00:03:46.580> up<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:47.030> something<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.050> lot

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
go all the way up to something a lot

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.910 
go all the way up to something a lot
more<00:03:48.500> expensive<00:03:48.860> this<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:50.680> dedicated<00:03:51.680> macro

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
more expensive this is a dedicated macro

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.100 
more expensive this is a dedicated macro
lens<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.330> quite<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.570> special<00:03:54.020> one

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
lens and this is quite a special one

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.550 
lens and this is quite a special one
this<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.440> MP<00:03:54.800> II<00:03:54.830> 65<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.990> doesn't

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
this is the MP II 65 and this doesn't

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.590 
this is the MP II 65 and this doesn't
give<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.860> just<00:03:58.070> one-to-one<00:03:58.760> power<00:03:59.090> this

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
give you just one-to-one power this

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.650 
give you just one-to-one power this

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
gives you five times magnification five

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.110 
gives you five times magnification five
times<00:04:03.020> life-size<00:04:03.740> on<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.070> full-frame<00:04:04.550> sensor

times life-size on a full-frame sensor

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.150 
times life-size on a full-frame sensor
which<00:04:05.600> means<00:04:05.840> we<00:04:05.990> can<00:04:06.140> get<00:04:06.260> an<00:04:06.380> incredible

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
which means we can get an incredible

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.730 
which means we can get an incredible
tiny<00:04:07.490> amount<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.880> detail<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.420> shot<00:04:08.740> fantastic

again in the next episode you'll see the
results<00:04:15.530> of<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.890> compared<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.520> this<00:04:16.670> one<00:04:16.910> and

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
results of this compared to this one and

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.990 
results of this compared to this one and
compared<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:17.630> one<00:04:17.840> but<00:04:18.820> some<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.910> these

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
compared to this one but some of these

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.760 
compared to this one but some of these
macro<00:04:20.480> lenses<00:04:20.870> like<00:04:21.080> this<00:04:21.260> can<00:04:21.500> be<00:04:21.590> quite

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
macro lenses like this can be quite

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.100 
macro lenses like this can be quite
expensive<00:04:21.890> this<00:04:22.460> one<00:04:22.640> I<00:04:22.670> think<00:04:22.790> maybe<00:04:23.540> retails

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
expensive this one I think maybe retails

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.310 
expensive this one I think maybe retails
at<00:04:24.290> about<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.560> thousand<00:04:25.100> pounds<00:04:25.280> maybe<00:04:26.320> more

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
at about a thousand pounds maybe more

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.590 
at about a thousand pounds maybe more
maybe<00:04:27.560> about<00:04:27.860> $1,500<00:04:28.700> not<00:04:28.850> quite<00:04:29.030> sure

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
maybe about $1,500 not quite sure

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.650 
maybe about $1,500 not quite sure
as<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:30.110> said<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.440> one<00:04:30.650> may<00:04:31.130> be<00:04:31.190> 200-pound<00:04:31.940> $300

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
as I said that one may be 200-pound $300

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.080 
as I said that one may be 200-pound $300
this<00:04:33.260> one<00:04:33.500> comes<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.040> camera<00:04:34.430> but<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.730> can

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
this one comes with the camera but I can

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.460 
this one comes with the camera but I can
show<00:04:35.240> you<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.360> way<00:04:35.540> where<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.810> can<00:04:35.840> convert

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
show you a way where you can convert

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.770 
show you a way where you can convert
this<00:04:36.770> into<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.130> more<00:04:37.460> powerful<00:04:37.760> macro<00:04:38.540> lens

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
this into a more powerful macro lens

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.560 
this into a more powerful macro lens
with<00:04:39.350> some<00:04:39.620> simple<00:04:40.070> accessories<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:41.210> that's

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
with some simple accessories and that's

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.320 
with some simple accessories and that's
these<00:04:41.810> things<00:04:42.170> these<00:04:43.040> things<00:04:43.460> are<00:04:43.850> called

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
these things these things are called

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.040 
these things these things are called
extension<00:04:45.050> tubes<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:46.480> extension<00:04:47.480> tubes<00:04:47.810> are

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
extension tubes and extension tubes are

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.880 
extension tubes and extension tubes are
basically<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:49.510> lensless<00:04:50.510> tube<00:04:51.350> meaning

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
basically a lensless tube meaning

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.620 
basically a lensless tube meaning
they've<00:04:52.040> got<00:04:52.250> no<00:04:52.430> glass<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:53.090> there<00:04:53.240> just<00:04:53.330> act

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
they've got no glass in there just act

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.590 
they've got no glass in there just act
as<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> spacer<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.640> put<00:04:55.880> between<00:04:56.060> your

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
as a spacer that you put between your

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.110 
as a spacer that you put between your
lens<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.380> camera<00:04:57.560> body<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.700> effectively

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
lens and the camera body so effectively

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.510 
lens and the camera body so effectively
you<00:04:59.270> take<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.600> lens<00:04:59.810> off<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.410> then<00:05:01.280> you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
you take the lens off and then you

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.840 
you take the lens off and then you
install<00:05:02.390> one<00:05:02.990> of<00:05:03.050> these<00:05:03.340> extension<00:05:04.340> tube

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
install one of these extension tube

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.540 
install one of these extension tube
spacers<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.660> then<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.530> reattach<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.370> lens

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
spacers and then you reattach the lens

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.150 
spacers and then you reattach the lens
on<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.880> front<00:05:07.910> and<00:05:08.600> that<00:05:08.660> then<00:05:09.380> allows<00:05:09.860> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
on the front and that then allows the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.910 
on the front and that then allows the
lens<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.670> focus<00:05:10.700> much<00:05:11.360> closer<00:05:11.930> than<00:05:12.410> it<00:05:12.710> could

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
lens to focus much closer than it could

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.400 
lens to focus much closer than it could
previously<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.850> therefore<00:05:14.810> giving<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:15.290> an

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
previously and therefore giving you an

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.570 
previously and therefore giving you an
increase<00:05:16.160> in<00:05:16.400> magnification<00:05:17.270> but<00:05:17.840> all<00:05:18.140> a<00:05:18.620> much

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
increase in magnification but all a much

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.760 
increase in magnification but all a much
reduced<00:05:19.910> cost<00:05:20.480> too<00:05:20.690> compared<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.260> buying<00:05:21.470> an

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
reduced cost too compared to buying an

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.100 
reduced cost too compared to buying an
actual<00:05:21.950> macro<00:05:22.520> lens<00:05:22.730> now<00:05:23.330> optically<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
actual macro lens now optically the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.380 
actual macro lens now optically the
quality<00:05:24.530> isn't<00:05:24.800> as<00:05:25.190> good<00:05:25.430> it's<00:05:25.970> not<00:05:26.150> as

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
quality isn't as good it's not as

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.570 
quality isn't as good it's not as
perfectly<00:05:27.230> suited<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.830> macro<00:05:28.190> work<00:05:28.370> as<00:05:28.550> a

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
perfectly suited to macro work as a

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.340 
perfectly suited to macro work as a
dedicated<00:05:29.270> macro<00:05:29.450> lens<00:05:29.870> so<00:05:29.990> if<00:05:30.080> you're<00:05:30.200> really

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
dedicated macro lens so if you're really

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.750 
dedicated macro lens so if you're really
into<00:05:30.710> macro<00:05:31.010> photography<00:05:31.130> you<00:05:31.550> want<00:05:31.700> to

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
into macro photography you want to

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.920 
into macro photography you want to
really<00:05:31.940> get<00:05:32.060> into<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.240> then<00:05:32.630> obviously

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
really get into it then obviously

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.770 
really get into it then obviously
getting<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.860> true<00:05:34.130> macro<00:05:34.460> lens<00:05:34.700> is<00:05:34.880> great<00:05:35.030> but

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
getting a true macro lens is great but

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.690 
getting a true macro lens is great but
these<00:05:36.380> things<00:05:36.710> are<00:05:36.950> fantastic<00:05:37.040> because

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
these things are fantastic because

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.760 
these things are fantastic because
they're<00:05:37.970> really<00:05:38.570> well<00:05:38.960> priced<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.500> think<00:05:39.680> you

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
they're really well priced I think you

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.710 
they're really well priced I think you
can<00:05:39.950> pick<00:05:40.100> up<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.370> set<00:05:40.730> of<00:05:40.760> these<00:05:40.970> extension

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
can pick up a set of these extension

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.060 
can pick up a set of these extension
tubes<00:05:42.020> for<00:05:42.980> around<00:05:44.410> 120<00:05:45.410> dollars<00:05:45.800> something

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
tubes for around 120 dollars something

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.210 
tubes for around 120 dollars something
like<00:05:46.250> that<00:05:46.610> that's<00:05:46.910> about<00:05:47.120> 90<00:05:47.600> pounds<00:05:47.810> and

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
like that that's about 90 pounds and

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.960 
like that that's about 90 pounds and
they<00:05:49.220> come<00:05:49.490> as<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.640> set<00:05:49.970> of<00:05:51.670> extension<00:05:52.670> tubes

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
they come as a set of extension tubes

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.470 
they come as a set of extension tubes
that<00:05:53.660> you<00:05:53.840> can<00:05:54.140> basically<00:05:55.010> use<00:05:55.480> individually

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
that you can basically use individually

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.840 
that you can basically use individually
to<00:05:56.840> give<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.080> different<00:05:57.260> strengths<00:05:58.040> or<00:05:58.220> you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
to give you different strengths or you

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.350 
to give you different strengths or you
can<00:05:58.970> use<00:05:59.150> all<00:05:59.420> three<00:05:59.870> of<00:06:00.020> them<00:06:00.430> combined<00:06:01.430> to

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
can use all three of them combined to

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.750 
can use all three of them combined to
give<00:06:02.540> you<00:06:02.690> a<00:06:02.720> super<00:06:03.260> strength<00:06:03.890> massive

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
give you a super strength massive

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.270 
give you a super strength massive
enlargement<00:06:05.830> ridiculously<00:06:06.830> scaled

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
enlargement ridiculously scaled

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.150 
enlargement ridiculously scaled
enlargement<00:06:08.530> compared<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.680> what<00:06:09.860> you'd<00:06:10.010> get

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
enlargement compared to what you'd get

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.300 
enlargement compared to what you'd get
with<00:06:10.490> just<00:06:10.700> the<00:06:10.850> lens<00:06:11.030> on<00:06:11.390> its<00:06:11.630> own<00:06:11.980> now<00:06:12.980> whilst

material that you can cover obviously

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.430 
material that you can cover obviously
there<00:06:19.880> are<00:06:20.060> lots<00:06:20.240> of<00:06:20.630> other<00:06:20.840> things<00:06:21.200> that<00:06:21.290> you

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
there are lots of other things that you

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.470 
there are lots of other things that you
can<00:06:21.620> photograph<00:06:21.830> in<00:06:22.340> macro<00:06:22.910> mode<00:06:22.940> it<00:06:23.210> doesn't

have to be flowers at spring it can be

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.090 
have to be flowers at spring it can be
all<00:06:25.340> sorts<00:06:25.370> of<00:06:25.760> abstract<00:06:26.510> shots<00:06:27.080> or<00:06:27.380> different

all sorts of abstract shots or different
small<00:06:28.340> objects<00:06:28.880> even<00:06:29.030> stuff<00:06:29.360> you<00:06:29.540> find<00:06:29.720> around

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
small objects even stuff you find around

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.510

the home that you want to do some sort

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.370 
the home that you want to do some sort
of<00:06:31.550> weird<00:06:31.820> detail<00:06:32.420> shots<00:06:32.720> or<00:06:32.900> like<00:06:33.050> maybe<00:06:33.230> the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
of weird detail shots or like maybe the

end of a pencil or something and

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.640 
end of a pencil or something and
interestingly<00:06:36.610> these<00:06:37.610> compact<00:06:38.240> cameras<00:06:38.750> have

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
interestingly these compact cameras have

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.670 
interestingly these compact cameras have
a<00:06:40.040> built-in<00:06:40.850> macro<00:06:41.090> mode<00:06:41.479> as<00:06:41.720> well

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
a built-in macro mode as well

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.080 
a built-in macro mode as well
and<00:06:42.770> quite<00:06:43.039> surprisingly<00:06:43.160> you<00:06:43.789> can<00:06:43.820> actually

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
and quite surprisingly you can actually

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.270 
and quite surprisingly you can actually
get<00:06:44.389> pretty<00:06:44.690> good<00:06:44.930> macro<00:06:45.320> results<00:06:46.039> out<00:06:46.220> of

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
get pretty good macro results out of

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.100 
get pretty good macro results out of
these<00:06:46.729> compact<00:06:47.240> cameras<00:06:47.600> when<00:06:47.750> you<00:06:47.810> put<00:06:47.990> them

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
these compact cameras when you put them

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.129 
these compact cameras when you put them
into<00:06:48.259> the<00:06:48.580> macro<00:06:49.580> mode<00:06:49.759> setting<00:06:50.539> on<00:06:50.750> the

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
into the macro mode setting on the

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.230 
into the macro mode setting on the
camera<00:06:51.169> it<00:06:52.160> allows<00:06:52.490> you<00:06:52.699> to<00:06:52.759> focus<00:06:53.000> that

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
camera it allows you to focus that

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.760 
camera it allows you to focus that
little<00:06:53.660> bit<00:06:53.780> closer<00:06:54.050> and<00:06:54.259> you<00:06:54.320> can<00:06:54.380> do<00:06:54.590> some

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
little bit closer and you can do some

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.670 
little bit closer and you can do some
really<00:06:55.220> good<00:06:55.400> detail<00:06:56.030> shots<00:06:56.720> abstract<00:06:57.410> shots

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
really good detail shots abstract shots
