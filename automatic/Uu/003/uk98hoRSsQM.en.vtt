have your armchairs or side chairs or
Ottomans<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.280> kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.700> zone<00:00:48.600> around<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Ottomans they kind of zone around the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.000 
Ottomans they kind of zone around the
sofa<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.239> sectional<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.270> you're<00:00:51.600> using
