00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.910
 Now I'm worried if I'm very 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.889
 worried because I know it's a time it 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.400
 is reading the book of 50 shadows and 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.530
 well I was at the beginning because 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.910
 I do not read, I do not like it, but when I 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.830
 I saw that a movie was going to come out of 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.540
 book and I said nothing this book should be 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.460
 moving web google and I personally 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.420
 I was excited so I read the book and in 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.040
 how much does it mean that I read it 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.540
 I really want to say that then in 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.030
 wikipedia but I always very 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.010
 excited very humble very hot 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.750
 between wikipedia and the first thing I read 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.730
 it's sex and I said for my own lie 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.499
 the issue is that I keep reading and the thing 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.390
 it was getting worse I'm putting 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.190
 better depending on your tastes of acosta 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.640
 that my face as I was reading was 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.640
 common 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.120
 the hardcore web book or I had 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.949
 I read the book that at 50 shades of sacha 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.570
 and I did not have that much sexual practice 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.489
 work with compared to the book of 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.620
 the 50 shades of game would really be 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.690
 I could not sleep 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.520
 a lie the thing is that I am very 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.530
 curious but always humble always 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.180
 respectful simple hot I followed 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.130
 looking for more things about this book so 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.780
 peculiar peculiar psoe but and when that 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.070
 the thing was getting worse 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.810
 first we must understand the context 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.610
 of the book in which we have two 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.409
 protagonists one called cristian gray 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.880
 who is a young billionaire addicted to 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.830
 the dildos and another is a young 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.420
 university called fan to this demand 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.890
 summarizing the story one assumes that 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.300
 young to stay have only one 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 interview of this young gray but 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.670
 when she sees it for the first time is that 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.820
 gives therefore one writes nothing then 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.790
 the interview does not go well 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.080
 the axes of the book the thing that arrives a 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.390
 moment in which our young 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.040
 Anastasia wakes up magically in the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.540
 department of cristian green and with its 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.490
 addiction to sex toys 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.940
 he says then he is going to have sex 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.250
 sexual with you and you will see here all 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.630
 acceptable because this guy I do not know 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.830
 and the title says they want in relation 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.840
 between them but what comes next 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.140
 it really did not let me sleep because it's going to 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.820
 have sex with you but 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.530
 first signed this contract 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.090
 the young man has to sign a contract 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.920
 so you can stay here 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.660
 we enter a deep level disorder 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.610
 mental but we have to understand 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 that this serious guy is a young tycoon 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.030
 of business that obviously has to 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.220
 have contracts everywhere but 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.390
 take contracts to sex and know that 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.400
 the guy is a professional but 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.740
 women you do not find a little 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.600
 kill that because you believe me 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.370
 I know and good by following the story 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.440
 they then come out to turn me around in a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.630
 helicopter to something else because they do not stop 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.280
 have your women watch this movie and 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.959
 unless they go to the cinema truth the two 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.790
 together because that time has to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.500
 Silver and you can only buy our 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.270
 of cinema and more above notes that about 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.980
 the losses that she took to walk in 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.930
 helicopter and you already take it back to 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.220
 the square in your car 200 papers a day 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.870
 that is if you are everything to see the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.870
 movie to the cinema she will be all the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.970
 time with a face of injustice and you with 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.410
 one side of your videos but following 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.209
 with the story cristian gray in the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.730
 helicopter passed him a contract 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.440
 Confidentiality imagine how it continued 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.480
 if they actually asked for a contract to 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.370
 everything for this city brings a coffee but 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.260
 first sign this to the stay prepare 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.360
 mind breakfast but first sign this 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.710
 come up if it's let me get rid of all look 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.570
 sadomasochistic caused 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.640
 more childish about your defenseless body 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.620
 but first you signed contract 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.210
 honestly do not keep reading anything else 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.860
 because I did not like it but that's my 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.480
 personal opinion and you know that there is only 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.120
 Two ways of receiving an opinion 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.650
 first is to accept and practice it and 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.650
 another is to send the chucha 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.800
 can you leave me in the comments that 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.959
