00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:15.560
 I'm going to make orange muffins and 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:20.689
 lima for this we need 250 ml of 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:25.010
 oil 90 milliliters of milk 250 grams 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:29.029
 of sugar 250 grams of flour grated 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.140
 of orange and lime 4 eggs and an envelope 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.820
 yeast chemical royale 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.610
 we started putting the sugar and the 4 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.070
 eggs in a bowl now we're going to 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.920
 beat well until doubled so 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.350
 less its volume and let's see that it has 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.260
 bleached that is like a foam 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.079
 whitish so now to beat a 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.440
 I look at how after beating 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.930
 increased the volume and is like 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.890
 whitish now let's add the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.530
 90 milliliters of milk and 250 milliliters of milk 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.259
 oil equivalent to a glass of those from 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.899
 water once we have added milk 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.320
 and the oil we beat a little more to 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.470
 mix everything and then we're going to 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.860
 add the flour is approved together with 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.860
 yeast 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.740
 helping us with a strainer let's go 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:27.250
 sifting the flour to which we have 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.880
 mixed the yeast 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:35.119
 and once we have passed the whole moon 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.380
 we will mix the goal with a spatula 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.380
 with enveloping movements 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.909
 and finally once we have mixed 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.490
 add the flour zest 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.310
 lime and orange and again with 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.679
 outflanking as we go 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.090
 mixing the good with this there will be 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:01.340
 finished the preparation of the dough 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.610
 once well mixed we will cover it and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.550
 we will put to the refrigerator 6 to 7 hours 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.430
 and then we'll continue from the fridge the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.560
 mass accredits and now what we 're going to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.420
 making help from a spoon is and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.570
 filling the molds in this case of 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.970
 silicone because they rise better like three 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.850
 we will fill them with a little finger 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.700
 of free space above because 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.980
 then win go up in the oven you see no 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.470
 up to the top and then 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.020
 we want spurred on a little bit 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.630
 of sugar now we will put the tray to 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.630
 oven in the second height below to 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:45.630
 about 210 215 degrees about 15 16 minutes 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.380
 roughly we just pulled out of the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.380
 muffins oven 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.440
 and you see 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.440
 as in your life 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.500
 now we wait for them to cool down to 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.800
 remove the silicone and start 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.890
 savor the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.490
 Here we present a few of our 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.490
 muffin 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.680
 that has a delicious taste for the lime 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.680
