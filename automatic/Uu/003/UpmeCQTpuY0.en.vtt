00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
so our philosophy here we do a lot of

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.619 
so our philosophy here we do a lot of
ground-based<00:03:47.560> explosive<00:03:48.459> movements<00:03:48.879> we<00:03:49.480> have

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
ground-based explosive movements we have

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.539 
ground-based explosive movements we have
machines<00:03:50.049> use<00:03:50.590> machines<00:03:50.950> over<00:03:51.190> we<00:03:51.400> have

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
machines use machines over we have

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.630 
machines use machines over we have
offices<00:03:51.909> a<00:03:52.269> lot<00:03:52.599> of<00:03:52.720> three<00:03:52.900> blades<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.379> like<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
offices a lot of three blades I like the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.759 
offices a lot of three blades I like the
move<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.909> weight<00:03:55.090> off<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.420> floor<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.650> to

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
move of weight off the floor I like to

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.160 
move of weight off the floor I like to
get<00:03:56.860> them<00:03:57.040> moving<00:03:57.580> -<00:03:57.790> my<00:03:58.090> goal<00:03:58.540> here<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:58.989> not<00:03:59.019> to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
get them moving - my goal here is not to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.570 
get them moving - my goal here is not to
make<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.470> weight<00:03:59.680> limit<00:03:59.920> use<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.129> bigger<00:04:00.340> soccer

so<00:04:01.330> movement<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:02.379> key<00:04:02.680> for<00:04:02.709> me<00:04:02.980> how<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.310> room

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
so movement is key for me how that room

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.180 
so movement is key for me how that room
would<00:04:03.670> stay<00:04:03.879> in<00:04:03.940> addressed<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.629> flexible<00:04:05.290> stain

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190

main goal we get their wings they're

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.420 
main goal we get their wings they're
gonna<00:04:12.790> get<00:04:13.090> them<00:04:13.980> explosive<00:04:14.980> get<00:04:15.280> them

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
gonna get them explosive get them
