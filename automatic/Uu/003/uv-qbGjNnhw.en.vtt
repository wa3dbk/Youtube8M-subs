over<00:00:20.880> 13<00:00:21.330> left<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.439> particular<00:00:22.619> moment

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
over 13 left at this particular moment

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.640 
over 13 left at this particular moment
but<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.539> goes<00:00:24.660> into<00:00:24.779> standby<00:00:25.140> again<00:00:25.470> that

will<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.400> long<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:26.970> using<00:00:27.180> it

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
will go up as long as I'm not using it

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300 
will go up as long as I'm not using it
too<00:00:27.570> much<00:00:27.779> it'll<00:00:28.050> definitely<00:00:28.320> handle<00:00:29.099> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
user I like the design of the phone the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.650 
user I like the design of the phone the
fact<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.400> swings<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.239> six

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
fact that is it swings into six

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.780 
fact that is it swings into six
millimeters<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> edges<00:03:40.799> but<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.489> curved

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
millimeters on the edges but it's curved

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.000 
millimeters on the edges but it's curved
like<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:42.989> makes<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.530> feel<00:03:43.739> actually

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010

want to just go to a phone all around

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.990 
want to just go to a phone all around
with<00:05:32.840> an<00:05:32.930> SD<00:05:33.169> card<00:05:33.199> I<00:05:33.680> like<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.669> blue<00:05:34.820> light

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
with an SD card I like the blue light

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.490 
with an SD card I like the blue light
play<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.510> know<00:05:35.630> go<00:05:35.900> to<00:05:35.930> something<00:05:36.260> like<00:05:36.380> that

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
play you know go to something like that

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.469 
play you know go to something like that
now<00:05:36.889> that<00:05:37.039> device<00:05:37.370> obviously<00:05:37.729> is<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.150> quad<00:05:38.300> core

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
now that device obviously is a quad core

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.719 
now that device obviously is a quad core
as<00:05:38.599> well<00:05:38.750> but<00:05:39.159> maybe<00:05:40.159> I'll<00:05:40.370> do<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.490> matchup

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
as well but maybe I'll do a matchup

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.850 
as well but maybe I'll do a matchup
between<00:05:41.030> those<00:05:41.360> two<00:05:41.599> see<00:05:42.289> how<00:05:42.409> it<00:05:42.530> handles

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
between those two see how it handles

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.589 
between those two see how it handles
things<00:05:43.010> I<00:05:43.340> think<00:05:43.699> this<00:05:43.789> is<00:05:43.970> just<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.300> little<00:05:44.510> bit

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
things I think this is just a little bit

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.600 
things I think this is just a little bit
better<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:45.409> a<00:05:45.530> lot<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.800> areas<00:05:46.130> but<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.430> blue

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
better in a lot of areas but the blue

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.180 
better in a lot of areas but the blue
