Forge epidemic this is okhla hadith and
we're<00:00:04.319> gonna<00:00:04.470> be<00:00:04.650> covering<00:00:04.980> some<00:00:05.730> tricks<00:00:06.089> on

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
we're gonna be covering some tricks on

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.210 
we're gonna be covering some tricks on
how<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.600> get<00:00:06.779> virtually<00:00:07.140> unlimited<00:00:07.680> vehicles

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
how to get virtually unlimited vehicles

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.850 
how to get virtually unlimited vehicles
now<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.670> do<00:00:08.790> say<00:00:09.210> virtually<00:00:09.570> that's<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.559> bit<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
now I do say virtually that's a bit of a

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.700 
now I do say virtually that's a bit of a
caveat<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.309> can't<00:00:11.730> get<00:00:11.940> infinite<00:00:12.840> amount<00:00:13.620> of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
caveat you can't get infinite amount of

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.930 
caveat you can't get infinite amount of
vehicles<00:00:13.860> because<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.519> would<00:00:14.639> crash<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
vehicles because that would crash the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.790 
vehicles because that would crash the
game<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.750> get<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.049> ton<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.350> vehicles

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
game but you can get a ton of vehicles

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.170 
game but you can get a ton of vehicles
much<00:00:17.279> more<00:00:17.490> than<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.789> otherwise<00:00:18.060> have

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
much more than you would otherwise have

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
much more than you would otherwise have
so<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> main<00:00:19.020> trick<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.439> how<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.710> works<00:00:19.980> is

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
so the main trick of how this works is

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.279 
so the main trick of how this works is
you're<00:00:20.670> gonna<00:00:20.730> want<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> forge<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.600> bunch<00:00:22.140> of

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
you're gonna want to forge a bunch of

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.599 
you're gonna want to forge a bunch of
different<00:00:22.529> vehicles<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.949> your<00:00:23.070> map<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> by

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
different vehicles on your map and by

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.220 
different vehicles on your map and by
tweaking<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> game<00:00:24.510> type<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.960> will<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.170> able

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
tweaking the game type you will be able

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
tweaking the game type you will be able
to<00:00:25.380> transform<00:00:25.859> some<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> vehicles<00:00:26.460> into

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
to transform some of the vehicles into

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.820 
to transform some of the vehicles into
the<00:00:27.359> vehicles<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.810> want<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.500> I'm<00:00:28.560> gonna<00:00:28.680> go

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the vehicles you want so I'm gonna go

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.470 
the vehicles you want so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.010> show<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.400> guys<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.269> works

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
ahead and show you guys how that works

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.630 
ahead and show you guys how that works
so<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.199> custom<00:00:31.470> games<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:32.279> over<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> game

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
so in your custom games go over to game

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.000 
so in your custom games go over to game
options<00:00:33.030> go<00:00:33.750> down<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.050> general<00:00:34.350> settings<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
options go down to general settings and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
options go down to general settings and
then<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.730> vehicle<00:00:35.910> set<00:00:36.300> you're<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.570> change

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
then the vehicle set you're gonna change

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.440 
then the vehicle set you're gonna change
it<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.399> we're<00:00:38.489> gonna<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.059> change

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it so what we're gonna do here is change

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.869 
it so what we're gonna do here is change
it<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> mongooses<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.700> see

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it to mongooses and what you can see

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
it to mongooses and what you can see
here<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.629> warthogs<00:00:43.110> became<00:00:43.440> mongooses

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
here is the warthogs became mongooses

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.580 
here is the warthogs became mongooses
and<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.910> ghosts<00:00:45.360> became<00:00:45.870> mongooses<00:00:46.320> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and the ghosts became mongooses so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
and the ghosts became mongooses so
that's<00:00:46.739> how<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.100> extra<00:00:47.520> mongooses<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that's how you get extra mongooses so

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600 
that's how you get extra mongooses so
right<00:00:48.930> there<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.980> lot<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> mongooses

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
right there that's a lot of mongooses

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.700 
right there that's a lot of mongooses
and<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.590> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and if you want more what you can do is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.200 
and if you want more what you can do is
actually<00:00:52.829> add<00:00:53.100> vehicle<00:00:53.489> pads<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:54.120> we're

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
actually add vehicle pads now we're

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.189 
actually add vehicle pads now we're
gonna<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.480> ahead<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.960> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
gonna go ahead and make it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
gonna go ahead and make it
Warhawks<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.309> happens<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.270> this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Warhawks and see what happens so in this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.790 
Warhawks and see what happens so in this
case<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.379> tanks<00:00:59.160> became<00:00:59.460> more<00:00:59.640> hogs<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
case the tanks became more hogs the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.229 
case the tanks became more hogs the
wraiths<00:01:01.800> became<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:02.370> hugs<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.879> warthog

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
wraiths became more hugs and the warthog

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
wraiths became more hugs and the warthog
status<00:01:03.629> warthog<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.500> 24<00:01:05.369> right<00:01:05.700> there

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
status warthog so you get 24 right there

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.780 
status warthog so you get 24 right there
and<00:01:06.470> then<00:01:07.470> additionally<00:01:07.920> again<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.640> have

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and then additionally again you can have

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
and then additionally again you can have
vehicle<00:01:09.210> pads<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.750> more<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.680> we're<00:01:10.770> gonna

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
vehicle pads to get more now we're gonna

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.109 
vehicle pads to get more now we're gonna
go<00:01:11.040> ahead<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.250> change<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> light<00:01:11.909> ground

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
go ahead and change it to light ground

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.480 
go ahead and change it to light ground
and<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.540> happens<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.560> case<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and see what happens so in this case the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.969 
and see what happens so in this case the
wraiths<00:01:14.880> became<00:01:15.390> ghosts<00:01:15.930> ghosts<00:01:16.650> remain

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
wraiths became ghosts ghosts remain

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.499 
wraiths became ghosts ghosts remain
ghosts<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> tanks<00:01:18.360> became

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
ghosts and then the tanks became

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.170 
ghosts and then the tanks became
warthogs<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.350> you'll<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> refer<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.939> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
warthogs so you'll have to refer to this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
warthogs so you'll have to refer to this
video<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.080> each<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
video to see just how each of the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.260 
video to see just how each of the
different<00:01:22.920> vehicles<00:01:23.430> will<00:01:23.670> turn<00:01:23.939> into

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
different vehicles will turn into

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.340 
different vehicles will turn into
something<00:01:24.479> else

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
something else

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
something else
but<00:01:25.680> yeah<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.280> you're<00:01:26.400> gonna<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
but yeah this is how you're gonna get a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.850 
but yeah this is how you're gonna get a
combination<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.360> light<00:01:27.600> vehicles<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.200> in

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
combination of light vehicles and in

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
combination of light vehicles and in
this<00:01:28.979> case<00:01:29.250> yep<00:01:30.079> we're<00:01:31.079> gonna<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.380> ahead<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
this case yep we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
this case yep we're gonna go ahead and
look<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.920> tanks<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.869> here

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
look at tanks so what you can see here

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
look at tanks so what you can see here
is<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.009> mantises<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.270> down

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
is the mantises that I put down

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
is the mantises that I put down
additionally<00:01:37.380> become<00:01:37.680> tanks<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.579> seems

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
additionally become tanks and it seems

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.510 
additionally become tanks and it seems
to<00:01:38.970> give<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> preference<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.869> UNSC<00:01:40.799> tanks<00:01:41.189> where

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to give a preference to UNSC tanks where

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
to give a preference to UNSC tanks where
you're<00:01:41.640> gonna<00:01:41.700> note<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> however<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.720> can't

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you're gonna note is however you can't

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.120 
you're gonna note is however you can't
have<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> glitch<00:01:43.350> where<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.860> into<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
have a glitch where they go into the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.499 
have a glitch where they go into the
ground<00:01:44.340> because<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> mantas<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.180> would<00:01:45.299> see<00:01:45.420> is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
ground because the mantas I would see is

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
ground because the mantas I would see is
a<00:01:45.540> smaller<00:01:45.840> object<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.649> won't<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> problem

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
a smaller object it won't have a problem

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.380 
a smaller object it won't have a problem
with<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> ground<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.939> turns<00:01:48.000> into<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
with the ground but when it turns into a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
with the ground but when it turns into a
tank<00:01:48.689> it'll<00:01:49.380> interfere<00:01:49.649> with<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.130> ground

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
tank it'll interfere with the ground

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.639 
tank it'll interfere with the ground
over<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> put<00:01:52.290> aircraft

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
over here you know if you put aircraft

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.410 
over here you know if you put aircraft
you're<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.040> restricted<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> normal

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you're just restricted to the normal

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
you're just restricted to the normal
Banshee<00:01:54.869> there's<00:01:55.049> no<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> spawn<00:01:55.740> in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
Banshee there's no way to spawn in

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.550 
Banshee there's no way to spawn in
anything<00:01:56.100> else<00:01:56.399> which<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.210> too<00:01:57.479> bad<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:58.469> we're

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
anything else which is too bad now we're

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.050 
anything else which is too bad now we're
going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> go<00:01:58.829> ahead<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.159> mantises<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
going to go ahead and do mantises so in

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
going to go ahead and do mantises so in
this<00:02:00.149> case<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.170> tanks<00:02:01.530> turn<00:02:01.920> into

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this case all the tanks turn into

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.249 
this case all the tanks turn into
mantises<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.850> includes<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.600> Scorpion<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
mantises that includes the Scorpion and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.959 
mantises that includes the Scorpion and
the<00:02:04.320> race<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the race so this is how you get a lot of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.900 
the race so this is how you get a lot of
mantises<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:07.110> awesome<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.649> minigames<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
mantises it's awesome for minigames and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
mantises it's awesome for minigames and
anything<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.750> might<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.319> involving

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
anything you might want to do involving

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.460 
anything you might want to do involving
mantises<00:02:11.610> where<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> need<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.930> 16

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
mantises where you need all you know 16

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800 
mantises where you need all you know 16
players<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.520> them<00:02:14.730> now<00:02:15.450> we're<00:02:15.540> gonna<00:02:15.660> look

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
players to get them now we're gonna look

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.660 
players to get them now we're gonna look
at<00:02:15.930> human<00:02:16.260> vehicles<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
at human vehicles here you can see the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.990 
at human vehicles here you can see the
Wraiths<00:02:17.910> turned<00:02:18.690> into<00:02:19.400> scorpions<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.610> not

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
Wraiths turned into scorpions and not

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
Wraiths turned into scorpions and not
mantises<00:02:21.690> that's<00:02:21.990> an<00:02:22.140> important<00:02:22.530> note<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
mantises that's an important note and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.170 
mantises that's an important note and
the<00:02:23.190> ghost<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.580> back<00:02:23.670> turned<00:02:24.060> into

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the ghost in the back turned into

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.260 
the ghost in the back turned into
mongooses<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.440> yeah<00:02:25.890> keep<00:02:26.700> referring<00:02:27.000> back<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
mongooses so yeah keep referring back to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.550 
mongooses so yeah keep referring back to
this<00:02:27.450> video<00:02:27.690> when<00:02:27.840> you're<00:02:27.960> tweaking<00:02:28.200> your

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
this video when you're tweaking your

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.320 
this video when you're tweaking your
maps<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.070> trying<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.520> build<00:02:29.700> these<00:02:29.850> minigames

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
maps and trying to build these minigames

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.820 
maps and trying to build these minigames
because<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.690> not<00:02:30.810> exactly<00:02:30.960> obvious<00:02:31.530> what

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
because it's not exactly obvious what

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.580 
because it's not exactly obvious what
each<00:02:32.220> vehicle<00:02:32.820> will<00:02:33.000> turn<00:02:33.300> into<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:34.320> again

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
each vehicle will turn into but again

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.530 
each vehicle will turn into but again
you<00:02:34.740> know<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.490> also<00:02:35.610> add<00:02:35.910> vehicle<00:02:36.390> pads

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
you know you can also add vehicle pads

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.530 
you know you can also add vehicle pads
additionally<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.950> get<00:02:38.190> more<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.850> your

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
additionally to get more of your

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
additionally to get more of your
vehicles<00:02:39.990> for<00:02:40.350> whatever<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.680> want<00:02:40.860> for

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
vehicles for whatever you want for

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.610 
vehicles for whatever you want for
whatever<00:02:41.190> purpose<00:02:41.730> you're<00:02:41.940> gonna<00:02:42.090> need<00:02:42.620> then

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
whatever purpose you're gonna need then

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.410 
whatever purpose you're gonna need then
what<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.520> do<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.910> you're<00:02:45.000> gonna<00:02:45.060> go<00:02:45.300> ahead

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
what you can do is you're gonna go ahead

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
what you can do is you're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:45.720> go<00:02:46.140> back<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.410> menu<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.890> switch<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.400> all

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and go back to menu and switch it to all

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520 
and go back to menu and switch it to all
covenant<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.780> point<00:02:49.020> you'll<00:02:49.140> see<00:02:49.200> what

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
covenant at that point you'll see what

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.000 
covenant at that point you'll see what
happens

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
happens

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.660 
happens
so<00:02:50.490> warthogs<00:02:51.120> become<00:02:51.510> ghosts<00:02:52.670> mongooses

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
so warthogs become ghosts mongooses

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.050 
so warthogs become ghosts mongooses
become<00:02:54.000> ghosts<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.600> then<00:02:54.750> mantises<00:02:55.500> and

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
become ghosts and then mantises and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.000 
become ghosts and then mantises and
scorpions<00:02:57.060> become<00:02:57.600> wraiths<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.709> can<00:02:58.890> get

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
scorpions become wraiths so you can get

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.680 
scorpions become wraiths so you can get
a<00:02:59.040> lot<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.430> wraiths<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.820> a<00:03:00.000> lot<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.209> ghosts<00:03:00.600> by

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
a lot of wraiths and a lot of ghosts by

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.199 
a lot of wraiths and a lot of ghosts by
using<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.220> will<00:03:02.220> probably<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.610> developing<00:03:03.120> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
using this will probably be developing a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.420 
using this will probably be developing a
minigame<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> lot<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.050> race<00:03:04.290> some<00:03:05.010> mortar

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
minigame with a lot of race some mortar

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.760 
minigame with a lot of race some mortar

stuff<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.070> you'll<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.370> seen<00:03:08.610> come<00:03:08.880> back

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
stuff like that you'll be seen come back

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.699 
stuff like that you'll be seen come back
then<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.570> course<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:10.050> change<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.530> no

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
then of course you can change it to no

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.160 
then of course you can change it to no
human<00:03:11.040> no<00:03:11.130> covenant<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.450> I'm<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:12.810> gonna<00:03:12.930> show

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
human no covenant and I'm not gonna show

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.510 
human no covenant and I'm not gonna show
that<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.740> means<00:03:13.860> those<00:03:14.220> particular

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
that that just means those particular

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.190 
that that just means those particular
vehicles<00:03:15.090> won't<00:03:15.240> spawn<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> map<00:03:15.990> so

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
vehicles won't spawn on the map so

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.800 
vehicles won't spawn on the map so
that's<00:03:16.350> nothing<00:03:16.650> too<00:03:16.860> interesting<00:03:17.810> what

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that's nothing too interesting what

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.000 
that's nothing too interesting what

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
you're gonna want to play around with is

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.759 
you're gonna want to play around with is
the<00:03:20.280> traits<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.450> allow<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.930> force<00:03:22.440> spawn

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
the traits that allow you to force spawn

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.259 
the traits that allow you to force spawn
certain<00:03:23.310> vehicles<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.850> that's<00:03:23.970> what's<00:03:24.180> gonna

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
certain vehicles and that's what's gonna

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.390 
certain vehicles and that's what's gonna
get<00:03:24.510> at<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> more<00:03:24.989> interesting<00:03:25.500> moments<00:03:25.830> and
