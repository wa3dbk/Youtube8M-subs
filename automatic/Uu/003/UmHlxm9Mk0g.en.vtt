00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.750 
bring it up just as an illustration of
how<00:03:21.450> seemingly<00:03:22.620> random<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.829> but<00:03:24.579> it's<00:03:24.700> not

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
how seemingly random it is but it's not

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.330 
how seemingly random it is but it's not
random<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.660> only<00:03:26.110> got<00:03:26.440> there<00:03:26.709> because<00:03:26.829> I<00:03:27.070> made

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
random I only got there because I made

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.330 
random I only got there because I made
the<00:03:27.489> audience<00:03:27.640> fresh<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:29.530> saying<00:03:29.799> yeah<00:03:30.070> so

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the audience fresh just saying yeah so

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.400 
the audience fresh just saying yeah so
so<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.269> was<00:03:31.390> like<00:03:31.480> two<00:03:31.780> three<00:03:31.810> years<00:03:32.260> before

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
so that was like two three years before

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.740 
so that was like two three years before
silicon<00:03:32.980> even<00:03:33.220> became<00:03:34.060> came<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.600> fruition

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
silicon even became came to fruition

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.590 
silicon even became came to fruition
like<00:03:35.440> maybe<00:03:36.070> like<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.310> couple<00:03:36.820> years<00:03:37.180> at<00:03:37.450> most

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
like maybe like a couple years at most

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.370 
like maybe like a couple years at most
that's<00:03:37.900> crazy

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380
