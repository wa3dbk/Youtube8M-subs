00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.699
 hello everyone today we're going to see the use of 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.789
 The feet press special fabrics for 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.009
 sew buttonholes depending on the type of 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.160
 machine that you have of your seniority or of 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.950
 your model will have a standing type 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.719
 or another let's see these two models that 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.719
 are the most commonly used 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.630
 We started with the foot for buttonholes in a 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.970
 He passed 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.180
 It is the most common foot in machines 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.210
 modern its use is much simpler and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.210
 Quick 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.220
 this foot for the sat the ace has a 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.220
 mobile area in which we place the button 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.040
 which we want to make the buttonhole 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.950
 the size of the button is transferred to 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.560
 space between these two tabs that goes 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.770
 to determine the final size of our 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.770
 buttonhole 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.360
 to our sewing machine 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.570
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.320
 change the press foot normal fabrics by 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.930
 our special foot to make eyelets 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.880
 according to your machine model you will have to 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.560
 put it with the forward button or 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.130
 backwards but its use is going to be 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 similar 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.230
 we choose on our sewing machine the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.880
 corresponding program to do 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.880
 eyelets 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.740
 we place the fabric in the chosen position 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 for the buttonhole 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.200
 making it match the brand of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.320
 press fabrics 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 now we have to lower a lever one 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.340
 palanquita that we have in our 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 machine and that is the one that will make butt 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.340
 with the press foot fabrics 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.709
 so that the buttonhole comes out exactly 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.709
 of the measure that we need 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.430
 we can start sewing is a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 automatic program and we will not have 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.510
 nothing to worry about the machine 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.940
 will do everything alone she decides when 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.940
 start and when each stitch ends 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:40.000
 passes a pile of cultured backwards 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:43.180
 then a zigzag forward 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.920
 when the necessary length ends, 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.790
 the bottom or top top 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.390
 buttonhole and start again with the other 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.230
 side 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.880
 first a stitch 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.930
 and then a coating zigzag 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.290
 When finished, it will be paid 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.290
 automatically she 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.510
 we have finished our buttonhole 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.390
 depending on the type of machine you can have 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.310
 several buttonhole options is by 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.800
 example allows to do it in two heights 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.800
 different here you can see the result 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.650
 any case to open the eyelets already 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.250
 you know that the best option is to use 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.860
 old discs 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.230
 and now we will check that as it was 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.690
 wait for the machine has not been wrong 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.060
 the eyelets are made to order 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.060
 exact necessary for our button 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.159
 let's see now the use of the cloth press 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.060
 it's normal for a buttonhole made in four 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.819
 time 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.910
 the difference here is that we are 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.610
 those who decided the length and the width 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.440
 when to start and when to finish 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.440
 stitch of our leaves 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.620
 so we will take the measures well 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.080
 and we will mark the exact position where 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.550
 we want the beginning the end and the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.550
 center above 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.660
 here we have the marks on the press foot 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.320
 fabrics 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.780
 first tell you that it is usually marked 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.270
 with the letter m 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.440
 this kind of press fabrics special for 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.220
 eyelets 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.560
 the red lines allow us to align 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.870
 our press fabrics with the beginning or 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.870
 the end of lohan we are going to sew 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:21.260
 now we select step number 1 in 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.520
 our sewing machine number 1 we 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:29.710
 will do the corresponding stitches 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.710
 to the right side of loja 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.499
 remember that it is always you who chooses 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:42.990
 how long will each step last? 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.990
 be the length of each of these steps 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:50.830
 we select number 2 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.409
 this step makes the lower stitches 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.499
 of the buttonhole 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:06:00.229
 you have to decide how many stitches to 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:06:00.229
 make it normal from 4 to 6 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:06.330
 the next step the number 3 the machine 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.790
 will go backwards doing the 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:14.040
 stitch zig zag to complete 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.040
 the left side of the buttonhole 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:26.669
 and finally step 4 are again from 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.979
 4 to 6 stitches on top of the 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.979
 buttonhole that end up finishing 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.130
 and we have finished our home 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.190
 in this case if you want to repeat or review 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.040
 Some of the parts of the buttonhole have 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.810
 to select just that step in your 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.800
 things machine 1 on 2 on 3 or 4 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.800
 according to what you want to repeat
