today<00:00:08.040> I'm<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.370> showing<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:08.880> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.160 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
slave<00:00:09.780> an<00:00:10.139> axis<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.830> Mach<00:00:11.400> 3<00:00:11.670> with<00:00:11.880> Apollo<00:00:12.420> 3

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
slave an axis in Mach 3 with Apollo 3

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.340 
slave an axis in Mach 3 with Apollo 3
motion<00:00:13.650> controller<00:00:13.980> from<00:00:14.130> la<00:00:14.309> cuestión<00:00:15.350> it's

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
motion controller from la cuestión it's

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.140 
motion controller from la cuestión it's
not<00:00:16.440> uncommon<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:16.949> larger<00:00:17.430> machines<00:00:17.789> like

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
not uncommon for larger machines like

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.750 
not uncommon for larger machines like
plasmas<00:00:18.750> water<00:00:19.020> jets<00:00:19.320> or<00:00:19.529> routers<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.490> have

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
plasmas water jets or routers to have

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.540 
plasmas water jets or routers to have
two<00:00:21.090> motors<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.109> gantry<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.680> move<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> back

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
two motors on the gantry to move it back

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
two motors on the gantry to move it back
and<00:00:23.760> forth<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.140> set<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.680> that

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and forth so this is how to set up that

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
and forth so this is how to set up that
second<00:00:26.430> motor<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> copies<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:28.019> one

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
second motor so it copies the first one

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.439 
second motor so it copies the first one
so<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.560> don't<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> command<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.519> say<00:00:30.300> an

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
so you don't have to command and say an

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.780 
so you don't have to command and say an
X<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.960> an<00:00:31.080> A<00:00:31.369> simultaneously<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.640> what

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
X and an A simultaneously to get what

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.840 
X and an A simultaneously to get what
you<00:00:32.820> want<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.690> I'm<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.050> set<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.890> x

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you want so I'm going to set up the x

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.979 
you want so I'm going to set up the x
axis<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.600> run<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.550> control<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> X<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
axis to run the to control the X and the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.650 
axis to run the to control the X and the
a<00:00:40.020> axis<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> only<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> control<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> X

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
a axis so you only have to control the X

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.600 
a axis so you only have to control the X
so<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.530> now<00:00:43.710> when<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.820> move<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> x<00:00:45.420> axis

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.430 

it<00:00:49.600> just<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.620> x-axis<00:00:51.130> moves<00:00:51.340> so<00:00:52.270> to<00:00:52.780> slave<00:00:53.290> an

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
it just the x-axis moves so to slave an

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.770 
it just the x-axis moves so to slave an
axis<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:54.130> first<00:00:54.370> step<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:55.150> go<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.330> config

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
axis the first step is to go to config

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.970 
axis the first step is to go to config
and<00:00:55.960> then<00:00:56.400> slave<00:00:57.400> axis<00:00:58.200> so<00:00:59.200> here<00:00:59.500> we're<00:00:59.800> going

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
and then slave axis so here we're going

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.820 
and then slave axis so here we're going
to<00:01:00.070> slave<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> axis<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.960> X<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.710> we'll

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
to slave the a axis to the X so we'll

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.000 
to slave the a axis to the X so we'll
check<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:04.480> we<00:01:04.660> hit<00:01:04.750> okay<00:01:05.110> now<00:01:05.830> give

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
check that and then we hit okay now give

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.000 
check that and then we hit okay now give
this<00:01:06.160> message<00:01:06.550> we<00:01:06.940> have<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.180> restart<00:01:07.510> Mach<00:01:07.720> 3

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
this message we have to restart Mach 3

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.950 
this message we have to restart Mach 3
so<00:01:09.010> hit<00:01:09.160> OK

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.920 

close<00:01:12.530> my<00:01:12.740> threes<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.340> session<00:01:13.940> if<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.750> have

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
close my threes and session if you have

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.760 
close my threes and session if you have

the new high con plug-in version 1.3 4.9

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.730 
the new high con plug-in version 1.3 4.9
or<00:01:19.010> later<00:01:19.190> then<00:01:19.970> you're<00:01:20.630> done<00:01:20.810> at<00:01:21.260> this<00:01:21.470> point

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
or later then you're done at this point

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.030 
or later then you're done at this point
and<00:01:21.890> your<00:01:22.400> activities<00:01:23.300> are<00:01:23.480> slate<00:01:23.720> if<00:01:24.650> you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
and your activities are slate if you

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.310 
and your activities are slate if you
have<00:01:25.190> an<00:01:25.370> earlier<00:01:25.730> version<00:01:25.970> then<00:01:26.660> you<00:01:27.020> have<00:01:27.170> to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
have an earlier version then you have to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.670 
have an earlier version then you have to
do<00:01:27.470> this<00:01:27.620> next<00:01:27.920> step<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.900> next<00:01:30.110> step<00:01:30.470> if

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
do this next step so the next step if

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.670 
do this next step so the next step if
necessary<00:01:31.220> is<00:01:31.370> to<00:01:31.430> come<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.850> config<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.450> then

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
necessary is to come to config and then

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.940 
necessary is to come to config and then
config<00:01:33.680> plugins<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.250> click<00:01:34.810> on<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.290> config

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
config plugins and click on the config

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.370 
config plugins and click on the config
for<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.280> hike<00:01:37.400> on<00:01:37.580> plug-in<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.170> then<00:01:39.170> go<00:01:39.320> to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
for the hike on plug-in and then go to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.980 
for the hike on plug-in and then go to
the<00:01:40.250> tab<00:01:40.460> for<00:01:40.910> your<00:01:41.060> slave<00:01:41.300> axis<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:41.930> this

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
the tab for your slave axis so in this

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.280 
the tab for your slave axis so in this
case<00:01:42.200> if<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> axis<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:44.080> you'll<00:01:45.080> need<00:01:45.229> to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
case if the a axis and you'll need to

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.240 
case if the a axis and you'll need to
change<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.890> index<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.200> number<00:01:48.710> of<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
change the index to the number of the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.400 
change the index to the number of the
axis<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.000> are<00:01:50.090> slaving<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.290> in

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
axis that you are slaving it to so in

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.440 
axis that you are slaving it to so in
this<00:01:51.500> case<00:01:51.740> we're<00:01:52.040> sliding<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.520> X<00:01:52.729> so

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
this case we're sliding it to the X so

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.560 
this case we're sliding it to the X so
the<00:01:53.600> index<00:01:53.930> number<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.380> here<00:01:54.770> X<00:01:54.920> 0<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.450> we'll

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
the index number is here X 0 so we'll

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.920 
the index number is here X 0 so we'll
change<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:57.020> index<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.619> 0<00:01:57.860> normally<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:58.369> 3

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
change the index to 0 normally it's 3

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.150 
change the index to 0 normally it's 3
it's<00:01:59.930> already<00:02:00.229> changed<00:02:00.560> here<00:02:00.740> because<00:02:01.010> I'm

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
it's already changed here because I'm

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.219 
it's already changed here because I'm
using<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.670> new<00:02:01.790> plug-in<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.690> would<00:02:02.810> just

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
using the new plug-in but you would just

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.130 
using the new plug-in but you would just
from<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.650> drop<00:02:03.860> down<00:02:03.890> select<00:02:04.490> 0<00:02:04.810> hit<00:02:05.810> save

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
from the drop down select 0 hit save

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.840 
from the drop down select 0 hit save
config<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.800> then<00:02:07.570> hit<00:02:08.570> ok<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:10.729> we'll

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
config and then hit ok so then we'll

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.010 
config and then hit ok so then we'll

was add an additional motor to the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.850 
was add an additional motor to the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
both the motors were moving in the same

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.980 
both the motors were moving in the same

the<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.510> example<00:02:51.570> could<00:02:51.990> be<00:02:52.140> reversed<00:02:52.560> from

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the a for example could be reversed from

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.140 
the a for example could be reversed from
the<00:02:53.040> way<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.220> should<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.430> going<00:02:53.520> even<00:02:54.060> though

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the way it should be going even though

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.260 
the way it should be going even though
it's<00:02:54.300> moving<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.930> same<00:02:55.080> amount<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.800> X<00:02:56.270> so

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
it's moving the same amount as the X so

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.300 
it's moving the same amount as the X so
to<00:02:57.330> change<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.650> hit<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.980> reversed

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
to change that you just hit the reversed

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.940 
to change that you just hit the reversed
checkbox<00:03:00.210> here<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:01.140> will<00:03:01.260> change<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
checkbox here and that will change the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.510 
checkbox here and that will change the
direction<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> axis<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.070> matches

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
direction of the a axis so it matches

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.600 
direction of the a axis so it matches
with<00:03:05.640> your<00:03:05.850> mechanics<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.710> see<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.190> a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
with your mechanics so you see now the a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.340 
with your mechanics so you see now the a
is<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:10.050> opposite<00:03:10.560> direction<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.100> X<00:03:12.350> so

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
is going opposite direction of the X so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.140 
is going opposite direction of the X so
the<00:03:13.440> very<00:03:13.620> last<00:03:13.650> thing<00:03:14.010> here<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.550> go<00:03:15.090> to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the very last thing here is to go to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.030 
the very last thing here is to go to

jog it back and forth

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.870 
jog it back and forth
everything<00:03:22.740> would<00:03:22.920> be<00:03:23.010> working<00:03:23.340> great<00:03:23.520> but

everything would be working great but

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.490 
everything would be working great but
then<00:03:24.000> when<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.209> go<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.360> home<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.959> might<00:03:25.350> go

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
then when you go to home it it might go

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.680 
then when you go to home it it might go
caddy<00:03:26.160> corner<00:03:26.430> because<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.360> trying<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
home the opposite direction of the X so

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.840 
home the opposite direction of the X so
to<00:03:32.250> change<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.990> use<00:03:34.730> configure<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
home negative check boxes so that they

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.250 
home negative check boxes so that they
both<00:03:38.250> move<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.790> same<00:03:39.000> way<00:03:39.080> one<00:03:40.080> other
