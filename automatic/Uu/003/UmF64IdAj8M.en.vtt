 I like it very much and I look forward to many 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.920
 comments 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.930
 to start let's take a brush 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.150
 inspired and a ham can be from a 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.540
 natural soap and we're going to wake up a 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.540
 little bit 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.370
 we take a little wet saxony and what 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.290
 we started to apply on the eyebrow 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.190
 combing it up so that it 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.190
 attach to the skin 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.040
 we removed we left a surplus and what 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.850
 we apply with the fingers on the 6 for 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.850
 give more grip 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.870
 ah 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.870
 to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.810
 we take a cotton and clean the excess 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 around the eyebrow 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.530
 we apply with a little bit so the clear 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.570
 giving small and smooth blows to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.570
 start covering all the leaves 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.200
 on powders we put the base with the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.200
 fingers giving small blows again 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.610
 after covering the eyebrows with a 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.830
 flat brush we base on all the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.830
 face to tone the tone of the skin 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.680
 taking into account that marinera de tees 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.380
 white we should use a weddings in clear and 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.980
 then to seal the base we apply 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.980
 powder 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.240
 with a brown pencil we started to give 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.500
 informed the eyebrows taking into account 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.500
 the marked points 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.700
 with an angular brush and a shadow of 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:01.590
 We seal the pencil and apply 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.560
 previously this will give an effect of 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.230
 naturalness to the eyebrow 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.480
 the idea of â€‹â€‹covering the eyebrows is to give them the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.080
 ideal height and shape ideal to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.080
 character 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.720
 we put the blush in a tanned tone 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.720
 just below the cheekbones 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.519
 We apply shadow across the eyelid 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.519
 a tone similar to the tone of the skin 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.170
 We take shadow around a bone and 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.170
 we apply below the eyebrow 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.400
 then with a shadow in clear coffee 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.230
 we mark the outline of the eye right in the 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.230
 eye socket on the outside 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.879
 this gives an effect of depth to the 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.879
 eye 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.669
 with a very thin brush 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.780
 and a black eyeliner can be in gel or 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.330
 it can be liquid we delineate exactly 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.710
 in the line of the eyelashes and in 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.580
 the outside part we raise a line 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.580
 towards the eyebrow 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.260
 in three spans the eyelashes very well 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.290
 for the verb to put the tabs 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.290
 Flanges on the outside of the eye 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.449
 We can use an epilator or we can 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.449
 put them with your fingers 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.790
 then we apply a lot of blink 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.790
 emphasizing on false eyelashes 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.889
 let's enlarge the lips a little 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.190
 so let's take a red pencil or 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.230
 a pencil more or less vinotinto and we are going to 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.480
 delineate the entire contour of the lips 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.190
 either in a very tight line and 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.190
 then we begin to fill them 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.759
 if you want you can mark more the contour 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:00.289
 of the lips and delineate a little more 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.289
 to make them look bigger 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.190
 we seal the pencil with a red lipstick 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.259
 to soften the lips and then 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.819
 we apply a lot of brightness to the idea 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.819
 that is also red 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.510
 an angular shadow and a brown brush 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.830
 let's give shade to the nose to 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.830
 profile a little more 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.540
 we apply around the contour of the 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.430
 nose and then we start to blur 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.120
 with your fingers with small bumps very 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.120
 soft 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.289
 with a fine tip house pencil we make 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.289
 a point to simulate the moon 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.040
 we apply illuminator to give more light 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:07.510
 to the face and highlight more the area of 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.510
 nose and the area of â€‹â€‹the cheekbones 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.360
 well this has been the tutorial of the day 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.030
 today I hope you liked it very much 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.020
 and I hope many many comments we 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.020
 we see in the next 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.220
 ah
