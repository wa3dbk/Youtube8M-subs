00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
in a in a vertical fashion which is not

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.250 
in a in a vertical fashion which is not
reptilian<00:05:17.070> like<00:05:17.660> no<00:05:18.660> it's<00:05:18.840> more<00:05:18.990> like<00:05:19.050> it's

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
reptilian like no it's more like it's

also<00:05:23.310> seen<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.700> though<00:05:23.850> surface<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.750> not

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
also seen it though surface and not

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.050 
also seen it though surface and not
hardly<00:05:25.680> even<00:05:25.889> leave<00:05:26.130> awake<00:05:26.460> as<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:27.150> swims<00:05:27.740> so

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
hardly even leave awake as it swims so

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.150 
hardly even leave awake as it swims so
again<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.330> know<00:05:30.450> could<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.720> be<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.840> large<00:05:31.830> sea

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
again you know could it be a large sea

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.379 
again you know could it be a large sea
turtle<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:32.639> just<00:05:32.820> happened<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.210> come

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
turtle that just happened to come

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.540 
turtle that just happened to come
slightly<00:05:34.050> inland<00:05:35.750> again<00:05:36.750> a<00:05:37.250> loggerhead<00:05:38.250> sea

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
slightly inland again a loggerhead sea

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.390 
slightly inland again a loggerhead sea
turtle<00:05:38.850> wouldn't<00:05:39.120> be<00:05:39.450> 25<00:05:39.930> foot<00:05:40.110> long<00:05:40.320> do<00:05:41.310> you

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
turtle wouldn't be 25 foot long do you

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.310 
turtle wouldn't be 25 foot long do you
think<00:05:41.490> it<00:05:41.850> could<00:05:41.880> be<00:05:42.389> descend<00:05:42.810> into<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.020> place

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
think it could be descend into the place

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.520 
think it could be descend into the place
yourself<00:05:44.300> be<00:05:45.300> an<00:05:45.419> exciting<00:05:45.750> thing<00:05:46.110> if<00:05:46.229> it<00:05:46.350> was

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
yourself be an exciting thing if it was

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.480 
yourself be an exciting thing if it was
it<00:05:46.860> would<00:05:46.979> be<00:05:48.380> what<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.410> scientific<00:05:49.979> discovery

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
it would be what a scientific discovery

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.240 
it would be what a scientific discovery
to<00:05:50.610> find<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:50.910> true<00:05:51.380> dinosaur<00:05:52.380> still<00:05:52.800> swimming

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
to find a true dinosaur still swimming

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.930 
to find a true dinosaur still swimming
around<00:05:53.520> right<00:05:54.360> here<00:05:54.390> in<00:05:54.660> Georgia<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.940> would

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
around right here in Georgia I would

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.260 
around right here in Georgia I would
like<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.150> think<00:05:57.419> it<00:05:57.660> could<00:05:57.930> be<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:59.490> maybe<00:06:00.030> in

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
like to think it could be and maybe in

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.400 
like to think it could be and maybe in
time<00:06:00.450> somebody<00:06:00.930> will<00:06:01.020> get<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.140> really<00:06:01.380> good

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
time somebody will get a really good

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.180 
time somebody will get a really good
look<00:06:01.530> at<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:01.979> yeah<00:06:02.370> with<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> camera<00:06:03.440> but<00:06:04.440> it's

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
look at it yeah with a camera but it's

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.800 
look at it yeah with a camera but it's
neat<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.460> think<00:06:05.760> we<00:06:05.850> could<00:06:05.970> ever<00:06:06.120> on<00:06:06.390> Loch<00:06:06.600> Ness

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
neat to think we could ever on Loch Ness

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.810 
neat to think we could ever on Loch Ness
monster<00:06:06.840> here<00:06:07.530> you<00:06:07.860> know<00:06:07.979> at<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.430> Altamaha
