00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.230
 Pub 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.950
 I'm going to have this is almost you can say 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.599
 the last of what we needed to buy 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.910
 so that we could put together what was our 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.180
 that neither piss and we already have that we already have 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.689
 this processor we already have ram memory 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.519
 we already have the video and room we have the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.140
 hard disk and well we have almost everything 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.269
 the only thing that we lacked was this 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.710
 what is the motherboard and we need 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.059

 can you see the unboxing I'm doing in 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.570
 the ground because the box is too much 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.269
 big then it does not give me a chance to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.549
 be able to make an egg boxing more 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.500
 appropriate since it have to put the 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.210
 camera a little farther and we're going to do 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.850
 everything possible that the audio work 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.920

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.810
 compatible as you will be able to read it here 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.900
 with what are the intel corp 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.750
 z68 chipset has to take this very in 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.880
 account when it comes to buying you is a 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.560
 motherboard and you have to take into account 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.570
 what is the processor model that you have 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.240

 board 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.640
 this is a zeta chipset that is 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.710
 compatible with the inter core i7 that I 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.850
