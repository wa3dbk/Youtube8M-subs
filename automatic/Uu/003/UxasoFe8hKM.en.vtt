lens set at f/2 with a Hoya HD circular
polarizing<00:00:17.660> filter<00:00:17.960> on<00:00:18.080> there<00:00:18.290> so<00:00:18.740> how<00:00:19.100> does

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
polarizing filter on there so how does

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.760 
polarizing filter on there so how does
it<00:00:19.310> look<00:00:19.610> now<00:00:19.880> this<00:00:20.600> jacket<00:00:21.170> is<00:00:21.320> often

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
it look now this jacket is often

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.220 
it look now this jacket is often
susceptible<00:00:22.430> to<00:00:22.460> more<00:00:22.940> a<00:00:22.970> on<00:00:23.360> any<00:00:23.690> kind<00:00:24.050> of

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
susceptible to more a on any kind of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.290 
susceptible to more a on any kind of
camera<00:00:24.830> because<00:00:25.490> of<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.760> really<00:00:26.090> tight

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
camera because of the really tight

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.210 
camera because of the really tight
detail<00:00:26.750> in<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.140> shoulder<00:00:27.560> pad<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:27.950> you<00:00:27.980> may<00:00:28.190> be

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
detail in the shoulder pad so you may be

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.160 
detail in the shoulder pad so you may be
seeing<00:00:28.610> that<00:00:28.790> there<00:00:29.030> we'll<00:00:29.270> find<00:00:29.540> out<00:00:29.750> anyway

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
seeing that there we'll find out anyway

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.990 
seeing that there we'll find out anyway
but<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.830> just<00:00:31.040> wanted<00:00:31.250> to<00:00:31.310> run<00:00:31.520> through<00:00:31.820> and

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
but I just wanted to run through and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.569 
but I just wanted to run through and
show<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.440> some<00:00:33.440> sample<00:00:34.010> footage<00:00:34.160> from<00:00:34.460> a

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
show you some sample footage from a

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.729 
show you some sample footage from a
bunch<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.940> different<00:00:34.999> lenses<00:00:35.660> handheld<00:00:36.469> and

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
bunch of different lenses handheld and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.489

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:39.499 
on tripod in FX and in DX mode so you

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:41.110 
on tripod in FX and in DX mode so you
can<00:00:39.679> get<00:00:39.800> an<00:00:39.920> idea<00:00:40.039> of<00:00:40.339> what<00:00:40.460> sort<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.789> quality

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
can get an idea of what sort of quality

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.819 
can get an idea of what sort of quality
it's<00:00:41.239> putting<00:00:41.480> out<00:00:41.659> there<00:00:41.899> let's<00:00:42.379> take<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.620> look

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
it's putting out there let's take a look

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.930 
it's putting out there let's take a look
okay<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.059> this<00:00:44.359> is<00:00:44.570> using<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.260> 14<00:00:45.859> to<00:00:46.010> 24<00:00:46.609> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
okay so this is using the 14 to 24 and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.270 
okay so this is using the 14 to 24 and
I'm<00:00:47.510> hand-holding<00:00:48.409> so<00:00:48.589> let's<00:00:48.800> just<00:00:49.069> do<00:00:49.249> a

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
I'm hand-holding so let's just do a

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.840 
I'm hand-holding so let's just do a
little<00:00:53.140> ok<00:00:54.140> now<00:00:54.350> changing<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:54.949> aperture<00:00:55.429> mid

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
little ok now changing the aperture mid

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.239 
little ok now changing the aperture mid
video<00:00:56.210> this<00:00:56.809> does<00:00:57.109> allow<00:00:57.499> it<00:00:57.769> unlike<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
video this does allow it unlike the

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.799 
video this does allow it unlike the
lower<00:00:58.429> model<00:00:58.850> cameras<00:01:01.239> so<00:01:02.239> there<00:01:02.420> we<00:01:02.539> are<00:01:02.569> at

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
lower model cameras so there we are at

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.060 
lower model cameras so there we are at
f/8<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.120> then<00:01:05.120> let's<00:01:05.420> just<00:01:05.689> refocus<00:01:06.409> down<00:01:06.860> on

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
f/8 and then let's just refocus down on

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.889 
f/8 and then let's just refocus down on
the<00:01:07.189> ground<00:01:09.219> okay<00:01:10.219> then<00:01:10.729> let's<00:01:11.000> focus<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.659> to

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
the ground okay then let's focus on to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.459 
the ground okay then let's focus on to
my<00:01:12.110> camera<00:01:12.530> here

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
my camera here

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.830 
my camera here
okay<00:01:15.469> now<00:01:15.649> f/8<00:01:16.100> let's<00:01:16.549> bring<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.180> back<00:01:17.210> down<00:01:17.539> to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
okay now f/8 let's bring it back down to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.429 
okay now f/8 let's bring it back down to
2.8<00:01:19.659> okay<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:20.930> see<00:01:21.140> how<00:01:21.289> that's

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
2.8 okay and you can see how that's

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.020 
2.8 okay and you can see how that's
working<00:01:21.710> even<00:01:22.009> on<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.310> wide-angle<00:01:22.549> that's

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
working even on the wide-angle that's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.350 
working even on the wide-angle that's
coming<00:01:23.360> right<00:01:23.570> nice<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:23.869> close<00:01:24.229> refocus<00:01:25.360> okay

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
coming right nice and close refocus okay

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.010 
coming right nice and close refocus okay
so<00:01:26.420> no<00:01:26.750> background<00:01:28.630> there's<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.810> background

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
so no background there's the background

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.660 
so no background there's the background
and<00:01:30.560> then<00:01:31.219> back<00:01:31.549> down<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.789> 2.8<00:01:33.340> next<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.460> let's

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and then back down to 2.8 next up let's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.480 
and then back down to 2.8 next up let's
have<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.969> look<00:01:35.270> filming<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:35.930> with<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.590> camera

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
have a look filming this with the camera

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.020 
have a look filming this with the camera
90<00:01:38.030> mil<00:01:38.270> macro<00:01:38.899> lens<00:01:39.280> okay<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.340> test<00:01:40.670> out<00:01:40.850> this

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
90 mil macro lens okay to test out this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.330 
90 mil macro lens okay to test out this
macro<00:01:41.509> let's<00:01:41.869> see<00:01:42.229> how<00:01:42.439> close<00:01:42.619> we<00:01:42.740> can<00:01:43.039> get<00:01:43.219> in

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
macro let's see how close we can get in

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.849 
macro let's see how close we can get in
on<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:43.700> Australian<00:01:44.090> 10<00:01:44.570> cent<00:01:44.840> piece<00:01:45.109> okay<00:01:45.799> so

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
on this Australian 10 cent piece okay so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.039 
on this Australian 10 cent piece okay so
that's<00:01:46.189> getting<00:01:46.369> close<00:01:46.969> but<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.450> think<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.899> can

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
that's getting close but I think we can

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.899 
that's getting close but I think we can
go<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.259> favor<00:01:48.590> closer<00:01:48.979> than<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.759> can

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
go a favor closer than that but you can

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.539 
go a favor closer than that but you can
already<00:01:50.030> see<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:51.619> image<00:01:51.920> quality<00:01:52.070> holds

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
already see the the image quality holds

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.550 
already see the the image quality holds
up<00:01:52.640> really<00:01:52.789> nicely<00:01:53.090> okay<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:53.869> there<00:01:54.259> we<00:01:54.289> are

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
up really nicely okay so there we are

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.999 
up really nicely okay so there we are
filming<00:01:54.920> Lizzy<00:01:55.490> at<00:01:55.789> F<00:01:56.409> 5.6<00:01:57.409> now<00:01:57.590> let's<00:01:57.799> just

bring<00:01:58.189> up<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.369> aperture<00:01:58.670> bit<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.179> we<00:01:59.299> make

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
bring up the aperture bit so we make

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.789 
bring up the aperture bit so we make
sure<00:01:59.479> we<00:01:59.630> get<00:01:59.810> at<00:01:59.960> least<00:01:59.990> all<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.469> front<00:02:00.679> of

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
sure we get at least all the front of

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.789 
sure we get at least all the front of
the<00:02:00.859> coin<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.310> focus<00:02:01.759> there<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:02.780> are<00:02:02.810> at<00:02:03.109> f10

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
the coin in focus there we are at f10

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.289 
the coin in focus there we are at f10
and<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:04.100> can<00:02:04.219> see<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.490> background<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:05.090> going

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299

little bit of action in each direction
as<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.570> said<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.930> camera<00:04:25.350> just<00:04:25.560> pick<00:04:25.919> up<00:04:26.070> that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
as I said the camera just pick up that

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.550 
as I said the camera just pick up that
this<00:04:26.430> was<00:04:26.700> DX<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.450> went<00:04:27.600> for<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.870> now<00:04:28.350> let's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
this was DX and went for it now let's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.730 
this was DX and went for it now let's
zoom<00:04:28.620> in<00:04:28.950> right<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.310> 270<00:04:30.000> refocus<00:04:30.810> on<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.410> tree

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
zoom in right to 270 refocus on the tree

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.500 
zoom in right to 270 refocus on the tree
and<00:04:32.010> then<00:04:32.520> we'll<00:04:32.639> get<00:04:32.790> this<00:04:32.970> woman<00:04:33.330> as<00:04:33.479> she

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
and then we'll get this woman as she

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:43.040 
and then we'll get this woman as she
walks<00:04:33.900> past<00:04:39.380> okay<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.440> not<00:04:41.220> too<00:04:41.430> jittery<00:04:41.700> I<00:04:42.120> can

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
walks past okay so not too jittery I can

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.500 
walks past okay so not too jittery I can
see<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.620> VR<00:04:43.950> is<00:04:44.220> definitely<00:04:44.820> working

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
see that the VR is definitely working

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.700 
see that the VR is definitely working
sorry<00:04:46.440> BC<00:04:46.919> as<00:04:47.070> they<00:04:47.280> call<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:48.440> big<00:04:49.440> test

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
sorry BC as they call it a big test

sorry BC as they call it a big test
however<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.400> always<00:04:50.850> how<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.389> is<00:04:51.510> when<00:04:51.810> you're

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
however is always how it is when you're

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.260 
however is always how it is when you're
walking<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:53.100> see<00:04:53.310> how<00:04:53.520> much<00:04:53.669> movement<00:04:54.180> you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
walking to see how much movement you

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.980 
walking to see how much movement you
introduce<00:04:54.690> so<00:04:54.840> let's<00:04:55.050> have<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.260> look<00:04:56.600> I'm<00:04:57.600> just

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
introduce so let's have a look I'm just

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.690 
introduce so let's have a look I'm just
filming<00:04:58.200> my<00:04:58.440> shadow<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:59.070> know<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.430> am

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
filming my shadow so you know that I am

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.219 
filming my shadow so you know that I am
actually<00:05:00.180> walking<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:00.780> not<00:05:00.900> doing<00:05:01.110> something

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
actually walking and not doing something

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.080 
actually walking and not doing something
dodgy<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:04.770> don't<00:05:05.010> think<00:05:05.190> that's<00:05:05.370> too<00:05:05.580> bad<00:05:05.820> to

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
dodgy so I don't think that's too bad to

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.980 
dodgy so I don't think that's too bad to
be<00:05:06.210> honest<00:05:10.460> I'm<00:05:11.460> not<00:05:11.520> using<00:05:12.060> any<00:05:12.210> kind<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.690> rig

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
be honest I'm not using any kind of rig

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.080 
be honest I'm not using any kind of rig
to<00:05:13.350> support<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.010> or<00:05:14.100> anything<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.640> that<00:05:14.669> I

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
to support it or anything like that I

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.690 
to support it or anything like that I
think<00:05:16.020> it<00:05:16.200> looks<00:05:16.350> pretty<00:05:16.500> good<00:05:16.830> at<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.490> time

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
think it looks pretty good at the time

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.320 
think it looks pretty good at the time
that<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.300> why<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.260> use<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.740> DX<00:05:20.250> lens<00:05:20.550> on<00:05:20.789> a<00:05:20.820> super

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
that a why you use a DX lens on a super

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.600 
that a why you use a DX lens on a super
high<00:05:21.479> res<00:05:21.720> body<00:05:22.020> like<00:05:22.289> this<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.710> for<00:05:23.400> wide

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
high res body like this is for wide

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.210 
high res body like this is for wide
angles<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.300> can<00:05:24.419> see<00:05:24.660> that<00:05:24.840> 10<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.200> 24<00:05:25.710> is

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
angles you can see that 10 to 24 is

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.940 
angles you can see that 10 to 24 is
super<00:05:26.789> small<00:05:27.120> light<00:05:27.450> and<00:05:27.690> compact<00:05:28.110> compared

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
super small light and compact compared

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.480 
super small light and compact compared
it<00:05:29.039> to<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.490> 14<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.120> 24<00:05:30.690> from<00:05:31.350> Nikon<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.130> you

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
it to the 14 to 24 from Nikon and you

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.070 
it to the 14 to 24 from Nikon and you
can<00:05:32.640> see<00:05:32.820> it's<00:05:33.030> just<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.300> whole<00:05:33.479> different<00:05:33.870> ball

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
can see it's just a whole different ball

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.950 
can see it's just a whole different ball
