00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 good day dear motorists 

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.120
 today i want to show you how 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.330
 connect cigarette lighter recorder 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.540
 car so that the wires do not stick out 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.509
 in the middle of the car and did not have to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.590
 disassemble the skin and generally in principle 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.170
 and leaves in your car stuffing 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.930
 first of all I want to show where 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.480
 right and how best it will be to strengthen 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.150
 Registrar windshield 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.579
 principle always registrar necessary 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.680
 strengthen behind the rearview mirror 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.420
 that is, here in this area if you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 left-handed car and, accordingly, if 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.040
 the prophet is in that area that is a mirror 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.750
 turned a little bit your side so 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.420
 there is enough space for court 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.890
 install the dvr draw your 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 note that if you have 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.820
 the sun strip of the car is necessary 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.579
 to fix 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.550
 the recorder or the sun protective 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.070
 strip or under it also if your 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.619
 car there are such bumps 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 if not not inside glass glass 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.820
 is outside then on them sucker 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.229
 also will not be attached because under 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.080
 they will still fall on the canvas and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.620
 Sooner or later 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.430
 fasteners will disappear if in principle no longer 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.560
 where to mount 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.370
 that is, here are some of these attempts 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.010
 machines occupy vast areas here 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.950
 you can go out in such a way that take 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.720
 thick transparent scotch and made just 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.970
 box that was flat smooth 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.030
 the surface and then it is already sticky 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.130
 will be perfectly attached to mount 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.380
 the recorder needs to be well warmed up 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.840
 clean glass pay attention if 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.610
 you do this winter especially on such 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.240
 machines like ford focus that have 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.920
 heated windshield 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.180
 must first be heated at least 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.120
 10-15 minutes 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 This glass before any suction cup 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.520
 now about how to conduct 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.460
 right really wanna draw your 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 attention to one thing very much 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.210
 motorists are trying to power 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.700
 car here is a cover that goes 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.600
 bundled all DVRs to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.350
 the ceiling lighting by the authors but 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.810
 recorders are basically only 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.480
 almost there probably 95 percent 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.190
 powered by 5 volts so here in this 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.140
 cigarette lighter and which are bundled in 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.720
 all recorders is converter 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.120
 that is, there are chips 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.790
 converting 12 by 5 volts these 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.410
 microcircuits are not heated in principle 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.080
 especially on modern recorders 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.000
 beta use 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.560
 increased goes and from calling in the ceiling here 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.960
 these here is a converter 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.290
 really a very dangerous thing especially 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.840
 this is the general attention of those multivan which 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.790
 also dismantled to reduce the size 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.310
 just said a cigarette lighter here just 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.990
 spit in principle who did the hidden 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.940
 wiring there somewhere in the car hides 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.190
 about the payment to the cigarette lighter is also very 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.120
 much light to do it even if you 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.670
 the recorder cost very good money then 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.450
 it does not guarantee at all that this 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.460
 here the cigarette lighter is not made anywhere 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.560
 on the stern of cheap Chinese factories ie 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.660
 they are purchased components 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.610
 can be purchased anywhere and not a fact 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.710
 what is it they do n't do for the cigarette lighter 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.540
 and the quality of such a cry flew away nobody you 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.760
 guarantee will not be at best 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.000
 there will blow the fuse in the worst place 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.790
 will close and you have somewhere fun 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.200
 background wiring is all hidden from 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.280
 instantly especially if it's on the go 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.230
 take it all down and take it apart 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 can't just not physically physically 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.290
 have time and maybe the car can 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.660
 ignite in this case such things are not 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.250
 Casco nothing at all that is 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.830
 problems with the electrician is your own 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.810
 problems of this company that you will 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.520
 set with the lady's face so on she 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.830
 also here for these things on responsibility 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.540
 carries that is for wiring she will say yes 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.310
 we have wiring everything burned you 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.370
 chip 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.260
 so I really do not recommend it here. 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.920
 do the more hours tell you how 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.260
 easily and simply connects to the network 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.360
 the cigarette lighter of the car so that it's 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.890
 right now the registrar 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.750
 there are no products connected here 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.739
 let's start with what's worth 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.750
 DVR in this area in 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.910
 principle necessarily sweet pushing 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.500
 little by the way here is the classic 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.870
 registrar option in principle he is all 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:34.200
 equal will take up less space further 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.760
 we leave we leave immediately wire up under 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.760
 roof trim for all men 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.180
 you for there at the cheapest there 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.919
 Mercedes finish all here here 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.850
 so let's say there are niches 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:54.000
 where you can push the wire further here in 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.500
 this place has two options like 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.560
 hold the wire down 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.530
 used to always lead the wire here are the numbers 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.810
 through this, too, there are niches but different 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.669
 of course there are different machines for some 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.800
 it's very tight here so the wire is not 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.660
 prolazit especially if the wire itself 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.030
 fat 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.520
 then I had to shoot here paneling 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.740
 that is, shoot pro hold down 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.610
 far conduct either here but here he 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.020
 almost all the machines have no slots 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.570
 it comes that the wire is already on top 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.910
 any further here on the lantern down well then 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:32.039
 wire all solve the dashboard 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.560
 Now I advise you to do this 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.950
 we are bringing this part so far 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.070
 pad it all 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.380
 from the roof there is a gap in any car we 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.580
 through it we push through the wire and enter 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.740
 under this gum here also gum 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.170
 but of course of all the cars are also here 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:58.010
 There is a niche where the wire is perfectly prolazit 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:06:01.440
 and lead down down and further behind the door 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.440
 We see the glove box here in this place 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.670
 the place the wire goes out to me it goes to 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.770
 tee 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:12.810
 in the glove compartment to learn to tee glove compartment 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.510
 but in principle the right can also be started up 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:20.850
 immediately home before the cigarette lighter well or 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.300
 can also do through the cigarette lighter 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.910
 just kensu on some machines here st 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.390
 from 100 side there are niches where you can 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.400
 quietly lay a wire many no 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.800
 there will have lived only in this place 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.450
 wield scotch so the wire is not 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.100
 hung out 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.780
 how many here did not come across the car here 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.590
 the distance is small in principle anywhere 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.380
 it does not interfere 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.140
 Also, in principle, you can not miss 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.390
 wire through the glove compartment can do it 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.210
 below but here again it depends on the machines 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.800
 and you will have to take some 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.050
 cable ties so that the wire does not dare 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.110
 down or have some cars here 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:02.060
 niche when you want blood 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.030
 Finally I would like to tell you about 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.160
 where better to mount the DVR 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.660
 in general, I highly recommend 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.330
 DVR buy as high as possible 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.850
 on the ceiling the car is due to the fact that 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.640
 the higher we stand the DVR order 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.980
 more we have the ability to send 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.310
 DVR so he looked down 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.830
 let them fall to the hood or panel at 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.860
 car is it really nothing scary angle 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.480
 review is enough to look ahead but 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.360
 The problem is that when we are a registrar 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.410
 set down that is, the lower we have it 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.150
 so we have to put it that strongly 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.780
 there is a tilt to serve as much as possible 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:44.720
 straighter and we have a marketing lens 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.970
 a lot of sunshine and sunny 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.240
 light gives the picture in the first bl 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.700
 put in the second picture becomes so 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.080
 let's say dark ie amines works 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.820
 much worse read 

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.930
 days in principle objects will be more 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:03.130
 vague, well, actually all the luck 

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.130
 goodbye
