 his package you must also choose 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.079
 your operator there are three types 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.090
 different 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.369
 first of all we put the so-called operators 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.880
 classic orange sfr bouygues telecom 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.040
 and free 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.869
 the big advantage and they have 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.270
 shops are much more accessible 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.579
 and have more customer service 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.259
 deepened the disadvantage and that they 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.890
 are more expensive than other types 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.320
 operators 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.170
 then we have local operators those 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.850
 so-called conventional operators 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.220
 sosh for orange alarm clock sfr and well 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.070

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.350
 that they are usually there without commitment 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.270
 cheaper than so-called operators 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.130
 classics is against they are 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.350
 accessible only on the internet 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.330
 to finish there are also the mv 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.610
 rings that offers very low prices 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.860
 suitable for small consumption but it 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.480
 must really avoid going over 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.180
