out<00:00:56.270> there<00:00:56.570> have<00:00:56.900> an<00:00:57.410> igniter<00:00:58.059> system<00:00:59.059> it<00:00:59.390> will

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
out there have an igniter system it will

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.660 
out there have an igniter system it will
light<00:00:59.840> okay<00:01:00.590> I'm<00:01:00.710> now<00:01:00.860> just<00:01:01.070> turned<00:01:01.340> on<00:01:01.520> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
the oven and you look inside there and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.330 
the oven and you look inside there and
what<00:01:11.030> will<00:01:11.180> happen<00:01:11.660> is<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:12.110> oven<00:01:12.860> igniter

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
what will happen is that oven igniter

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.330 
what will happen is that oven igniter
will<00:01:13.790> start<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.300> glow<00:01:14.540> if<00:01:15.080> that<00:01:15.650> ignite<00:01:16.009> oven

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
will start to glow if that ignite oven

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.240 
will start to glow if that ignite oven
igniter<00:01:16.700> starts<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.300> glow<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:18.560> know<00:01:18.830> that

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
igniter starts to glow you know that

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.730 
igniter starts to glow you know that
that's<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.670> problem<00:01:19.940> what<00:01:20.780> happens<00:01:21.229> is<00:01:21.440> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
that's the problem what happens is the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.300 
that's the problem what happens is the
oven<00:01:22.100> igniter<00:01:22.729> has<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.210> draw<00:01:23.420> enough<00:01:24.310> okay

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
oven igniter has to draw enough okay

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.469 
oven igniter has to draw enough okay
let's<00:01:25.580> see<00:01:25.820> here<00:01:25.850> I'm<00:01:26.119> going<00:01:26.300> to<00:01:26.390> actually

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
let's see here I'm going to actually

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.020 
let's see here I'm going to actually
show<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.950> oven<00:01:28.190> igniter<00:01:28.490> has<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.820> draw

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
show you the oven igniter has to draw

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.359 
show you the oven igniter has to draw
enough<00:01:29.270> amperage<00:01:29.690> just<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.560> trip<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.979> safety

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
enough amperage just to trip the safety

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.510 
enough amperage just to trip the safety
switch<00:01:31.490> there<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.270> okay<00:01:33.170> I'm<00:01:33.740> now<00:01:34.070> that's

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
switch there it is okay I'm now that's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.240 
switch there it is okay I'm now that's
now<00:01:34.820> telling<00:01:35.390> me<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.170> oven<00:01:36.649> igniter<00:01:37.040> is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
now telling me that that oven igniter is

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.640 
now telling me that that oven igniter is
bad<00:01:37.490> because<00:01:37.820> if<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.119> igniter<00:01:38.570> was<00:01:38.840> good<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
bad because if that igniter was good the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.740 
bad because if that igniter was good the
oven<00:01:39.950> would<00:01:40.190> come<00:01:40.460> on<00:01:40.670> he<00:01:40.940> might<00:01:41.180> take<00:01:41.360> up<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.720> a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
oven would come on he might take up to a

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.570 
oven would come on he might take up to a
minute<00:01:42.040> but<00:01:43.040> it's<00:01:43.250> not<00:01:43.549> coming<00:01:43.760> on<00:01:44.320> okay

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
minute but it's not coming on okay

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.090 
minute but it's not coming on okay
so<00:01:47.270> there's<00:01:47.690> about<00:01:47.930> five<00:01:48.200> different<00:01:48.470> ignition

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
so there's about five different ignition

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.430 
so there's about five different ignition
systems<00:01:49.580> with<00:01:49.790> an<00:01:49.970> oven<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.660> then<00:01:50.900> now<00:01:51.380> we

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
systems with an oven and then now we

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.010 
systems with an oven and then now we
know<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.130> ovens<00:01:52.430> igniters<00:01:53.240> bad<00:01:53.510> we're<00:01:53.870> going

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
know the ovens igniters bad we're going

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.530 
know the ovens igniters bad we're going

and<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:32.820> I'm<00:02:32.940> stripping<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.510> wires<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.140> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
and then I'm stripping the wires to to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.120 
and then I'm stripping the wires to to
the<00:02:34.590> igniter<00:02:34.920> now<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.480> all<00:02:37.320> I'm<00:02:37.560> going<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.920> do

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
the igniter now so all I'm going to do

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.090 
the igniter now so all I'm going to do
is<00:02:38.550> I'm<00:02:38.940> going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.350> put<00:02:40.350> when<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.650> put<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
is I'm going to put when I put in the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.240 
is I'm going to put when I put in the
new<00:02:41.370> igniter<00:02:42.320> I'm<00:02:43.320> going<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> cut<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.040> wires

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
new igniter I'm going to cut the wires

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.920 
new igniter I'm going to cut the wires
back<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.940> new<00:02:45.090> igniter<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> little

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
back on the new igniter there a little

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.300 
back on the new igniter there a little
bit<00:02:46.110> too<00:02:46.320> long<00:02:46.530> they<00:02:46.800> don't<00:02:46.980> need<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.250> be

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
bit too long they don't need to be

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.220 
bit too long they don't need to be
trimmed<00:02:47.640> but<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.060> go<00:02:48.330> ahead<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.690> trim<00:02:49.020> down

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
trimmed but I go ahead and I trim down

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.600 
trimmed but I go ahead and I trim down
and<00:02:50.720> what<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.080> with<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> wire<00:02:52.980> nut<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.580> I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and what I do is with the wire nut is I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.220 
and what I do is with the wire nut is I
attach<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:56.160> new<00:02:56.400> igniter<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.720> old<00:02:57.870> wires

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
attach the new igniter to the old wires

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.990 
attach the new igniter to the old wires
and<00:03:00.350> you're<00:03:01.350> basically<00:03:01.770> ready<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.310> go

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.240 

okay<00:03:07.780> here's<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.170> new<00:03:08.410> igniter<00:03:08.680> I'm<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.190> to

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
okay here's the new igniter I'm going to

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.490 
okay here's the new igniter I'm going to
show<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:11.230> see<00:03:11.410> I'm

wires I'm going to strip it to expose
the<00:03:29.640> actual<00:03:30.640> metal<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.330> wire<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.150> then<00:03:34.330> I

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
the actual metal to the wire so then I

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.340 
the actual metal to the wire so then I
can<00:03:34.660> wire<00:03:34.900> nut<00:03:35.200> real<00:03:35.500> nice<00:03:36.810> I'm<00:03:37.810> going<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.020> redo

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
can wire nut real nice I'm going to redo

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.660 
can wire nut real nice I'm going to redo
that<00:03:38.530> one<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:40.050> okay

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.630 
time okay so i'm going to be shutting
this<00:04:07.780> igniter<00:04:08.170> i<00:04:08.290> know<00:04:08.410> now<00:04:08.800> oh<00:04:09.040> no<00:04:09.340> what<00:04:09.519> I'm

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
this igniter i know now oh no what I'm

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.670 
this igniter i know now oh no what I'm
doing<00:04:09.940> now<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.540> put<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.900> new<00:04:11.050> igniter<00:04:11.350> in

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
doing now is I put the new igniter in

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.190 
doing now is I put the new igniter in
and<00:04:11.980> I'm<00:04:12.489> actually<00:04:12.790> testing<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.840> igniter

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
and I'm actually testing the igniter

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.680 
and I'm actually testing the igniter
okay<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:15.190> you<00:04:15.370> have<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:15.610> minute<00:04:15.970> for<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.450> thing
