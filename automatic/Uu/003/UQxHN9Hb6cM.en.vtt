season glitter and sequins is really

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.179 
season glitter and sequins is really
and<00:06:38.569> right<00:06:38.840> now<00:06:39.020> so<00:06:39.349> I<00:06:39.379> figured<00:06:39.830> I'd<00:06:39.949> get<00:06:40.129> a

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
and right now so I figured I'd get a

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.170 
and right now so I figured I'd get a
pair<00:06:40.520> of<00:06:40.550> these<00:06:40.669> and<00:06:41.330> again<00:06:41.599> the<00:06:41.749> inside<00:06:42.199> of<00:06:42.319> it

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
pair of these and again the inside of it

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.070 
pair of these and again the inside of it
has<00:06:44.180> a<00:06:44.210> different<00:06:44.840> design<00:06:45.139> as<00:06:45.319> well<00:06:46.689> so<00:06:47.689> i

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
has a different design as well so i

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.809 
has a different design as well so i
think<00:06:48.379> the<00:06:48.499> canvas<00:06:48.949> ones<00:06:49.159> are<00:06:49.400> a<00:06:49.430> bit<00:06:49.580> cheap

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:49.819 
think the canvas ones are a bit cheap

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.769 
think the canvas ones are a bit cheap
