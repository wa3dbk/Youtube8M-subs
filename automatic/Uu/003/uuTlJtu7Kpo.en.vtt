00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.110
 Baltasar Monaco Trujillano dedicated 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.740
 from very young to music is the 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.670
 creator of the smallest violin in the world 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.680
 it measures only three inches but still 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.349
 this cyto violin sounds up to the 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.500
 state youth symphony orchestra 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.500
 trujillo 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.320
 the idea of â€‹â€‹the smallest violin in the world 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.750
 born when my father was born in Monaco 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.450
 buy several instruments among them 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.180
 a violin and I liked the way 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.790
 of the instrument from a very young age 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.910
 he fell in love with the violins and when he had 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.430
 the 16 years old he had already created this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.210
 Miniature instrument took me three 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 weeks build it I remember I did the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.239
 box then attaches the handle to the box 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 of resonance I made the accessories like 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.220
 the coral strip the peg the bridge and the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 soul is the only violin in the world that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.259
 being so small it sounds like one of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.910
 regular size that currently and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.500
 another violin is small and it 's more 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.900
 small but they are made for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 adorn nothing bad and that is that this violin 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.910
 cited you do not have to envy anything to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 these others have each part in place 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.890
 This was made to scale the ropes 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.009
 They are made with wires from a 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.550
 old phone and they are as thin as a 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550
 human hair 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.710
 with materials came to see maple and ebony 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.110
 all the people who see this 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.540
 instrument they think is toy 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.700
 but when they hear it they are 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.770
 totally surprised is something magical 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.109
 with what will happen 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 can do with this violin up 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.530
 including adapting to a concert with 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.659
 the orchestra is formed until the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 Orchestral colleagues stay 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.569
 admired to see this ingenious violin 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.030
 they do it and how to call it not only was it a 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.629
 wonder are a pot in your moments 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.849
 free 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.549
 baltasar is dedicated to work as 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.099
 taxi driver to get enough 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:26.040
 income meant to sustain their 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.680
 family since salaries as musicians 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.650
 to a little low currently baltasar 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.549
 makes another violin a challenge 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.220
 that will break your record much smaller 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.940
 than the current one and that will have the same 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.430
 sonority and has all the same 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.709
 conditions of like a normal violin 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.689
 and this instrument is going to sound this 2 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.959
 inches another aspect 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.510
 main will be the technique to use 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.909
 the technique is that I grab 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.689
 this instrument and I stick it 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.319
 to the body so that everything is reduced to 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.319
 a proportion 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.480
 Our production team had the 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.710
 opportunity to attend one of the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.130
 rehearsals with the symphony orchestra 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.770
 youthful and there we could enjoy the 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.380
 interpretation of the concert in the minor 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.500
 by antonio vivaldi for violin and 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.930
 orchestra the population of trujillo in the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.910
 trujillo state in venezuela today 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.910
