00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 very good reviews and animals 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.520
 helpless 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.349
 to show you the truth they were there 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.020
 with jake now I was going to comment on some 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 little thing of these images that as you know 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 I'm bringing pictures of Jason 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.390
 possible future generations this already 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.310
 I say it's a fake 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.500
 that's what a person has done because he has 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.119
 dear but the truth that they are very 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.189
 pretty and let's start with the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 first you can deduce that they are the three 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.460
 legendary birds as it could be the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.410
 article ambrosino the three 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 personally the photos of your lung to 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 I really like jumping 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.079
 I would have the water pets got into 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.469
 a cage 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.559
 everything is very much alive that is called youtube 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.559
 and that all dogs 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:18.590
 the description because I have seen many 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:18.590
 videos where it is abandoned show more 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:29.209
 what seems 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.259
 has a little story and that's the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.750
 evolution of both resisting from king of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.060
 King and rock kings and king 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.010
 of the four and according to the area in the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.440
 that the pokemon is at 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.100
 evolve would evolve into one of the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.100
 four ways 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.080
 I already say what a person does 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.850
 only to a person who 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.320
 because what I like most with 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.600
 difference is the favorite but it's that 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.630
 this little guy the kid is cool 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.190
 heap yes good it would be the little 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.960
 in front or if the tender jake 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.640
 evolves this evolution to both 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.780
 it depends when it evolves it acquires the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.720
 color of one or the other 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.090
 then there would be very good as not 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.380
 specifies very well how they would evolve 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.380
 but there it is 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.440
 if it does not catch my attention 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.610
 personally the dose is very simple 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:50.410
 I like it for nothing 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:53.260
 I like them and then the tour here is 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.350
 precious using it up here the one from the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.840
 tiny spirit of acció 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.520
 and angel and this one also has his little 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.810
 history and that is the revolution 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.270
 as Alberto said of the three poems 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.040
 and it can evolve all three depending 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.930
 of its characteristics if it has maximum 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.730
 evolve speed and I street if 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.510
 had maximum defense the huc yes and 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.510
 maximum attack 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.010
 interesting to me it seems interesting and 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.390
 let's continue as I say you have the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.130
 links in the description in case those that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.440
 you see more is easy boards 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:33.690
 everyone has their funny things to know 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.640
 about the pokemon it was not mentioned that 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.990
 if you want classes and if you want to have a 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.820
 limit and that has to come out of the egg 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.190
 because if it does not it does not go with you and they say 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.190
 funny things if the imagination 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.730
 tran latina and would grow not 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.890
 gelatin is cool to think that that then 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.660
 transforms in that rajoy follows the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:09.420
 glans ugly yes yes yes maybe that way 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:13.260
 part then here you have training to do 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.260
 but nothing 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:24.390
 the victims do not look alike but I 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.390
 I like it a lot I do not know why I like it 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.660
 I love it is very nice too but 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.990
 as I say the little one of the safe aunt 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.470
 This yes that will rule if it is also very 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.490
 pretty also then that of fiber 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.390
 I do not like 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.720
 I do not know I do not like you personally 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.720
 opinions 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.740
 your opinion 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.480
 and then liu yuqi that will have a small 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.300
 history also because as you know 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.640
 nobody took actions that would be the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.230
 small mana but now it's here not 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.840
 you know very well if in the small 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.300
 direction is the demana fish would be 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.190
 the pre-volution of manabí and in illicit 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.930
 fix and evolve and love it though 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.620
 you know what actions do not evolve 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.250
 bad faith 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.440
 but the truth is short but like 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.440
 nice is it is short but hyper intense 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.520
 that is loans he left data 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.710
 very pretty 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.610
 well i want i would like to know 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.820
 your opinion and talca 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.040
 good the law and we have been commenting os 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.050
 I will bring more things of this law with 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.510
 possible generations since you already know or 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.130
 possible pokemon that you never know if 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.450
 they are going to do nothing is this generation 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.969
 I think so because with the money that 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.879
 win 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:22.779
 and nothing guys we're saying goodbye 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:25.319
 jake and I hope you like an advance 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.319
 until next time
