00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
really simple you just use ten cups of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.920 
really simple you just use ten cups of
water<00:01:52.380> per<00:01:52.770> pound<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> dry<00:01:53.759> beans

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
water per pound of the dry beans

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.150 
water per pound of the dry beans
you're<00:01:55.230> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.440> put<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> into<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.920> large

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
you're going to put it into a large

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.450 
you're going to put it into a large
stockpot<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.210> bring<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> boil<00:01:58.410> for<00:01:59.130> two

stockpot and bring it to a boil for two
minutes<00:01:59.760> and<00:01:59.940> then<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.540> them<00:02:00.780> rest<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.530> one

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
minutes and then have them rest for one

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.990 
minutes and then have them rest for one
hour

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
hour

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.850 
hour
covered<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:04.110> after<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.800> gonna

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
covered then after that you're gonna

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.560 
covered then after that you're gonna
rinse<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.370> beans<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.880> you're<00:02:06.090> ready<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.330> use

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
rinse the beans and you're ready to use

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.170 
rinse the beans and you're ready to use
them<00:02:06.740> then<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.220> prepare<00:02:08.729> your<00:02:08.790> rice

according<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> package<00:02:10.590> directions<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.420> I

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
according to the package directions so I

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.120 
according to the package directions so I
think<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.960> key<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.440> making<00:02:13.620> these<00:02:13.860> taste

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
think the key to making these taste

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.730 
think the key to making these taste
extra<00:02:14.580> tasty<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.240> chopping<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:15.900> two<00:02:16.170> onions<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
extra tasty is chopping up two onions to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.800 
extra tasty is chopping up two onions to
add<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> burritos<00:02:17.580> as<00:02:17.820> well<00:02:18.210> as<00:02:18.450> putting

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
some Tabasco sauce on your right so when

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.010 
some Tabasco sauce on your right so when
everything<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.060> all<00:02:24.270> laid<00:02:24.510> out<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.750> looks<00:02:24.930> like

tortillas and you needs if up bags for
storing<00:02:32.310> them<00:02:32.459> as<00:02:32.610> well<00:02:32.850> as<00:02:33.060> aluminum<00:02:33.630> foil<00:02:33.930> so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
storing them as well as aluminum foil so

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.690 
storing them as well as aluminum foil so
the<00:02:34.590> process<00:02:34.980> for<00:02:35.010> putting<00:02:35.370> these<00:02:35.459> together

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the process for putting these together

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.610 
the process for putting these together
is<00:02:36.000> simple<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.870> take<00:02:37.050> squares<00:02:37.440> of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
is simple you just take squares of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.560 
is simple you just take squares of
aluminum<00:02:38.040> foil<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.550> set<00:02:38.880> your<00:02:39.060> tortilla<00:02:39.480> on

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
aluminum foil and set your tortilla on

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.150 
aluminum foil and set your tortilla on
it<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.200> you're<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.950> add

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it and then you're just going to add

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
it and then you're just going to add
your<00:02:41.520> ingredients<00:02:41.700> first<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.690> add<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> beans

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
your ingredients first we add the beans

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.910 
your ingredients first we add the beans
and<00:02:43.620> then<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.370> add<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.520> little<00:02:44.820> bit<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> christ'

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
and then we add a little bit of christ'

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.530 
and then we add a little bit of christ'
followed<00:02:46.920> by<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.160> onion<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> then<00:02:48.360> you're

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
followed by the onion and then you're

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.660 
followed by the onion and then you're
going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> put<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.110> cheese<00:02:49.380> on<00:02:49.620> top<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
going to put the cheese on top now the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.550 
going to put the cheese on top now the
key<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.180> making<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.990> make<00:02:52.200> sure<00:02:52.410> that

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
key to making this is to make sure that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.590 
key to making this is to make sure that
you<00:02:52.709> don't<00:02:52.980> over<00:02:53.220> stuff<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.330> then<00:02:54.480> if

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
you don't over stuff it because then if

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.240 
you don't over stuff it because then if
you<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.930> they're<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.260> not<00:02:55.650> as<00:02:55.830> good<00:02:55.860> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you do they're really not as good and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.920 
you do they're really not as good and
you<00:02:56.310> cut<00:02:56.459> stuff<00:02:56.700> busting<00:02:57.150> out<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> sides<00:02:57.600> and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
you cut stuff busting out the sides and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.930 
you cut stuff busting out the sides and
they're<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.860> hard<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.100> hold<00:02:59.310> but

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
they're really hard to hold but

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.460 
they're really hard to hold but
Charlie's<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> master<00:03:00.930> folder<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.380> he

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
Charlie's like a master folder if he

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.500 
Charlie's like a master folder if he
just<00:03:01.650> takes<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> sides<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.430> curves<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.209> around

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
just takes the sides up curves it around

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.509 
just takes the sides up curves it around
gives<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.080> little<00:03:04.290> tuck<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.800> then<00:03:05.370> he's

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
gives it a little tuck and then he's

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.990 
gives it a little tuck and then he's
just<00:03:05.580> going<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.090> take<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.780> aluminum<00:03:07.290> foil<00:03:08.000> and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
just going to take the aluminum foil and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.330 
just going to take the aluminum foil and
it's<00:03:09.209> ready<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.510> labeling<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:11.130> when

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it's ready for labeling so when

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.890 
it's ready for labeling so when
everything<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.880> all<00:03:12.090> said<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.360> done<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.720> looks

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
everything is all said and done it looks
