00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.870
 Tess company brings to your attention 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.530
 TEC-2 formwork 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.450
 for construction on technology tise 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 wall 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.820
 external or internal carry external 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.100
 internal bearing walls that she herself 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.990
 represents this external 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.859
 and the stick so cause stopped at 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:42.899
 formwork system of metal rods 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:48.020
 for fixing 2 anzhi beaters 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.710
 scraper kit 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.399
 push pad 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.500
 extractor that is for the device 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:00.809
 devices for pulling something 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.039
 educational and compensator like 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.910
 the manufacturing process itself takes place 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.479
 more 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.470
 let's say this table is 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:19.280
 surface of the foundation well or 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:24.200
 continuation of the wall formwork 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.619
 set on the foundation they 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.619
 emptiness are established 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.110
 which is fixed by the bottom 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.700
 respectively 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.700
 bottom rods and fixed by one 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.120
 rods here in this position somewhere 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:56.060
 position and stick ready for 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:59.090
 manufacturing unit block size length 51 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.530
 centimeter width 25 centimeters this 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.850
 screen size one brick 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:15.320
 you can even brick and height 15 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:19.930
 centimeters if you look times that is 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.930
 we have a brick 25 centimeters long 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.340
 width 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.810
 the solution is mixed hard and 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.930
 actually there is 14 m 1 3 with a little 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.110
 the amount of water is rammed in this 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.050
 formwork 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:53.239
 as the rules of care, the visits are then taken 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:56.709
 back block is removed once again on 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.709
 the same side to stock up 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.260
 pulled out a zonal system of rods 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.550
 but these rods are also pulling them out 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.070
 I will not pull out here and removed 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:21.210
 void former because 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.420
 ramming is being created strenuously external 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.920
 formwork and on the vaster 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.530
 for this is made from device extractor 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:37.400
 someone who is an educator to pull out 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.400
 shifts one void generator 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.700
 come back come running 2 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.700
 hollow core 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:04:00.300
 then what unit is here 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:01.250
 fit I recognize the panel and hunched over 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.610
 external 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:19.680
 formwork on the wall hung on the foundation 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:21.169
 we get such an economic unit 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.910
 components 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.830
 cube masonry of such a wall somewhere order 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.660
 one and a half thousand rubles 4 square 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:34.310
 Well, compared to the meters, we now wondered 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.840
 considered the usual garage 4 by 6 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.790
 cost is the cost of turnover 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:45.330
 these walls, that is, no idea what 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:48.150
 cranes when laying in this way block 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.520
 after a set of strength namely itself 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.949
 styling can be entered in black 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:00.220
 every day one row here but after 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:05.199
 28 days God gains compressive strength 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:10.060
 at the bar thoria gave us something to press 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.680
 these parameters, this block of those 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.610
 the proportions that we just said 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.389
 there is one cream 14 500 cement 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.389
 meets the standards 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:28.000
 masonry for masonry 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:29.050
 stones what else can you add here 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.590
 this set 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:38.289
 Well, as 53 birds 1 is given here 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.840
 device as a compensator of causes 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:45.099
 exists 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.569
 for example your wall there are partitions whether 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.380
 yet it is not a multiple 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:58.810
 the length of the block, respectively, you can 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:06:02.590
 block gap appears at which 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:06.690
 actually do not get something personal 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.490
 do not do a half block do not put not 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.750
 the form does not pride cnes, respectively 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.400
 This compensator is installed and 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.139
 clogged solution can be inside 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.639
 there too cheek to do 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:25.060
 emptiness or maybe foam 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:30.120
 put here that you can 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.120
 say about this formwork
