00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 most people usually say that 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.569
 the people that we play or that we have 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.340
 a YouTube channel we just upload the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.130
 games that we have good or bad is 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.660
 a game where I was terrible 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.030
 it may be that the score honestly 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.030
 it was 9 12 this is a repeat 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 I'm there 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.300
 Well, now we're ready 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.579
 step step the following the most 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.579
 my team is we had a terrible game 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.540
 we had a horrible game look like 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.960
 you can see I'm going 29 the looks that is my your 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.280
 curve 10 10 grabbed all and so 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.260
 say it but nevertheless 40 I also 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.790
 to tell them that the top behaved 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.230
 as a 10 year old boy and said no 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.300
 he was going to help me I did not go out all 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 heading to some team fa and inside to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.910
 make the cases he could grabbing the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.990
 others weak and the majority killed him 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.180
 but what I want to show you is 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.090
 that one sometimes when you lose 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.220
 despairs and ends giving away the game 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.720
 but let's see how they can see in this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.720
 precise moment of departure 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.480
 the caress approached we are four of his 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.060
 five because to see it pause the triumph 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.740
 this train train scholarship like you 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.410
 I want to tell you if I were here 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.540
 they saw then there were four of us left 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.190
 of those five here is the ani that was 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.450
 as the star character of the game 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.340
 the score as you can see for 53 to 34 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.900
 so the difference now the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.330
 difference now what can you see we are going 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.100
 winning by nine towers they grabbed 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.720
 if I'm not wrong they grabbed all the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 dragons also grabbed the two 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.090
 males who had done three did not 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.230
 it went on average 23 the entire game 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 so doing it has to play 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.880
 defensive waiting and waiting and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.100
 waiting waiting as with the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.260
 hope of being able to win we are 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.090
 trying to make the train more than anything 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.590
 will help us but the guy did not want us 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 help throughout the game so 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.390
 say it and you see this video that always 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.390
 that you are a bad person good thing 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.660
 is that dani was a medium and with him 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.460
 we try to achieve it 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.590
 We went up farm and we gave ourselves to recover 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.840
 as you can see I stopped in 296 those of 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.850
 lalin was lousy they hauled because in 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.800
 bots a disgust I can tell you that the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.540
 people I grab at the beginning was for mistakes 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.670
 of the looks that was given to good 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.140
 game things that you have this 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.180
 it's blanket in platinum 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.719
 I am platinum 4 sexually was to work 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.859
 porn if I'm 1 but that's what it's about 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.120
 game to learn from each of 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.189
 our mistakes and when they follow a 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.359
 line you learn something new just that I 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.660
 I want to show you the following to 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.510
 watch 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.940
 the enemy is here hidden in this 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.240
 bus from here 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.520
 to see here you can already see are the 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.440
 four hidden and the lighter the bait 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.140
 so that we would go out to kill her or 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.610
 when trying to fight law they killed us 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.319
 then I'll give it to follow it 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.359
 presented the video 1000 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.760
 at the moment in which I approach 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.999
 try to paste the lime and followed 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 they all flown immediately to 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.540
 kill me 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.460
 there it is we are here goes the hook of 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.020
 three and here comes the ani takes a 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.150
 neglect of the two lanes are the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.130
 take the two which leaves us four 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.620
 of their three they are or are jazz between what 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.720
 common and the fidesz tic and the looks already 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.660
 prepares the tien entered too late 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.540
 but as you can see until the game 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.260
 more lost can be won so this 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.150
 is what you can line up I have a 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.879
 account or benin ea 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.470
 and then it does not make me that different level 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.930
 only that there are less affected and 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.069
 people have better computers in 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.590
 wool the problem of that is that the 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.170
 people have very bad computers and 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.360
 Well, as you can see here, we went through 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.590
 I was only alive the Cadiz but I did not 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.890
 I would have chased him because obviously 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.530
 we had 40 seconds to win the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.530
 game and the casino was going to get only 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.079
 because obviously you can die because 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.489
 we are three against one and the only thing 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.470
 I could do was look at how we work 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.000
 the towers and half approaching the 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.580
 approaching it we had to hit for 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.139
 put fear in him so to speak 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.849
 but when you have finished the part of 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.159
 What I want to tell you is not to leave 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.250
 to train try to the end because 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.509
 by the slightest mistake of the great enemy 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.590
 you can end up turning 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.700
 a game that is completely 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.590
 lost 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.430
 as you can see he turned a 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.050
 lost game 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.910
 the only thing I want to keep with this is 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.750
 for those who are in leagues you can not 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.160
 be bronze silver gold platinum nimo that 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.900
 platinum, most people tend to 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.880
 give up quickly later because I've 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.560
 already opted for this attitude that the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.220
 people start to say hehehehe is 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.900
 of the first mistake that your team makes and 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.020
 it makes me less to so much listen to that 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.910
 immediately and I usually go affects me or 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.560
 I usually leave the game to her good 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.030
 goals accept surrender so to speak 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.130
 so that I did not argue with 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.200
 people where touch to beg them so that 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.400
 do things is a video where only 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.320
 I want you to take a small example in 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.300
 a single move that the ani made for 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.650
 yes doing it got in without fear killed the 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.800
 two lanes because I knew to give what 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.300
 they were doing more damage but he helped us 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.790
 practically to win the game only 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.500
 other the rest but we have to enter the 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.210
 they see what came in and then enter 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.250
 do they immediately take a 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.560
 decision came in and we could win a 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.480
 bad position of the enemy cost them the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.950
 departure even though we were already four 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.750
 times without with all of you imagine 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.880
 where aitor would have been 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.700
 It would have been something much easier but 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.200
 he preferred and cfk then that what I 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.940
 I want you to see 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.770
 at stake sometimes many times we pass 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.820
 many angers but more than going through anger 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.990
 is to try it or go a little further 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.970
 you are looking for a platinum diamonds and want 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.740
 criticize the video can I do it just 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.210
 I try to teach something to my 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.010
 subscribers or the people that I 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.510
 already the people in whom 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.430
 I will share in different groups 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.930
 of the video so they can see and can 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.180
 continue to take an example of certain 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.000
 plays or certain things that they can do 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.140
 It is a good focus change a game me 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.850
 liked my videos I invite you to me 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.010

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.300
 many more videos like this and I know that you 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.300
 you can get a very good smile
