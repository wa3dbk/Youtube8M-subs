to another titanfall weapon review of
this<00:00:09.480> time<00:00:09.690> we're<00:00:09.780> gonna<00:00:09.870> take<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> look<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.469> the

old shotgun in titanfall the Eva 8 and
if<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> standard<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.700> shotguns<00:00:14.969> we

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
if this is a standard for shotguns we

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.450 
if this is a standard for shotguns we
can<00:00:15.450> only<00:00:15.570> hope<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.949> respawn<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.039> introduce

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460

can only hope that respawn and introduce
more<00:00:17.880> shotguns<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.449> game<00:00:18.660> I'd<00:00:19.230> personally

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
more shotguns in game I'd personally

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.380 
more shotguns in game I'd personally
like<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.279> pump-action<00:00:20.699> shotgun<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
like to see a pump-action shotgun of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.359 
like to see a pump-action shotgun of
some<00:00:21.570> kind<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.680> review<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.189> about

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
some kind but this review is all about

some kind but this review is all about
the<00:00:23.519> eve<00:00:23.670> 8<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.269> let's<00:00:24.449> get<00:00:24.570> started<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.140> take

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the eve 8 so let's get started and take

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.810 
the eve 8 so let's get started and take
a<00:00:25.350> look<00:00:25.590> at<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> stats<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.279> figures<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.550> this

a look at the stats and figures of this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.460 
a look at the stats and figures of this
weapon<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.300> find<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:27.869> makes<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.260> so

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
weapon and find out what makes it so

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
weapon and find out what makes it so
good<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.970> always<00:00:30.179> we'll<00:00:30.480> start<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
good so as always we'll start off with a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.690 
good so as always we'll start off with a
look<00:00:31.199> at<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> damage<00:00:31.590> rate<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.369> Eva<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
look at the damage rate in the Eva a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.240 
look at the damage rate in the Eva a
comes<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> mammoth<00:00:33.780> figure<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.469> 285

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
comes out with the mammoth figure of 285

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
comes out with the mammoth figure of 285
up<00:00:35.460> close<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.239> soon<00:00:36.570> drops<00:00:36.809> off<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
up close for that soon drops off to a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
up close for that soon drops off to a
lovely<00:00:37.559> 28<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.399> long<00:00:38.579> range<00:00:38.989> this<00:00:39.989> super<00:00:40.320> high

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
lovely 28 at long range this super high

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.660 
lovely 28 at long range this super high
damage<00:00:40.649> officer<00:00:41.010> means<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.489> kill

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
damage officer means that you can kill

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.540 
damage officer means that you can kill
your<00:00:41.820> targets<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.540> shot<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.230> close<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:44.160> 28

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
your targets in one shot up close at 28

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.920 
your targets in one shot up close at 28
at<00:00:44.700> long<00:00:44.879> range<00:00:45.180> doesn't<00:00:45.600> mean<00:00:45.690> you're<00:00:45.840> going

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
at long range doesn't mean you're going

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
at long range doesn't mean you're going
to<00:00:45.989> need<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> eight<00:00:46.680> shots<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.250> kill<00:00:47.430> I'm

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to need up to eight shots to kill I'm

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.760 
to need up to eight shots to kill I'm
not<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.480> sure<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:49.050> how<00:00:49.230> titanfall

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
not actually sure about how titanfall

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.979 
not actually sure about how titanfall
works<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> hit<00:00:51.030> detection<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.719> shotguns

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
works out the hit detection for shotguns

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
works out the hit detection for shotguns
in<00:00:52.590> other<00:00:52.890> games<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.160> Call<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> Duty<00:00:53.910> were

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in other games like Call of Duty were

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
in other games like Call of Duty were
used<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.390> seeing<00:00:54.719> damage<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.379> divided<00:00:55.860> up

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
used to seeing damage that's divided up

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
used to seeing damage that's divided up
between<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.520> number<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> pellets<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.750> e8

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
between the number of pellets the e8

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
between the number of pellets the e8
does<00:00:58.440> fire<00:00:58.680> our<00:00:58.890> eight<00:00:59.100> pellets<00:00:59.489> per<00:00:59.579> shot<00:01:00.090> but

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
does fire our eight pellets per shot but

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.970 
does fire our eight pellets per shot but
because<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.809> super<00:01:01.199> high<00:01:01.320> damage<00:01:01.559> figure

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
because of this super high damage figure

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
because of this super high damage figure
I'm<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.340> sure<00:01:02.730> whether<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> game

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
I'm not actually sure whether the game

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.270 
I'm not actually sure whether the game
takes<00:01:03.600> into<00:01:03.870> consideration<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.589> individual

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
takes into consideration the individual

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.420 
takes into consideration the individual
pellet<00:01:05.640> hits<00:01:06.320> 285<00:01:07.320> damage<00:01:07.710> points<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.220> more

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
pellet hits 285 damage points is more

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
pellet hits 285 damage points is more
than<00:01:08.610> enough<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> take<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> pilot<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.840> close

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
than enough to take out a pilot at close

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.109 
than enough to take out a pilot at close
range<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.280> calculated<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
range but if your calculated that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
range but if your calculated that
long-range<00:01:12.630> figure<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.110> 28<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.680> per<00:01:13.950> pellet

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
long-range figure of 28 as per pellet

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920 
long-range figure of 28 as per pellet
you<00:01:14.790> could<00:01:14.939> easily<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.299> those<00:01:15.479> one-shot

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you could easily get those one-shot

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
you could easily get those one-shot
kills<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> any<00:01:16.650> range<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.549> think<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
kills out to any range so I think the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
kills out to any range so I think the
profile<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> eight<00:01:18.930> shots<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.470> kill

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
profile of one to eight shots to kill

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
profile of one to eight shots to kill
relates<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> best<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.880> weapon

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
relates the best to how this weapon

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
relates the best to how this weapon
actually<00:01:21.330> performs<00:01:21.930> in-game<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.189> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
actually performs in-game and with this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560 
actually performs in-game and with this
in<00:01:23.460> mind<00:01:23.640> actually<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> all

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
in mind actually think that it all

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.700 
in mind actually think that it all
depends<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.049> whether<00:01:25.229> you've<00:01:25.409> got<00:01:25.560> your

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
depends on whether you've got your

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.899 
depends on whether you've got your
target<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.430> heart<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.640> screen

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
target in your heart in screen

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
target in your heart in screen
crosshairs<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.900> opposed<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
crosshairs and up as opposed to the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
crosshairs and up as opposed to the
random<00:01:28.740> spread<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.310> pellets<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> chance

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
random spread of pellets and the chance

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.370 
random spread of pellets and the chance
of<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> those<00:01:30.659> pellets<00:01:30.900> hits<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.350> your

the term for a shotgun it's more looking

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.780 
the term for a shotgun it's more looking
at<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.990> spread<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.650> pellets<00:03:13.040> per<00:03:13.100> shot<00:03:13.610> as

might<00:03:47.330> also<00:03:47.510> be<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> good<00:03:47.930> choice<00:03:48.260> if<00:03:48.500> you're

might also be a good choice if you're

might also be a good choice if you're
not<00:03:48.770> too<00:03:48.950> hot<00:03:49.190> with<00:03:49.370> your<00:03:49.400> aim<00:03:49.790> as<00:03:50.540> we

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
not too hot with your aim as we

not too hot with your aim as we

plus<00:03:53.150> damage<00:03:53.510> rating<00:03:53.870> at<00:03:53.990> close<00:03:54.230> range<00:03:54.560> seems

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
plus damage rating at close range seems

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.400 
plus damage rating at close range seems
big<00:03:55.310> per<00:03:55.550> shot<00:03:55.880> as<00:03:56.030> opposed<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.480> per<00:03:56.780> pellet<00:03:57.080> so

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
big per shot as opposed to per pellet so

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.930 
big per shot as opposed to per pellet so
I<00:03:57.440> guess<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.860> wider<00:03:58.130> spread<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.610> pellets

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
I guess that wider spread of pellets

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.370 
I guess that wider spread of pellets
isn't<00:03:59.240> gonna<00:03:59.330> make<00:03:59.510> any<00:03:59.570> difference<00:03:59.750> to<00:04:00.200> the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
isn't gonna make any difference to the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.290 
isn't gonna make any difference to the
weapons<00:04:00.740> ability<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.310> take<00:04:01.520> out<00:04:01.700> targets<00:04:02.150> with

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
weapons ability to take out targets with

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.510 
weapons ability to take out targets with
one<00:04:02.360> hit<00:04:02.870> well<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.680> wider<00:04:03.890> spread<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:04.370> gonna

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
one hit well that wider spread is gonna

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.280 
one hit well that wider spread is gonna
make<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.850> easier<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.330> land<00:04:05.540> those<00:04:05.690> hit<00:04:05.990> with<00:04:06.260> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
make it easier to land those hit with a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.980 
make it easier to land those hit with a
wider<00:04:06.530> area<00:04:06.680> for<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.550> aim<00:04:07.700> with<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.780> worst

in its range you're gonna start to need

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.340 
in its range you're gonna start to need
multiple<00:04:19.760> shots<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.510> kill<00:04:20.690> at<00:04:20.870> much<00:04:21.020> closer
