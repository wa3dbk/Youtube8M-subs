00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
two the thing about gears one is it was

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.529 
two the thing about gears one is it was
a<00:04:39.919> little<00:04:40.220> glitchy<00:04:40.460> at<00:04:40.699> time<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.240> if<00:04:41.389> you

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
a little glitchy at time so if you

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.180 
a little glitchy at time so if you
weren't<00:04:41.690> really<00:04:41.930> good<00:04:42.229> at<00:04:42.350> two<00:04:42.500> piecing<00:04:43.010> it

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
weren't really good at two piecing it

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.189 
weren't really good at two piecing it
would<00:04:43.490> sponge<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.449> next<00:04:44.690> shot<00:04:44.870> or<00:04:45.110> it

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
would sponge the next shot or it

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.260 
would sponge the next shot or it
actually<00:04:45.320> wouldn't<00:04:45.770> even<00:04:46.010> shoot<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.460> but<00:04:47.180> in

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
actually wouldn't even shoot it but in

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.930 
actually wouldn't even shoot it but in
this<00:04:47.449> game<00:04:47.690> there's<00:04:48.470> people<00:04:48.979> just<00:04:49.310> swinging

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
this game there's people just swinging

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.520 
this game there's people just swinging
for<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.180> fences<00:04:50.690> like<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.080> thought<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.320> was

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
for the fences like I thought I was

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.939 
for the fences like I thought I was
playing<00:04:51.830> MLB<00:04:52.449> 2013<00:04:53.449> last<00:04:53.750> night<00:04:54.050> when<00:04:54.770> I<00:04:54.800> was

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
playing MLB 2013 last night when I was

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.770 
playing MLB 2013 last night when I was
trying<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.280> play<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.669> breach<00:04:55.940> shot<00:04:56.240> playlist

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
trying to play the breach shot playlist

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.020 
trying to play the breach shot playlist
and<00:04:56.990> everybody<00:04:57.470> was<00:04:58.070> just<00:04:58.370> running<00:04:58.759> around

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
and everybody was just running around

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.570 
and everybody was just running around
and<00:04:59.660> mailing<00:05:00.259> and<00:05:00.530> mailing<00:05:00.919> because<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.340> mail

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and mailing and mailing because the mail

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.529 
and mailing and mailing because the mail
a<00:05:01.729> timer<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:02.389> super<00:05:03.020> quick<00:05:03.880> between<00:05:04.880> melee<00:05:05.270> so

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
a timer is super quick between melee so

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.390 
a timer is super quick between melee so
you<00:05:05.630> can<00:05:05.840> mail<00:05:06.020> eight<00:05:06.199> once<00:05:06.470> and<00:05:06.770> then<00:05:06.889> melee

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
you can mail eight once and then melee

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.360 
you can mail eight once and then melee
again<00:05:07.849> like<00:05:08.150> almost<00:05:08.570> directly<00:05:09.050> after<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.889> so

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
again like almost directly after that so

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.219 
again like almost directly after that so
that's<00:05:10.520> definitely<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:11.210> huge<00:05:11.479> problem<00:05:12.020> that<00:05:12.199> I

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
that's definitely a huge problem that I

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.640 
that's definitely a huge problem that I
wish<00:05:12.500> gets<00:05:13.250> fixed<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.780> ret<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.169> see<00:05:15.320> me<00:05:15.440> dial
