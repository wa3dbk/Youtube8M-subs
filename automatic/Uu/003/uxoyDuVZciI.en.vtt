00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.540
 more 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.069
 i 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.050
 rabies is one of the substances because 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.420
 so I see it as one of the substances 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.340
 more toxic than we can generate 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.440
 human beings not only could 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.770
 check that it is toxic to us to 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 level of health in the impact that can 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.840
 have in our immune system 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.600
 but in the negative repercussions that 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.239
 you can start having this in other 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.489
 areas of our life the reasons that 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.280
 can not generate such a strong emotion 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.129
 as the rage are millions and they are like 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.050
 to order all day can be something 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.260
 what a co -worker told us that 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.750
 rabies produces something that does not come out as 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 we had planned someone who was 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.670
 opposes in the way of our objective 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.030
 someone who commits an injustice in short 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.549
 there are millions of reasons and it is always 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.909
 all very latent when we relate 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.820
 with the outside world the consequence of 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.780
 be kidnapped by the rage that I 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.020
 I have been able to verify that it is more tangible 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.000
 is this the jungle of energy I 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.740
 I feel and this has not repeated in some 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.680
 of my lectures and some more tips 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.690
 that god the universe or as they want 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.570
 call it gives us as a kind of 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.450
 gas tank and every time 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 we do certain things between them have 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.110
 an attack of rage is like if you were 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.710
 open a hole in that gas tank 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.799
 with which all our 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.290
 vital energy when we feel anger and 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.850
 unconsciously we are thinking what 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.649
 it's what we're feeling , we're going 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.780
 to send that person to you 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.820
 situation for which we are 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.640
 feeling like that and there's nothing further from 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.920
 the reality most of the time that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.400
 emotion that we are harboring stays 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.100
 inside of us we think that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.890
 feeling it will hurt others but 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.380
 even so it eats us and our 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.590
 really harmful consequences in 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.720
 all aspects 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.739
 in today's framework I will share with 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.420
 you two tools the first one is 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.640
 conscious try to identify 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.489
 exactly the moment where it starts 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.590
 the branch there is a situation you are having 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.489
 a discussion to someone tells you something 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.099
 unfair happens whatever and in that precise 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.660
 moment where they are starting to 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.000
 feel the ship that we left one what 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.220
 feel like in the body or rejoice 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.970
 stomach especially as in the chest there is 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.980
 people who map and turn red or red 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.980
 and he does not know what to do with that in the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.239
 moment that I call as the zero point 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.640
 the zero point is that opportunity that that 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.440
 emotion is giving us to stop it 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.569
 number two the dragon exercise this 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.360
 exercise is to visualize the 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.140
 rage like a kind of dragon that 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.690
 try to penetrate my shell or my field 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.740
 electromagnetic that protects me from everything 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.890
 the most 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.860
 every time I start to feel that the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.570
 rage floods my entire emotional system 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:43.340
 I repeat mentally or avÃ­o to you not you 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.740
 lets enter I do not allow you to enter and 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.760
 with each repetition I imagine how this 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:53.060
 dragon hits against this shell 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.160
 or electromagnetic field that allows me 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.250
 be protected and be at peace 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.340
 the brain for some reason is going to start 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.710
 to take this command like I'm not going 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.660
 to let kidnap by emotion is a 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.370
 exercise that I have practiced several 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.730
 times and methods wonderful results 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.070
 so I would love that every time 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.320
 are in a similar situation use 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.600
 this tool to see how they are doing 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.850
 Leave me your comments and share 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.100
 also with me other tools that 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.220
 have been useful for you to be able to 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.190
 share them in next frame tips for 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.760
 the handling of the radio 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.170
 and remember that all the tools 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.170
 they are always inside you
