have some great merits to them

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.250 
have some great merits to them
especially<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.609> beast<00:03:21.970> mode<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.480> they<00:03:22.930> both

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
especially in beast mode and they both

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.039 
especially in beast mode and they both
look<00:03:23.530> very<00:03:23.560> cool<00:03:24.250> it'll<00:03:25.180> be<00:03:25.359> a<00:03:25.390> preference

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
look very cool it'll be a preference

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.170 
look very cool it'll be a preference
thing<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.500> most<00:03:26.769> because<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.669> a<00:03:27.700> really

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
thing for most because this is a really

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.539 
thing for most because this is a really
quality<00:03:28.780> Legion<00:03:29.230> toy<00:03:29.380> easily<00:03:30.190> one<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.430> the

best and with that we've seen all the
terrorcons<00:03:34.209> apart<00:03:34.660> but<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.500> think<00:03:35.799> we<00:03:35.919> need<00:03:36.069> one

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
terrorcons apart but I think we need one

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.919 
terrorcons apart but I think we need one
