00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 among all the offal is reading 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.480
 probably the most appreciated is the most 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 consumed in absolute 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.559
 when I cooked this food well 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.400
 it can turn into an excellent dish 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.830
 single 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.299
 however, it is also low in calories 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 unlike what you believe the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.199
 common thought the tripe does not supply 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.250
 low fat and low calories 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.660
 just think 108 kcal per 100 g what 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
 makes the difference clearly 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.490
 seasoning in accompanying sauce 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 but today I would like to offer you the version 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.860
 light with very little oil 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.270
 we'll find out together 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.309
 ingredients for 4 people 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.340
 we have five and six hundred grams of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.030
 clean and raw fresh bovine tripe 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.430
 naturally then 400 g of large pieces 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.219
 or of pilar that I have still passed of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.710
 tomato the one you like best 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 400 milliliters of white wine 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.960
 or if you don't like it you can use it 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.079
 a part of white wine and a part of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.659
 vegetable broth about 50 milliliters of 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:10.320
 vinegar a small celery carrot 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.930
 rosemary shallot a teaspoon of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.350
 tomato paste a spicchietto 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 of garlic a bay leaf berries of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.780
 juniper and a few cloves 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.200
 abundant pepper sage leaf 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 salt as needed and then before serving 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 we have oil only two tablespoons per 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.450
 end of cooking and about 30 grams 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.270
 of grated Parmesan cheese 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.970
 first we prepared the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.790
 casserole with plenty of water than us 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.340
 we are about 50 mm of white vinegar and then 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.399
 cover 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.649
 in the meantime we are still washing the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.049
 troops because they exist in the market 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.479
 clearly the raw tripe already cleaned 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.630
 but it is always better a twofold or even 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.490
 a triple cleaning then how to do it 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.280
 you take a sad one opens the water 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.780
 under running water it washes floor 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.459
 plan and good for this operation with 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.069
 all sad and now that we have them 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.700
 washed well we all have too 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.470
 placed on the cutting board and cut into 2 3 or 4 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.470
 cm according to your tastes 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.060
 now that we've even cut them 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.269
 all in small pieces we can boil them about 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.030
 10 minutes in water and vinegar because 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.879
 boil them ten minutes to remove 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.040
 the characteristic smell and then also for 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:49.579
 make them a little more digestible increase 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.930
 even the flame and in the meantime there 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:56.780
 we prepare the sauce of ours 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.340
 businesses boil in the water there 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.930
 prepare the sauce as I said 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.769
 first then in a large saucepan 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.170
 pour in large pieces of peeled tomatoes 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.389
 or the past then we cut ourselves 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.010
 even the chopped vegetables then 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:14.560
 carrot and celery after having them 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.419
 clearly washed properly we pour 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.250
 we mix well 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.950
 if you want you can also finely chop 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.340
 the onion, however, as you know I do not 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.280
 I particularly like it so I don't have it 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.319
 inserted and I preferred shallots 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.310
 now let's get the bag ready 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.609
 of mixed aromas as I said I have 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.250
 prepared a half shallot clearly 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.709
 peeled we cut it in two we can 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.799
 put it directly inside the 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.739
 our pot back on the cutting board 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.410
 here I cut a clove of garlic a 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.200
 half or removed the heart to make it more 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.480
 digestible 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.060
 now we put it inside one 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.069
 sterile egret to avoid that 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.910
 all the aromas are dispersed in the sauce 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:07.290
 in this egret we put a cow of 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:12.319
 juniper a clove one 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:18.320
 laurel leaves maybe we break 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.320
 Sage some leaves 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.670
 prof marine 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.210
 and we close the bag and pine 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.290
 and now we have prepared ours 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.240
 nice bag of aromas we put it 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.080
 directly into her have passed 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.180
 about 10 minutes and you see it trip 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.160
 boiling right now as one 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.410
 skimmer so don't go to drain 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.140
 remove the water with a skimmer 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.970
 the tripe from the water and pour it 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.970
 directly of his so 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.680
 once we have paid them in 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:13.080
 gravy mix well if like me 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.030
 like his beautiful red 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.510
 I would also add a spoonful of 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.510
 tomato paste and dissolve it 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:36.990
 we can also adjust salt and 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:39.510
 plenty of pepper and now let's find out with 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.760
 the liquid is generally used 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.180
 broth that can be vegetable or meat 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.330
 I instead recommend all white wine 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.970
 in this way the characteristic smell 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.190
 of the tripe will be less so it will be 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.000
 even more delicate, however, we mix well 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.520
 the whole 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.490
 increase the flame until recovery 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.370
 of boiling and then I recommend one 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.979
 very slow cooking for three and a half hours 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.100
 4 clearly this is valid if 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.990
 compare fresh and raw troops 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.479
 there are also tripes on the market 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.000
 pre-cooked in this case the future will be 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.610
 about 45 50 minutes 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.889
 if during cooking you notice that 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.599
 the sauce is too dry, I recommend 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.830
 add more liquid 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:28.349
 so see you in a few hours are 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:33.510
 four hours passed and our troops 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:35.220
 they are ready then I now advise 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.169
 to remove the bag with the 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.490
 aromas is that place we put on one 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:43.620
 little bowl now let's increase the flame 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.970
 then let's dry a little 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.410
 excess liquid 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.420
 I remember that up to this point 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.720
 I didn't add fat 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:55.420
 ne all in e book we add but then 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.850
 at the end of cooking 2 tablespoons of 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.850
 oil only two are sufficient for 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:06.340
 this quantity that you suggested here 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:08.110
 here therefore we learn to use fats 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.300
 in excess 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:15.070
 in this way we mix his many 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.620
 nets also a healthier dish because 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:21.940
 the oil does not boil during the whole 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:26.200
 cooking tripe a bit of cheese 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:31.780
 grated parmesan and then we go to 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.060
 serve as I told you the tripe 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.160
 they represent a very little dish 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.800
 caloric possible digestive difficulties 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.130
 they derive at most from is considerable 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.650
 supply of collagen and protein tissues 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.320
 provided by the troops and certainly not by the 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.230
 in short, a good amount of fat 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.200
 dish rich in vitamins of the group b 

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:57.060
 high biological value proteins and salts 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.060
 minerals such as iron in particular
