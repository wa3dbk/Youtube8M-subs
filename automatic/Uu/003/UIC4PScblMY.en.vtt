00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.430 

okay<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.540> was<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.900> flamenco<00:01:08.350> tremolo<00:01:08.530> and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
okay so this was a flamenco tremolo and

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.510 
okay so this was a flamenco tremolo and
the<00:01:11.440> flamenco<00:01:11.800> tremolo<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.250> like<00:01:12.370> the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
the flamenco tremolo is like the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.190 
the flamenco tremolo is like the
classical<00:01:13.030> plus<00:01:13.450> one<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.320> plus<00:01:14.530> one<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:17.170> I

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
classical plus one the plus one is the I

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:38.590 
classical plus one the plus one is the I
finger<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:18.270> played<00:01:19.270> twice<00:01:22.619> P<00:01:23.619> I<00:01:24.119> am<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.149 

so<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.610> difference<00:01:40.940> really<00:01:41.150> is<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.979> use

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
so the difference really is that the use

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.250 
so the difference really is that the use
of<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.490> flamenco<00:01:43.790> tremolo<00:01:44.090> because<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.110> has

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
of the flamenco tremolo because it has

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.469 
of the flamenco tremolo because it has
one<00:01:45.440> extra<00:01:45.470> note<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.450> kind<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.770> has<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.800> broader

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
one extra note it kind of has a broader

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.540 
one extra note it kind of has a broader
sound<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:51.380> one<00:01:51.650> extra<00:01:51.830> note<00:01:52.130> even<00:01:52.400> though<00:01:52.460> it

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
sound that one extra note even though it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.910 
sound that one extra note even though it
happens<00:01:52.820> very<00:01:52.970> very<00:01:53.090> fast<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:54.229> slows<00:01:54.650> down<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
happens very very fast it slows down the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.390 
happens very very fast it slows down the
baseline<00:01:55.369> considerably<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.070> creates

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
baseline considerably and and it creates

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.260 
baseline considerably and and it creates
a<00:01:58.640> more<00:01:59.030> thicker<00:01:59.960> texture<00:02:00.470> if<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.740> will<00:02:01.040> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
a more thicker texture if you will the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.100 
a more thicker texture if you will the
classical<00:02:02.270> tremolo<00:02:02.600> because<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:02.960> only

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
classical tremolo because it's only

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.170 
classical tremolo because it's only
three<00:02:03.410> it's<00:02:03.860> kind<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.160> fleeting<00:02:04.520> by<00:02:04.880> very

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
three it's kind of fleeting by very

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.100 
three it's kind of fleeting by very
quickly<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.390> compositions<00:02:08.390> used<00:02:08.929> in

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
quickly and and the compositions used in

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.880 
quickly and and the compositions used in
it<00:02:10.300> take<00:02:11.300> that<00:02:11.450> painting<00:02:11.750> into<00:02:12.110> account<00:02:12.470> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it take that painting into account and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.310 
it take that painting into account and
that's<00:02:13.130> when<00:02:13.370> they<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:17.120> affects<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> phrasing

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
that's when they it affects the phrasing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.170 
that's when they it affects the phrasing
it<00:02:18.800> affects<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.770> tempo<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.280> how<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.910> take

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
it affects the the tempo of how you take

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.610 
it affects the the tempo of how you take
things<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.630> pretty<00:02:23.840> much<00:02:23.930> locks<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.410> into

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
things so it pretty much locks you into

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.270 
things so it pretty much locks you into
a<00:02:24.680> very<00:02:24.830> specific<00:02:25.100> kind<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.890> pulsation<00:02:27.890> if<00:02:28.190> you

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
a very specific kind of pulsation if you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.330 
a very specific kind of pulsation if you
will<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:29.060> flamenco<00:02:29.450> tremolo<00:02:30.160> there's<00:02:31.160> many

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
will the flamenco tremolo there's many

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.070 
will the flamenco tremolo there's many
different<00:02:31.610> ways<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.000> different<00:02:32.060> uses<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:32.750> it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
different ways and different uses for it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.930 
different ways and different uses for it
some<00:02:33.320> people<00:02:33.890> were<00:02:33.980> played<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.670> rhythmic

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
some people were played in in rhythmic

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:45.870 
some people were played in in rhythmic
things

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.540 

so<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.810> anatolia<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.860> kind<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.100> fast<00:02:48.340> so

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
so in anatolia that kind of a fast so

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.550 
so in anatolia that kind of a fast so
they<00:02:48.670> are<00:02:48.790> it's<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.690> know<00:02:49.810> very<00:02:49.840> very<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
they are it's you know very very on the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.100 
they are it's you know very very on the
beat<00:02:56.820> not<00:02:57.820> much<00:02:58.030> space<00:02:58.240> between<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> thumb

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
beat not much space between the thumb

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.060 
beat not much space between the thumb
and<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.830> singing<00:03:00.130> line<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.950> in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
and and the and the singing line but in

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.590 
and and the and the singing line but in
any<00:03:06.250> net<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.430> like<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.820> was<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.180> doing<00:03:07.420> right

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
any net I like I was just doing right

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.960 
any net I like I was just doing right
now<00:03:07.630> in<00:03:08.560> any<00:03:08.800> kind<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.070> free<00:03:09.340> form<00:03:09.610> which<00:03:09.820> they

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
now in any kind of free form which they

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.140 
now in any kind of free form which they
use<00:03:10.090> tremolo<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> lot<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:11.140> flamenco<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
use tremolo a lot of in flamenco the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.700 
use tremolo a lot of in flamenco the
spacing<00:03:13.720> sometimes<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.290> little<00:03:14.500> bit<00:03:14.590> more

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
spacing sometimes is a little bit more

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:25.960 
spacing sometimes is a little bit more
Roboto<00:03:15.070> so<00:03:15.460> when<00:03:15.640> you're

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.580 

so<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.540> see<00:03:27.690> I'm<00:03:27.780> varying<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> speed

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
so as you can see I'm varying the speed

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.800 
so as you can see I'm varying the speed
and<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.040> tempo<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.060> actual<00:03:30.330> tremolo<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
and the tempo of the actual tremolo and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.170 
and the tempo of the actual tremolo and
the<00:03:31.140> bass<00:03:31.290> line<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.830> lot<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.340> than<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.820> would<00:03:32.880> if

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the bass line a lot more than I would if

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.740 
the bass line a lot more than I would if
I<00:03:33.300> was<00:03:33.420> playing<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.140> classical<00:03:34.530> tremolo<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.750> how

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
I was playing a classical tremolo so how

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.390 
I was playing a classical tremolo so how
to<00:03:36.810> practice<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.290> flamenco<00:03:37.560> tremolo<00:03:37.890> pretty

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
to practice a flamenco tremolo pretty

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.300 
to practice a flamenco tremolo pretty
much<00:03:38.580> like<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.210> classical<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:40.620> with<00:03:40.860> plus

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
much like the classical but with plus

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.740 
much like the classical but with plus
one<00:03:44.750> there's<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.810> little<00:03:47.210> an<00:03:48.210> exercise<00:03:48.720> that

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
one there's a little an exercise that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.600 
one there's a little an exercise that
kind<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.350> works<00:03:49.860> on<00:03:51.800> getting<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.040> rotation<00:03:53.190> of

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
kind of works on getting the rotation of

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.580 
kind of works on getting the rotation of
the<00:03:53.730> fingers<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.810> happen<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.560> very

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
the fingers to happen in a very

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.120 
the fingers to happen in a very
effective<00:03:56.010> way<00:03:57.560> it's<00:03:58.560> kind<00:03:58.770> of<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.890> quality

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
effective way it's kind of a quality

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.220 
effective way it's kind of a quality
control<00:03:59.520> from<00:04:00.180> every<00:04:00.540> finger<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.990> every

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
control from every finger to every

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.810 
control from every finger to every
finger<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.650> every<00:04:01.890> finger<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.250> every<00:04:02.459> finger

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
finger to every finger to every finger

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.480 
finger to every finger to every finger
to<00:04:03.240> happen<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.750> really<00:04:04.080> ideal<00:04:04.560> way<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.430> you

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
to happen in a really ideal way so you

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.980 
to happen in a really ideal way so you
kind<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.790> break<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:05.970> down<00:04:06.240> into<00:04:06.450> smaller<00:04:06.870> units

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
kind of break it down into smaller units

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.890 
kind of break it down into smaller units
what<00:04:07.800> do<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:07.950> mean<00:04:08.100> by<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.750> instead<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.810> just

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
what do I mean by that instead of just

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.420 
what do I mean by that instead of just
going<00:04:11.450> endlessly<00:04:12.450> like<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.870> I'm<00:04:13.430> focusing

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
going endlessly like that I'm focusing

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.390 
going endlessly like that I'm focusing
on<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.670> quality<00:04:15.230> between<00:04:16.230> just<00:04:16.799> getting<00:04:17.220> from

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
on the quality between just getting from

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.060 
on the quality between just getting from
one<00:04:17.519> note<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.730> another<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:19.470> groups<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.890> two

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
one note to another of in groups of two

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.400 
one note to another of in groups of two
and<00:04:20.400> then<00:04:21.060> repeating<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.660> same<00:04:21.810> finger<00:04:22.230> into

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
and then repeating the same finger into

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.200 
and then repeating the same finger into
the<00:04:22.560> next<00:04:22.860> one<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.130> into<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> next<00:04:23.669> one<00:04:23.820> like

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
the next one and into the next one like

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:37.480 
the next one and into the next one like
this

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:05:03.280 

aye<00:04:38.830> aye<00:04:39.830> they<00:04:40.750> am<00:04:41.919> empire

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.620 

what<00:05:04.290> that<00:05:04.440> does<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.800> just<00:05:05.010> makes<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:06.210> fingers

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
what that does it just makes the fingers

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.650 
what that does it just makes the fingers
very<00:05:07.500> alert<00:05:07.830> when<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.280> have<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.580> double<00:05:08.970> hit

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
very alert when you have to double hit

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.140 
very alert when you have to double hit
with<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.900> same<00:05:10.110> finger<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:11.520> just<00:05:11.820> makes<00:05:12.000> them

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
with the same finger it just makes them

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.060 
with the same finger it just makes them
very<00:05:12.270> alert<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.990> teaches<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.590> muscle<00:05:13.920> to

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
very alert and it teaches the muscle to

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.980 
very alert and it teaches the muscle to
regenerate<00:05:14.880> quickly<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:15.510> is<00:05:15.630> very<00:05:15.810> good

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
regenerate quickly and that is very good

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.029 
regenerate quickly and that is very good
for<00:05:16.110> speed<00:05:16.380> by<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.620> way<00:05:16.740> so

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.519 

and<00:05:23.400> as<00:05:23.849> you<00:05:23.999> do<00:05:24.119> that<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.509> apply<00:05:24.869> also<00:05:25.199> the

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
and as you do that you apply also the

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.799 
and as you do that you apply also the
planting<00:05:26.249> element<00:05:27.089> into<00:05:27.419> it<00:05:27.509> which<00:05:27.659> we

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:27.809 
planting element into it which we

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:30.290 
planting element into it which we
discussed<00:05:28.169> earlier<00:05:28.319> and<00:05:28.860> so<00:05:29.729> this<00:05:29.909> is<00:05:30.029> a<00:05:30.059> great

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
discussed earlier and so this is a great

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:40.580 
discussed earlier and so this is a great
preparation<00:05:31.080> for<00:05:31.619> eventually<00:05:32.099> going

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.350 

so<00:05:40.800> really<00:05:40.950> anything<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.490> good<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:41.940> just<00:05:42.150> play

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
so really anything is good you just play

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:51.740 
so really anything is good you just play
chords

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.460 

anything<00:05:53.100> done<00:05:54.100> right<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:54.699> a<00:05:54.759> good<00:05:55.030> exercise

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470
