00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
once that wing parts in the floor you're

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
once that wing parts in the floor you're
pretty<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:35.640> i<00:01:35.670> had<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
pretty much good to go i had to kind of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
pretty much good to go i had to kind of
direct<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> terminal<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.220> but

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
direct it out of the terminal here but

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.219

you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.820> hop<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> wing<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.659> shoot<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you can hop on the wing and shoot it and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
you can hop on the wing and shoot it and
then<00:01:40.350> we'll<00:01:40.470> actually<00:01:40.680> move<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
then we'll actually move now if you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.219 
then we'll actually move now if you
don't<00:01:42.000> believe<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.420> pull<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> an<00:01:42.780> LMG
