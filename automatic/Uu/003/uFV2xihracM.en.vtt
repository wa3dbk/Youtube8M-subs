right diagonal turn and then just keep

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.399 
right diagonal turn and then just keep
going<00:01:41.460> straight<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.659> soon<00:01:42.990> you'll<00:01:43.229> find

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.430 
through a loading screen but not always
but<00:02:03.400> if<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.640> do<00:02:03.820> just<00:02:04.120> wait<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:04.570> then<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:05.260> will

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
but if you do just wait and then it will

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.140 
but if you do just wait and then it will
keep<00:02:05.620> going

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
keep going

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.480 
keep going
so<00:02:07.150> this<00:02:07.360> place<00:02:07.630> should<00:02:07.810> look<00:02:07.990> very<00:02:08.020> familiar

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
so this place should look very familiar

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.040 
so this place should look very familiar
since<00:02:09.490> this<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.210> beginning<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
pirates once you get there you could

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.030 
pirates once you get there you could
just<00:02:34.420> keep<00:02:34.780> going<00:02:35.140> throughout<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.680> mission

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
this and then you'll soon go to the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.670 
this and then you'll soon go to the
place<00:03:00.489> where<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.820> final<00:03:01.030> boss<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:02.320> huge

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
place where the final boss is the huge

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.910 
place where the final boss is the huge
Walker<00:03:03.040> spider<00:03:03.549> thing<00:03:04.320> now<00:03:05.320> this<00:03:05.530> is<00:03:05.739> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
Walker spider thing now this is the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.330 
Walker spider thing now this is the
probably<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.610> easiest<00:03:07.590> place<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.160> but

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
probably the easiest place to go to but

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.460 
probably the easiest place to go to but
not<00:03:09.519> too<00:03:09.730> many<00:03:09.850> people<00:03:10.030> know<00:03:10.330> about<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.810> but

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
not too many people know about it but

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.830 
not too many people know about it but
then<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.769> can<00:03:11.950> face<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.400> boss<00:03:12.610> 1v1<00:03:13.269> him<00:03:13.690> if

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
then you can face the boss 1v1 him if

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.170 
then you can face the boss 1v1 him if
you<00:03:13.930> want<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.350> gonna<00:03:15.100> be<00:03:15.280> really<00:03:15.549> hard<00:03:15.910> you

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
you want to gonna be really hard you

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.270 
you want to gonna be really hard you
have<00:03:16.690> unlimited<00:03:17.049> respawns<00:03:17.530> because<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.160> is

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
have unlimited respawns because it is

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.360 
have unlimited respawns because it is
the<00:03:18.400> Cosmodrome<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.560> that's<00:03:20.560> pretty<00:03:21.040> much<00:03:21.160> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
the Cosmodrome and that's pretty much it
