00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.350
 the best resolution you ever have 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.210
 seen 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.730
 a philips brags a bit with 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.090
 her newest top model TV in the 78 100 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.950
 series the ultra hd screen of 49 inch 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.599
 of marlies show four times more pixels 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.249
 then full hd 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.679
 the image is therefore sharper 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.449
 and brighter but only if you have ultra hd 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.189
 video is playing 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.509
 and unfortunately that is hardly available 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.630
 and it will take a while 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.329
 before it is available for ultra hd 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.870
 you do not have to buy this TV yet 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.870
 but why then 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.460
 This Philips TV is slim and elegant with 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.680
 the beautiful aluminum of the housing 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.390
 you really get a luxury ferry house 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.879
 the broad flat foot but on the screen 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.170
 supports is quite striking and I don't know 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.730
 or that will suit everyone 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.780
 fall 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.790
 furthermore a nice thin which makes it 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.239
 seen from the side barely stands out 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.239
 the space 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.059
 The full HD image of this TV is this is 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.860
 great if you play with 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.840
 the image settings then pop the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.390
 polar bears from the earth blu-ray you 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.300
 away from the screen the image too much 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.710
 contrast it is beautiful and sharp and clear 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.240
 and the viewing angle is also good because 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.880
 if you are sitting diagonally on the couch then it is 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.080
 image still great to see also the sound 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.060
 is very impressive 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.020
 with the movie avatar it even seems like one 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.390
 kinda like the sound out 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.180
 different directions comes its light 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.350
 salaam perfect well at the highest 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.450
 the volume still sounds 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.940
 clear and full and that is such a handsome 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.830
 performance 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.610
 a downside to this philips tv is it 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.840
 smart tv menu that is really annoyingly slow 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.850
 last year we were critical about 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.200
 way of another philips it on tv 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.040
 the philips 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.869
 46 pfl 8,008 k well unfortunately they are not 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.909
 changed so much since the navigable go 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.590
 still so slow that you keep getting it 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.710
 is about half a second behind 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.420
 the taxi and that while this TV anyway one 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.729
 quad-core processor and with it 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.229
 he really had to turn things around faster 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.540
 I ask but can not feel chosen 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.040
 is for android as operating system 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.350
 the TVs and the new Philips 8000 series 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.209
 who have android 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.290
 and therefore they are expected to be one 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.329
 much quicker with the philips tv's handy 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.579
 double-sided remote control supplied 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.560
 He is handy because you are on Facebook and 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.320
 twitter apps in the smart menu and at 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.549
 youtube just come and tap 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.410
 search fields 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.030
 but the keyboard does not always work 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.470
 it does not work in the browser address bar 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.780
 and it also doesn't work if you want to search 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.390
 in netflix truth is possible it goes 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.890
 type nice and quick because 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.680
 keys are divided into two fields 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.680
 and so you can do fairly quickly 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.000
 this philips tv is very nice has great 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.890
 image has very good sound for ultra 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.569
 you don't have to buy hd video yet 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.880
 that is hardly there yet 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.280
 the smarttv is very slow despite the 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.260
 heavy quad core processor 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.090
 all in all i think you will look cheaper 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.090
 with one of the tv put our test
