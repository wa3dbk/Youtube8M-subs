sport that I sell out that I'm good at
I'm<00:06:01.920> just<00:06:02.130> missing<00:06:02.370> one<00:06:02.610> little<00:06:02.640> component

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
I'm just missing one little component

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.590 
I'm just missing one little component
that's<00:06:03.360> all<00:06:04.760> with<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.880> end<00:06:06.090> of<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.360> series

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
that's all with the end of the series

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.540 
that's all with the end of the series
came<00:06:07.260> to<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.410> beginning<00:06:07.530> of<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:07.950> careers<00:06:08.310> of

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
came to the beginning of the careers of

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.790 
came to the beginning of the careers of
a<00:06:08.730> funeral<00:06:09.150> young<00:06:09.360> drivers<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.530> perhaps

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
a funeral young drivers and perhaps

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.190 
a funeral young drivers and perhaps
something<00:06:11.160> more<00:06:11.420> proof<00:06:12.420> that<00:06:12.660> a<00:06:12.690> green<00:06:12.960> racing

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
something more proof that a green racing

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.850 
something more proof that a green racing
series<00:06:13.620> is<00:06:14.070> just<00:06:14.400> that<00:06:14.580> a<00:06:14.880> racing<00:06:15.660> series<00:06:15.870> that

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
series is just that a racing series that

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.400 
series is just that a racing series that
you<00:06:16.980> can<00:06:17.130> race<00:06:17.280> clean<00:06:17.580> well<00:06:18.510> maybe<00:06:19.140> a<00:06:19.230> little

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
you can race clean well maybe a little

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.860 
you can race clean well maybe a little
dirty<00:06:19.710> at<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.250> same<00:06:20.430> time<00:06:20.700> I<00:06:21.060> think<00:06:21.390> that<00:06:21.750> this

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
dirty at the same time I think that this

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.510 
dirty at the same time I think that this
series<00:06:22.110> will<00:06:22.320> gain<00:06:22.470> more<00:06:22.680> praised<00:06:23.040> as<00:06:23.250> it<00:06:23.370> gets

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
series will gain more praised as it gets

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.490 
series will gain more praised as it gets
more<00:06:23.700> popular<00:06:23.910> and<00:06:24.360> all<00:06:24.540> this<00:06:24.750> technology<00:06:25.140> I

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
more popular and all this technology I

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.960 
more popular and all this technology I
mean<00:06:25.710> it<00:06:25.830> just<00:06:25.860> trickles<00:06:26.280> down<00:06:26.580> into<00:06:26.910> the

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
mean it just trickles down into the

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.520 
mean it just trickles down into the
street<00:06:27.210> cars<00:06:27.480> and<00:06:27.720> will<00:06:27.810> make<00:06:27.930> streetcars

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
street cars and will make streetcars

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.320 
street cars and will make streetcars
ultimately<00:06:29.160> for<00:06:29.370> more<00:06:29.520> fuel-efficient<00:06:30.120> some

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
ultimately for more fuel-efficient some

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.540 
ultimately for more fuel-efficient some
