do we have to have you know do we have

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.740 
do we have to have you know do we have
to<00:01:15.869> reach<00:01:16.020> level<00:01:16.439> 100<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.600> people<00:01:18.600> can

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
to reach level 100 so that people can

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.249 
to reach level 100 so that people can
have<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:19.200> key<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.509> people<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.140> have

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.140 
have more key so that people can have
more<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:24.920> just<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:26.070> maybe<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.670> might<00:01:26.880> need<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
more I just think maybe we might need to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.380 
more I just think maybe we might need to
level<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.549> drop<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.240> if

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
level up and when they do drop it if

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.310 
level up and when they do drop it if
they<00:01:30.659> give<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> us

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
they give it to us

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.020 
they give it to us
they<00:01:31.470> might<00:01:31.680> need<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> add<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> leveling<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.820> as

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they might need to add a leveling up as

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.399 
they might need to add a leveling up as
well<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> mean<00:01:33.900> some<00:01:34.079> people<00:01:34.110> might

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
well with the I mean some people might

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
well with the I mean some people might
agree<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.799> people<00:01:35.040> might<00:01:35.130> disagree<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
