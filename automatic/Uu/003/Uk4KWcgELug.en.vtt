 you can really define a cable as wilson extreme objects then 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.939
 There are 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.929
 original copies 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.480
 original pieces of the first - current events in particular for the bike description 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:23.629
 and there are also used by the molds to eventually make the caricatures 

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.939
 on an original motorcycle stamp I am talking about the bikes of the seventies 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.289
 of the motion of the 80s 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.679
 a bit of physiological disorder. simple reason why 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860
 a year ago this company was not like that 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.690
 I did a lot of work to do this life on the right side of the - products 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.670
 province puts it the history of motorcycle racing therefore all old models 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.340
 all those parts 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.050
 among which you also pull it 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 tambourine era 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.200
 the sp3 frames 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 raid 5 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.770
 and these are all the frames we say new that have never been sold 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 and they are truly among the period this is the story of the bill show 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.410
 and here in these boxes have been cataloged we say all the parts of the 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.260
 vintage motorcycles therefore of the fuel caps to the levers change whoever has more 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.290
 put it 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.300
 as you move to the left we say that 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.920
 rejuvenates warehouse because there are things I love you 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 thesis water thesis o 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 four-hour weight now these stars 7 starter to knock out drums if 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.780
 these are decomposable circles that made only the motion 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.390
 these have enormous value 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.929
 we can tell one thing 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.419
 trento neighborhood star tourism absolutely you arehra tell 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.580
 what is there who is rims 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.190
 then later also saw your bike 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.850
 I am very glad I am not even up to the point of explaining everything 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.320
 what the two of them said they were remembered 20 30 years ago and asked for 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.270
 favorite to take me to 1 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.110
 one of the circles I clearly remember we saw the warehouse and his 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.489
 arrangement can do whatever it wants 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.929
 the work was sila foretold was the m was excited visibly excited 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.839
 these are things beyond everything beyond the market for money numbers 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.619
 are the things that one can say I have lived in my life too 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.619
 these are the shelves dedicated to TV 5 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.760
 the solidity and the tip 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.760
 company to go ahead here 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.309
 for diesel fuel 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:48.019
 these ubiquitous subjects of the db5 furnish a particular version we say 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.739
 sportier than our motto of being affected by forged aluminum 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.700
 they must point out for example here are the tg5 doors 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.549
 which are forks and ohlins 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.969
 which are ohlins rm forks that we buy 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:10.559
 which then after we completely disassemble we assemble a foot 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.489
 the fact from the full anodized and this is a from the loris it costs a lot 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.109
 then after the pd roma take costing a lot also requires an additional 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.629
 assembly work here often many wonder why your bike 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.369
 it costs a little more than the others 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.249
 because behind there is a job to get many do not know 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.650
 what words unfortunately we have to make gravy the loves are 3 requests 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.789
 exclusivity 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:37.499
 this for example is a support we say and closing traverses between inter 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.519
 and forever Japanese motorcycles made normally fusion costs 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.539
 30 euros this costs 450 euros ours 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.939
 for the moment I say that we are more on the passionate side because it is true 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.540
 the real financial return where you put the time is much longer 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.759
 that is I get dressed to finish a financial investment a 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:06.079
 terms and that in predetermined pvp of as regards the industry with the blue ones 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.559
 industry of high technology as this sector where fierce competition 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.829
 publishers cannot be immediate at this time there is much 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.639
 especially worry 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.579
 dr re-launch the brand to show the signal to the public that the 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.199
 bimota and hysterics there is a reality that we have new projects returns 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.960
 finance you repair later obviously I managed to 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.289
 transmit as passionate malaparte finance dog on passion 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.330
 for the bike 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.159
 in the face of my passion they are convinced that it was worthwhile because 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.159
 if you don't believe it you can't do it 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.960
 what perspectives of the exchange 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.460
 certainly the most immediate and that of having a great success 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.330
 in the racing world we are busy with my super tuning and with 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.330
 on request ward ring 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.870
 tent specify that we do not have a timma company re why
