00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.460
 good morning today I will be with you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.520
 show 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.680
 android smartphone fly iq443 trend 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.070
 this is not a review this is a small demonstration 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.109
 the operation of this unit full review 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.619
 with just a review comparing with another 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.700
 flyers kim couple there fly iq446 read 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.260
 us on site hold x dot ru 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.040
 as you can see the device is very 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.120
 rather big look how he lies with me 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.910
 in hand although on the other hand there are 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 much more not a small apparatus can 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.960
 also look at its weight 125 grams 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.990
 screen ips screen 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.420
 I promised I want to compare 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.610
 his screen with screen archive 446 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.970
 according to the characteristics of protection completely 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.220
 same in practice for quality itan 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:30.689
 I liked the trend a little less than 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.130
 screen these 446 matt but trend screen 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 slightly brighter 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.110
 look now about brightness 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:45.110
 half that's 0 brightness that's one hundred percent 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 brightness 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.079
 I want to show how these devices catch 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.079
 Wi-Fi 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:11.530
 average magic life wi-fi again 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:15.420
 a little bit more we have that 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:20.100
 let's want to compare flash brightness 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 so here it is not necessary in the carpet 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:38.120
 I also think everything is visible 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:41.769
 magic more by comparison can 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.769
 read the review on our website 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.760
 camera trend basically i'm in drive then 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.030
 I liked a little more than the camera 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:02.220
 magic well of course friend too 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:07.440
 frank, we do not have anything outstanding 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.440
 for instagram will come down but no more 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.960
 Internet traditionally I am quite a lot 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.200
 time I spend reading twitter 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.440
 all kinds of news 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.210
 doing things like that on a trend is easy and 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.690
 nice sometimes of course come across 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:35.280
 so that starts a little miss 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.880
 RAM and there is only half a giga 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.880
 you can survive it 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.010
 if you try especially to open big 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.010
 number of tabs at the same time 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.920
 for reading books the way certainly fits 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.560
 electronic ink screens 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:17.470
 some time on this smartphone i 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:21.620
 read something gps 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.220
 traditionally for devices on chips from 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:29.410
 mediatek there is no support glonass oh 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.410
 what are our traffic jams today 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.940
 but satellites despite this catches 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.560
 the device is very bright 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:46.030
 watching the video is traditionally again for 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:50.510
 I donâ€™t know why mediatek 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:54.280
 preinstalled person want 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.280
 immediately pull as far as possible 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:03.200
 the rest is already quite nice 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.040
 videos ranging from everywhere you can watch 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.040
 no problem 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.280
 only here so I over the hill 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.280
 cool increase 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.070
 actually what I wanted to say when 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.800
 using mx player is a must 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.260
 set software decoder 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:49.240
 if you put the hardware problem 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:53.010
 Since the sound will not sound traditional 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.010
 last few toys 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.720
 I wanted to show you today about what 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.500
 do not forget to tell please 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.870
 read a great detailed review 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.110
 This unit on our site 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.060

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.060
