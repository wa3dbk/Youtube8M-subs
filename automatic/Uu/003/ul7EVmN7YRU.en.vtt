00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.570 
I thought it would be fun to show you
guys<00:00:12.750> anyways<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> first<00:00:14.099> thing<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.490> I'm

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
guys anyways so the first thing that I'm

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.430 
guys anyways so the first thing that I'm
pulling<00:00:14.940> out<00:00:15.059> over<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.049> make<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.410> for

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
pulling out over here is the make up for

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.189 
pulling out over here is the make up for
ever<00:00:16.680> aqua<00:00:17.130> seal<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.930> looks

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
ever aqua seal so this is what it looks

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.230 
ever aqua seal so this is what it looks
like<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.740> says<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.550> waterproof

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
like it says that it's a waterproof

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.009 
like it says that it's a waterproof
liquid<00:00:22.020> converter<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.890> what<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.100> means<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
liquid converter so what that means is

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.109 
liquid converter so what that means is
that<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.890> basically<00:00:26.160> put<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> drop<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that you can basically put a drop of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.160 
that you can basically put a drop of
this<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.510> anything<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.050> it
