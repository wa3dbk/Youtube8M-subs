00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
seen done you know it actually took me a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.240 
seen done you know it actually took me a
little<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.380> effort<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> hardest<00:01:32.070> part

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you know after all was some of the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.330 
you know after all was some of the
missions<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.619> you'll<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.280> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
missions that you'll get to see here in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.679 
missions that you'll get to see here in
a<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.520> bit<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> spring<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> Bluebird<00:01:36.570> on

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
a little bit the spring the Bluebird on

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.850 
a little bit the spring the Bluebird on
top<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> gazebo<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.740> pretty

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
top of the gazebo that one was pretty

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
top of the gazebo that one was pretty
simple<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.460> actually<00:01:39.210> only<00:01:39.750> sped<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.259> up

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
simple I actually only sped this up

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
simple I actually only sped this up
slightly<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.369> could<00:01:41.520> actually<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
slightly so we could actually see it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.580 
slightly so we could actually see it
because<00:01:42.420> most<00:01:42.659> speeds<00:01:42.899> are<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.229> easy<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
because most speeds are really easy to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010 
because most speeds are really easy to
get<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.220> spray<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.790> blue<00:01:45.299> shell<00:01:45.570> green<00:01:45.720> shell

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
this part because it actually took a

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.089 
this part because it actually took a

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
I'm speeding a bit through this because

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.510 
I'm speeding a bit through this because
it<00:05:38.419> was<00:05:38.539> a<00:05:38.570> very<00:05:39.199> very<00:05:39.530> difficult<00:05:39.770> mission<00:05:40.340> and

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
it was a very very difficult mission and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.219 
it was a very very difficult mission and
you<00:05:40.909> know<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.030> did<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.449> hundred<00:05:41.780> coins<00:05:41.960> and

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
blue coins here so there's no point me

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.460 
blue coins here so there's no point me
you<00:05:44.120> know<00:05:44.210> actually<00:05:44.360> going<00:05:44.930> through<00:05:45.199> all<00:05:45.260> this

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
you know actually going through all this

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.480
