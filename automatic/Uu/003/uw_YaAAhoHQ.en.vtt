wing zero onto the exia body and a head

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.510 
wing zero onto the exia body and a head
um<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.470> didn't<00:02:42.680> really<00:02:42.800> do<00:02:42.980> anything<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
um I didn't really do anything to the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.360 
um I didn't really do anything to the
back<00:02:43.700> there<00:02:43.940> where<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> GN<00:02:44.420> drive<00:02:44.630> goes<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.370> um

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
back there where the GN drive goes in um

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.699 
back there where the GN drive goes in um
I<00:02:46.459> don't<00:02:47.239> know<00:02:47.390> why<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.840> was<00:02:48.140> gonna<00:02:48.260> paint<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
I don't know why I was gonna paint the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.710 
I don't know why I was gonna paint the
cap<00:02:48.920> instead<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.670> just<00:02:49.790> i'll<00:02:50.090> leave<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.510> i

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
cap instead of just i'll leave it i

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.170 
cap instead of just i'll leave it i
might<00:02:51.350> add<00:02:51.500> something<00:02:51.769> eventually<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:53.150> i

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
might add something eventually but i

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.050 
might add something eventually but i
made<00:02:53.690> little<00:02:53.959> holes<00:02:54.560> i<00:02:54.950> drilled<00:02:55.040> holes<00:02:55.580> for

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
made little holes i drilled holes for

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.470 
made little holes i drilled holes for
the<00:02:56.090> wings<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.959> go<00:02:57.080> in<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:58.150> what<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.269> did<00:02:59.450> was

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the wings to go in and what I did was

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.440 
the wings to go in and what I did was
like<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.110> wings<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.560> stuff<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:01.239> did<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.269> lot

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
like on the wings and stuff I did a lot

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.250 
like on the wings and stuff I did a lot
of<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.750> white<00:03:03.019> shading<00:03:03.590> white<00:03:03.920> panda<00:03:04.280> lining

which was a lot of fun bring her up
close<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.519> can<00:03:10.700> kind<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:10.910> see<00:03:11.060> some<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
close and can kind of see some of the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.830 
close and can kind of see some of the
details<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:12.970> painted<00:03:13.970> some<00:03:14.180> little<00:03:14.390> lines<00:03:14.570> in

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
details I painted some little lines in

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.070 
details I painted some little lines in
the<00:03:14.930> eyes<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:17.180> add<00:03:17.360> on<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.019> whole

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.280 
the eyes and I add on to the whole
cartoony<00:03:21.080> effect<00:03:22.209> into<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.390> chest<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
cartoony effect into the chest and the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.650 
cartoony effect into the chest and the
cutie<00:03:25.190> mark<00:03:25.400> symbol<00:03:25.640> on<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.850> shoulder<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.239> I

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
cutie mark symbol on the shoulder and I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.110 
cutie mark symbol on the shoulder and I
hand<00:03:27.590> painted<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.130> simple<00:03:28.489> here<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:28.880> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
hand painted the simple here on the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.289 
hand painted the simple here on the
condenser<00:03:30.640> um<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:32.540> lot<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.230> white<00:03:33.380> trim<00:03:34.299> yeah

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
condenser um a lot of white trim yeah

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.509 
condenser um a lot of white trim yeah
this<00:03:35.600> isn't<00:03:35.750> perfect<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.860> hair<00:03:37.100> needs<00:03:37.430> a

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
this isn't perfect like the hair needs a

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.860 
this isn't perfect like the hair needs a
little<00:03:37.610> bit<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.850> touching<00:03:38.120> up<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.630> some<00:03:38.810> of

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
little bit of touching up and some of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.300 
little bit of touching up and some of
the<00:03:38.959> lines<00:03:39.200> are<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.470> little<00:03:39.530> bit<00:03:39.799> sloppy<00:03:40.239> but<00:03:41.239> uh

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
the lines are a little bit sloppy but uh

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.270 
the lines are a little bit sloppy but uh
overall<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.400> think<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:43.730> was<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> really<00:03:44.150> fun<00:03:44.420> a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
overall I think this was a really fun a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.140 
overall I think this was a really fun a
lot<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.340> fun<00:03:46.610> making<00:03:46.640> this<00:03:47.060> one<00:03:47.269> um

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
lot of fun making this one um

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.220 
lot of fun making this one um
particulate<00:03:50.470> really<00:03:51.470> really<00:03:52.280> hindered<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
particulate really really hindered the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.140 
particulate really really hindered the
head<00:03:54.410> still<00:03:54.800> he<00:03:55.099> was<00:03:55.459> on<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.610> ball<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:56.000> him

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
head still he was on the ball to him

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.100 
head still he was on the ball to him
everything<00:03:56.890> that's<00:03:57.890> about<00:03:58.069> it<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.550> wings<00:03:59.110> the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
everything that's about it the wings the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.670 
everything that's about it the wings the
wings<00:04:00.140> can<00:04:00.620> fold<00:04:00.860> down<00:04:01.120> like<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.330> but<00:04:03.170> uh<00:04:03.200> I

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
wings can fold down like that but uh I

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.210 
wings can fold down like that but uh I
think<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.160> looks<00:04:04.190> cooler<00:04:04.840> with<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:06.069> picked<00:04:07.069> up

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
think it looks cooler with a picked up

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.589 
think it looks cooler with a picked up
like<00:04:07.430> this<00:04:08.050> um<00:04:09.489> you<00:04:10.489> can<00:04:10.730> move<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.209> legs

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
like this um you can move the legs

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.600 
like this um you can move the legs
around<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.959> little<00:04:12.110> bit<00:04:12.290> they<00:04:12.770> do<00:04:12.920> pop<00:04:13.160> off<00:04:13.400> of

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
around a little bit they do pop off of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.789 
around a little bit they do pop off of
Baldwin's<00:04:16.450> there's<00:04:17.450> articulation<00:04:18.169> here<00:04:18.590> and

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
Baldwin's there's articulation here and

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.870 
Baldwin's there's articulation here and
there<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:19.880> waste<00:04:20.120> articulation<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.430> mean<00:04:22.789> it

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
there is waste articulation so I mean it

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.180 
there is waste articulation so I mean it
moves<00:04:23.030> around<00:04:23.320> fair<00:04:24.320> bit<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.710> mean<00:04:24.919> same

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
moves around fair bit I mean same

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.940 
moves around fair bit I mean same
articulation<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.150> really<00:04:26.300> had<00:04:26.479> before

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
articulation that it really had before

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.080 
articulation that it really had before
um<00:04:27.950> little<00:04:28.700> hindered<00:04:29.320> but<00:04:30.320> not<00:04:30.740> too<00:04:31.160> bad<00:04:32.650> um

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
um little hindered but not too bad um

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.390 
um little hindered but not too bad um
yeah<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:35.479> I<00:04:35.570> guess<00:04:35.720> that's<00:04:35.750> really<00:04:36.500> it<00:04:36.650> I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
yeah but I guess that's really it I

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.310 
yeah but I guess that's really it I
don't<00:04:38.150> really<00:04:38.330> want<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.599> make<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.900> me<00:04:39.050> work<00:04:39.200> in

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
don't really want to make to me work in

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.690 
don't really want to make to me work in
progress<00:04:39.530> videos<00:04:39.979> because<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.310> knew<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.460> lot<00:04:40.640> of
