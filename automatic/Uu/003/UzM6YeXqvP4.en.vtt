you can actually treat the face and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
you can actually treat the face and

example of this would be used to see

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.800 
example of this would be used to see
many<00:03:40.410> companies<00:03:40.919> do<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.430> rolling<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
many companies do the rolling the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.710 
many companies do the rolling the
crosshatch<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.590> sort<00:03:43.799> of<00:03:43.889> Union<00:03:44.340> Jack

crosshatch the sort of Union Jack
formation<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:46.109> rolling<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.130> problem

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
formation of rolling and the problem

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.890 
formation of rolling and the problem
with<00:03:47.549> this<00:03:47.639> of<00:03:47.849> course<00:03:47.880> was<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.450> center<00:03:48.870> of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
with this of course was the center of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.930 
with this of course was the center of
the<00:03:49.079> skin<00:03:49.349> got<00:03:49.560> rolled<00:03:49.829> eight<00:03:50.220> times<00:03:50.519> as<00:03:50.760> much

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
the skin got rolled eight times as much

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.339 
the skin got rolled eight times as much
as<00:03:51.120> all<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.299> surrounding<00:03:51.870> tissue<00:03:52.049> and

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
as all the surrounding tissue and

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.470 
as all the surrounding tissue and
basically<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.340> only<00:03:53.400> worked<00:03:53.760> on<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.030> large

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
basically it only worked on the large

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.940 
basically it only worked on the large
surface<00:03:54.930> areas<00:03:55.200> like<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.440> cheek<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.859> the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
surface areas like the cheek and the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.309 
surface areas like the cheek and the
forehead<00:03:56.370> as<00:03:56.639> we've<00:03:57.299> demonstrated<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:58.109> and

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
forehead as we've demonstrated more and

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.750 
forehead as we've demonstrated more and
more<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.829> only<00:03:58.980> roll<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.400> certain

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
more that you can only roll in certain

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.309 
more that you can only roll in certain
directions<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.389> certain<00:04:00.870> ways<00:04:01.019> across

certain<00:04:01.709> parts<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.160> face<00:04:02.340> we've<00:04:02.970> seen

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
certain parts of the face we've seen

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.119 
certain parts of the face we've seen
these<00:04:03.389> techniques<00:04:03.840> adopted<00:04:04.049> by<00:04:04.620> more<00:04:04.889> and

more groups across the world and it's

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.539 
more groups across the world and it's
been<00:04:07.109> kind<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.560> flattering<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.220> watch<00:04:08.370> that
