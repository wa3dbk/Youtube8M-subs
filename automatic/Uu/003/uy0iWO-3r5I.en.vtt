I<00:01:35.820> guess<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.930> trying<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I guess but you know I'm trying to be a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.929 
I guess but you know I'm trying to be a
little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.130> running<00:01:38.430> back<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
little bit of a running back in the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.850 
little bit of a running back in the
quarterback<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> same<00:01:39.720> time<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.409> then

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
quarterback at the same time and then

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
quarterback at the same time and then
work<00:01:41.009> out<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> recognize

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
work out for me but I here I recognize

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
work out for me but I here I recognize
the<00:01:42.479> read-option<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:43.110> bad<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the read-option was bad because of the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.340 
the read-option was bad because of the
to<00:01:44.790> stack<00:01:45.060> linebackers<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
to stack linebackers right there and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.740 
to stack linebackers right there and
after

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
after

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.020 
after
commit<00:01:47.620> to<00:01:47.650> me<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.100> knocked<00:01:48.490> me<00:01:48.640> out<00:01:48.790> while

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
commit to me and knocked me out while

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.790 
commit to me and knocked me out while
the<00:01:49.150> other<00:01:49.270> committed<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.780> running<00:01:50.020> back<00:01:50.230> but

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
the other committed to running back but

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.110 
the other committed to running back but
anyway<00:01:51.040> I<00:01:51.070> threw<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.370> ball<00:01:51.520> away<00:01:51.700> right<00:01:51.970> here

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
anyway I threw the ball away right here

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.670 
anyway I threw the ball away right here
and<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:52.270> see<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> past<00:01:52.810> got<00:01:53.050> more<00:01:53.200> realistic

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
and I see the past got more realistic

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.590 
and I see the past got more realistic
because<00:01:53.830> not<00:01:54.160> every<00:01:54.460> pass<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.730> perfect<00:01:55.479> and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
because not every pass is perfect and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.560 
because not every pass is perfect and
spot<00:01:55.900> on<00:01:56.080> any<00:01:56.380> more<00:01:56.560> like<00:01:57.160> he<00:01:57.280> used<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.580> be<00:01:57.790> that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
spot on any more like he used to be that

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.360 
spot on any more like he used to be that
was<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.750> big<00:01:59.200> problem<00:01:59.530> with<00:01:59.590> Matt<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.800> every

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
was a big problem with Matt and every

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.010 
was a big problem with Matt and every
single<00:02:00.580> pass<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.120> quarterback<00:02:01.510> dude<00:02:01.720> was<00:02:01.870> he

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
single pass the quarterback dude was he

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.830 
single pass the quarterback dude was he
was<00:02:02.200> spot-on<00:02:02.530> or<00:02:03.180> perfect<00:02:04.180> like<00:02:04.360> nobody

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
was spot-on or perfect like nobody

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.380 
was spot-on or perfect like nobody
missed<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.380> ball<00:02:05.590> or<00:02:05.860> anything<00:02:06.250> no<00:02:07.119> balls

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
missed the ball or anything no balls

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.529 
missed the ball or anything no balls

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
still things to learn right there I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.990 
still things to learn right there I
understood<00:02:46.959> what<00:02:47.170> i<00:02:47.200> did<00:02:47.470> i<00:02:47.560> do<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.580> know

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.340 
understood what i did i do to you know
the<00:02:49.150> guy<00:02:49.300> there<00:02:49.600> was<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> line<00:02:49.930> back<00:02:50.140> right

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
the guy there was a line back right

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.289 
the guy there was a line back right
there<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.830> camera<00:02:51.190> makes<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.030> easier

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
there but this camera makes it easier

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.910 
there but this camera makes it easier
for<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.600> see<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.900> defense<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.620> your

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
for you to see the defense as your

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.640 
for you to see the defense as your
quarterback<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.450> new<00:02:55.570> camera<00:02:55.930> but

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
quarterback so I like the new camera but

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.990 
quarterback so I like the new camera but
as<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.830> see<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.160> running<00:02:57.430> back<00:02:57.549> getting<00:02:57.790> nice

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
as you see the running back getting nice

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.479 
as you see the running back getting nice
yardage<00:02:58.330> on<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.600> run<00:02:58.750> right<00:02:58.959> there<00:02:59.400> it's<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
yardage on the run right there it's a

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.699 
yardage on the run right there it's a
great<00:03:00.700> game<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.269> next<00:03:02.200> video<00:03:02.410> I'm<00:03:02.500> probably

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
great game in next video I'm probably

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.259 
great game in next video I'm probably
