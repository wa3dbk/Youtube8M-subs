you know if you're on the train talking

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.799 
you know if you're on the train talking
to<00:01:02.969> someone<00:01:03.149> off<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> that's<00:01:03.570> awkward

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to someone off it that's awkward

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
to someone off it that's awkward
disabled<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
disabled or not it's just that it's just

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520 
disabled or not it's just that it's just
kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.049> country

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
kind of the way we are in this country

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.899 
kind of the way we are in this country
and<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.950> when<00:01:08.729> there's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and I think that when there's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
and I think that when there's
awkwardness<00:01:09.270> around<00:01:09.450> disability<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.500> when

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
awkwardness around disability and when

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
awkwardness around disability and when
you<00:01:10.710> meet<00:01:10.920> somebody<00:01:11.159> different<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you meet somebody different for the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
you meet somebody different for the
first<00:01:12.240> time<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.720> something<00:01:12.990> different<00:01:13.439> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
first time you see something different I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
first time you see something different I
think<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.310> our<00:01:14.490> human<00:01:14.700> nature<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
think it's our human nature just to be a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
think it's our human nature just to be a
little<00:01:15.930> bit<00:01:16.140> curious<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.159> same<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> know

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
showing this this issue in a bit of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.260 
showing this this issue in a bit of
light<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:31.950> also<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.220> kind<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.820> making<00:02:33.000> people

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
light but also to kind of making people

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.240 
light but also to kind of making people
realize<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.110> know<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:34.890> one

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
realize that you know it is just one

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.130 
realize that you know it is just one
aspect<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.790> person's<00:02:36.120> personality<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.690> you

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
aspect of a person's personality and you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.020 
aspect of a person's personality and you
can<00:02:37.470> move<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.860> from<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.310> there<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.730> don't

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
can move on from it and there is I don't

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.490 
can move on from it and there is I don't
think<00:02:39.300> there's<00:02:39.420> no<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:40.020> somebody<00:02:40.350> said<00:02:40.470> to

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
think there's no like somebody said to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.740 
think there's no like somebody said to
me<00:02:40.590> right<00:02:40.800> what<00:02:41.310> are<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.520> rules<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:42.210> meeting<00:02:42.630> a

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
me right what are the rules of meeting a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
me right what are the rules of meeting a
disabled<00:02:43.410> person<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.860> wouldn't<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.760> tell

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
you and that's coming from because it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.180 
you and that's coming from because it
didn't

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
didn't

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.980 
didn't
I<00:02:47.220> suppose<00:02:47.550> difficulty<00:02:47.970> what<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.510> seems<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.870> be

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
I suppose difficulty what it seems to be

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.810 
I suppose difficulty what it seems to be
certainly<00:02:49.320> from<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.530> film<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.550> becomes

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
certainly from the film is it becomes

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.690 
certainly from the film is it becomes
the<00:02:50.970> overriding<00:02:51.450> topic<00:02:52.230> oh<00:02:52.350> yeah<00:02:52.740> not<00:02:53.370> only<00:02:53.580> is

little bit more open and maybe not

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.689 
little bit more open and maybe not
overcompensate<00:04:52.229> but<00:04:52.409> you've<00:04:52.560> got<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.919> kind<00:04:53.580> of

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
overcompensate but you've got to kind of

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.909 
overcompensate but you've got to kind of
put<00:04:53.879> people<00:04:54.240> at<00:04:54.360> ease<00:04:54.449> and<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.139> that's<00:04:55.650> just
