pounds<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.110> was<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.560> surprised<00:01:59.009> because

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
pounds so I was really surprised because

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.520 
pounds so I was really surprised because
when<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> opened<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.329> was<00:02:00.540> half<00:02:00.869> full<00:02:01.259> or

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
when I opened it it was half full or

when I opened it it was half full or
half<00:02:01.619> empty<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.450> weird<00:02:03.780> because

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
half empty so it's really weird because

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.050 
half empty so it's really weird because
I<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.649> know<00:02:04.710> why<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.790> could

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
I don't know why they do that they could

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.930 
I don't know why they do that they could
have<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.210> made<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> jar<00:02:07.110> smaller<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.920> um<00:02:08.190> I
