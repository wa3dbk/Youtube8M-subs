00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:48.990 

Oh

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.400 

well<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.030> didn't<00:01:50.450> think<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.720> would<00:01:50.840> be<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.230> to

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
well I didn't think it would be in to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.570 
well I didn't think it would be in to
tease<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.680> pointe<00:01:51.860> shoes<00:01:52.070> let's<00:01:52.280> put<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.550> that

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
tease and pointe shoes let's put it that

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.760 
tease and pointe shoes let's put it that
way<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.420> didn't<00:01:53.900> know<00:01:54.170> we<00:01:54.380> would<00:01:54.500> be<00:01:54.650> doing

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
way so I didn't know we would be doing

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.950 
way so I didn't know we would be doing
such<00:01:55.100> classical<00:01:55.640> work<00:01:55.820> showing<00:01:56.360> football

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
such classical work showing football

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.510 
such classical work showing football
like<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.320> was<00:01:57.440> like<00:01:57.590> okay<00:01:58.010> well<00:01:58.190> would<00:01:58.280> be<00:01:58.430> in

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
like I was like okay well would be in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.700 
like I was like okay well would be in
you<00:01:58.820> know<00:01:58.850> trainers<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.600> doing<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.930> but<00:02:00.200> so

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
you know trainers and doing this but so

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.050 
you know trainers and doing this but so
I<00:02:00.740> didn't<00:02:01.010> see<00:02:01.190> how<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.490> would<00:02:01.580> come<00:02:01.760> together

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
I didn't see how it would come together

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.000 
I didn't see how it would come together
but<00:02:02.330> actually<00:02:02.720> doing<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.050> process<00:02:03.470> it's

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
but actually doing the process it's

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.340 
but actually doing the process it's
worked<00:02:04.370> so<00:02:04.580> well<00:02:04.760> because<00:02:05.000> we're<00:02:05.390> dancing<00:02:06.080> and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
worked so well because we're dancing and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.980 
worked so well because we're dancing and
also<00:02:07.310> telling<00:02:07.580> these<00:02:07.820> showing<00:02:08.600> these<00:02:08.690> moments

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
also telling these showing these moments

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:23.090 
also telling these showing these moments
and<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.500> just<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.830> don't<00:02:09.950> know<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.220> just<00:02:10.250> works

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.760 

I<00:02:23.160> think<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> two<00:02:24.120> disciplines<00:02:24.660> match<00:02:25.440> quite

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
I think the two disciplines match quite

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.340 
I think the two disciplines match quite
well<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.460> all<00:02:26.610> about<00:02:26.820> movement<00:02:27.090> about<00:02:27.600> being

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
well it's all about movement about being

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.140 
well it's all about movement about being
up<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.830> moving<00:02:29.430> around<00:02:29.460> with<00:02:29.790> youth<00:02:29.940> groups

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
up and moving around with youth groups

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.670 
up and moving around with youth groups
the<00:02:30.420> same<00:02:30.570> as<00:02:30.720> ballet<00:02:30.900> okay<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:31.440> as

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the same as ballet okay it's not as

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.130 
the same as ballet okay it's not as
refined<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.280> bad

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.870 

my<00:02:37.680> daughter's<00:02:38.040> did<00:02:38.160> ballet<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.610> my<00:02:38.700> son
