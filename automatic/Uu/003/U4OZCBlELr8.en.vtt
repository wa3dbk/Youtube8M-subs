whenever we pass one another on the road
we<00:00:30.000> wave<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:31.439> did<00:00:32.099> seem<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.730> most

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
them in the same direction you waved it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.459 
them in the same direction you waved it
would<00:00:42.000> look<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.270> goodbye<00:00:42.719> wave<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
would look like a goodbye wave you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.810 
would look like a goodbye wave you
wave<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:43.829> faster<00:00:44.160> than<00:00:44.190> your<00:00:44.399> wave<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
wave I'm faster than your wave and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
wave I'm faster than your wave and
that's<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.210> too<00:00:45.420> polite<00:00:45.920> but<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.129> see

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that's not too polite but if you see

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.110 
that's not too polite but if you see
someone<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> opposite<00:00:48.059> direction

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
someone go in the opposite direction

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680 
someone go in the opposite direction
it's<00:00:48.570> perfectly<00:00:48.870> fine<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> wave<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:49.590> them

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's perfectly fine to wave at them

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.370 
it's perfectly fine to wave at them
and<00:00:51.780> there<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.440> different<00:00:52.680> types<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.920> ways

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
and there are different types of ways

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.920 
and there are different types of ways
for<00:00:54.830> example

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.010 

for<00:01:00.440> example<00:01:00.860> sports<00:01:01.160> bike<00:01:01.400> riders<00:01:02.020> friendly

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
for example sports bike riders friendly

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.470 
for example sports bike riders friendly
bunch<00:01:03.200> and<00:01:03.560> their<00:01:03.890> waves<00:01:04.120> and<00:01:05.120> there's<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.360> few

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
bunch and their waves and there's a few

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.480 
bunch and their waves and there's a few
different<00:01:05.780> types<00:01:05.810> actually<00:01:06.250> sometimes<00:01:07.250> I'll

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
different types actually sometimes I'll

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.550 
different types actually sometimes I'll
just<00:01:07.760> put<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.330> hand<00:01:08.630> out<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.050> side<00:01:09.170> like

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
just put a hand out to the side like

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.810 
just put a hand out to the side like
this

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.540 
this
just<00:01:11.330> put<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.480> hand<00:01:11.750> out<00:01:12.400> sometimes<00:01:13.400> they'll

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
just put a hand out sometimes they'll

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.060 
just put a hand out sometimes they'll
actually<00:01:13.670> wave

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 

if<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> corner<00:01:18.120> and<00:01:18.330> they're<00:01:18.450> cornering

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
if it's a corner and they're cornering

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.649 
if it's a corner and they're cornering
it's<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.170> little

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
it's a little

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.289 
it's a little
saves<00:01:19.930> Victor<00:01:20.320> hands<00:01:20.649> off<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.009> handlebars

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
saves Victor hands off the handlebars

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.999 
saves Victor hands off the handlebars
see<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.329> always<00:01:22.780> keep<00:01:22.930> both<00:01:23.110> hands<00:01:23.380> on<00:01:23.649> corners

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
see I always keep both hands on corners

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.469 
see I always keep both hands on corners
like<00:01:24.189> this<00:01:24.340> one<00:01:24.549> right<00:01:24.670> here<00:01:24.939> is<00:01:25.240> you<00:01:25.329> gotta

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
like this one right here is you gotta

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.810 
like this one right here is you gotta
lean

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.640 

and<00:01:27.910> that's<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.390> pretty<00:01:28.600> sharp<00:01:29.020> turn<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.560> you'd

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
and that's a pretty sharp turn and you'd

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.170 
and that's a pretty sharp turn and you'd
be<00:01:29.770> stupid<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.220> take<00:01:30.370> your<00:01:30.520> hand<00:01:30.730> off<00:01:30.850> for<00:01:31.060> this

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
be stupid to take your hand off for this

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.320 
be stupid to take your hand off for this
one<00:01:31.240> so

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
one so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.480 
one so
I'd<00:01:32.810> take<00:01:33.170> both<00:01:33.380> hands<00:01:33.620> on<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:34.010> one<00:01:34.250> for

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
I'd take both hands on this one for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.890 
I'd take both hands on this one for
certain

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
certain

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.070 
certain
but<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:38.210> if<00:01:38.330> you're<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.600> corner<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.020> that

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
but so if you're on the corner like that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.320 
but so if you're on the corner like that
and<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:40.250> want<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.520> keep<00:01:40.640> both<00:01:40.760> hands<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
and you want to keep both hands on the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.550 
and you want to keep both hands on the
wheel<00:01:41.420> on

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
wheel on

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
wheel on
especially<00:01:43.190> ones<00:01:43.490> like<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:43.760> especially

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.889 

and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.219> can<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.490> nod<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> person

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and then you can just nod at the person

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.179 
and then you can just nod at the person
a<00:01:49.049> nod<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.590> fine

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
a nod is fine

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.999 
a nod is fine
it's<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:50.969> a<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.289> polite<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it's not as a it's not as polite as a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.240 
it's not as a it's not as polite as a
wave<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.000> acceptable<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.250> safety

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
wave but it's acceptable and safety

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.179 
wave but it's acceptable and safety
comes<00:01:56.430> first

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
comes first

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.069 
comes first
so<00:01:58.759> when<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.179> see<00:01:59.329> someone<00:01:59.539> you<00:01:59.689> guys<00:01:59.810> nod

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
so when you see someone you guys nod

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.200 
so when you see someone you guys nod
your<00:02:00.380> head<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.829> they'll<00:02:01.189> see<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
your head and they'll see it it's a

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.100 
your head and they'll see it it's a
couple<00:02:03.020> two<00:02:03.170> away

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.310 

yeah

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
yeah

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.990 
yeah
so<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.800> general<00:02:09.010> the<00:02:09.250> motorcyclists<00:02:09.910> they

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
so in general the motorcyclists they

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.910 
so in general the motorcyclists they
just<00:02:10.150> either<00:02:10.330> they<00:02:10.720> either<00:02:10.780> actually<00:02:11.380> wave<00:02:11.590> or

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
just either they either actually wave or

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.330 
just either they either actually wave or
they<00:02:12.040> put<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.310> hand<00:02:12.610> out<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.970> side

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
they put a hand out to the side

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.950 
they put a hand out to the side
Harley<00:02:15.340> riders<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> other<00:02:16.270> hand<00:02:16.569> have<00:02:16.930> a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
Harley riders on the other hand have a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.130 
Harley riders on the other hand have a
sort<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.380> different<00:02:17.530> way

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
sort of a different way

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.250 
sort of a different way
therefore<00:02:20.140> no<00:02:20.769> waves<00:02:21.010> among<00:02:21.220> casual<00:02:21.819> nor<00:02:22.299> cool

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
therefore no waves among casual nor cool

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.380 
therefore no waves among casual nor cool
they'll<00:02:24.739> have<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.129> just<00:02:25.370> put<00:02:25.550> one<00:02:25.819> hand<00:02:26.180> out

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
they'll have to just put one hand out

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.539 
they'll have to just put one hand out

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.789 
this
they<00:02:29.750> keep<00:02:29.930> below<00:02:30.200> they<00:02:30.440> don't<00:02:30.590> put<00:02:30.709> it

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
they keep below they don't put it

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.199
