made from a matte material which does

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.069 
made from a matte material which does
two<00:00:47.070> things<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.789> prevents<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> case<00:00:48.899> from

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
two things one prevents the case from

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.619 
two things one prevents the case from
being<00:00:49.289> scratched<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.190> glossy<00:00:50.460> cases<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.360> and

no case on your phone at all obviously

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
no case on your phone at all obviously
that<00:01:06.990> means<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> won't<00:01:07.590> offer<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that means this won't offer much in the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
that means this won't offer much in the
way<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.640> drop<00:01:09.030> protection<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.290> offer

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
way of drop protection but it will offer

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.100 
way of drop protection but it will offer
protection<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.369> surface<00:01:11.880> scratching<00:01:12.390> small

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
protection from surface scratching small

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.690 
protection from surface scratching small
bumps<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.619> dings<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.460> what's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
bumps and dings and that's really what's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
bumps and dings and that's really what's
most<00:01:14.909> important<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> me<00:01:15.780> knock<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.530> wood<00:01:16.830> I'm

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
most important to me knock on wood I'm

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
most important to me knock on wood I'm
not<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> person<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.090> drops<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.540> phone<00:01:18.810> very

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
not a person that drops my phone very

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.600 
not a person that drops my phone very
often<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.070> count<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.460> hand

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
often I think I can count on one hand

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.330 
often I think I can count on one hand
the<00:01:20.909> number<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.180> times<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.689> happened<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
the number of times it's happened and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
the number of times it's happened and
therefore<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.549> don't<00:01:23.790> need<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> super

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
therefore I don't need a super

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
therefore I don't need a super
protective<00:01:24.960> case<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.650> need<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> case

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
protective case what I do need is a case

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.710 
protective case what I do need is a case
that<00:01:26.549> protects<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:26.970> phone<00:01:27.210> wallets<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.630> my
