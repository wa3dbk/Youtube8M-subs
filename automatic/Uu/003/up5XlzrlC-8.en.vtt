00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
actually gets a full face helmet rating

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.860 
actually gets a full face helmet rating
and<00:00:14.670> not<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.179> three-quarter<00:00:15.630> helmet

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870

and not just a three-quarter helmet
rating<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.230> most<00:00:16.470> modulars<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> market

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510

ear<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> ear<00:00:26.060> first<00:00:27.060> you'll<00:00:27.240> notice<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
ear to ear first you'll notice on the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.509 
ear to ear first you'll notice on the
since<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> modular<00:00:28.859> has<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> flip<00:00:29.310> open

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
since it is a modular has a flip open

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.209 
since it is a modular has a flip open
face<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:31.140> button<00:00:31.410> underneath<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> helmet<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
face the button underneath the helmet is

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.389 
face the button underneath the helmet is
super<00:00:32.579> easy<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> operate<00:00:33.000> even<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> have

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
super easy to operate even if you have

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.160

thick touring gloves on or something big

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.330 
thick touring gloves on or something big
on<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:37.410> hands<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:38.370> flips<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.850> easier<00:00:39.570> so

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
on your hands just flips up easier so

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.360 
on your hands just flips up easier so
there's<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.520> internal<00:00:42.030> visor<00:00:43.250> which<00:00:44.250> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
there's an internal visor which is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.340 
there's an internal visor which is
operated<00:00:44.789> from<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.059> switch<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> side<00:00:46.230> right

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
operated from a switch to the side right

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.400 
operated from a switch to the side right
here<00:00:46.789> one<00:00:47.789> cool<00:00:47.940> thing<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.989> modulars

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
here one cool thing about the modulars

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
here one cool thing about the modulars
you<00:00:49.649> don't<00:00:50.000> find<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.300> lot<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> other<00:00:51.719> helmets

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you don't find in a lot of other helmets

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.619 
you don't find in a lot of other helmets
is<00:00:52.489> if<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.940> visor<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
is if you have the visor up on the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.799 
is if you have the visor up on the
helmet<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.829> decide<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.640> lift<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
helmet and you decide to lift up the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
helmet and you decide to lift up the
chin<00:00:58.020> bar<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.710> actually<00:00:58.980> will<00:00:59.100> close<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
chin bar it actually will close the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.369 
chin bar it actually will close the
visor<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> take<00:01:01.199> off

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
visor for you so if you go to take off

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.549 
visor for you so if you go to take off
there's<00:01:01.649> no<00:01:01.940> wind<00:01:02.940> getting<00:01:03.480> caught<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
there's no wind getting caught up in the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
there's no wind getting caught up in the
chin<00:01:04.769> bar<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.369> causing<00:01:05.729> buffeting

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
chin bar out there and causing buffeting

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
chin bar out there and causing buffeting
on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.990> neck<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.830> pins<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.189> the

locking system our metal and hook system
it's<00:01:11.880> kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.060> identical<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.680> an

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's kind of identical to like an
