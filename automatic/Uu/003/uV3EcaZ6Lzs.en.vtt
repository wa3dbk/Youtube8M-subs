you<00:00:02.190> know<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.790> house<00:00:03.030> looks<00:00:03.270> pretty<00:00:03.540> cool

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
you know this house looks pretty cool

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.040 
you know this house looks pretty cool
except<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.680> lon<00:00:05.009> she's<00:00:05.460> not<00:00:05.609> doing<00:00:05.910> well<00:00:06.120> oh

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.299 

yeah<00:00:10.050> that's<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.500> lot<00:00:10.769> better<00:00:13.099> now<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.250> is

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
yeah that's a lot better now this is

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.500 
yeah that's a lot better now this is
just<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.969> little<00:00:15.690> simple<00:00:15.900> lawnmower<00:00:16.830> design

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
just a little simple lawnmower design

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.599 
just a little simple lawnmower design
just<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.630> two<00:00:18.779> dispensers<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.949> water

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
bucket in each and all the wines on the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.750 
bucket in each and all the wines on the
ground<00:00:24.300> as<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.689> can<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:25.050> well<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> can't

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
ground as you can see well as you can't

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.410

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.100 
see and yeah go ahead and show you guys
the<00:00:30.630> wiring<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.540> we've<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.899> got<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the wiring so here we've just got a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
the wiring so here we've just got a
simple<00:00:34.530> edge<00:00:34.710> detector<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.300> basic

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
simple edge detector just your basic

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.319 
simple edge detector just your basic
edge<00:00:36.870> detector<00:00:37.440> piston<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> block<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
edge detector piston with a block a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.380 
edge detector piston with a block a
sticky<00:00:40.140> piston<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:41.280> our<00:00:41.430> repeater<00:00:41.820> facing

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
sticky piston with our repeater facing

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.700 
sticky piston with our repeater facing
that<00:00:42.809> away<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:44.420> rests<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.660> wiring<00:00:45.930> coming

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that away and rests on wiring coming

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
that away and rests on wiring coming
over<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.190> block<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.780> block<00:00:49.079> is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
over this block and now this block is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.840 
over this block and now this block is
really<00:00:49.530> essential<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.730> know

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
really essential because it's you know

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.549 
really essential because it's you know
it's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.360> basic<00:00:51.750> design<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> edge

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it's the basic design of the edge

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
it's the basic design of the edge
detector<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.850> piston<00:00:54.270> extends<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.989> cuts

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
detector this piston extends and cuts

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.819 
detector this piston extends and cuts
off<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.969> wiring<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:57.899> after

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
off the are the wiring here which after

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.400 
off the are the wiring here which after
the<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.160> pulse<00:00:59.460> goes<00:00:59.789> out<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the first pulse goes out and then as it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.280 
the first pulse goes out and then as it
retracts<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.699> are<00:01:02.940> let's<00:01:03.449> through<00:01:03.840> another

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
retracts they are let's through another

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.140 
retracts they are let's through another
tiny<00:01:04.589> second<00:01:05.070> pulse<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.729> retracts

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
tiny second pulse which then retracts

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
tiny second pulse which then retracts
the<00:01:06.270> water<00:01:06.600> buckets<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:08.040> into<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> yard

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the water buckets back into the yard

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.880 
the water buckets back into the yard
dispensers<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> first<00:01:10.260> pulse<00:01:10.590> comes

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
dispensers so the first pulse comes

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.960 
dispensers so the first pulse comes
through<00:01:12.110> ejects<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> water<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.369> second

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
through ejects the water and then second

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.120 
through ejects the water and then second
pulse<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> piston<00:01:16.409> retracts<00:01:19.130> brings

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
pulse when the piston retracts brings

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
pulse when the piston retracts brings
the<00:01:20.280> water<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.299> into<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the water back into the into the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.969 
the water back into the into the
dispensers<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.960> wiring<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.770> just

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
dispensers so this wiring up here just

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.749 
dispensers so this wiring up here just
runs<00:01:26.610> around<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:28.310> button<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
runs around to the button here in the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.140 
runs around to the button here in the
garage<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.600> garage<00:01:30.689> area<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.820> push

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
garage in the garage area so you push

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:42.080 
garage in the garage area so you push
that<00:01:34.159> goes<00:01:35.159> down<00:01:36.979> extends<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> piston<00:01:41.090> cuts

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that goes down extends the piston cuts

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
that goes down extends the piston cuts
off<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> wiring<00:01:42.899> yeah<00:01:43.619> I'll<00:01:43.740> try<00:01:43.920> show<00:01:44.189> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
off the wiring yeah I'll try show you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.789 
off the wiring yeah I'll try show you
guys<00:01:49.430> see<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.229> sends<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> first

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
guys see that so it sends the first

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.310 
guys see that so it sends the first
pulse<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.899> retracts<00:01:57.320> see

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
pulse out and then as that retracts see

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.260 
pulse out and then as that retracts see
it<00:01:58.439> tight<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.829> sends<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.250> tiny<00:01:59.610> little<00:01:59.790> pulse

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it tight it sends that tiny little pulse

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.830 
it tight it sends that tiny little pulse
out<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:01.560> attracts<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.159> water<00:02:02.840> so

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
out that's what attracts the water so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.109 
out that's what attracts the water so
this<00:02:04.110> redstone<00:02:04.500> wiring<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> repeater

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
this redstone wiring just put a repeater

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.190 
this redstone wiring just put a repeater
in<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.810> safe<00:02:07.079> safe<00:02:07.799> measures<00:02:09.200> runs

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
in here just for safe safe measures runs

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.050 
in here just for safe safe measures runs
around<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.739> another<00:02:10.950> repeater<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> block

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
around to another repeater to the block

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.840 
around to another repeater to the block
and<00:02:12.390> then

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
and then

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
and then
the<00:02:12.970> dispenser<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.200> same<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.100> other<00:02:15.130> side

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the dispenser and same on the other side

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.510 
the dispenser and same on the other side
so<00:02:16.870> fairly<00:02:17.230> simple<00:02:17.680> fairly<00:02:18.220> easy<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:21.010> it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
so fairly simple fairly easy and it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.700 
so fairly simple fairly easy and it
looks<00:02:21.670> good<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:24.040> yeah<00:02:25.500> thanks<00:02:26.500> guys<00:02:26.680> for

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
looks good so yeah thanks guys for

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.950 
looks good so yeah thanks guys for
watching
