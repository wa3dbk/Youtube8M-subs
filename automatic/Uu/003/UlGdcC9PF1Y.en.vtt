00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.350
 You have also seen a defeat for a long time 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 was not good 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.569
 how do you think that is 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:12.619
 at 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.119
 I think the lines 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.119
 neither does the fold-out in midfield 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.100
 the stadium of psv could stunt to have entrance but because the mother to walk 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.239
 be our law 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.640
 funny and mental 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.289
 found out with the fan 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.099
 certainly in the first half 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.569
 stop this school from playing soccer 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.569
 that is not the most ideal for everyone not I think and that 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.820
 because it wasn't good enough but strangely enough it came to 2 0 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 penalty of psv still a lot of chances of juliana 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 the Netherlands the chance of success and ended up on the pole 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.670
 besides a little luck, two trainers may well be the Dutch wesame 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.830
 that does not happen and the customers could afford 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.740
 they are known on Friday 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.180
 if no there are just drop a number of times yes but good 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.960
 We conclude that we have a strong team 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.570
 Take the self-employed who unlearned right about things like this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.640
 have an opinion in public 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.900
 well 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.280
 so is not so much the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.500
 I got up to say that it was already there 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.670
 come 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.680
 We must above all look at ourselves which is very important of course still got 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740
 a chance 4 may I say so 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 morales wants to know can leave 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.140
 I should have taken on my own to buy a label from one 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.160
 grocery store 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.270
 good against it 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.850
 when your house is ready to stand in and by three and that is not 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.500
 ideal 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.570
 it is no different that you think it is logical that you are a substitute 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.550
 but i expect collin playing 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 finished was just a point of rest in the team so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.580
 then I have nothing to say about that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.640
 so you can use it army yes this moment certainly have these guests 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.300
 what should I do with you because they want and bunch the situation of 19 but it is 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 indeed this is a very large audience still direct 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.650
 although 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.420
 in the sense that it somewhat knocked out a topper 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.260
 that is annoying and that is 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.139
 not far from ideal power 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.639
 shortly thereafter also just preses before they are touched and so 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.449
 after that, just have to adjust to see for yourself 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.359
 how far that will come
