the NFL let alone even other sports I
see<00:02:00.460> these<00:02:00.640> teams<00:02:00.939> playing<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:01.600> many

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
see these teams playing in so many

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.810 
see these teams playing in so many
pivotal<00:02:02.320> games<00:02:02.560> late<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.100> season<00:02:03.310> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
pivotal games late in the season the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.550 
pivotal games late in the season the
Packers<00:02:04.180> have<00:02:04.330> kind<00:02:04.540> of<00:02:04.570> dominated<00:02:05.049> recently

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
Packers have kind of dominated recently

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.649 
Packers have kind of dominated recently
but<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.920> Bears<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.880> know<00:02:06.970> have<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.330> division

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
but the Bears you know have the division

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.940 
but the Bears you know have the division
lead<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:07.869> year<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.560> will<00:02:08.649> make<00:02:08.769> their

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
lead this year and that will make their

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.880 
lead this year and that will make their
mashup<00:02:09.369> week<00:02:10.030> 15<00:02:10.479> big<00:02:11.230> one<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.590> probably

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
mashup week 15 big one and probably

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.350 
mashup week 15 big one and probably
pretty<00:02:12.220> fiery<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.790> think<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.240> sometimes

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
pretty fiery I think that sometimes

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.830 
pretty fiery I think that sometimes
rivalries<00:02:14.020> are<00:02:14.050> more<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.500> failure

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
rivalries are more for the failure

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.509 
rivalries are more for the failure
but<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.200> believe<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.769> these<00:02:16.010> two<00:02:16.250> teams

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
but I believe that these two teams

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.750 
but I believe that these two teams
believe<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.890> biggest<00:02:19.220> rivalry

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
believe that this is the biggest rivalry

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520 
believe that this is the biggest rivalry
in<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.910> game<00:02:20.090> today<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.540> they<00:02:20.629> act<00:02:21.200> like<00:02:21.319> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
in the game today and they act like it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.720 
in the game today and they act like it
wasn't<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.890> field<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.190> there's<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.489> no

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
wasn't on the field that there's just no

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.030 
wasn't on the field that there's just no
better<00:02:22.940> experience<00:02:23.599> there's<00:02:23.840> no<00:02:24.019> more<00:02:24.260> mutual

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
better experience there's no more mutual

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.250 
better experience there's no more mutual
respect<00:02:25.519> between<00:02:25.610> fans<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.569> there's<00:02:27.110> no

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
respect between fans and there's no

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.110 
respect between fans and there's no
greater<00:02:27.500> history<00:02:27.920> as<00:02:28.040> i<00:02:28.160> mentioned<00:02:28.519> i'm<00:02:28.940> going

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
to put a different spin on this for the

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.650
