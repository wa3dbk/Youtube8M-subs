you that when you do have a toe bar

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.000 
you that when you do have a toe bar
fitted<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.840> reverse<00:00:22.230> sensors<00:00:22.740> will

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
fitted not all reverse sensors will

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.939 
fitted not all reverse sensors will
actually<00:00:24.050> disabled<00:00:25.050> or<00:00:25.230> will<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> tow

actually disabled or will see the tow
bar<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> car<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:28.800> wanted

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
bar on on the car so just really wanted

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.410 
bar on on the car so just really wanted
to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> quick<00:00:29.519> video<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
to do a quick video because it's a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
to do a quick video because it's a
question<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.990> constantly<00:00:31.500> getting<00:00:31.769> asked

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
question I'm constantly getting asked

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.549 
question I'm constantly getting asked
will<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:33.149> my<00:00:33.360> reverse<00:00:33.719> sensors<00:00:34.140> work<00:00:34.320> with

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
will will my reverse sensors work with

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.340 
will will my reverse sensors work with
the<00:00:34.680> tow<00:00:34.860> bar<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:36.059> sat<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> cabin<00:00:37.260> at

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the tow bar so I'm sat in the cabin at

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.660 
the tow bar so I'm sat in the cabin at
the<00:00:37.410> moment<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.340> swap<00:00:38.520> over

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the moment I'm going to just swap over

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.770 
the moment I'm going to just swap over
to<00:00:38.899> two<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> other<00:00:40.980> camera<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
to two to the other camera if I can and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.319 
to two to the other camera if I can and
so<00:00:43.770> i'm<00:00:44.070> sat<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> dashboard<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:47.329> we

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so i'm sat in the dashboard here and we

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.580 
so i'm sat in the dashboard here and we
put<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> ignition<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:51.140> then<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.260> put<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
put the ignition on and then we put the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
put the ignition on and then we put the
car<00:00:52.800> into<00:00:53.039> reverse<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.899> hear<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
car into reverse and you can hear a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.869 
car into reverse and you can hear a
bleep<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.710> from<00:00:58.949> coming<00:00:59.399> from<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> back

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
bleep it from coming from the back

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.760 
bleep it from coming from the back
basically<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.260> telling<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
basically that's just telling you that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.369 
basically that's just telling you that
the<00:01:02.129> car's<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.510> car's<00:01:03.899> gone<00:01:04.110> into

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the car's got the the car's gone into

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.789 
the car's got the the car's gone into
gear<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.930> sensors<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.590> on

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
gear and that the the sensors are all on

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.160 
gear and that the the sensors are all on
and<00:01:08.070> working<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> constant<00:01:09.869> tone

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and working if there was a constant tone

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.070 
and working if there was a constant tone
it<00:01:10.830> would<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.570> recognizing<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> tow<00:01:12.840> bar

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it would be recognizing the tow bar

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.050 
it would be recognizing the tow bar
which<00:01:13.799> obviously<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.549> hear<00:01:14.880> there

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
which obviously as you can hear there

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
which obviously as you can hear there
isn't<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.259> walk<00:01:16.470> towards

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
isn't so I'm just going to walk towards

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.270 
isn't so I'm just going to walk towards
the<00:01:16.950> back<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> car

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.410 

and<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.380> can<00:01:26.530> probably<00:01:26.590> hear<00:01:27.189> as<00:01:28.060> soon<00:01:28.299> as

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
and as you can probably hear as soon as

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.280 
and as you can probably hear as soon as
I<00:01:28.570> walk<00:01:28.780> up<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.710> one<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:29.979> these<00:01:30.100> sensors<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
I walk up to to one of these sensors the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.789 
I walk up to to one of these sensors the
the<00:01:32.920> car<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.970> showing

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the car is is showing

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.719 
the car is is showing
so<00:01:35.799> there's<00:01:36.280> your<00:01:36.430> tow<00:01:36.640> bar<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.490> walk

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
so there's your tow bar and if I walk

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.700 
so there's your tow bar and if I walk
around<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.360> can<00:01:40.479> see<00:01:40.659> scents<00:01:41.080> are<00:01:41.200> very<00:01:41.440> very

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
around you can see scents are very very

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.080 
around you can see scents are very very
close<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.649> seven<00:01:44.979> pin<00:01:45.190> socket<00:01:45.909> for

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
close to the to the seven pin socket for

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.450 
close to the to the seven pin socket for
the<00:01:46.180> tow<00:01:46.330> bar<00:01:46.539> electrics<00:01:47.080> but<00:01:47.920> it's<00:01:48.250> all

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
the tow bar electrics but it's all

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.520 
the tow bar electrics but it's all
working<00:01:48.700> he's<00:01:49.299> picking<00:01:49.659> me<00:01:49.690> up<00:01:49.840> as<00:01:50.229> I'm

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
working he's picking me up as I'm

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.950 
working he's picking me up as I'm
walking<00:01:50.710> towards<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:55.690> go

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
walking towards it and there you go

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.669 
walking towards it and there you go
you've<00:01:56.710> got<00:01:56.890> me<00:01:57.039> stood<00:01:57.310> round<00:01:58.119> about<00:01:58.679> 12

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
you've got me stood round about 12

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.910 
you've got me stood round about 12
inches<00:01:59.860> or<00:02:00.190> so<00:02:00.369> from<00:02:01.179> from<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.600> tow<00:02:01.750> bar<00:02:01.990> so

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
inches or so from from the tow bar so

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.899 
inches or so from from the tow bar so
hopefully<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:04.000> will<00:02:05.220> clear<00:02:06.220> up<00:02:06.460> quite<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> few

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
hopefully that will clear up quite a few

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.330 
hopefully that will clear up quite a few
issues<00:02:07.030> or<00:02:07.869> using<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.470> correct<00:02:08.739> parking

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
issues or using the correct parking

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.100 
issues or using the correct parking
sensors<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.119> actually<00:02:10.630> have<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> toe<00:02:11.080> bar

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
sensors you can actually have a toe bar

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.640 
sensors you can actually have a toe bar
fitted<00:02:11.769> with<00:02:12.040> new<00:02:12.069> parking<00:02:12.819> sensors<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.330> well

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
fitted with new parking sensors as well

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.100 
fitted with new parking sensors as well
