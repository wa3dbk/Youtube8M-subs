 secret of the yucca but first of all 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.200
 I have to ask you a question 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.869
 once you've played minecraft player 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.390
 asked if the anvil serve to 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.390
 something more than to fix objects 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.910
 useless as with wood or to put 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.579
 slightly stupid names to your street 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.730

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.730

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.670

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.409
 of sight or the little lamb, how beautiful you want

 It's good to follow Fredo come, nothing happens 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.340
 good guys, so today's tutorial 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.140
 consists of as I said in anvil if 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.789
 it's a pretty curious door but 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.020
 see what the hell this your heart needs 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.020
 action fuck action 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.440
 and good guys first of all we'll have 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 what to put 2 chubb that is one on top of 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.490
 another and right next to these cassava 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 this from Moscow that as you see on the screen 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 and so magically come in is inside you 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.580
 of the bukis, my mother, how much do I say 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.440
 I can see spectacular yuki not 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.880
 Actually I am a hacker and good as 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.680
 you can see on the screen you can shoot 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.630
 arrows out of a cheese commanding is not a 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.090
 little but then you can hide or if 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.980
 As you can see the arrows do not give you this 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.170
 means you can use this type 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.000
 of coordination as booker in the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.380
 pvp battles and good as you see if 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.610
 you want to go to the other side, stay 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.770
 go back inside the anvil 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.870
 you have to do it again and good as 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.060
 You see it's quite simple but there are times 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.130
 that you need practice since it's not 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.410
 so easy sometimes frustrates me super 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.410
 fruit and the cerebral centrals 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.350
 yes, the fart everything sounds very 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.050
 great but where is the secret door 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.090
 who was promising us by look at their 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.230
 paladins in front of you the only thing that 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.000
 you have to do is what has 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.090
 taught to you and all your classmates 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.220
 youtube with the anvil move for the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.950
 left look for the side and 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.810
 but if you were a son of a bitch, this is not 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.490
 you can make a friend and the worst of 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.940
 it is that I'll put creative 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.200
