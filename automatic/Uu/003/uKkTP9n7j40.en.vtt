backing<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.430> saturated<00:02:26.180> it's<00:02:26.930> a

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
backing is kind of saturated it's a

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.619 
backing is kind of saturated it's a
heavy<00:02:27.349> paper<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.129> like<00:02:28.790> any<00:02:28.970> paper<00:02:29.269> when<00:02:29.599> you

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
heavy paper and like any paper when you

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.280 
heavy paper and like any paper when you
put<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:29.989> under<00:02:30.290> water<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:31.340> gets<00:02:32.290> waterlogged

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
put it under water it gets waterlogged

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.550 
put it under water it gets waterlogged
and<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.739> colors<00:02:34.129> start<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.549> blur<00:02:34.909> on<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.840> back

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
and the colors start to blur on the back

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.890 
and the colors start to blur on the back
you<00:02:36.769> can<00:02:36.890> see<00:02:36.950> this<00:02:37.250> blue<00:02:37.939> starting<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.599> blur<00:02:38.870> a

you can see this blue starting to blur a

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.020 
you can see this blue starting to blur a
little<00:02:39.019> bit<00:02:39.409> just<00:02:40.280> give<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.609> a<00:02:40.670> few<00:02:40.700> more

see the decals starting to peel off

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.750 
see the decals starting to peel off
already<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.319> I'm<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:46.220> take<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.579> to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
already so I'm going to take that to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.839 
already so I'm going to take that to
mean<00:02:46.909> it's<00:02:47.120> ready<00:02:47.920> now<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.189> see<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.730> the

mean it's ready now I can see that the
the<00:02:50.419> bottom<00:02:50.780> right<00:02:51.079> corner<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.680> peeling<00:02:52.189> off

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
the bottom right corner is peeling off

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.369 
the bottom right corner is peeling off
already<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:53.480> I'm<00:02:53.540> going<00:02:53.689> to<00:02:53.750> make<00:02:53.900> use<00:02:54.139> of<00:02:54.169> that

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
already so I'm going to make use of that

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.369 
already so I'm going to make use of that
room<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.090> bit<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.419> tricky<00:02:56.810> material<00:02:57.290> to

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
room it's a bit of a tricky material to

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.259 
room it's a bit of a tricky material to
work<00:02:57.530> with<00:02:57.590> when<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.459> have<00:02:58.579> these<00:02:58.730> big<00:02:58.939> sheets

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
work with when you have these big sheets

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.849 
work with when you have these big sheets
but<00:02:59.599> you<00:02:59.780> don't<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.200> be<00:03:00.290> an<00:03:00.409> expert<00:03:00.739> at

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
but you don't have to be an expert at

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.379 
but you don't have to be an expert at
all<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.980> like<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.340> get<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.639> surface<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.269> a

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
all so I like to get the surface just a

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.629 
all so I like to get the surface just a
little<00:03:05.689> bit<00:03:05.840> wet<00:03:06.079> so<00:03:06.349> like<00:03:06.859> that<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.519> can

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
little bit wet so like that so it can

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.170 
little bit wet so like that so it can
move<00:03:07.790> around<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.290> decal<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:09.739> slide<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.060> is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
move around so the decal can slide it is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.710 
move around so the decal can slide it is
a<00:03:11.209> waterslide<00:03:12.049> decal<00:03:12.590> after<00:03:12.950> all<00:03:13.359> and<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.389> want

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
a waterslide decal after all and I want

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.330 
a waterslide decal after all and I want
to<00:03:14.780> find<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.139> edge<00:03:15.349> again<00:03:17.290> there<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.500> is<00:03:21.340> very

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
to find that edge again there it is very

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.180 
to find that edge again there it is very
gentle<00:03:23.169> here<00:03:24.169> you<00:03:24.319> don't<00:03:24.530> want<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:24.889> let<00:03:25.040> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
gentle here you don't want to let it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.059 
gentle here you don't want to let it
touch<00:03:25.370> itself<00:03:25.819> like<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.379> that<00:03:27.379> could<00:03:27.650> be<00:03:27.680> bad

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
touch itself like that that could be bad

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.240 
touch itself like that that could be bad
already

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.810 

okay<00:03:32.820> we're<00:03:33.000> able<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.240> unpeel<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.460> it's<00:03:35.460> really

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
okay we're able to unpeel it it's really

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.970 
okay we're able to unpeel it it's really
only<00:03:35.940> stable<00:03:36.570> once<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:36.930> on<00:03:37.080> there<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.830> let's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
only stable once it's on there so let's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.530 
only stable once it's on there so let's
get<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.340> there<00:03:38.520> as<00:03:38.670> soon<00:03:38.940> as<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:39.210> possibly

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
get it on there as soon as we possibly

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.090 
get it on there as soon as we possibly
can<00:03:40.070> now<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.130> see<00:03:41.460> how<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:41.880> slide<00:03:42.210> around

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
can now you see how it can slide around

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.040 
can now you see how it can slide around
once<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.280> flat<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:45.060> don't<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.900> worry

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
once it's flat you don't have to worry

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.780 
once it's flat you don't have to worry
about<00:03:46.110> getting<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.650> exact<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.250> takes<00:03:47.460> a<00:03:47.550> little

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
about getting it exact it takes a little

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.750 
about getting it exact it takes a little
while<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> dry<00:03:51.980> look<00:03:52.980> at<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.280> that's<00:03:53.490> pretty

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
while to dry look at that that's pretty

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.080 
while to dry look at that that's pretty
nice<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.860> can<00:03:55.860> see<00:03:56.010> there's<00:03:56.220> one<00:03:56.430> air<00:03:56.700> bubble

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
nice I can see there's one air bubble

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.880 
nice I can see there's one air bubble
starting<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.510> form<00:03:57.810> there<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.650> we'll<00:03:58.770> just

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
starting to form there so we'll just

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.840 
starting to form there so we'll just
push<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.280> out<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.430> our<00:03:59.730> fingers<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.180> that

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
push it out with our fingers like that

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.250 
push it out with our fingers like that
go<00:04:02.850> ahead<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.240> push<00:04:03.450> out<00:04:03.660> where<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:03.990> think

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260

go ahead and push out where you think
any<00:04:04.410> others<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.920> there's<00:04:05.160> another<00:04:05.370> one

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
any others I there's another one

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.860 
any others I there's another one
starting<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.030> form<00:04:09.590> all<00:04:10.590> right<00:04:11.360> okay<00:04:12.360> now<00:04:12.660> that

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
starting to form all right okay now that

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.350 
starting to form all right okay now that
the<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.320> big<00:04:13.500> air<00:04:13.709> bubbles<00:04:14.070> are<00:04:14.360> completely

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
the the big air bubbles are completely

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.900 
the the big air bubbles are completely
out<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.230> way<00:04:16.350> I'm<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.459> going<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.640> check

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
out of the way I'm just going to check

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.020 
out of the way I'm just going to check
the<00:04:18.060> alignment<00:04:18.359> make<00:04:18.900> sure<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.230> edges<00:04:20.030> there

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
the alignment make sure the edges there

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.200 
the alignment make sure the edges there
we<00:04:21.120> go<00:04:21.330> notice<00:04:21.750> it's<00:04:21.930> still<00:04:22.200> very<00:04:22.470> uh<00:04:23.210> sliding

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
we go notice it's still very uh sliding

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.520 
we go notice it's still very uh sliding
you<00:04:24.300> can<00:04:24.480> move<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.690> around<00:04:24.750> quite<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.169> bit<00:04:25.410> if

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
you can move it around quite a bit if

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.970 
you can move it around quite a bit if
you<00:04:25.650> want

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
you want

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.740 
you want
I<00:04:27.410> get<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.040> make<00:04:29.880> sure<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.240> edges

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
I get that just and make sure that edges

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.070 
I get that just and make sure that edges
look<00:04:31.050> neat<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.040> trim<00:04:32.390> because<00:04:33.390> if<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.780> dries

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
look neat and trim because if it dries

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.900 
look neat and trim because if it dries
with<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.470> edges<00:04:34.830> up<00:04:34.980> in<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.220> air<00:04:35.430> it's<00:04:35.669> going

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
with the edges up in the air it's going

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.820 
with the edges up in the air it's going
to<00:04:35.970> look<00:04:36.180> not<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.440> hot<00:04:39.110> push<00:04:40.110> out<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:40.560> little

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
to look not so hot push out that little

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.850 
to look not so hot push out that little
corner<00:04:41.130> wants<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.610> make<00:04:41.790> some<00:04:41.970> more<00:04:42.150> bubbles

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
corner wants to make some more bubbles

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.920 
corner wants to make some more bubbles
there<00:04:43.860> we<00:04:43.980> go<00:04:44.360> next<00:04:45.360> thing<00:04:45.480> I'm<00:04:45.540> going<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.720> do

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
there we go next thing I'm going to do

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:53.930 
there we go next thing I'm going to do
is<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:48.260> paper<00:04:49.260> towel<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:51.740> dab<00:04:52.940> down

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
is get a paper towel and just dab down

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.180 
is get a paper towel and just dab down
the<00:04:54.390> top<00:04:54.630> don't<00:04:55.050> wipe<00:04:55.350> because<00:04:55.620> you'll<00:04:55.919> push

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
the top don't wipe because you'll push

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.340 
the top don't wipe because you'll push
it<00:04:56.340> all<00:04:56.460> over<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.850> place<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.840> drier<00:04:58.140> it

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
it all over the place and the drier it

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.170 
it all over the place and the drier it
gets<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.800> more<00:04:58.979> it's<00:04:59.130> going<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.340> dry<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:03.030> we'll

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
gets the more it's going to dry so we'll

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.810 
gets the more it's going to dry so we'll
just<00:05:03.419> get<00:05:03.600> all<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.380> major<00:05:04.820> easy-to-reach

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
just get all the major easy-to-reach

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.260 
just get all the major easy-to-reach
water<00:05:06.150> off<00:05:10.220> now<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.310> can<00:05:11.490> see<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:12.150> material

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
water off now you can see the material

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.180 
water off now you can see the material
is<00:05:12.570> starting<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.900> dry<00:05:13.229> it's<00:05:13.650> getting<00:05:13.919> just<00:05:13.950> a

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
is starting to dry it's getting just a

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.719 
is starting to dry it's getting just a
little<00:05:14.220> bit<00:05:14.520> wrinkly<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:17.190> goes<00:05:17.460> through<00:05:17.700> a

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
little bit wrinkly it goes through a

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.469 
little bit wrinkly it goes through a
wrinkly<00:05:18.060> phase<00:05:18.620> before<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.710> dries<00:05:19.919> completely

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
wrinkly phase before it dries completely

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.090 
wrinkly phase before it dries completely
see<00:05:21.479> that<00:05:21.630> edge<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:22.050> trying<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.410> curl<00:05:22.770> up<00:05:23.070> so

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
see that edge is trying to curl up so

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.149 
see that edge is trying to curl up so
I'm<00:05:23.370> going<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.580> try<00:05:24.440> push<00:05:25.440> that<00:05:25.710> down

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:36.709 

and<00:05:28.759> do<00:05:28.969> one<00:05:29.209> more<00:05:29.239> quick<00:05:29.689> round<00:05:29.989> of<00:05:30.110> dabbing

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.289 

anyway<00:05:37.469> that's<00:05:37.830> about<00:05:38.009> it<00:05:38.369> this<00:05:38.849> is<00:05:39.029> going<00:05:39.209> to

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:39.299 
anyway that's about it this is going to

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:42.499 
anyway that's about it this is going to
dry<00:05:39.719> fully<00:05:40.499> I'm<00:05:40.889> not<00:05:41.069> sure<00:05:41.279> how<00:05:41.459> long<00:05:41.519> maybe<00:05:42.059> 90

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
dry fully I'm not sure how long maybe 90

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.899 
dry fully I'm not sure how long maybe 90
minutes<00:05:42.869> or<00:05:43.049> an<00:05:43.169> hour<00:05:43.369> I'm<00:05:44.369> going<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:44.639> let<00:05:44.789> it

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
minutes or an hour I'm going to let it

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.149 
minutes or an hour I'm going to let it
go<00:05:45.119> ahead<00:05:45.299> and<00:05:45.479> just<00:05:45.749> dry<00:05:46.049> overnight<00:05:46.379> this<00:05:47.009> is

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
go ahead and just dry overnight this is

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.129 
go ahead and just dry overnight this is
another<00:05:47.429> one<00:05:47.699> I<00:05:47.729> did<00:05:48.119> about<00:05:48.449> 10<00:05:48.929> minutes

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
another one I did about 10 minutes

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.439 
another one I did about 10 minutes
before<00:05:49.349> I<00:05:49.559> made<00:05:49.769> this<00:05:49.889> video<00:05:50.159> so<00:05:50.489> you<00:05:51.119> can<00:05:51.269> see

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
before I made this video so you can see

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.049 
before I made this video so you can see
it's<00:05:51.659> just<00:05:52.049> about<00:05:52.379> ready<00:05:52.679> there's<00:05:53.669> no<00:05:53.849> more

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:54.059 
it's just about ready there's no more

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.029 
it's just about ready there's no more
water<00:05:54.329> on<00:05:54.689> it<00:05:54.869> and<00:05:54.899> there<00:05:55.139> are<00:05:55.199> no<00:05:55.349> air<00:05:55.619> bubbles

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
water on it and there are no air bubbles

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.149 
water on it and there are no air bubbles
on<00:05:56.219> it<00:05:56.249> but<00:05:57.029> still<00:05:57.719> very<00:05:58.139> delicate<00:05:58.649> and<00:05:58.739> still

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
on it but still very delicate and still

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.199 
on it but still very delicate and still
is<00:05:59.569> capable<00:06:00.569> of<00:06:00.689> sliding<00:06:01.259> around<00:06:01.969> so<00:06:02.969> you<00:06:03.029> want

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:03.209 
is capable of sliding around so you want

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:05.929 
is capable of sliding around so you want
to<00:06:03.329> let<00:06:03.419> these<00:06:03.629> things<00:06:04.219> sit<00:06:05.219> around<00:06:05.459> for<00:06:05.879> a

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939 
to let these things sit around for a

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:09.769 
to let these things sit around for a
long<00:06:06.179> time<00:06:06.479> from<00:06:07.139> the<00:06:07.379> dry<00:06:07.819> so<00:06:08.819> I<00:06:09.119> hope<00:06:09.749> that

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
long time from the dry so I hope that

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.059 
long time from the dry so I hope that
gives<00:06:09.989> you<00:06:10.259> a<00:06:10.319> good<00:06:10.439> impression<00:06:10.860> of<00:06:10.919> how<00:06:11.009> to

gives you a good impression of how to

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.279 
gives you a good impression of how to
use<00:06:11.279> waterslide<00:06:11.969> decals<00:06:12.449> and<00:06:12.599> I<00:06:12.659> hope<00:06:12.809> you<00:06:13.019> do

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.569 
use waterslide decals and I hope you do
a<00:06:13.319> lot<00:06:13.559> of<00:06:13.589> really<00:06:13.800> creative<00:06:14.219> things<00:06:14.249> with

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:14.579 
a lot of really creative things with

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:16.459 
a lot of really creative things with
them<00:06:14.759> because<00:06:14.909> they're<00:06:15.179> reasonably<00:06:16.079> cheap

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
them because they're reasonably cheap

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:19.279 
them because they're reasonably cheap
and<00:06:17.119> they're<00:06:18.119> very<00:06:18.300> flexible<00:06:18.539> and<00:06:19.019> can<00:06:19.079> look

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
and they're very flexible and can look

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.369 
and they're very flexible and can look
very<00:06:19.319> nice<00:06:19.739> thanks
