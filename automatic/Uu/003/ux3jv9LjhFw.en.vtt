00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 FranÃ§ois Moser Deputy Mayor of 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.150
 Versailles in the Yvelines 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.519
 I support the demonstration of 2 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.130
 I argued in February acquired dead 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.009
 all actions of the demo for all 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.590
 because the demo for all was the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.289
 movement that allowed us to show 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.900
 millions of people we were only 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.900
 disagree on this evolution of the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.119
 society this evolution of society 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 who condemns somewhere the right to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.490
 the child 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 France has always had a great 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.780
 family policy every country the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.610
 recognize and it's thanks to this 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.649
 family policy that there is a rate of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.170
 birth rate higher in France than in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.430
 other European countries 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.100
 why today put everything back into 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.579
 cause why while it works 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.399
 want to beat the cards and malause years 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.820
 it must be said probably destroyed 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.870
 which in the past has been our pride 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.410
 French 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 I am convinced that these values 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.949
 are based on the dignity of the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.619
 nobody on respect for life at all 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.750
 moment of this one at the very beginning of 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 existence as at the end of 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.119
 existence are the very foundations of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.009
 our European living together 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.720
 there is a consequence of the law this 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.729
 wedding for all we do not have at all 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.350
 measured though parliamentarians that 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.740
 we were very much stressed 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 it's for couples who 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.110
 are waiting to adopt a child 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.150
 you know that since the law was 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.710
 adopted countries like Russia the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.799
 Russia being the first country and which 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.530
 grant adoption rights to 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.740
 abroad and well Russia has closed its 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.530
 doors and I personally saw in 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.780
 my riding couples who are 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.399
 came to see me saying intervene 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.950
 because the child we 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.200
 waited for russia well we 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.880
 we will not be able to welcome him 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.189
 and that's unfortunately what happened 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.869
 spent a lot of couples waiting 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.820
 and children who already knew 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.530
 their name 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.530
 are today in pain
