00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
along this is a guy that when he shows

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.440 
along this is a guy that when he shows
up<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> court<00:01:43.950> he's<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.850> gonna<00:01:45.060> show<00:01:45.270> up

unless he's ready to play I agree and I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.450 
unless he's ready to play I agree and I

think because of that I can't view him

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.270 
think because of that I can't view him
as<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.640> liability<00:01:50.909> he's<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.170> too<00:01:52.470> big<00:01:52.770> time<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
as a liability he's just too big time of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280 
as a liability he's just too big time of
a<00:01:53.369> talent<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:53.880> me<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.270> look<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.720> he's<00:01:55.049> too

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
a talent for me to look at and he's too

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.819 
a talent for me to look at and he's too
much<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.860> competitor<00:01:56.210> aunt<00:01:57.210> Edie's<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.259> he

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
much of a competitor aunt Edie's up he

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.429 
much of a competitor aunt Edie's up he
does<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.759> can't<00:02:00.509> look<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.960> him<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
does it all I can't look at him as a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649 
does it all I can't look at him as a
liability<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.640> understand<00:02:03.119> he<00:02:03.180> could<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> bit

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
liability I understand he could be a bit

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.770 
liability I understand he could be a bit
disruptive<00:02:03.950> momentarily<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.509> think

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
disruptive momentarily but I just think

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.180 
disruptive momentarily but I just think
that<00:02:06.869> they<00:02:07.079> played<00:02:07.409> together<00:02:07.619> long<00:02:08.160> enough

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that they played together long enough

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.420 
that they played together long enough
and<00:02:08.759> he<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.690> too<00:02:10.140> big<00:02:10.410> time<00:02:10.679> talented<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and he is too big time talented and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.970 
and he is too big time talented and
Kevin<00:02:12.270> Durant<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.959> who<00:02:13.110> he<00:02:13.230> is

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
Kevin Durant is who he is

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.759 
Kevin Durant is who he is
they'll<00:02:14.190> find<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> way<00:02:14.730> within<00:02:15.150> within<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.349> 48

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
they'll find a way within within the 48

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.119 
they'll find a way within within the 48
minutes<00:02:17.400> mix<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:18.480> work<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.870> out<00:02:19.010> that's<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.099> I

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
minutes mix to work it out that's what I

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.190 
minutes mix to work it out that's what I
believe<00:02:20.250> by<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.239> way<00:02:21.480> I'm<00:02:21.750> still<00:02:22.049> not<00:02:22.140> sure

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
believe by the way I'm still not sure

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.199 
believe by the way I'm still not sure
Russell<00:02:22.590> Westbrook<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> point<00:02:23.640> guard<00:02:23.849> I

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
Russell Westbrook is a point guard I

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.910 
Russell Westbrook is a point guard I
think<00:02:24.629> he's<00:02:24.750> still<00:02:24.959> more<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.319> 2<00:02:25.560> than<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
think he's still more of a 2 than a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.430 
think he's still more of a 2 than a
point<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:27.090> also<00:02:27.269> think<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.200> I've

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
point and I also think that as I've

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.080 
point and I also think that as I've
watched<00:02:28.680> Duran<00:02:29.069> over<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> last<00:02:29.580> month<00:02:29.909> or<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
watched Duran over the last month or so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.660 
watched Duran over the last month or so
Duran<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:30.900> actually<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> better<00:02:31.799> distributor

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
Duran is actually a better distributor

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.640 
Duran is actually a better distributor
of<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:32.970> basketball<00:02:33.510> than<00:02:33.810> Russell<00:02:34.049> is<00:02:34.379> I'm

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
of the basketball than Russell is I'm

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.320 
of the basketball than Russell is I'm
just<00:02:34.860> talking<00:02:35.160> about<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> goddess<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.150> ball

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
just talking about the goddess the ball

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.770 
just talking about the goddess the ball
up<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> court<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.019> said<00:02:37.260> all<00:02:37.470> right<00:02:37.530> I

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
up the court like you said all right I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.869 
up the court like you said all right I
believe<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.140> there<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.590> no<00:02:40.920> way<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.220> all<00:02:41.640> your

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
believe that there is no way to all your

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.759 
believe that there is no way to all your
points<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.299> Jesus<00:02:42.480> made<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.349> Russell

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
points to Jesus made that Russell

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.030 
points to Jesus made that Russell
Westbrook<00:02:44.190> will<00:02:44.430> ease<00:02:44.760> back<00:02:45.060> into<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.599> flow

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
Westbrook will ease back into this flow

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.220 
Westbrook will ease back into this flow
he<00:02:47.040> loves<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.849> play<00:02:48.060> basketball<00:02:48.299> he<00:02:48.930> has<00:02:49.019> been

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
he loves to play basketball he has been

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.960 
he loves to play basketball he has been
itching<00:02:49.799> as<00:02:49.950> you've<00:02:50.099> seen<00:02:50.310> night<00:02:50.549> after<00:02:50.819> night

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
itching as you've seen night after night

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970 
itching as you've seen night after night
on<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> bench<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.510> get<00:02:51.870> into<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.410> basketball

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
on the bench to get into the basketball

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.670 
on the bench to get into the basketball
game<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.510> he<00:02:54.720> will<00:02:54.900> return<00:02:55.290> with

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
game and I think he will return with

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.229 
game and I think he will return with
guns<00:02:56.269> blazing<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:58.769> young<00:02:59.010> man<00:02:59.069> has<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.700> huge

ego i think his ego is bigger than
Kevin's<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:02.730> that's<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:03.000> that's<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.510> compliment

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
again it's not going to be as difficult

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.710 
again it's not going to be as difficult
as<00:05:11.870> you're<00:05:12.870> portraying<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.740> be<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:15.000> him

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
as you're portraying it to be that him

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.570 
as you're portraying it to be that him
and<00:05:15.870> KD<00:05:16.410> are<00:05:16.590> going<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.980> be<00:05:17.100> able<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.400> jail

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
and KD are going to be able to jail

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.650
