00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.099 
method in the summertime with a
Yirgacheffe<00:00:22.670> works<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:24.210> well<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.900> our

brewing<00:00:30.480> cone<00:00:30.750> filter<00:00:31.080> however<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.489> use<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
brewing cone filter however I use the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.260 
brewing cone filter however I use the
cone<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.140> find<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> cone<00:00:35.130> 3<00:00:35.520> they've

cone to I find the cone 3 they've

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630 
cone to I find the cone 3 they've
developed<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.020> much<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.340> fine

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
developed it so much that it's too fine

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.260 
developed it so much that it's too fine
for<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.510> brew<00:00:39.780> method<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
for this brew method so what I do is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.319 
for this brew method so what I do is
again<00:00:43.079> set<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> scale<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:45.149> I'm

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
again set it up on the scale and I'm

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.520 
again set it up on the scale and I'm
going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> add<00:00:46.700> I'm<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> add<00:00:48.350> 220<00:00:49.350> grams

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
going to add I'm going to add 220 grams

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.150 
going to add I'm going to add 220 grams
of<00:00:49.829> ice<00:00:53.239> all<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.449> 220<00:00:55.170> grams<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.530> ice<00:00:55.649> I'm

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
of ice all right 220 grams of ice I'm

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
of ice all right 220 grams of ice I'm
just<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> put<00:00:56.699> my<00:00:56.789> system<00:00:57.180> together<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
just going to put my system together and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.279 
just going to put my system together and
then<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.170> add<00:00:59.030> 26<00:01:00.030> 27<00:01:00.690> grams<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
then I'm going to add 26 27 grams of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.420 
then I'm going to add 26 27 grams of
coffee

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
coffee

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.600 
coffee
it's<00:01:02.760> coarsely<00:01:03.750> ground<00:01:04.019> its<00:01:04.260> ground<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's coarsely ground its ground as if I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's coarsely ground its ground as if I
were<00:01:05.850> actually<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> brew<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.960> chem<00:01:07.260> X<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
were actually going to brew a chem X so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.030 
were actually going to brew a chem X so
26<00:01:08.850> grams<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> start<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.590> timer<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
26 grams I'm going to start my timer and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
26 grams I'm going to start my timer and
I'm<00:01:11.280> gonna<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.580> ahead<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> bloom<00:01:12.330> just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I'm gonna go ahead and do a bloom just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.450 
I'm gonna go ahead and do a bloom just
like<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.960> normally<00:01:13.290> would<00:01:13.650> I'm<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> add

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
like I normally would I'm going to add

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.620 
like I normally would I'm going to add
between<00:01:15.210> 50<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> 60<00:01:16.500> grams<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.890> water<00:01:17.630> I'm

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
between 50 to 60 grams of water I'm

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
between 50 to 60 grams of water I'm
going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> try<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.290> wet<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.799> ground

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
going to try and wet all the ground

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
going to try and wet all the ground
coffee<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> let<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
coffee and then I'm going to let it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.789 
coffee and then I'm going to let it
bloom<00:01:22.490> for<00:01:23.490> 40<00:01:23.850> seconds<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> idea<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bloom for 40 seconds so the idea of the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.480 
bloom for 40 seconds so the idea of the
bloom<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.090> know<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.780> coffee<00:01:28.490> coming

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bloom is you know you see coffee coming

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.300 
bloom is you know you see coffee coming
down<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.659> bottom<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> system<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:32.159> really

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
down the bottom of the system but really

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.789 
down the bottom of the system but really
you<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> coffee<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.380> holding

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you really want the coffee to be holding

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.499 
you really want the coffee to be holding
on<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> water<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.119> don't<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
on to the water you don't want to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.660 
on to the water you don't want to
actually<00:01:36.990> creating<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.979> brewing

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
actually creating a lot of a brewing

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
actually creating a lot of a brewing
event<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.390> when<00:01:39.630> you're<00:01:39.750> doing<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.079> bloom

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
event so if when you're doing your bloom

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
event so if when you're doing your bloom
you<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.310> want<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.970> streaming

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you don't want it to just be streaming

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
you don't want it to just be streaming
down<00:01:42.750> through<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> bottom<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:44.009> want<00:01:44.100> your

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
down through the bottom you want your

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
down through the bottom you want your
coffee<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.820> hanging<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
coffee to be hanging on to that that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.190 
coffee to be hanging on to that that
bloom<00:01:46.500> volume<00:01:47.040> alright<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> 40<00:01:48.600> seconds<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
bloom volume alright so 40 seconds and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.020 
bloom volume alright so 40 seconds and
then<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> trick<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.979> really

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
then this one the trick here is a really

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.649 
then this one the trick here is a really
crazy<00:01:54.649> super<00:01:55.820> slow<00:01:57.530> painfully<00:01:58.530> slow<00:01:58.890> pour

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
crazy super slow painfully slow pour

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.889 
crazy super slow painfully slow pour
because<00:02:00.659> once<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.560> quit<00:02:01.770> pouring<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
because once you quit pouring it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
because once you quit pouring it
essentially<00:02:03.899> drops<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.219> bottom<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
essentially drops to the bottom of the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.719 
essentially drops to the bottom of the
the<00:02:06.450> vessel<00:02:06.840> very<00:02:07.469> quickly<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the vessel very quickly so I'm going to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.020 
the vessel very quickly so I'm going to
add<00:02:09.470> 220<00:02:10.470> grams<00:02:10.849> of<00:02:11.849> water<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
add 220 grams of water to the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.290 
add 220 grams of water to the
system<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.959> 220<00:02:14.530> ice<00:02:14.680> 220<00:02:15.430> water<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.970> I'm

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
system so 220 ice 220 water and I'm

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.790 
system so 220 ice 220 water and I'm
going<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.569> do<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.440> reach<00:02:17.770> that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
going to do it so that I reach that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.070 
going to do it so that I reach that
endpoint<00:02:18.370> about<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.360> minute<00:02:19.780> 45<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:24.400> Cup

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
endpoint about a minute 45 so this Cup

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.809 
endpoint about a minute 45 so this Cup
honestly<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> little<00:02:26.980> under<00:02:27.190> extracted

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
honestly it is a little under extracted

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.740 
honestly it is a little under extracted
it's<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.150> bit<00:02:28.330> thin<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:29.500> again<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.520> really<00:02:31.239> has

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
it's a bit thin but again it really has

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.229 
it's a bit thin but again it really has
a<00:02:31.780> beautiful<00:02:32.110> place<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.220> summertime<00:02:33.730> it's

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
a beautiful place in the summertime it's

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.610 
a beautiful place in the summertime it's
a<00:02:34.420> different<00:02:34.870> beverage

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
a different beverage

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.120 
a different beverage
it<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:36.420> very<00:02:37.420> sessionable<00:02:38.130> very

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
it is very sessionable very

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.880 
it is very sessionable very
thirst-quenching<00:02:39.489> i<00:02:40.380> personally<00:02:41.380> find<00:02:41.620> that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
thirst-quenching i personally find that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.640 
thirst-quenching i personally find that
it<00:02:42.069> only<00:02:42.310> works<00:02:42.700> with<00:02:42.940> coffees<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.620> a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
it only works with coffees that have a

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.009 
it only works with coffees that have a
high<00:02:45.100> note<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.580> citrus<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.840> this

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
high note of citrus and so this

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.830 
high note of citrus and so this
Yirgacheffe<00:02:47.440> has<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.890> lot<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.540> citrus<00:02:49.540> lemon

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
Yirgacheffe has a lot of citrus lemon

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.160 
Yirgacheffe has a lot of citrus lemon
notes<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.500> lemon<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.519> coffee<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.180> what

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
notes of lemon in the coffee and what

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.770 
notes of lemon in the coffee and what
that<00:02:53.380> does<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.950> think<00:02:54.040> there<00:02:54.730> my<00:02:55.269> theory<00:02:55.660> is

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
that does I think there my theory is

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.259 
that does I think there my theory is
that<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:56.080> kind<00:02:56.380> of<00:02:56.560> mask<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.430> little<00:02:57.880> bit<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
that a kind of mask a little bit of the

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.259 
that a kind of mask a little bit of the
bitterness<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:59.280> happens<00:03:00.280> when<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.970> brew

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
bitterness that happens when you brew

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.930 
bitterness that happens when you brew
coffee<00:03:01.600> directly<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.440> ice<00:03:02.940> essentially

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
coffee directly on ice essentially

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.150 
coffee directly on ice essentially
that's<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.660> it's<00:03:04.989> done<00:03:05.140> growing<00:03:05.709> up<00:03:05.860> in<00:03:06.010> about

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that's it it's done growing up in about

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.750 
that's it it's done growing up in about
220<00:03:06.850> 215<00:03:07.480> again<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.410> cup<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.860> not<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.580> be

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
220 215 again the cup is not going to be

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.229 
220 215 again the cup is not going to be
as<00:03:10.060> if<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.840> actually<00:03:11.200> did<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.739> Chemex<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.640> that

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
as if I actually did a Chemex and that

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.540 
as if I actually did a Chemex and that
sort<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.569> flavor<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.230> concentration<00:03:14.680> but

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
sort of flavor of that concentration but

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.699 
sort of flavor of that concentration but
yet<00:03:15.760> it's<00:03:15.940> been<00:03:16.090> cooled<00:03:16.420> down<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.019> it's<00:03:17.530> going

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
yet it's been cooled down so it's going

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.229 
yet it's been cooled down so it's going
to<00:03:17.860> be<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> little<00:03:18.280> bit<00:03:18.400> more<00:03:18.579> fatigue<00:03:19.000> but

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
to be a little bit more fatigue but

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.759 
to be a little bit more fatigue but
you're<00:03:19.390> going<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.630> get<00:03:19.780> those<00:03:19.959> citrus<00:03:20.500> notes

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
you're going to get those citrus notes

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.259 
you're going to get those citrus notes
you're<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.160> get<00:03:21.280> those<00:03:21.459> tea<00:03:21.820> notes<00:03:22.060> in

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
you're going to get those tea notes in

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.569 
you're going to get those tea notes in
the<00:03:22.390> system<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:26.260> got<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> nice<00:03:26.739> caramel<00:03:27.190> color

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
the system it's got a nice caramel color

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.250 
the system it's got a nice caramel color
again<00:03:28.299> light<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:30.299> again<00:03:31.299> really<00:03:31.600> refreshing

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
again light but again really refreshing

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.190 
again light but again really refreshing

know create big controversy in terms of
this<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.700> right<00:03:39.850> method<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.170> extracted

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
this is the right method is it extracted

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.640 
this is the right method is it extracted
enough<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> not<00:03:42.459> extracted<00:03:43.180> enough<00:03:43.650> this
