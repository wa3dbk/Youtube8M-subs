00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.760 
know Spain passes the ball a lot and
dominates<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.760> game<00:04:35.140> every<00:04:36.140> team<00:04:36.350> is<00:04:36.530> going

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
to defend against spain by Torres is a

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.380

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
the greater will play because he is

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.740 
the greater will play because he is
meant<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.500> open<00:04:45.890> up<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.340> opponent's<00:04:46.850> gonna<00:04:47.660> go
