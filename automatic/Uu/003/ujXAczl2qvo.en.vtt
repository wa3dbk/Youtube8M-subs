lower half and as you can see most of
these<00:01:42.460> look<00:01:42.670> very<00:01:42.700> very<00:01:42.940> similar<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.680> next

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
these look very very similar the next

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.800 
these look very very similar the next
thing<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.130> did<00:01:45.310> was<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.729> baked<00:01:46.240> them<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.690> after

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
thing I did was I baked them and after

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.510 
thing I did was I baked them and after
making<00:01:47.200> them<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.560> started<00:01:47.800> making<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:48.130> different

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
making them I started making a different

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.149 
making them I started making a different
ice<00:01:48.729> cream<00:01:49.119> parts<00:01:49.569> so<00:01:50.110> for<00:01:50.289> this<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.649> chopped<00:01:50.979> up

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
ice cream parts so for this I chopped up

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.520 
ice cream parts so for this I chopped up
some<00:01:51.429> brown<00:01:51.819> or<00:01:52.149> bronze<00:01:52.420> quiet<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.020> then<00:01:53.289> mix

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
some brown or bronze quiet and then mix

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.770 
some brown or bronze quiet and then mix
it<00:01:53.679> into<00:01:53.830> some<00:01:54.069> mint<00:01:54.310> green<00:01:54.520> claim<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.149> then

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
it into some mint green claim and then

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.570 
it into some mint green claim and then
using<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.380> mint<00:01:56.560> green<00:01:56.679> I<00:01:56.920> textured<00:01:57.460> it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
using the mint green I textured it

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.880 
using the mint green I textured it
within<00:01:57.789> needle<00:01:58.390> tool<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.990> then<00:01:59.409> put<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.710> in

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
within needle tool and then put it in

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.920 
within needle tool and then put it in
between

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
between

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:12.130 
between
green<00:02:02.560> macaron<00:02:03.040> shells

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140

rock on top of it and this one I'm
showing<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.430> slower<00:02:22.730> details<00:02:23.180> how<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> did

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
showing you in slower details how I did

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.870 
showing you in slower details how I did
it<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.230> at<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.860> bottom<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> shell<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.580> added

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
it so at the bottom the shell I added

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.410 
it so at the bottom the shell I added
some<00:02:25.910> emails<00:02:26.480> echo<00:02:26.660> gel<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.290> then<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.220> put<00:02:29.090> on

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
some emails echo gel and then I put on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.750 
some emails echo gel and then I put on
the<00:02:30.020> ice<00:02:30.260> cream<00:02:30.530> part<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.280> put<00:02:31.400> something

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
the ice cream part and put something

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.699 
the ice cream part and put something
with<00:02:31.880> lego<00:02:31.940> doll<00:02:32.209> on<00:02:32.390> top<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.260> then

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
with lego doll on top of that and then

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.890 
with lego doll on top of that and then
put<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.950> macron<00:02:34.310> shell<00:02:34.640> on<00:02:34.880> top<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.570> don't

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
put the macron shell on top and don't

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.500 
put the macron shell on top and don't
further<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:37.280> also<00:02:37.730> have<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.120> bake<00:02:38.330> this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
further in you also have to bake this

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.780 
further in you also have to bake this
again<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.230> about<00:02:39.350> 10<00:02:39.680> minutes<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.220> bake<00:02:40.580> my

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
again for about 10 minutes so I bake my

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.630 
again for about 10 minutes so I bake my
shells<00:02:41.120> for<00:02:41.480> about<00:02:41.959> 10<00:02:42.770> minutes<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:43.459> it

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
shells for about 10 minutes and then it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.790 
shells for about 10 minutes and then it
baked<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.120> again<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.690> another<00:02:44.870> 10<00:02:45.170> minutes<00:02:45.200> so

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
baked it again for another 10 minutes so

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.040 
baked it again for another 10 minutes so
it's<00:02:46.070> really<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.640> how<00:02:47.450> many<00:02:47.660> times<00:02:47.840> you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
it's really up to you how many times you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:56.770 
it's really up to you how many times you
want<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.290> be<00:02:48.380> good

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.970 

for<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.500> use<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> regular

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
for this one I just use a regular

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.920 
for this one I just use a regular
chocolate<00:02:59.670> color<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.659> didn't<00:03:00.900> even

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
chocolate color and I didn't even

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.360 
chocolate color and I didn't even
texture<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.469> because<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.680> wanted<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.250> what

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
texture it because I wanted to see what

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.250 
texture it because I wanted to see what
it<00:03:02.430> looked<00:03:02.549> like<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.969> smooth<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.659> again

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it looked like just smooth and again

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.569 
it looked like just smooth and again
just<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.560> same<00:03:04.799> thing<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.159> I've<00:03:05.280> been<00:03:05.400> doing

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
just the same thing that I've been doing

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.369 
just the same thing that I've been doing
and<00:03:05.909> then<00:03:06.359> after<00:03:06.689> you've<00:03:06.840> baked<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.290> for

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
and then after you've baked it for

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.050 
and then after you've baked it for
another<00:03:07.769> 10<00:03:08.069> minutes<00:03:08.099> this<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.519> what<00:03:08.790> they<00:03:08.879> all

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
another 10 minutes this is what they all

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.369 
another 10 minutes this is what they all
should<00:03:09.239> look<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.420> they're<00:03:09.750> super<00:03:10.049> adorable

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
should look like they're super adorable

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.530 
should look like they're super adorable
and<00:03:10.739> yes<00:03:11.370> if<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.700> don't<00:03:11.849> want<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.329> bake<00:03:12.510> it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
and yes if you don't want to bake it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.199 
and yes if you don't want to bake it
twice<00:03:13.019> then<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.560> would<00:03:13.709> just<00:03:13.849> do<00:03:14.849> this<00:03:14.970> all<00:03:15.180> in

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
twice then you would just do this all in

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.149 
twice then you would just do this all in
one<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.689> but<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.989> find<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.439> making<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.890> shells

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
one go but I find that making the shells

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.099 
one go but I find that making the shells
first<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.790> makes<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.450> easier<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.810> press

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
first it makes it easier to press

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.920 
first it makes it easier to press
together<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:20.970> first<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.450> it's

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
together so this is the first one it's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.350 
together so this is the first one it's
like<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.109> pistachio<00:03:22.310> mint<00:03:23.310> ice<00:03:24.000> cream<00:03:24.030> McCarron

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.040 

next<00:03:27.720> one<00:03:27.960> is

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
next one is

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.770 
next one is
blueberry<00:03:29.500> chocolate<00:03:29.920> macron<00:03:30.700> maybe<00:03:31.570> he<00:03:31.720> is

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
blueberry chocolate macron maybe he is

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.670 
blueberry chocolate macron maybe he is
Mona<00:03:31.960> I'm<00:03:32.230> not<00:03:32.440> sure

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.619 

the<00:03:37.129> next<00:03:37.400> one<00:03:37.519> here<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.030> be<00:03:38.390> very

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
the next one here is it be very

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:47.510 
the next one here is it be very
