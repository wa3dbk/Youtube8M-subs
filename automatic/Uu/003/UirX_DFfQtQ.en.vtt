that<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.730> guitarist<00:00:06.089> can<00:00:06.359> use<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.660> practice

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
that a guitarist can use to practice

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.459 
that a guitarist can use to practice
with<00:00:08.010> unamplified<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> option

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
with unamplified and have the option

with unamplified and have the option
performed<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.160> amplified<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.940> one

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
performed with it amplified so one

performed with it amplified so one
amplified<00:00:12.599> you'll<00:00:12.990> hear<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> little

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
amplified you'll hear that it's a little

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.680 
amplified you'll hear that it's a little
bit<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> nasal<00:00:14.519> sound<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> smaller<00:00:15.389> body

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
bit of a nasal sound it's a smaller body

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.689 
bit of a nasal sound it's a smaller body
it's<00:00:16.350> all<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> compromises<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.430> need<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it's all the compromises you need to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.640 
it's all the compromises you need to
make<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> smaller<00:00:18.630> instrument<00:00:19.050> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
make to have a smaller instrument that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.460 
make to have a smaller instrument that
still<00:00:20.039> feels<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> balanced<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
still feels and this is balanced as a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.420 
still feels and this is balanced as a
full-size<00:00:23.340> archtop<00:00:23.850> guitar<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:25.099> no<00:00:26.099> way<00:00:26.250> was

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
full-size archtop guitar but no way was

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.500 
full-size archtop guitar but no way was
our<00:00:26.580> intention<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.000> make<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.269> sound

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
our intention to make this sound

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
our intention to make this sound
acoustically<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> full-size<00:00:28.859> archtop

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
acoustically like a full-size archtop

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.609 
acoustically like a full-size archtop
guitar<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> keep<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> price<00:00:31.320> down<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
guitar and we can keep the price down a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
guitar and we can keep the price down a
little<00:00:31.859> bit<00:00:32.070> by<00:00:32.309> building<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
little bit by building in that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
little bit by building in that
complement<00:00:33.870> combination<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.559> compromises<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
complement combination of compromises so

00:00:35.219 --> 00:01:07.429 
complement combination of compromises so
acoustically<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> that's<00:01:06.360> an<00:01:06.600> acoustic<00:01:07.140> sound

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
acoustically so that's an acoustic sound

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.810 
acoustically so that's an acoustic sound
when<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.369> amplify<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.659> through

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
when we amplify it and this is through

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.039 
when we amplify it and this is through
acoustic<00:01:11.820> imaging<00:01:11.970> amp<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> razor's<00:01:12.930> edge

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
acoustic imaging amp with a razor's edge

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.880 
acoustic imaging amp with a razor's edge
cabinet<00:01:13.650> set<00:01:14.400> flat
