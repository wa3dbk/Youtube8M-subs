00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 comedy club 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.860
 what is the story of a school delegate because it was self-evident 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.840
 once again in front of the theater right in front of the theater I had 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.730

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.010
 it's a little bit the maximum juice it's not left the club 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.560
 but hey it's okay I do not want to manage against seduced more than rené-paul 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.630
 beautiful knowing who will succeed really has no purpose for me in life 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.920
 to become famous 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
 and for now my plan works perfectly well 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.730
 upset the highway for me 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.810
 percent were heard on tour it was really fantastic all 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.440
 Winter 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.880
 she the place that struck me the most during the tour is monaco 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.780
 I had a lot of apriori on monaco told me you'll see monaco it's a 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.219
 place with that directs 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.829
 prevailing between rich doing rich stuff so let's say to is this 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.040
 that we are rich 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.580
 yes it's true but it's true that it's true I bought stoke las vegas to 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550
 24 euros 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.030
 know the year I asked to visit what is happening with these tools 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.079
 de rigueur 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.419
 in the evening around 9 pm after the guards by red dragon 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.470
 it's amazing and I've seen people I've never seen otherwise I quickly did 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.840
 it is obviously with m 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.979
 clap in Morocco 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.240
 for styling 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.590
 their comments 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.300
 you have spicy bread a little 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.920
 I have first prices that dragging dogs hunk with cuts of 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 hair 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 it's also waste with pink blue paints 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 it is the basketball federation due is also because it is a cup of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.860
 hair 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.540
 then from the moment you let go of the ulna and not what it is 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.060
 that this thing you see you can not prepare a gallant appointment in the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.930
 North 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.319
 the mold 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.869
 not even 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.040
 I was about to forget 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.520
 as a reminder after for romance not a muslim country 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.789
 the least loan 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.029
 not been stated in a separate report to actually find a job 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.059
 because I'm a comedian in a series or a movie is actually nothing 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.839
 all 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.219
 my name is yacine I'm a comedian and for that reason I'm the guy who has 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.669
 the most free time in this room 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.919
 Well it's true so to reassure me I watched French production of 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 series and all that I say to myself that in the end it's not so bad 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:36.869
 not seriously 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.019
 there she dressed club me at least I could and I see the series 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.229
 French first the genetic map 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.909
 and both of them fixed together they are all afraid of the world in itself 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.150
 the Chinese were going caterpillar and the age of the replicas of the clock your 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.669
 next man 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.679
 good and the tobacco announced 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:54.139
 the carrots are cooked 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.030
 it sucks that I love playing in a series like 24 hours 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.129
 over 24 hours I think it was excited his agents 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.680
 anti-espionage% and the dishes that are all connected by satellite they are the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.009
 last computers it throws 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.439
 in our series but when they spot a suspect 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.719
 he still works with the whiteboard we saw in college she wants 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.520
 find the daaf 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.929
 in fact the hardest good ok guys 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.929
 we have a little jobbik 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.999
 he is in a house 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.910
 the accident took place 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.610
 it's to ask stuff the united states question at several times 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.489
 it's fiction of me I like when the inspector during the summer 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.150
 interrogatories inspectors leave their homes 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.669
 it was fearing that a little effective the table is cold wind 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.019
 timorous the copa del rey 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.150
 turan and hull 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.789
 I do not care I lose my public place 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.709
 I like it in French yes the bakery 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.979
 water and bakery 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.639
 I do not know if I tell you I understand this issue but by dint of 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.509
 badly after blocking I throw myself in the arms 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.159
 you want me to give you then I stopped my room 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.159

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.749

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:31.449
 halloween of st-charles makes it a coffee a tea 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.220
 elise told incredible stories like 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.620
 prison break happens if you know this series 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.909
 beautiful is the story of a guy who gets a tattoo 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.259
 of the plan of a prison completely aside 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.760
 you do it on purpose as in prison to free his brother 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.500
 his brother sentenced to death but in fact neither is it a conspiracy of the 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.979
 house-white led by the president of the fff 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.370
 it's anything rosicky loud 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.500
 sexy and strong 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.610
 the daily mexico such episodes she tries to disassemble the 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.970
 toilet of his prison with a piece of soap that will carve himself 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.479
 is the duration he said if he will arrive jarael d'ouattara 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.029
 that's what he did with 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.439
 the erc for them 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.860
 every month 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.509
 as the person's basement 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.849
 the impossible thing that he's very happy with it but what part of it 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.849
 you have to go with it yet as soon as the girls are done 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.779
 eu 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:24.610

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.330
 yeah 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.750
 more importantly it's more believable because it was over at the most 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.319
 violent who do not have an occupation army and a weapon 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.330
