appeared in the story and why there is
not<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.300> shadow<00:00:12.599> animatronics<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.440> three<00:00:13.860> of

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
not to shadow animatronics but three of

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.970 
not to shadow animatronics but three of
them<00:00:14.429> okay<00:00:15.030> let's<00:00:15.389> start<00:00:15.660> by<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.440> mini<00:00:16.770> game

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980

from<00:00:17.160> F&amp;F<00:00:17.699> 3<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.720> tell<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.170> Chado

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
from F&amp;F 3 we can tell the Chado

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
from F&amp;F 3 we can tell the Chado
animatronics<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.250> very<00:00:20.609> unique<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.600> can

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
animatronics are very unique they can

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.290 
animatronics are very unique they can
fly<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.410> travel<00:00:23.010> through<00:00:23.340> time<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.119> space

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

like<00:05:42.070> toy<00:05:42.370> Bonnie<00:05:42.669> but<00:05:42.970> that's<00:05:43.300> not<00:05:43.510> affect

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
like toy Bonnie but that's not affect

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.960 
like toy Bonnie but that's not affect
and<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.440> hat<00:05:44.620> from<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:45.039> teaser<00:05:45.310> belongs<00:05:45.760> to

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
and the hat from the teaser belongs to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.110 
and the hat from the teaser belongs to
the<00:05:46.210> way<00:05:46.419> first<00:05:46.950> animatronic<00:05:47.950> threadbare<00:05:48.639> but

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
the way first animatronic threadbare but

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.810 
the way first animatronic threadbare but
what<00:05:49.630> about<00:05:49.660> stripe<00:05:50.410> shadow<00:05:51.039> Freddy<00:05:51.400> had<00:05:51.639> no

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
what about stripe shadow Freddy had no

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.659 
what about stripe shadow Freddy had no
stripe<00:05:52.270> when<00:05:52.630> we<00:05:52.750> saw<00:05:52.960> him<00:05:53.169> but<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.800> Giza<00:05:54.100> has

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
stripe when we saw him but the Giza has

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.510 
stripe when we saw him but the Giza has
it<00:05:54.940> they<00:05:55.330> think<00:05:55.660> is<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.560> head<00:05:56.800> is<00:05:57.010> real

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
it they think is that the head is real

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.240 
it they think is that the head is real
and<00:05:58.000> like<00:05:58.389> shadow<00:05:58.690> friday<00:05:59.050> which<00:05:59.320> is<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.800> ghost

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
and like shadow friday which is a ghost

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.180 
and like shadow friday which is a ghost
so<00:06:00.850> i<00:06:01.060> think<00:06:01.210> that<00:06:01.660> this<00:06:01.960> tribe<00:06:02.410> was<00:06:02.710> added

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
so i think that this tribe was added

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.909 
so i think that this tribe was added
later<00:06:03.520> on<00:06:03.880> after<00:06:04.120> son<00:06:04.750> person<00:06:05.200> died<00:06:05.470> in<00:06:05.710> the

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
later on after son person died in the

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.219 
later on after son person died in the
costume<00:06:06.400> so<00:06:06.729> that's<00:06:07.150> a<00:06:07.330> reason<00:06:07.690> why<00:06:07.840> we<00:06:08.050> see

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
costume so that's a reason why we see

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.290 
costume so that's a reason why we see
the<00:06:08.440> head<00:06:08.650> whizzes<00:06:09.100> try<00:06:09.430> but<00:06:09.729> shadow<00:06:09.970> Freddy

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
the head whizzes try but shadow Freddy

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.300 
the head whizzes try but shadow Freddy
had<00:06:10.570> no<00:06:10.750> stripe<00:06:11.139> on<00:06:11.289> his<00:06:11.530> head<00:06:11.740> when<00:06:11.889> we<00:06:12.070> soak

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
had no stripe on his head when we soak

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.700 
had no stripe on his head when we soak
him<00:06:12.580> another<00:06:13.210> possible<00:06:13.810> reason<00:06:13.870> that<00:06:14.229> school

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
him another possible reason that school

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.830 
him another possible reason that school
just<00:06:14.950> has<00:06:15.220> made<00:06:15.430> a<00:06:15.460> mistake<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.120> created<00:06:16.810> the

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
just has made a mistake and created the

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.320 
just has made a mistake and created the
head<00:06:17.169> with<00:06:17.350> a<00:06:17.380> stripe<00:06:17.889> on<00:06:18.070> it<00:06:18.220> but<00:06:18.880> I<00:06:19.090> don't

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
head with a stripe on it but I don't

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.969 
head with a stripe on it but I don't
think<00:06:19.510> that<00:06:19.750> he<00:06:19.930> could<00:06:20.110> make<00:06:20.320> that<00:06:20.650> big

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
think that he could make that big

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.820 
think that he could make that big
mistake<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:21.729> the<00:06:22.360> laughing<00:06:22.870> why<00:06:23.289> does<00:06:23.560> shadow

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
mistake and the laughing why does shadow

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.159 
mistake and the laughing why does shadow
neutronics<00:06:24.520> look<00:06:24.850> like<00:06:25.150> animatronics<00:06:25.960> not

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
neutronics look like animatronics not

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.770 
neutronics look like animatronics not
like<00:06:26.380> people<00:06:26.560> the<00:06:27.220> official<00:06:27.700> reason<00:06:27.909> is<00:06:28.180> the

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
like people the official reason is the

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.680 
like people the official reason is the
fact<00:06:29.050> that<00:06:29.169> they<00:06:29.530> died<00:06:29.860> in<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.490> suits<00:06:30.820> so<00:06:31.240> they

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
fact that they died in the suits so they

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.970 
fact that they died in the suits so they
had

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
had

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.700 
had
suits<00:06:32.310> loop<00:06:32.610> but<00:06:32.850> the<00:06:33.270> real<00:06:33.450> reason<00:06:33.600> is<00:06:34.110> the

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
suits loop but the real reason is the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.620 
suits loop but the real reason is the
fact<00:06:35.010> that<00:06:35.160> school<00:06:35.580> just<00:06:35.820> like<00:06:35.970> to<00:06:36.390> walk<00:06:36.600> with
