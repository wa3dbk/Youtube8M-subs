it says four on the screen I change it

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.050 
it says four on the screen I change it
back<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.270> three<00:02:32.740> or<00:02:33.740> I<00:02:33.770> like<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.819> I'll

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
check it and it's at three again so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.059 
check it and it's at three again so
that's<00:02:42.530> pretty<00:02:42.860> easy<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.770> that's<00:02:45.770> pretty
