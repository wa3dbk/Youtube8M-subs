00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.379
 [music] 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.059
 while some leave the market and turn off 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.190
 producing others feel in 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.290
 Russia is quite comfortable we arrived at 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.030
 Shushary factory under St. Petersburg to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.220
 understand how the formula is 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 success toyota and at the same time see how 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.710
 collects one of the main automotive 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 this year's premier 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.150
 updated camry restyled launch 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.519
 models on the pipeline started in November 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 last year at the same time opened the shop 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.070
 stamping and plastic production 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 details 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.690
 the level of localization has grown together not 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.460
 reached 30 percent and literally a month 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.410
 back here began to collect the car with 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 2-liter engine in August 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 a new body welding line will open 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 the end of this year, the capacity of the plant 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.390
 will be 100 thousand cars a year 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.190
 In addition to camry, there will be the most 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.500
 popular model toyota in Russia 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.300
 rav4 several pilot bodies 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 the crossover is already here with their help 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.039
 masters master assembly technology 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.980
 total line will require 800 extra 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.780
 employees 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.430
 process itself it 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.490
 identical and all production technology 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.619
 it is similar to Japanese 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.880
 trying to learn from our Japanese colleagues 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.189
 and 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.700
 people who work in factories in 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.560
 Japan is a meticulous approach to 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.310
 performing production operations 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.210
 after all, Toyota 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.570
 she is famous for being neat 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:31.189
 and precisely tunes the process 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.360
 man-made is important and more 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.670
 she is known for her quaint 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 terminology the most common 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 the word local kaizen glossary is 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.970
 principle which stands for continuous 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.560
 improvement of all processes from 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.590
 production details before the relationship 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.450
 with suppliers and dealers one more of 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.610
 equestrian japanese term scribble 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.810
 this device is created directly 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.030
 by the employees themselves 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.549
 the main task to simplify or facilitate 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.799
 any process but there is a rule it 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.840
 should not consume energy on such 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.729
 Mechanisms seemed a dozen 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.429
 for example it helps to transfer 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.759
 trunk lid before the workers did 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.759
 it's by hand 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.479
 when do you understand the risk area 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.790
 labor protection you can easily 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.349
 recognize the risk in achieving 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.150
 a certain level of quality performance 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.739
 operations exactly then you can 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.640
 recognize which of the operation is 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.650
 meaningful 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.049
 and which does not benefit no one can 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.780
 eliminate or replace something we 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.970
 used to saying that always 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.400
 the employer speeds up production 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.200
 line makes it more intense we don't 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.420
 do this we just change those 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.310
 useless 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.560
 steps that a person performs on more 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.690
 lucid climbed all these fancy 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.819
 japanese words and device at first 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.829
 seem to be some kind of exotic which 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.230
 does not fit with the wife of the Russian 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.970
 it is not true 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.160
 terms and principles are learned 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.079
 staff pretty quickly besides 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.360
 many things like technology 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.019
 labor protection or the so-called circles 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.329
 qualities 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.940
 the Japanese a few decades ago 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.430
 borrowed from the Soviet Union and now 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.890
 adapted and brought back to Russia 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.609
 in the end we get to the pain familiar things and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.390
 with a unique Japanese flavor 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.880
 control at each stage of production 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.930
 so numbers and that is enough mr 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.269
 and make a little mistake 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.160
 for example drop the bolt on the floor and this is already 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.560
 sufficient reason not to 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.560
 I will be afraid of this word to pull for andon 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.840
 so you need to do with each 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.480
 emergency situation even seemed to be the most 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.500
 would be insignificant so for don and here 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.480
 tugging regularly 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.040
 the post starts playing music on 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.560
 the display lights up the problem area 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.810
 foremen comes and see what's the matter 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.819
 if the problem is trivial to build it 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.610
 will not affect in any way if something more serious 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.989
 A specialist will try to fix it if 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.420
 in a couple of minutes it won't work 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.680
 the line will have to stop the way and our 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.260
 presence directly here 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.180
 the situation is also abnormal so there are three 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.190
 cars that passed by while we 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.930
 recorded the video then brigadier 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.000
 I had to additionally check at the end 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.849
 plot because working on us 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.170
 distracted such a rule in Russian 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.120
 man speaking Russian 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.690
 mentality I think laid much 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.000
 more 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.099
 desire is proud of what he does 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.790
 rather than in any other our 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.320
 guys have such a desire to create with them 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.359
 passion to create really 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.220
 neat quality product it 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.570
 the goal of the leadership 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.430
 our company 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.440
 and apparently it somehow 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.380
 succeeds and financial motivation in 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.720
 order salary of at least 38 thousand rubles 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.580
 so one report per month and inadequate 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.190
 everyone's participation in improving the working 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.990
 process forget here do not read by 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.910
 at least when we talked to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.550
 Masters reviews have heard only 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.470
 positive but also building an employee in 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.190
 full order despite the real 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.750
 hard and highly responsible work 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.520
 possible employees at the shushary plant 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.590
 there is such a tremendous experience 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.120
 Japanese colleagues the level of robotization on 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.070
 the company is a little lower 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.290
 but control plays a key role 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.700
 quality and here technology is absolutely 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.650
 the same as at toyota 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.650
 Japan and other countries around the world
