00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.690 

there's<00:00:07.600> two<00:00:07.930> main<00:00:08.230> reasons<00:00:08.710> why<00:00:08.920> a<00:00:09.340> nickel

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
there's two main reasons why a nickel

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.060 
there's two main reasons why a nickel
titanium<00:00:09.850> rotary<00:00:10.540> files<00:00:10.840> separate<00:00:11.440> and<00:00:11.860> it's

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
titanium rotary files separate and it's

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.220 
titanium rotary files separate and it's
because<00:00:12.460> of<00:00:12.490> cyclic<00:00:13.240> fatigue<00:00:13.420> which<00:00:13.870> is<00:00:14.050> kind

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
because of cyclic fatigue which is kind

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.810 
because of cyclic fatigue which is kind
of<00:00:14.260> like<00:00:14.440> taking<00:00:14.650> a<00:00:14.800> coat<00:00:15.040> hanger<00:00:15.460> and<00:00:15.490> doing

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
of like taking a coat hanger and doing

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.120 
of like taking a coat hanger and doing
that<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.630> it'll<00:00:16.810> eventually<00:00:16.990> break<00:00:17.529> and

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
that and it'll eventually break and

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.519 
that and it'll eventually break and
torsional<00:00:18.820> fatigue<00:00:19.180> meaning<00:00:19.540> the<00:00:19.630> tip<00:00:19.900> will

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
torsional fatigue meaning the tip will

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.159 
torsional fatigue meaning the tip will
get<00:00:20.710> locked<00:00:20.950> in<00:00:21.250> but<00:00:21.610> the<00:00:21.700> motor<00:00:21.939> continues<00:00:22.720> to

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
get locked in but the motor continues to

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:29.089 
get locked in but the motor continues to
spin<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:24.279> it<00:00:24.430> shears<00:00:24.849> off<00:00:25.119> so<00:00:26.079> this<00:00:26.470> motion

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:38.119 

significantly<00:00:30.099> reduces<00:00:30.669> both<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:31.149> those

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.009 

so<00:00:38.879> you'll<00:00:39.269> see<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.600> we're<00:00:40.109> gonna<00:00:40.649> engage

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
so you'll see that we're gonna engage

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.380 
so you'll see that we're gonna engage
withdraw

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.060 

engage<00:00:47.390> withdraw<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.260> that's<00:00:48.620> two<00:00:48.860> working

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
engage withdraw and that's two working

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.889 
engage withdraw and that's two working
links<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:49.640> your<00:00:49.790> first<00:00:50.000> file<00:00:50.329> you're<00:00:50.629> done

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
links so your first file you're done

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.760 
links so your first file you're done
right<00:00:51.710> there

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
right there

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.599 
right there
you<00:00:54.370> would<00:00:54.460> irrigate<00:00:55.000> at<00:00:55.210> this<00:00:55.540> point<00:00:57.360> correct

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.569 

put<00:01:01.179> in<00:01:01.269> your<00:01:01.420> second<00:01:01.809> file<00:01:02.079> here<00:01:02.499> and<00:01:02.679> repeat

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
put in your second file here and repeat

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.760 
put in your second file here and repeat
that<00:01:03.760> same<00:01:03.820> motion<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.680> engage<00:01:06.330> withdraw

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that same motion so engage withdraw

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.639 
that same motion so engage withdraw
clean<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.920> file<00:01:09.159> out<00:01:09.399> engage<00:01:10.360> withdraw<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.530> I

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
clean the file out engage withdraw and I

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.530 
clean the file out engage withdraw and I
got<00:01:11.799> to<00:01:11.950> working<00:01:12.310> like<00:01:12.340> there<00:01:15.360> you're<00:01:16.360> done

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
got to working like there you're done

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.200 
got to working like there you're done
with<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.750> file<00:01:17.259> so<00:01:17.680> you'll<00:01:17.860> take<00:01:18.100> all<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:18.909> the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
with that file so you'll take all of the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:27.399 
with that file so you'll take all of the
files<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.930> working<00:01:20.350> length<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.610> finally

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.130 

and<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.250> much<00:01:28.520> more<00:01:28.790> efficient<00:01:29.479> cutting<00:01:29.690> to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
and it's much more efficient cutting to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.840 
and it's much more efficient cutting to
yes<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.270> engage<00:01:32.270> withdraw

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
yes so I engage withdraw

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.350 
yes so I engage withdraw
engage<00:01:34.850> withdraw<00:01:35.950> irrigate<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.160> then<00:01:37.550> you're

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
engage withdraw irrigate and then you're

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.260 
engage withdraw irrigate and then you're
gonna<00:01:38.479> start<00:01:38.750> paper<00:01:39.050> pointing<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:40.550> dry<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.119> we

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
gonna start paper pointing to dry and we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.050 
gonna start paper pointing to dry and we
have<00:01:41.390> matching<00:01:41.920> paper<00:01:42.920> points<00:01:43.490> we've<00:01:43.850> got<00:01:44.030> a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
have matching paper points we've got a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.249 
have matching paper points we've got a
perch<00:01:44.390> everything<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.369> this<00:01:46.869> color<00:01:47.869> coding

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
perch everything is to this color coding

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.520 
perch everything is to this color coding
so<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.610> finish<00:01:49.940> with<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.690> single<00:01:51.170> striped

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
so if you finish with the single striped

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.530 
so if you finish with the single striped
red<00:01:51.800> there<00:01:52.460> will<00:01:52.550> be<00:01:52.580> paper<00:01:52.880> points<00:01:53.360> and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
red there will be paper points and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.900 
red there will be paper points and
gutta-percha<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:54.320> match<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:55.580> it

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
gutta-percha to match that so it's it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.660 
gutta-percha to match that so it's it
takes<00:01:55.940> all<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.690> guesswork<00:01:57.050> out<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:58.100> what

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
takes all of the guesswork out of what

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.550 
takes all of the guesswork out of what
you<00:01:58.940> need<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.240> set<00:01:59.479> up<00:01:59.509> what<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.080> doctor<00:02:00.500> is

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
you need to set up what the doctor is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.910 
you need to set up what the doctor is
going<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.009> gonna<00:02:01.580> grab
