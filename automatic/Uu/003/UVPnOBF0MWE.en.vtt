00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
huge huge difference between the two

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.780 
huge huge difference between the two
then<00:01:21.990> another<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.549> see<00:01:23.759> i

then another thing is as you can see i

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.840 
then another thing is as you can see i
got<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.299> super<00:01:25.259> nintendo<00:01:25.380> working<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.700> one

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
got the super nintendo working I got one

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.620 
got the super nintendo working I got one
of<00:01:26.939> those<00:01:27.380> universal<00:01:28.380> plugs<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.880> AC<00:01:30.090> plugs

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of those universal plugs the AC plugs

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.039 
of those universal plugs the AC plugs
and<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.049> works<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.329> super<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.540> well<00:01:33.840> as
