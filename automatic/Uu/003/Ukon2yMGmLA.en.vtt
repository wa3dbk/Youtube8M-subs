00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
actually use is olive juice it's a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
actually use is olive juice it's a
byproduct<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> olive<00:00:32.309> oil<00:00:32.579> process<00:00:33.210> so

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
byproduct of the olive oil process so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.959 
byproduct of the olive oil process so
it's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> sustainable<00:00:34.230> process<00:00:34.550> what<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it's a sustainable process what we do is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.510 
it's a sustainable process what we do is
we<00:00:36.090> add<00:00:36.239> some<00:00:36.480> sweetener<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.370> some<00:00:38.370> ginger

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
we add some sweetener and some ginger

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
we add some sweetener and some ginger
lime<00:00:38.820> flavor<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> product<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
lime flavor to the product so that it is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
lime flavor to the product so that it is
palatable<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.510> tastes<00:00:42.780> good<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
palatable and that it tastes good and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
palatable and that it tastes good and
refreshing<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> juice<00:00:44.010> itself<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
refreshing all of juice itself is a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
refreshing all of juice itself is a
byproduct<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.050> olive<00:00:46.350> production<00:00:46.800> in

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
byproduct of the olive production in

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.889 
byproduct of the olive production in
Spain<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> facilities

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
Spain because they have the facilities

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.290 
Spain because they have the facilities
out<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:50.760> import<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
out there to do that we import that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.450 
out there to do that we import that
juice<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.320> manufacture<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> Los

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
juice here and we manufacture out of Los

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
dream to eventually import extra virgin
olive<00:01:01.620> oil<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.160> Greece<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.329> asked

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
olive oil from Greece so when he asked

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
olive oil from Greece so when he asked
me<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.750> research<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.500> information<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.040> how<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
me to research the information on how to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.219 
me to research the information on how to
do<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.880> came<00:01:06.030> across<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.540> statistic<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
do that I came across a statistic that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.410 
do that I came across a statistic that
said<00:01:07.590> virtually<00:01:08.549> no<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> per<00:01:09.270> capita

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
said virtually no one on a per capita

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.600 
said virtually no one on a per capita
basis<00:01:10.020> consumes<00:01:10.439> olive<00:01:10.740> oil<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> United

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
basis consumes olive oil in the United

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
basis consumes olive oil in the United
States<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.630> no<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.380> getting<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
States so no one here is getting the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
States so no one here is getting the
nutritional<00:01:14.159> value<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.520> olive<00:01:14.939> oil<00:01:15.170> but<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
nutritional value of olive oil but they

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
nutritional value of olive oil but they
do<00:01:16.320> drink<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.920> beverages<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.820> looked

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
do drink a lot of beverages so I looked

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.800 
do drink a lot of beverages so I looked
up<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.049> researched<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:20.070> quite<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> bit<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
up and researched for quite a bit how to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.999 
up and researched for quite a bit how to
kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> fuse<00:01:22.110> those<00:01:22.259> two<00:01:22.500> products<00:01:22.890> together

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
kind of fuse those two products together

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
kind of fuse those two products together
so<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.670> deliver<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> nutritional<00:01:24.840> value

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so we can deliver the nutritional value

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
so we can deliver the nutritional value
of<00:01:25.340> all<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.369> two<00:01:26.700> people<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> United

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
of all the two people here in the United

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.880 
of all the two people here in the United
States<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.409> doing<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.710> first
