00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.860
 the list may even be a little long but 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.780
 the way of preparation is very simple 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.539
 The first step is to remove the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.430
 onion and margarine when 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.100
 Add the tomatoes and peppers

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.689
 shredded and paprika not stop stirring 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.939
 then place the broth of the fish that 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.429
 was cooked to give more flavor 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.130
 now let's just put the milk 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.200
 a creaminess and become much stronger 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.490
 it was environmental 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.490
 the five days of carnival 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.810
 add macaxeira and the grated carrot 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.830
 now I'll put the cookie and the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.900
 coriander that smell comes all natural 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 ok origin 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.990
 the recipe for rosÃ© broth has two 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.630
 secrets 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.450
 the first one she is going to show cooking now 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.060
 in secret to this, and I am sorry 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.080
 roasted is one of the ingredients that will 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.060
 give more energy was lion 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.080
 also more power with the folio 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.690
 hello the carnival 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.690
 then let the broth boil for 20 minutes. 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.560
 minutes on low heat 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.570
 now I will put the only salt you put 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.950
 August 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.710
 to finish this first 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.130
 part of the revenue, which is added to 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:10.200
 Finish the crushed quail egg 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:11.820
 already the kitchen as broth is with 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.550
 creamy consistency 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.690
 This is the second secret rosinha that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.490
 so the vein 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.700
 she chose an ingredient because the 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.770
 fiber rich cereal helps digestion 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.130
 so how do you then use the vein 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:30.240
 I'll dilute her on the led to stay longer 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:34.850
 soft and gives a much better consistency 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.850
 always stirring tanna evolve 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.650
 from let the broth boil for another 20 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 minutes and is ready to be 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.040
 served 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.120
 this amount yields up to eight servings 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.159
 like this 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.260

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.269
