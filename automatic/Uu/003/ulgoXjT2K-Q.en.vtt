intake manifold it's a very elegant
design<00:05:39.540> solution<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.680> still<00:05:40.890> allows<00:05:41.100> the

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
design solution and it still allows the

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.070 
design solution and it still allows the
engine<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.550> be<00:05:41.700> compact<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.930> put<00:05:43.050> a

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
engine to be compact to put a

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.480 
engine to be compact to put a

supercharger on a four cylinder engine

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.219 
supercharger on a four cylinder engine
and<00:05:44.940> not<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.510> much<00:05:45.690> because<00:05:45.900> it's<00:05:46.110> like

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
and not so much because it's like

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.990 
and not so much because it's like
driving<00:05:46.470> another<00:05:46.740> accessory<00:05:47.250> like<00:05:47.880> an

driving another accessory like an

driving another accessory like an
alternator<00:05:48.390> for<00:05:48.570> example<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:50.160> may<00:05:50.310> be

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
alternator for example so it may be

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.290 
alternator for example so it may be
worthwhile<00:05:50.669> to<00:05:50.790> look<00:05:51.000> at<00:05:51.090> some<00:05:51.240> other

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
worthwhile to look at some other

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669

are we going to see both it's quite
possible<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.580> there<00:06:05.970> are<00:06:06.090> some<00:06:06.330> who<00:06:06.510> have<00:06:07.140> put

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
possible and there are some who have put

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.740 
possible and there are some who have put
them<00:06:07.979> together<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.580> you<00:06:09.060> know<00:06:09.330> in<00:06:09.419> terms<00:06:09.570> of

the supercharger vs. turbocharger that

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.690 
the supercharger vs. turbocharger that
neat<00:06:12.240> thing<00:06:12.510> about<00:06:12.680> turbochargers<00:06:13.680> is<00:06:13.860> that

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
neat thing about turbochargers is that

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.300 
neat thing about turbochargers is that
you're<00:06:14.940> reusing<00:06:15.450> energy<00:06:16.350> in<00:06:16.620> the<00:06:16.740> exhaust<00:06:16.979> gas

you're reusing energy in the exhaust gas
that<00:06:17.580> otherwise<00:06:18.000> would<00:06:18.270> be<00:06:18.300> wasted<00:06:18.900> and<00:06:19.080> then

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
that otherwise would be wasted and then
