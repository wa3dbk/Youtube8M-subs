00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Welcome to the video there very much 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.859
 many people have asked like me 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.270
 currently a helmet camera where like that 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.010
 I worked with the microphone 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.440
 I thought I 'll make my little video 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.570
 and show how the moment the microphone 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.009
 Camera and everything attached is a lot of fun 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.049
 the first problem was already the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.880
 set the camera correctly because this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 at home, of course, slightly down 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 looks and the camera then right 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 It was easy to adjust in the ground 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.680
 has to be worked by the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.869
 just slightly upwards 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.609
 I have the camera I have the eyelets 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 tightened with the screwdriver 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.210
 so that nothing can get away from that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 I can not save it and keep it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 I also have everything wonderful the camera 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.329
 just outside but we can do it now 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.760
 again a do currently I use 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.780
 still the waterproof backplate why 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 I probably do not know because 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 l was still in the rhine lately and because 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.059
 at the moment it is raining a lot 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.950
 safety first 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.780
 Let's take a look at where that is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.149
 microphone are i have in the reason 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.510
 placed just below my mouth so 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.640
 no wind noise can be heard and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.260
 that does not bother me while talking 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.490
 then I have the cable under the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 done under the disguise of inhibitors 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.150
 well, i just wanted that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.600
 cable then almost backwards on mine 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.460
 Back rauslÃ¤uft so I go back and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.869
 wobble with the names or even at 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.479
 helmet does not take off the cable 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.220
 tear off one sees so at least halfway 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.530
 I stuck going again 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 outside along the edge and stops too 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.909
 wonderful on the microphone you can see the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.020
 small windscreen small schwamendingen 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.040
 that's awesome that so almost all 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.590
 Noises in the not always bright 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.079
 are and just great to recommend 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 the use of as the CoBox unfortunately 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.829
 no jack connection I needed 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.159
 a splitter around the whole on the phone 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.399
 connect once the inputs 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.470
 from audio input and audio output divides 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.479
 needs to mate with the train on mate 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.969
 cost euro 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.860
 because cell phones have a record so the 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.930
 Plug with input and output 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.170
 at the same time and to share that once 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.719
 yes you need such a plug here see 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.160
 you at least that's why I'm with 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.470
 a very normal app on my take 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.459
 sound I'm in the camera and the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.569
 app at the same time 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.370
 I can do some in this app 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 make adjustments such as 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.000
 Noise reduction and such a stuff 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.319
 unfortunately you do not have to look good now 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.730
 Just trust it, you can also do that 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.739
 Adjust level what you actually 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.209
 he does not need the headset with that 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.349
 small microphone really super loud that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.930
 At first I thought so but it 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.400
 works great same trick 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.019
 Brillant up such a helmet too 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.940
 recommend you can almost the helmet 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.099
 without touching down on the cable 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.900
 I also attached it so that I can 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.360
 can down and make it up 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.920
 that it does not bother me and that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.470
 it does not tear off everything again 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.680
 a couple of tape data packed and 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.380
 it keeps relatively good because I'm straight 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.489
 ask what I take the whole so 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.079
 I do not take that with the little one 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.360
 but I take it with me 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.610
 tvv is a big diaphragm microphone too 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.600
 great to recommend the scooter ride 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.519
 maybe a bit big 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.280
 You see the articles I give you 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.670
 sees, inter alia, the camera the 3.5 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.630
 mm jack and the microphone everything 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 in the description what you guys 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.950
 interested and have fun with the scooter 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.720
 a lot of fun on youtube and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.620

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.620
 microphone and the camera
