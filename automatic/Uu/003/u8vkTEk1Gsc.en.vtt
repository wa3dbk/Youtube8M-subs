00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.529
 in this video I want to prove that the root 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.009
 square of 2 and irrational and I'll do 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.669
 through evidence of contradiction to 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.349
 proof for contradiction is prepared 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.990
 assuming the post 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.250
 this is our goal but for the good 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.300
 of our test 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.080
 let's assume the opposite let's assume that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.029
 the square root of 2 is rational and see if 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.400
 leads to a contradiction that in fact 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.470
 can not be the case this can not be the 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.690
 in case it is rational to reach a 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.190
 contradiction assuming that the square root 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.990
 of 2 and rational 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.780
 we have to deduce that the root 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.060
 square of 2 should be rational then 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.990
 Let's take over the post. 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.880
 the square root of 2 is rational 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.490
 good if the square root of 2 and rational 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.070
 means we can write the root 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.100
 square of 2 as the ratio of two 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.339
 Whole aa ebe also gives to assume 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.259
 that they do not have common factors 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.299
 let's say they had some factors 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.100
 in common to divide the numerator and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.960
 denominator for those same factors 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.329
 then you are coming in a situation where 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.810
 they do not have factors in common or other 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.670
 way of saying is that a and b are prime 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 or another way of saying it is that people 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 can write as a ratio of two 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.490
 where it is irreducible and these are not 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.289
 share no other factor if 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.640
 able to write anything like the 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.890
 two integer ratio 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 then it can obviously simplify and more 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.310
 late to bill any common factor for 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.679
 get a point where it is irreducible 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.990
 I will assume that my a and b of this fraction is 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.329
 irreducible and this is important for 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.329
 prepare our contradiction 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:54.479
 I will assume that is irreducible not b 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.189
 have factors in common let write 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 because it is very important for 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.619
 this proof and let it do the same thing 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.220
 a and b have no other factors in 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:14.630
 do not have other factors in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.630
 common besides I think one is 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.670
 irreducible 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.000
 these two numbers are prime 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.860
 What does this mean for people to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.920
 people will try to manipulate a little 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.570
 Let's square the two sides 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.910
 of this equation will then be placed 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.560
 main root from 2 squared will 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.440
 get 2 and will be equal to squared 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.570
 about to the square and seeing the envelope b o 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.910
 square that the same thing as the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.010
 square on square 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.490
 now we can multiply both sides 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:57.700
 the square and so we get two 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:01.510
 times squared equals aal 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.620
 square what does this tell us about 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.590
 square is any number b to the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.750
 square times 2 anything times 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.750
 two will be the integer 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.860
 we assume that b is an integer then b to 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.540
 square 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.060
 must be an integer and you have a 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.580
 whole times 2 this should give you a 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.500
 Even this number should give you a number 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.970
 to 1 squared should be the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.010
 squared 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.340
 It must be because one is interesting 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.940
 square is the product of two numbers or 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.420
 is the product of the same number is to warn is 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.650
 another way of saying that to warn 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.680
 And what does this tell us about it? 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.260
 just remember the may be we are 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.280
 Assuming there is an integer a can be 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.630
 for the tie 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.300
 We have to remember that if 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.020
 multiply an even number of times a 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.010
 number we get a number to 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.239
 multiply 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.360
 a draw times a draw we get a 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.790
 odd number has a number times it 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.410
 we even get an odd number 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.600
 way to get that and if that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.660
 number for pa 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:26.260
 so that said paddle is in qa and otherwise 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.150
 to say that the epa is to say that it can 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.620
 to be 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:40.620
 as the product of 2 times some integer 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:42.720
 say some integer good here and where 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.669
 It's up to us, how are you going to see it? 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.289
 People can use it to show that bb 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.150
 should also be pair 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.949
 so let's think about this a little bit let's go 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.830
 back to this step here 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.720
 if you say that it can be represented 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.389
 as twice the product of some 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.710
 whole and that comes from the fact that the 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:05.669
 to rewrite this expression as 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:13.949
 two and I will do it as 2 times b ao 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:15.630
 square is equal to 2k squared instead 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:20.220
 from squared 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.320
 I can write 2k squared 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.539
 we are saying or deducing that assuming 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.120
 that we have just assumed that there is 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.030
 is partial and even can be represented 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.940
 as a product of 2 and some integer and 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:39.349
 gives to write than 2 times the b 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:42.599
 square is equal to 4 squared 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:47.120
 square and video car both sides 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:53.729
 by two and gets b squared equals 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:56.599
 2call square and tell us good 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.699
 square kao will be an integer 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:02.340
 You take any integer times 2 and it goes 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.909
 get a value for and tells us that bell 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.570
 square to the b-squared dial 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:11.900
 and if squares are pa 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:15.680
 by the same logic that we have just used 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:19.400
 This tells us that the bÃª pa 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:24.210
 so here is our contradiction 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:27.419
 we assume at first that a and b do not 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.199
 have common factors beyond 1 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:34.949
 we assume that this fraction a over b is 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.139
 irreducible but of this and the fact that 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.870
 there is about b must be equal to root 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.020
 square of two we can deduce that 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.710
 a hepatitis b 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.849
 pa if it is for b shovel and both have two 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.889
 as a factor 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.990
 so it's not irreducible you can 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.129
 divide the numerator and a denominator by 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:59.229
 2 a and b has a common factor of two 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:07:06.789
 just to make it clear then and 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:12.159
 we have that a and b with the factor 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:15.639
 this common factor of two means 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:17.009
 about b is reducible and this is the 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:20.220
 contradiction 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:23.250
 you assume that a square root of 2 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.930
 can be represented as a fraction 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.940
 irreducible from a to b irreducible 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.550
 because you can say that the ratio of two 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.090
 the contradiction that in the 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:37.599
 truth can be so not reducible 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.909
 can make this assumption this leads to a 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:42.810
 The square root contradiction of 2 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:42.810
 to be irrational
