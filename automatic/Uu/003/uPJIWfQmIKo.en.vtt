pins on the bottom here for your USB and

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.819 
pins on the bottom here for your USB and
audio<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.739> on<00:03:17.359> you've<00:03:18.359> got<00:03:18.569> eight<00:03:19.500> slots

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
audio and so on you've got eight slots

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.500 
audio and so on you've got eight slots
for<00:03:20.160> your<00:03:20.220> ddr's<00:03:22.579> like<00:03:23.579> said<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.209> can<00:03:24.389> be

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
for your ddr's like said this bit can be

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.599 
for your ddr's like said this bit can be
removed<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.109> it<00:03:25.200> can<00:03:25.350> install<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.160> optional

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
only a small fan and like says this is

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.310 
only a small fan and like says this is
optional<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.910> probably<00:03:42.690> won't<00:03:42.930> need<00:03:43.110> it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
optional so you probably won't need it

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
edge is angled like that like so you get

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.610 
edge is angled like that like so you get
six<00:05:17.320> of<00:05:17.410> these<00:05:18.900> I'll<00:05:19.900> just<00:05:20.110> quickly<00:05:20.290> show<00:05:20.440> you

how<00:05:20.770> these<00:05:21.130> dust<00:05:22.030> cups<00:05:22.120> work<00:05:22.720> each<00:05:23.500> one<00:05:23.770> of

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
how these dust cups work each one of

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.130 
how these dust cups work each one of
them<00:05:24.010> has<00:05:24.130> got<00:05:24.490> if<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.210> can<00:05:25.390> read<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.810> very

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
them has got if you can read that a very

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.690 
them has got if you can read that a very
small<00:05:27.930> explanation<00:05:28.930> for<00:05:29.650> where<00:05:29.890> you<00:05:30.400> need<00:05:30.550> to

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
small explanation for where you need to

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.160 
small explanation for where you need to
plug<00:05:30.850> them<00:05:31.000> in<00:05:32.640> so<00:05:33.640> this<00:05:34.000> one<00:05:34.240> goes<00:05:34.570> in<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.930> USB

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
plug them in so this one goes in the USB

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.170 
plug them in so this one goes in the USB
slots<00:05:36.030> you<00:05:37.030> just<00:05:37.270> push<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:37.960> in<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.940> that's

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
slots you just push it in and that's

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.860 
slots you just push it in and that's
covered<00:05:41.670> so<00:05:42.670> any<00:05:42.850> slot<00:05:43.270> so<00:05:43.420> you're<00:05:43.540> not<00:05:43.630> yours

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
covered so any slot so you're not yours

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.960 
covered so any slot so you're not yours
in<00:05:44.110> putting<00:05:44.500> these<00:05:44.560> cups<00:05:44.890> on<00:05:45.130> they'll<00:05:45.790> out

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
in putting these cups on they'll out

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.670 
in putting these cups on they'll out
make<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.180> look<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:46.540> bit<00:05:46.690> more<00:05:46.810> tidy<00:05:47.290> and<00:05:47.440> keep

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
make it look a bit more tidy and keep

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
feel a lot more solid and it's a lot

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.050 
feel a lot more solid and it's a lot
more<00:05:58.810> easier<00:05:59.200> to<00:05:59.260> handle<00:05:59.740> as<00:05:59.860> well<00:05:59.910> you<00:06:00.910> don't

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
more easier to handle as well you don't

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.280 
more easier to handle as well you don't
have<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.240> worry<00:06:01.420> about<00:06:01.540> touching<00:06:01.990> any<00:06:02.140> eight

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
have to worry about touching any eight

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.040 
have to worry about touching any eight
pins<00:06:05.880> I'll<00:06:06.880> just<00:06:07.150> show<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.360> some<00:06:07.540> of<00:06:07.930> the

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
pins I'll just show you some of the

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.020 
pins I'll just show you some of the
bigger<00:06:08.710> dust<00:06:08.950> cup<00:06:09.190> covers<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:09.640> you<00:06:09.700> get<00:06:09.880> with

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
bigger dust cup covers that you get with

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.350 
bigger dust cup covers that you get with
these<00:06:10.120> for<00:06:10.480> their<00:06:10.630> PCIe<00:06:11.200> slot<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:11.920> the<00:06:12.360> RAM

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
these for their PCIe slot and the RAM

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.760 
these for their PCIe slot and the RAM
slots<00:06:15.810> these<00:06:16.810> are<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.080> biggest<00:06:17.260> ones<00:06:17.530> these

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
slots these are the biggest ones these

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.250 
slots these are the biggest ones these
that<00:06:17.980> these<00:06:18.130> will<00:06:18.280> cover<00:06:18.520> your<00:06:18.670> RAM<00:06:18.820> slots<00:06:19.260> and

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
that these will cover your RAM slots and

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.720 
that these will cover your RAM slots and
about<00:06:20.530> you're<00:06:20.620> not<00:06:20.710> using<00:06:20.890> you<00:06:21.190> got<00:06:21.310> far<00:06:21.550> with

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
about you're not using you got far with

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.180 
about you're not using you got far with
this<00:06:22.050> you<00:06:23.050> can<00:06:23.200> cover<00:06:23.530> any<00:06:23.740> of<00:06:23.890> that<00:06:24.070> you're

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
this you can cover any of that you're

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:31.140 
this you can cover any of that you're
not<00:06:24.340> using<00:06:29.340> you're<00:06:30.340> just<00:06:30.520> simply<00:06:30.670> slot<00:06:31.030> them

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
not using you're just simply slot them

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.450 
not using you're just simply slot them
in<00:06:31.300> similar<00:06:32.230> to<00:06:32.380> what<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:32.710> would<00:06:33.040> do<00:06:33.220> if<00:06:33.370> it

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
in similar to what you would do if it

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:48.159 
in similar to what you would do if it
were<00:06:33.610> just<00:06:33.730> normal<00:06:33.940> Ram

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.300 

and<00:06:48.710> there<00:06:48.830> we<00:06:48.949> have<00:06:49.069> their<00:06:49.280> PCIe<00:06:49.819> slot<00:06:50.270> covers

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
and there we have their PCIe slot covers

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.570 
and there we have their PCIe slot covers
which<00:06:52.310> again<00:06:52.610> these<00:06:52.909> are<00:06:53.830> very<00:06:54.830> easy<00:06:54.949> to<00:06:55.400> use

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
which again these are very easy to use

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.140 
which again these are very easy to use
you<00:06:55.699> just<00:06:55.969> simply<00:06:56.360> push<00:06:57.139> them<00:06:57.289> into<00:06:57.469> place<00:06:57.740> and

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
you just simply push them into place and

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.489 
you just simply push them into place and
then<00:06:59.150> if<00:06:59.689> you<00:06:59.810> need<00:06:59.960> to<00:07:00.080> remove<00:07:00.169> them<00:07:00.469> just

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:00.499 
then if you need to remove them just

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:06.670 
then if you need to remove them just
simply<00:07:00.889> pull<00:07:01.249> them<00:07:01.310> back<00:07:01.460> out<00:07:05.409> quick<00:07:06.409> and<00:07:06.439> easy

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
simply pull them back out quick and easy

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.469 
simply pull them back out quick and easy
where<00:07:06.949> to<00:07:07.099> cover<00:07:07.310> any<00:07:07.520> ear<00:07:07.699> slots<00:07:08.120> make<00:07:08.360> it

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
where to cover any ear slots make it

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.929 
where to cover any ear slots make it
looked<00:07:08.659> idea<00:07:09.080> any<00:07:09.860> on<00:07:10.129> your<00:07:10.310> slot<00:07:10.639> so<00:07:10.819> you're

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:10.939 
looked idea any on your slot so you're
