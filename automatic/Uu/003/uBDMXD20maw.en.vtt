00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.490
 jo now the little solo I have 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.199
 a little simplified in the original are one 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.760
 a few sixteenths in there but mine 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.660
 opinion for the melody in 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.460
 the solo completely does not matter that way 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.320
 We'll put that little one right away 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.649
 It's a four-day little solo 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.249
 so really relaxed you lay down 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.989
 beginning with the index finger on the top 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.489
 both sides in the third and the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.499
 made little bary who grabs in 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.809
 third and today's the de and im 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:51.460
 on the upper side , enter the g 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.309
 the teach g string itself played teach 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.760
 said so now you start to tap 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:03.519
 on the high e string and pluck it 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:07.180
 sound down once so de the b and 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:12.220
 the g string and then I go again 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:16.900
 back to the b or a side that would be the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 one and two and now I take that 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.510
 small finger or the ring finger 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 I will not know how I do that 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.270
 made is relatively no matter the lay 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.330
 We then go to the finish time 3 in the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.310
 fifth and high e strings it 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.300
 played the note aaa and then we twitch 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.300
 the same again 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.000
 that's the first beat of him 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.070
 solo 1234 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.480
 so now we go back to the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.280
 little finger disappears again 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.130
 second clock have we here again 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.290
 this index finger over the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.690
 both sides over the both over the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.820
 hard side and we kill this 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.220
 chord this time we beat the three 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.940
 sides completely together so to hope 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.789
 that no longer singly and then play 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.740
 We also have 48 on the two and we pack 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.010
 the little finger again in the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.230
 five bund to the high e side so 1 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.340
 and 2 and there comes the little finger 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.650
 then again or the a 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.940
 that would be on the target time three 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.470
 Let's not turn the models over 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.550
 then we take the small one 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.489
 finger away and play on the 3 and 4 4 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.540
 and again 38 and again the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.540
 normal grip in the third 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.030
 pretty easy 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.280
 we do that 1 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.450
 on 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 so in the third step we play that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.660
 actually such a similar if the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.420
 again just how do you play something 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.580
 otherwise , we play the accord with the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.410
 index finger on currently 1 and 2 on the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.160
 two we go with the little one 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.890
 finger in the five minutes and him 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:22.739
 will hit there at 22 and and until the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:24.450
 3 is that there and on the 3 and take 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.290
 we take him away and play now too 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.510
 still on the 4th 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:36.620
 and on the 4th and that means the third 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.620
 act this solus I do very slowly 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.500
 since one understands so now comes one only 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.030
 a little tricky passage so we go 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.380
 now with the index finger in that too 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.330
 the last day of solo already with the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.930
 Forefinger we go to the fourth 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.360
 bunch to the side that's the note 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.860
 and I would then ring the finger 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.600
 that is relatively important because we still have it 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.450
 a small melody install the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.090
 ring finger in the fifth bunch to h 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.769
 side grab so we currently 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.579
 Prison is recommended on the b page 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.130
 The ring finger is in the fifth fret 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.680
 on the hair side and then we play 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.570
 this now also a quad as 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:35.460
 Interval we also play for 38 long 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.780
 to 2 on the two and there we take the 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.570
 middle finger that is still free and 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.250
 pack the fifth bund to the b 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.250
 page on the note c 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.410
 that's all we still do 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.420
 a bit he sounds like or himself 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.190
 that already trusts can try 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.040
 to make a little vibrato by ourselves 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.200
 the fingers moved a little bit up and down 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.950
 because the sound is over tied to one 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:11.830
 fittest sounds relatively long so and 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:14.200
 At the moment we can do 4 in the 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.480
 12 and on the front page stop and 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.470
 make a little sorry and then 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.470
 we go again bring out 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.120
 theoretically yes that's already one 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.680
 slide the many guitarists like to do 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 just to stop the parties 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.290
 sticking to each other so that it is 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.900
 Does not sound like you are now 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.510
 one part behind the other very rough 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:40.930
 plays and that's what they do here too 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:42.100
 that would be a rhythmic then 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.040
 I'm back in the refrain I play 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:50.340
 Slowly the solo in a row 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.340
 away 123 41 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.009
 No 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.430
 small 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:12.139
 for frank again maybe with 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:12.139
 a more relaxed 1234 sound 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.810
 and with a bit of practice, you can get it 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.740
 this little solo i believe 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.100
 actually go 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.620
 So I think that is feasible yes and 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.180
 as I said after the solo you go I 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.120
 already said it is always in 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.910
 he plays the refrain and he plays 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.430
 through again and then there again 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.100
 on the 3 break with the refrain and then 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.389
 at the end of the fund comes the 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.370
 At the beginning , it just just stopped again 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.680
 in repetition and very connected by 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.630
 He plays the original auditor for the song 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.449
 because at the beginning of five we play 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.860
 always a g1 de and a c that played 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.270
 the whole in the end just so that you 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.370
 just finish the last chord 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.590
 leaves 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.030
 the c so the song is listening to a tent 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.240
 on 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.240
 have fun
