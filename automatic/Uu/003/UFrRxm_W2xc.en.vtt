surprised<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.240> he<00:01:24.420> had<00:01:24.840> flipped<00:01:25.170> again<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
surprised that he had flipped again and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.450 
surprised that he had flipped again and
like<00:01:26.850> she<00:01:27.119> said<00:01:27.420> she<00:01:28.110> doesn't<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.530> when<00:01:28.920> he

like she said she doesn't know when he

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
like she said she doesn't know when he

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
went into the breech position so he

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
went into the breech position so he
could<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.340> been<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.090> about<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
week and then flips back down but it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
belly band tightly around my belly to

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.350 
belly band tightly around my belly to
try<00:02:19.129> to<00:02:19.190> hold<00:02:19.700> him<00:02:20.000> down<00:02:21.549> so<00:02:22.549> he<00:02:22.730> doesn't<00:02:22.760> flip

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
try to hold him down so he doesn't flip

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.680 
try to hold him down so he doesn't flip
again<00:02:24.069> we<00:02:25.069> did<00:02:25.280> talk<00:02:25.489> about<00:02:25.549> induction<00:02:26.540> as

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
again we did talk about induction as

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.270 
again we did talk about induction as
well<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.310> do<00:02:28.430> get<00:02:29.390> induced<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.769> will<00:02:31.069> be

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
well and if I do get induced it will be

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.990 
well and if I do get induced it will be
July<00:02:31.579> 3rd<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:32.769> think<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.980> don't<00:02:34.370> hold<00:02:34.640> me<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.819> that

July 3rd I think I don't hold me to that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.619 
July 3rd I think I don't hold me to that

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
trying everything to try to start labor

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.759 
trying everything to try to start labor

naturally I am due in one week so we're
trying<00:03:01.010> everything<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.850> am<00:03:01.880> at<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.299> two

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
trying everything and I am at a two

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.780 
trying everything and I am at a two
centimeter<00:03:02.980> high<00:03:03.980> I'm<00:03:04.099> two<00:03:04.310> centimeters

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
centimeter high I'm two centimeters

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.729 
centimeter high I'm two centimeters
dilated<00:03:04.970> which<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.690> went<00:03:05.989> into<00:03:06.109> labor<00:03:06.319> with<00:03:06.560> my

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
dilated which I went into labor with my

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.740 
dilated which I went into labor with my
at<00:03:06.920> only<00:03:07.130> one<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.549> half<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.209> could<00:03:08.480> go

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
at only one and a half so I could go

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.370 
at only one and a half so I could go
into<00:03:09.410> labor<00:03:09.739> any<00:03:09.859> time<00:03:10.400> basically<00:03:11.200> it's<00:03:12.200> just

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
into labor any time basically it's just

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.800 
into labor any time basically it's just
the<00:03:13.370> fact<00:03:13.639> of<00:03:13.819> what<00:03:13.970> no<00:03:14.209> one's<00:03:14.389> ready<00:03:14.660> I

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
the fact of what no one's ready I

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.110 
the fact of what no one's ready I
personally<00:03:15.410> think<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.160> might<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.459> next<00:03:16.849> week

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
personally think it might be next week

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.569 
personally think it might be next week
right<00:03:17.299> before<00:03:17.630> my<00:03:17.720> due<00:03:17.780> date<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.340> think

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
right before my due date I don't think

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.979 
right before my due date I don't think
I'll<00:03:19.700> have<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.150> induced<00:03:20.389> but<00:03:20.690> that's

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
I'll have to be induced but that's

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.940 
I'll have to be induced but that's
obviously<00:03:21.590> an<00:03:22.569> option<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.870> same<00:03:24.709> with<00:03:24.859> a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
obviously an option and same with a

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.979 
obviously an option and same with a
c-section<00:03:25.340> when<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.730> go<00:03:25.970> into<00:03:26.120> labor<00:03:26.359> they<00:03:26.750> have

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
c-section when I go into labor they have

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.220 
c-section when I go into labor they have
to<00:03:27.139> do<00:03:27.230> another<00:03:27.500> ultrasound<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.810> make<00:03:29.810> sure

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
to do another ultrasound and make sure

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.259 
to do another ultrasound and make sure
and<00:03:30.739> make<00:03:31.000> sure<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.359> he<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:32.989> head<00:03:33.349> down<00:03:33.380> so

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
and make sure that he is head down so

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.909 
and make sure that he is head down so
c-section<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.480> still<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:35.959> possibility<00:03:36.260> we

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
c-section is still a possibility we

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.220 
c-section is still a possibility we
can't<00:03:37.190> completely<00:03:37.819> say<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.569> c-section<00:03:38.810> is

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
can't completely say that c-section is

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.520 
can't completely say that c-section is
not<00:03:39.760> even<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.030> picture<00:03:41.150> because<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:42.079> is<00:03:42.380> in

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
not even in the picture because it is in

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.129 
not even in the picture because it is in
the<00:03:42.620> picture<00:03:42.950> about<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:44.150> would<00:03:44.209> say<00:03:44.359> 40%

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
the picture about I would say 40%

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.320 
the picture about I would say 40%
because

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
because

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.990 
because
it's<00:03:46.600> flippin<00:03:47.460> especially<00:03:48.460> so<00:03:48.640> late<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
it's flippin especially so late in the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000 
it's flippin especially so late in the
pregnancy<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.810> he's<00:03:49.960> flipping<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.710> so

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
pregnancy and he's flipping like this so

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.370 
pregnancy and he's flipping like this so
I<00:03:51.280> would<00:03:51.670> say<00:03:51.790> there's<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> 40%<00:03:52.480> chance<00:03:52.990> that<00:03:53.290> we

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
I would say there's a 40% chance that we

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.260 
I would say there's a 40% chance that we
could<00:03:53.500> still<00:03:53.740> have<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.920> c-section<00:03:54.130> feels<00:03:54.880> kind

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
could still have a c-section feels kind

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.290 
could still have a c-section feels kind
of<00:03:55.390> scary<00:03:55.650> I'm<00:03:56.650> hoping<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.310> he<00:03:57.640> stays<00:03:57.940> down

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
of scary I'm hoping that he stays down

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.640 
of scary I'm hoping that he stays down
I'm<00:03:58.630> hoping<00:03:58.960> that<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.170> go<00:03:59.350> into<00:03:59.470> labor

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
I'm hoping that I go into labor

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.080 
I'm hoping that I go into labor
naturally<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.460> don't<00:04:00.640> have<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:00.970> get

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
naturally and I don't have to get

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.350 
naturally and I don't have to get
induced<00:04:01.560> but<00:04:02.560> yeah<00:04:03.340> we<00:04:03.550> just<00:04:03.700> want<00:04:03.970> no<00:04:04.180> one

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
kind of stressful but kind of relieved

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.430 
kind of stressful but kind of relieved
that<00:04:11.470> he<00:04:12.130> was<00:04:12.310> head<00:04:12.520> down<00:04:12.700> but<00:04:13.110> it's<00:04:14.110> kind<00:04:14.380> of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
that he was head down but it's kind of
