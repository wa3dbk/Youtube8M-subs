00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
down on it nothing really happens you

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.890 
down on it nothing really happens you
feel<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.860> pressure<00:02:03.100> but<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:04.180> really<00:02:04.600> didn't

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
feel the pressure but it really didn't

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.290

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
kind of hard to kickstart if it hasn't

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.590 
kind of hard to kickstart if it hasn't
been<00:02:14.830> running<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.280> while<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.210> doesn't
