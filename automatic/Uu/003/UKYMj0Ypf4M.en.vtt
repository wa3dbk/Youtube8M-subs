00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
comments but I've always looked at it

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.709 
comments but I've always looked at it
like<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.279> as<00:00:32.460> Super<00:00:33.059> Saiyan<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.480> being

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
like that as Super Saiyan for being

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.200 
like that as Super Saiyan for being
stronger<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.739> can't<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.160> how<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.760> Super

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
stronger I just can't see how the Super

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.020 
stronger I just can't see how the Super
Saiyan<00:00:36.360> God<00:00:36.510> forms<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.910> thousands<00:00:38.910> and

these new forms being quite that strong
it<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.030> isn't<00:00:48.210> shown<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.500> me<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.890> was

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it just isn't shown to me if that was

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.670 
it just isn't shown to me if that was
the<00:00:50.370> case<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.760> mean<00:00:51.260> those<00:00:52.260> films<00:00:52.620> would

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680

actually<00:00:54.719> had<00:00:54.989> turned<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> suppose<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.039> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
actually had turned out I suppose I just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.099 
actually had turned out I suppose I just
think<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.480> clear<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> me<00:00:58.020> at

think that it's more clear to me at

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.770 
think that it's more clear to me at
Super<00:00:58.350> Saiyan<00:00:58.530> 4<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.489> stronger<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.539> not

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
Super Saiyan 4 is stronger it's not

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
Super Saiyan 4 is stronger it's not
obviously<00:01:01.760> concrete<00:01:02.760> evidence<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.390> nothing

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
obviously concrete evidence or nothing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.820 
obviously concrete evidence or nothing
and<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.470> concrete

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and there's not going to be concrete

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.109 
and there's not going to be concrete
evidence<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.369> either<00:01:05.489> side

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
