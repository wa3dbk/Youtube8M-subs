like<00:00:00.930> it<00:00:01.020> comes<00:00:01.230> up<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.879> how<00:00:02.879> much<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.149> this

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
like it comes up to how much is this

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:14.180 
like it comes up to how much is this
showing<00:00:05.480> 18.6<00:00:06.980> climbing<00:00:07.980> 19<00:00:09.200> I<00:00:12.799> guess<00:00:13.799> that's

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
showing 18.6 climbing 19 I guess that's

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.510 
showing 18.6 climbing 19 I guess that's
the<00:00:14.250> cool<00:00:14.519> thing<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.059> HHR<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:17.400> it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the cool thing about the HHR is that it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.920 
the cool thing about the HHR is that it
tells<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:19.460> how<00:00:20.460> far<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
tells you how far you can go on the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.320 
tells you how far you can go on the
amount<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.170> gas<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
amount of gas that you have and the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.099 
amount of gas that you have and the
speed<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:26.689> just<00:00:27.689> options

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
speed that you're going just options

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:37.819 
speed that you're going just options
nice<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:32.570> I<00:00:34.460> think<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:36.149> best<00:00:36.660> I've<00:00:37.590> been

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
nice to have I think at best I've been

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.990 
nice to have I think at best I've been
able<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.670> gas<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:40.070> about<00:00:41.070> 500<00:00:41.760> miles

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
able to do with gas is about 500 miles

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
able to do with gas is about 500 miles
on<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> tank<00:00:44.450> under<00:00:45.450> ideal<00:00:45.840> conditions<00:00:46.760> freeway

on a tank under ideal conditions freeway
speeds<00:00:48.149> no<00:00:48.570> stopping

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.610 

what<00:00:55.789> about<00:00:55.850> during<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.210> city<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.550> city

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
what about during the city and the city

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.980 
what about during the city and the city
our<00:01:00.620> best<00:01:01.190> average<00:01:02.050> was<00:01:03.050> about<00:01:03.379> 24<00:01:04.190> 25<00:01:05.150> miles

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
our best average was about 24 25 miles

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.840 
our best average was about 24 25 miles
per<00:01:06.200> gallon<00:01:06.500> miles<00:01:06.680> per<00:01:06.950> gallon<00:01:07.250> that's<00:01:07.640> about

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
per gallon miles per gallon that's about

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.890 
per gallon miles per gallon that's about
honey<00:01:08.090> miles<00:01:08.860> full<00:01:09.860> tank<00:01:10.100> Oh

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.810 

really<00:01:15.030> about<00:01:16.650> 360<00:01:17.650> something<00:01:18.070> like<00:01:18.220> that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
really about 360 something like that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.950 
really about 360 something like that
okay<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:19.920> 360<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.600> 500<00:01:22.860> miles<00:01:23.860> per<00:01:24.130> gallon

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
okay so 360 to 500 miles per gallon

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.750 
okay so 360 to 500 miles per gallon
miles<00:01:25.960> on<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.800> full<00:01:27.340> tank<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.640> gas<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.580> was

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
miles on a full tank of gas and that was

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.850 
miles on a full tank of gas and that was
when<00:01:30.940> it<00:01:31.360> was<00:01:31.479> new<00:01:31.720> now<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.410> car<00:01:32.950> has<00:01:33.220> run<00:01:33.520> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
when it was new now the car has run and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.810 
when it was new now the car has run and
it's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
it's

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's
it<00:01:38.360> had<00:01:38.570> gotten

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.580 

down<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:43.969> 24<00:01:44.969> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.930> city<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.110> about

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
down to about 24 in the city and about

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.660 
down to about 24 in the city and about
20<00:01:53.000> 26<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> freeway<00:01:55.369> okay<00:01:56.369> pull<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
20 26 on the on the freeway okay pull it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
20 26 on the on the freeway okay pull it
because<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.750> gotten<00:01:58.170> worn<00:01:58.470> it's<00:01:58.679> not

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
because it's it's gotten worn it's not

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.719 
because it's it's gotten worn it's not
brand<00:01:59.220> new<00:01:59.369> anymore<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.409> we're<00:02:02.340> gonna<00:02:02.460> get

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
brand new anymore so we're gonna get

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.569 
brand new anymore so we're gonna get
some<00:02:03.060> documentation<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.860> we'll<00:02:05.039> see<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
some documentation and we'll see what it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.359 
some documentation and we'll see what it
is<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:05.970> now

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.610 

before<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.330> put<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> AJ<00:02:10.020> joke<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.590> on

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
before we put the AJ joke it on

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.559 
before we put the AJ joke it on
what's<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> name<00:02:13.430> change<00:02:13.640> okay<00:02:15.010> I'm<00:02:16.010> sure<00:02:16.569> you

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
what's the name change okay I'm sure you

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.990 
what's the name change okay I'm sure you
would<00:02:17.690> know<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.500> be<00:02:18.620> out<00:02:18.769> here<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.760> a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
would know to be out here but think a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.050 
would know to be out here but think a
joke<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.629> is<00:02:21.019> is<00:02:23.890> using<00:02:24.890> electrolysis<00:02:25.370> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
joke it is is using electrolysis to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.440 
joke it is is using electrolysis to
split<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:27.080> water<00:02:27.349> atom<00:02:27.980> into<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.879> hydrogen

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
split the water atom into the hydrogen

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.130 
split the water atom into the hydrogen
and<00:02:29.690> oxygen<00:02:30.200> gas<00:02:30.970> creating<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.299> perfect

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
and oxygen gas creating a perfect

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.530 
and oxygen gas creating a perfect
mixture<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:34.400> will<00:02:34.640> displace<00:02:37.540> gas-air

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
mixture that will displace gas-air

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.860 
mixture that will displace gas-air
mixture<00:02:40.000> requirement<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.239> keep<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.629> engine

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
mixture requirement to keep the engine

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.740 
mixture requirement to keep the engine
running

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.900 

increase<00:02:45.290> efficiency<00:02:46.010> because<00:02:46.550> it's<00:02:46.820> a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
increase efficiency because it's a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.840 
increase efficiency because it's a
hotter<00:02:47.240> flame

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
hotter flame

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.370 
hotter flame
I<00:02:48.910> believe<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.630> don't<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.050> worry<00:02:50.260> about

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
I believe you don't have to worry about

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.490 
I believe you don't have to worry about
it<00:02:50.740> overheating<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.580> engine<00:02:51.970> because<00:02:52.570> you're

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
it overheating the engine because you're

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.330 
it overheating the engine because you're
not<00:02:53.680> running<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.280> pure<00:02:55.020> HHO<00:02:56.050> you're<00:02:56.800> running

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
not running on pure HHO you're running

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.670 
not running on pure HHO you're running
on<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.490> mixture<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.090> hho<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.290> fuel<00:03:00.160> air<00:03:00.340> mixture

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
on a mixture of hho and fuel air mixture

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.440 
on a mixture of hho and fuel air mixture
so<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:03.160> just<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.460> to<00:03:03.520> make<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.000> fuel<00:03:04.270> air

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
so it's just going to make the fuel air

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.560 
so it's just going to make the fuel air
mixture<00:03:05.050> more<00:03:05.800> efficiently<00:03:06.550> burned<00:03:06.940> because

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
mixture more efficiently burned because

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.180 
mixture more efficiently burned because
the<00:03:07.870> flash<00:03:08.170> speed<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.870> HHO<00:03:10.870> mixture<00:03:11.650> is

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
the flash speed of it HHO mixture is

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.330 
the flash speed of it HHO mixture is
much<00:03:12.880> faster<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.830> hotter

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
much faster and hotter

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.630 
much faster and hotter
so<00:03:15.760> it'll<00:03:16.030> burn<00:03:16.750> more<00:03:17.140> completely<00:03:17.640> your

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
so it'll burn more completely your

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.960 
so it'll burn more completely your
gasoline

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
gasoline

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.240 
gasoline
they're<00:03:21.210> mixture

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.410 

the<00:03:24.820> HHR<00:03:25.810> does<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:26.710> have<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.920> turbo<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:28.180> one

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
the HHR does this have a turbo this one

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.240 
the HHR does this have a turbo this one
does<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:29.170> turbo<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:30.300> we're<00:03:31.300> going<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:32.250> have

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
does have a turbo so we're going to have

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.420 
does have a turbo so we're going to have
to<00:03:34.290> inject<00:03:35.290> our<00:03:35.560> page<00:03:36.490> with<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.970> mixture

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
to inject our page with a mixture

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.059 
to inject our page with a mixture
at<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.180> intake<00:03:40.780> of

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
at the intake of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.170 
at the intake of
the<00:03:43.519> turbo<00:03:44.110> so<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.260> compresses<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:46.430> with<00:03:46.819> the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
the turbo so it compresses it with the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.720 
the turbo so it compresses it with the
rest<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.569> it<00:03:47.750> because<00:03:48.500> he<00:03:48.709> won't<00:03:49.040> pull<00:03:49.549> it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
rest of it because he won't pull it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.470 
rest of it because he won't pull it
after<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.450> turbo

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
after the turbo

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.780 
after the turbo
just<00:03:53.140> not<00:03:53.349> work<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.830> way<00:03:54.010> because<00:03:54.489> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
just not work that way because the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.880 
just not work that way because the
pressure<00:03:55.120> after<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.720> turbo<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.319> greater<00:03:56.620> than

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
pressure after the turbo is greater than

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.750 
pressure after the turbo is greater than
the<00:03:57.099> pressure<00:03:58.030> outside<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.220> wouldn't<00:04:00.580> be

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
the pressure outside so it wouldn't be

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.990 
the pressure outside so it wouldn't be
able<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.239> get<00:04:02.230> anything<00:04:02.530> in<00:04:02.920> there<00:04:03.159> just<00:04:03.849> won't

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
able to get anything in there just won't

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.440 
able to get anything in there just won't
work<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.420> way<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:04.659> it's<00:04:04.959> gonna<00:04:05.110> be<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.680> the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
work that way so it's gonna be on the

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.680 
work that way so it's gonna be on the
intake<00:04:07.450> side<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.440> turbo

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
intake side of the turbo

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.130 
intake side of the turbo
it'll<00:04:10.170> be<00:04:10.970> after

injected<00:04:31.660> into<00:04:32.660> it<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.830> has<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.100> be<00:04:34.220> between

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
injected into it so it has to be between

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.040 
injected into it so it has to be between
those<00:04:34.970> two

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.150 

what<00:04:39.050> about<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.260> regular<00:04:39.590> car<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.980> have<00:04:40.100> to

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
what about a regular car you have to

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.439 
what about a regular car you have to
worry<00:04:40.310> about<00:04:40.520> that

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
worry about that

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.760 
worry about that
just<00:04:41.809> put<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.050> in<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.229> intake<00:04:42.590> you're<00:04:42.949> good

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.420 

it<00:04:46.279> would<00:04:46.400> be<00:04:46.490> best<00:04:46.759> if<00:04:47.059> you<00:04:47.090> put<00:04:47.539> it<00:04:47.949> after<00:04:48.949> the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
it would be best if you put it after the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.019 
it would be best if you put it after the
carburetor<00:04:50.680> sometimes<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:52.669> can<00:04:52.819> put<00:04:52.999> a

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:53.029 
carburetor sometimes you can put a

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:57.290 
carburetor sometimes you can put a
high-rise<00:04:53.650> manifold

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.140 

not<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:57.720> man<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:58.230> high-rise

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.450 

inter<00:05:02.780> plate<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.410> guess<00:05:03.710> you'd<00:05:03.889> call<00:05:03.949> it<00:05:04.130> be<00:05:04.430> a

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
inter plate I guess you'd call it be a

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.870 
inter plate I guess you'd call it be a
plate<00:05:05.150> between<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.990> carburetor<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.949> the

plate between the carburetor and the
intake<00:05:08.449> manifold<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.590> can<00:05:09.770> put<00:05:09.949> an<00:05:10.040> injection

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
intake manifold you can put an injection

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.170 
intake manifold you can put an injection
hole<00:05:10.820> there<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:12.650> will<00:05:12.889> pull<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.280> in<00:05:13.460> that

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
hole there and it will pull it in that

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.629 
hole there and it will pull it in that
way<00:05:14.419> in<00:05:14.720> that<00:05:14.900> way<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.410> won't<00:05:15.530> be<00:05:15.680> offsetting

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
way in that way it won't be offsetting

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.140 
way in that way it won't be offsetting
and<00:05:16.940> being

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.990 

a<00:05:20.210> variable<00:05:21.140> on<00:05:21.440> your<00:05:21.950> carburetor<00:05:22.550> setting

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000

a variable on your carburetor setting
carburetor<00:05:23.570> setting<00:05:24.080> will<00:05:24.230> still<00:05:24.440> remain<00:05:24.890> the
