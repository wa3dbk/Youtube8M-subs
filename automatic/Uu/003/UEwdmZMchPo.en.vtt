the top of there

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.580 
the top of there
here<00:00:28.580> we<00:00:28.670> go<00:00:28.789> inside<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.480> box<00:00:29.660> as<00:00:30.109> you<00:00:30.289> can<00:00:30.410> see

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
here we go inside the box as you can see

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.750 
here we go inside the box as you can see

the<00:00:37.789> helicopter<00:00:38.179> itself<00:00:38.530> here<00:00:39.530> you<00:00:39.589> can<00:00:39.679> see

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
the helicopter itself here you can see

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.439 
the helicopter itself here you can see
the<00:00:39.889> helicopter<00:00:40.280> out<00:00:40.339> of<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.519> box<00:00:40.699> it's<00:00:41.300> a

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
the helicopter out of the box it's a

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.450 
the helicopter out of the box it's a
little<00:00:41.719> bit<00:00:41.870> bigger<00:00:42.109> than<00:00:42.319> the<00:00:42.469> standard<00:00:42.949> MCP

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
little bit bigger than the standard MCP

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.819 
little bit bigger than the standard MCP
X<00:00:43.639> and<00:00:43.969> this<00:00:44.539> is<00:00:44.659> to<00:00:44.780> accommodate<00:00:44.989> for<00:00:45.260> more

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
X and this is to accommodate for more

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.219 
X and this is to accommodate for more
power<00:00:46.069> so<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.519> has<00:00:46.699> a<00:00:47.120> brushless<00:00:47.600> main<00:00:47.929> motor

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
power so it has a brushless main motor

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.919 
power so it has a brushless main motor
and<00:00:48.530> also<00:00:49.339> a<00:00:49.370> brushless<00:00:49.639> tail<00:00:50.059> motor<00:00:50.299> so<00:00:50.780> this

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
and also a brushless tail motor so this

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.229 
and also a brushless tail motor so this
will<00:00:51.049> give<00:00:51.139> it<00:00:51.260> more<00:00:51.379> power<00:00:51.649> on<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.889> tail

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
will give it more power on the tail

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.520 
will give it more power on the tail
better<00:00:53.239> holding<00:00:53.629> keep<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.109> in<00:00:54.229> a<00:00:54.289> straight

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
better holding keep it in a straight

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.709 
better holding keep it in a straight
line<00:00:54.879> some<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:55.999> other<00:00:56.149> benefits<00:00:56.600> are

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
line some of the other benefits are

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.559 
line some of the other benefits are
rather<00:00:56.959> than<00:00:57.109> being<00:00:57.319> 1s<00:00:57.679> it's<00:00:57.889> now<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.039> 2s<00:00:58.579> 200

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
rather than being 1s it's now a 2s 200

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.020 
rather than being 1s it's now a 2s 200
milliamp<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:01.100> still<00:01:01.459> a<00:01:01.489> collective<00:01:01.909> pitch

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
milliamp it's still a collective pitch

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.119 
milliamp it's still a collective pitch
helicopter<00:01:02.629> still<00:01:03.289> uses<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.619> as3x

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
helicopter still uses the as3x

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.860 
helicopter still uses the as3x
technology<00:01:04.820> which<00:01:04.970> keeps<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.360> really<00:01:05.510> stable

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
technology which keeps it really stable

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.650 
technology which keeps it really stable
makes<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.950> really<00:01:07.100> easy<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.400> fly<00:01:07.670> under<00:01:08.480> the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
makes it really easy to fly under the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.600 
makes it really easy to fly under the
canopy<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.260> can<00:01:09.500> see<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.800> revised<00:01:10.100> battery

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
canopy you can see the revised battery

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.480 
canopy you can see the revised battery
tray<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> accommodate<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.630> 2's<00:01:11.930> battery<00:01:12.490> some

of<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.670> features<00:01:14.000> are<00:01:14.180> very<00:01:14.510> similar<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
of the features are very similar to the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.710 
of the features are very similar to the
OEM<00:01:15.110> CPX<00:01:15.620> as<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.280> servos<00:01:16.700> still<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> linear

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
OEM CPX as the servos still the linear

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.110 
OEM CPX as the servos still the linear
servos<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.040> frame<00:01:19.310> structure<00:01:19.970> is<00:01:20.060> very

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
servos the frame structure is very

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.020 
servos the frame structure is very
similar<00:01:20.690> it<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.620> holding<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.220> brushless<00:01:22.640> motor

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
similar it is holding a brushless motor

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.310 
similar it is holding a brushless motor
so<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.420> an<00:01:23.480> in<00:01:23.600> runner<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.990> sits<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.260> the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
so it's an in runner that sits in the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.650 
so it's an in runner that sits in the
middle<00:01:24.380> there<00:01:24.970> swash<00:01:25.970> plate<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:26.270> very<00:01:26.300> similar

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
middle there swash plate is very similar

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.650 
middle there swash plate is very similar
to<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.320> old<00:01:27.350> model<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.850> boom<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.300> actually<00:01:29.600> a

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
to the old model the boom is actually a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.870 
to the old model the boom is actually a
slightly<00:01:29.960> bigger<00:01:30.470> diameter<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:31.310> minimize

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
slightly bigger diameter to minimize

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.120 
slightly bigger diameter to minimize
damage<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.630> also<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.990> accommodate<00:01:33.710> an<00:01:33.860> extra

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
damage and also to accommodate an extra

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.400 
damage and also to accommodate an extra
wire<00:01:34.310> for<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.360> brushless<00:01:35.540> tail<00:01:35.900> motor<00:01:36.110> so

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
wire for the brushless tail motor so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.070 
wire for the brushless tail motor so
this<00:01:36.530> will<00:01:36.680> give<00:01:36.800> it<00:01:36.890> more<00:01:37.010> power<00:01:37.220> all<00:01:37.490> around

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
this will give it more power all around

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.830 
this will give it more power all around
so<00:01:39.080> there<00:01:39.260> you<00:01:39.320> go<00:01:39.410> guys<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.950> new<00:01:40.160> brushless

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
so there you go guys the new brushless

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.570 
so there you go guys the new brushless
mcps<00:01:41.890> definitely<00:01:42.890> recommend<00:01:43.250> checking<00:01:43.310> it

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
mcps definitely recommend checking it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.920 
mcps definitely recommend checking it
out<00:01:43.700> with<00:01:44.030> its<00:01:44.150> extra<00:01:44.420> power

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
out with its extra power

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.960 
out with its extra power
s3x<00:01:45.740> it's<00:01:46.070> gonna<00:01:46.159> be<00:01:46.280> stable<00:01:46.670> it's<00:01:46.790> going<00:01:46.909> to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
s3x it's gonna be stable it's going to

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.700 
s3x it's gonna be stable it's going to
be<00:01:47.030> fast<00:01:47.270> sound<00:01:47.780> everything<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.320> need<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.590> do

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
be fast sound everything you need to do

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.870 
be fast sound everything you need to do
to<00:01:49.520> next<00:01:49.760> time
