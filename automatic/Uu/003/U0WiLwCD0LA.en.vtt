generates the electricity through the
pole<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.930> into<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> water<00:01:20.119> fish<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.300> have<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pole and into the water fish we have a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the current in the water to fish been

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
the current in the water to fish been
stunning<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.050> fish

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
how far does the shot go from the pole

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.270 
how far does the shot go from the pole
couple<00:01:50.550> feet

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.020 

maybe<00:01:55.730> better<00:01:55.940> punish<00:01:56.330> them
