00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
course are easier than others but I just

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.950 
course are easier than others but I just

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
cartridge here I've put the cover in

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.150 
cartridge here I've put the cover in
there<00:04:50.610> fit<00:04:51.240> in<00:04:51.360> there<00:04:51.509> a<00:04:51.539> nice<00:04:51.919> trick<00:04:52.919> game

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
there fit in there a nice trick game

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.879 
there fit in there a nice trick game
like<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.880> there<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.900> go<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.710> doesn't

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
like that and there you go it doesn't

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.939 
like that and there you go it doesn't
really<00:04:56.130> wobble<00:04:56.550> around<00:04:56.639> too<00:04:57.030> much<00:04:57.240> you<00:04:57.449> know

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
really wobble around too much you know

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.080 
really wobble around too much you know
and<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:59.160> thought<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.430> came<00:04:59.550> out<00:04:59.669> pretty<00:04:59.759> cool

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
and I thought it came out pretty cool

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.080 
and I thought it came out pretty cool
there<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:01.400> drawback<00:05:02.400> though<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.789> using

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
there is a drawback though to using

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.659 
there is a drawback though to using
these<00:05:03.180> cases<00:05:03.690> since<00:05:04.380> they're<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:04.770> small<00:05:05.130> the

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
these cases since they're so small the

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.700 
these cases since they're so small the
manual<00:05:06.090> itself<00:05:06.599> will<00:05:06.810> not<00:05:06.960> fit<00:05:07.289> in<00:05:07.319> this<00:05:07.530> so

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
manual itself will not fit in this so

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.080 
manual itself will not fit in this so
you'll<00:05:07.860> have<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.099> put<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.370> manuals<00:05:08.759> somewhere

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
you'll have to put the manuals somewhere

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.159 
you'll have to put the manuals somewhere
else<00:05:09.319> but<00:05:10.319> at<00:05:10.409> least<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:12.479> have<00:05:12.599> a<00:05:12.630> nice<00:05:12.870> way<00:05:13.139> to

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
else but at least you have a nice way to

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.589 
else but at least you have a nice way to
box<00:05:13.830> up<00:05:14.069> your<00:05:14.310> games<00:05:14.729> if<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.060> don't<00:05:15.360> want<00:05:15.509> to

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
box up your games if you don't want to

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.969 
box up your games if you don't want to
have<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.900> do<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:18.270> Nintendo<00:05:18.870> DS<00:05:19.080> trick<00:05:19.530> which<00:05:19.860> I

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
have to do the Nintendo DS trick which I

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.649 
have to do the Nintendo DS trick which I
mean<00:05:20.159> you<00:05:20.340> can<00:05:20.550> use<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:20.909> cases<00:05:21.240> if<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:21.449> want

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
mean you can use the cases if you want

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.149 
mean you can use the cases if you want
but<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.110> just<00:05:22.169> figured<00:05:22.500> I'd<00:05:22.770> share<00:05:23.039> an

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
but I just figured I'd share an

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.740 
but I just figured I'd share an
alternative<00:05:23.639> method<00:05:23.759> with<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.150> guys<00:05:24.330> so
