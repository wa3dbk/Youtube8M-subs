00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
on this guy and try to figure out a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.190 
on this guy and try to figure out a
little<00:00:11.490> bit<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.910> landmark<00:00:12.360> right<00:00:12.630> there<00:00:12.840> I'm

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
little bit of a landmark right there I'm

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.860 
little bit of a landmark right there I'm
gonna<00:00:13.349> put<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.889> right<00:00:14.099> there<00:00:14.780> right<00:00:15.780> across

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
gonna put it right there right across

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.640 
gonna put it right there right across
from<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.500> e<00:00:20.840> now<00:00:22.250> take<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:24.260> bring<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.470> out

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
from the e now take this bring that out

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.410 
from the e now take this bring that out
to<00:00:26.180> right<00:00:27.180> where<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.080> crossed<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.420> drag

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
to right where you crossed it and drag

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.260 
to right where you crossed it and drag
that<00:00:30.630> 90<00:00:30.960> degrees<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> be

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that 90 degrees and that is going to be

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.990 
that 90 degrees and that is going to be
pretty<00:00:36.690> much<00:00:36.750> his<00:00:37.260> minimum<00:00:37.770> view<00:00:38.010> distance<00:00:38.460> or

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
pretty much his minimum view distance or

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
pretty much his minimum view distance or
maximum<00:00:39.480> view<00:00:39.660> distance<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.280> you're

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
maximum view distance so if you're

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.920 
maximum view distance so if you're
outside<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.450> stay<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
outside of that you can stay on the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.450 
outside of that you can stay on the
surface<00:00:43.140> no<00:00:44.129> problem

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.050 

all<00:00:48.970> right<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.390> he<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.170> now<00:00:50.440> crossing<00:00:51.400> so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
all right and he is now crossing so

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.410 
all right and he is now crossing so
we'll<00:00:52.180> switch<00:00:52.900> on<00:00:53.110> over<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.820> our<00:00:54.970> optics<00:00:55.480> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
we'll switch on over to our optics you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
we'll switch on over to our optics you
can<00:00:58.420> see<00:00:58.660> him<00:00:58.780> off<00:00:58.960> there<00:00:59.230> in<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.380> distance

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
can see him off there in the distance

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.250 
can see him off there in the distance
just<00:00:59.890> barely<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:00.970> actually<00:01:01.510> don't<00:01:01.840> know<00:01:02.050> if<00:01:02.080> you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
just barely I actually don't know if you

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.609 
just barely I actually don't know if you
guys<00:01:02.410> can<00:01:05.370> but<00:01:06.370> I<00:01:06.520> can<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.930> that's<00:01:08.440> really

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
guys can but I can and that's really

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.080 
guys can but I can and that's really
what's<00:01:08.890> important<00:01:09.310> when<00:01:09.490> I'm<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.820> one<00:01:09.940> who's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
what's important when I'm the one who's

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.890 
what's important when I'm the one who's
shooting<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.830> now<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:13.090> just<00:01:13.240> wait<00:01:13.450> you<00:01:13.720> can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
shooting so now you just wait you can

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020 
shooting so now you just wait you can
spot<00:01:14.710> little<00:01:14.979> landmarks<00:01:15.490> on<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.640> ship<00:01:15.880> if<00:01:16.000> you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
spot little landmarks on the ship if you

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.070 
spot little landmarks on the ship if you
want<00:01:16.240> mm-hmm

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
want mm-hmm

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.410 
want mm-hmm
fire<00:01:17.440> when<00:01:17.740> those<00:01:17.920> cross<00:01:18.250> your<00:01:18.520> central<00:01:19.240> wire

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
fire when those cross your central wire

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.060 
fire when those cross your central wire
right<00:01:19.750> here<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:23.050> that's<00:01:23.170> exactly<00:01:23.590> what<00:01:23.800> we're

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
right here so that's exactly what we're

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.499 
right here so that's exactly what we're
going<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.369> do<00:01:24.550> I<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:27.670> know<00:01:27.880> if<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.060> can<00:01:28.210> see

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
going to do I don't know if you can see

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.800 
going to do I don't know if you can see
but<00:01:28.810> just<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.759> an<00:01:30.910> attempt<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.300> show<00:01:31.509> off<00:01:31.660> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
but just in an attempt to show off the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.540 
but just in an attempt to show off the
accuracy<00:01:32.410> of<00:01:32.500> this<00:01:32.619> method<00:01:32.979> I'm<00:01:33.160> going<00:01:33.220> to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
accuracy of this method I'm going to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.400 
accuracy of this method I'm going to
fire<00:01:33.790> first<00:01:34.630> at<00:01:34.960> his<00:01:35.259> forward<00:01:36.240> mast<00:01:37.240> then<00:01:37.930> at

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
fire first at his forward mast then at

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.850 
fire first at his forward mast then at
what<00:01:38.680> looks<00:01:38.979> like<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.250> bridge<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:41.140> his<00:01:41.619> rear

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
what looks like the bridge then his rear

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.790 
what looks like the bridge then his rear
mast<00:01:42.160> which<00:01:42.759> is<00:01:42.970> close<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.390> his<00:01:44.110> smokestack

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
mast which is close to his smokestack

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.889 
mast which is close to his smokestack
and<00:01:45.070> should<00:01:45.610> be<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.759> lethal<00:01:46.210> hit<00:01:46.240> if<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.750> other

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
and should be a lethal hit if the other

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
and should be a lethal hit if the other
two<00:01:47.140> already

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.230 

he's<00:01:51.700> coming<00:01:52.119> up<00:01:52.240> now<00:01:52.510> on<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:52.960> cross<00:01:53.170> wire

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.360 

so<00:01:57.780> I'll<00:01:57.900> go<00:01:58.050> ahead<00:01:58.080> and<00:02:00.080> crier<00:02:01.190> switch<00:02:02.190> the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
so I'll go ahead and crier switch the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.130 
so I'll go ahead and crier switch the
next<00:02:02.640> two

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:26.470 

fire<00:02:08.759> switch<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:09.910> next<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:14.070> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.170 

I'm<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.960> let<00:02:28.140> us<00:02:28.520> track<00:02:29.520> these<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.000> just

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I'm going to let us track these and just

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.170 
I'm going to let us track these and just
hope<00:02:31.140> which<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.280> guys<00:02:32.460> should<00:02:32.670> all<00:02:32.820> be<00:02:32.940> doing

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
hope which you guys should all be doing

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.680 
hope which you guys should all be doing
right<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:33.950> then<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> get<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> head

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.590 

oh<00:02:42.720> look<00:02:43.650> at<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.420> getting

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
oh look at that that is getting

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.559 
oh look at that that is getting
nerve-racking<00:02:46.350> lacrosse

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.589 

all<00:02:51.110> those<00:02:51.469> are<00:02:51.500> hits<00:02:52.360> all<00:02:53.360> right<00:02:54.069> let's<00:02:55.069> go<00:02:55.219> to

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
all those are hits all right let's go to

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:07.280 
all those are hits all right let's go to
well<00:02:57.189> now<00:02:58.189> we're<00:02:58.370> going<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.579> third<00:02:58.760> person

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.619 

maybe<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.010> should<00:03:08.189> repair<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.640> boom<00:03:09.209> first

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
maybe I should repair this boom first

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.699 
maybe I should repair this boom first
hit<00:03:10.790> that's<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.879> big<00:03:12.090> head<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.540> think<00:03:13.200> died<00:03:13.439> with

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
hit that's a big head I think died with

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.550 
hit that's a big head I think died with
the<00:03:13.829> first<00:03:14.099> torpedo

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the first torpedo

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.860 
the first torpedo
second<00:03:16.190> torpedo<00:03:16.280> here

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.399 

so

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.929 

you<00:03:26.409> can<00:03:26.590> tell<00:03:26.769> actually<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.459> torpedo

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
you can tell actually that the torpedo
