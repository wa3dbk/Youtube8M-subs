days brass instruments are made of metal
but<00:02:29.720> rarely<00:02:30.470> some<00:02:30.739> are<00:02:30.920> made<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.220> wood<00:02:31.430> they

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
but rarely some are made of wood they

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.849 
but rarely some are made of wood they
make<00:02:32.390> their<00:02:32.569> sound<00:02:32.840> by<00:02:32.989> amplifying<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
make their sound by amplifying the

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.410 
make their sound by amplifying the
players<00:02:34.159> lift<00:02:34.579> vibrations<00:02:35.209> on<00:02:35.390> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
players lift vibrations on the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.630 
players lift vibrations on the
mouthpiece<00:02:35.689> the<00:02:36.620> vibrations<00:02:37.220> go<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.549> a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
mouthpiece the vibrations go to a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.339 
mouthpiece the vibrations go to a
resonant<00:02:38.180> chamber<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:38.750> instrument<00:02:39.049> and

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
resonant chamber in the instrument and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.729 
resonant chamber in the instrument and
brass<00:02:40.040> players<00:02:40.370> then<00:02:40.760> expand<00:02:41.720> or<00:02:41.989> shrink<00:02:42.049> the

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
brass players then expand or shrink the

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.949 
brass players then expand or shrink the
size<00:02:43.159> of<00:02:43.430> those<00:02:43.579> chambers<00:02:43.849> through<00:02:44.569> various

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
size of those chambers through various

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.890 
size of those chambers through various
valves<00:02:45.500> keys<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.340> slides<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:47.359> change<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
valves keys and slides to change the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780 
valves keys and slides to change the
pitch<00:02:48.109> and<00:02:48.409> sometimes<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.250> Tambor<00:02:49.579> of<00:02:49.700> the

pitch and sometimes the Tambor of the
sound<00:02:50.030> through<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.049> process<00:02:51.349> you<00:02:51.680> get<00:02:51.829> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
sound through this process you get the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.550 
sound through this process you get the
bright<00:02:52.190> clear<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.030> warm<00:02:53.389> sound<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:54.290> most
