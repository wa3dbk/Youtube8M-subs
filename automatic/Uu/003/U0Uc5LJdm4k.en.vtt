00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
in one video I cut I guess I should have

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.060 
in one video I cut I guess I should have
really<00:00:33.989> done<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.290> instead<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> doing<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
really done this instead of doing a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
really done this instead of doing a
normal<00:00:35.160> SG<00:00:35.579> however<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.570> thought<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
