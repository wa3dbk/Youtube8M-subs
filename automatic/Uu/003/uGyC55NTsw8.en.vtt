about<00:02:19.410> four<00:02:19.830> pounds<00:02:20.700> i<00:02:21.090> think<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.810> about

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
about four pounds i think it's about

about four pounds i think it's about
four<00:02:22.440> pound<00:02:22.800> something<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.720> just

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
four pound something for that so I just

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.750 
four pound something for that so I just
