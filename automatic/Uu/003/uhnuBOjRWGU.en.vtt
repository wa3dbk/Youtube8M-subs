00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 cinnamon on television more knowing that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.980
 never important but you do not have to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.599
 thinking a lot about this time I 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.900
 it seems that the quality of the equipment 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.700
 Mexican is that despite what you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.070
 he wants to tell me is far superior to the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.529
 costa rica it seems to me that the factor of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.630
 locality the party can be passed by 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.430
 water the weather is not going to be a factor to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.949
 favor of ours or costa rica 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.650
 there's going to be a cool temperature with 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.140
 Moisture is likely prognosis 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.180
 with rains before or during the game and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.010
 well , that's what is interesting is 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.140
 that Mexico must find the formula 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.660
 to defeat the costa rica team 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 English because he had many arrivals that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.379
 I did not specify them, I think it's time to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 give a coup of authority at the table and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.129
 that must be tomorrow yes because after 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.930
 this and nothing else would be left in four 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.809
 matches to get the ticket it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.280
 would come to the sixth and important think about 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.870
 go to the confederations cup with that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.660
 motivation to be first in the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 eliminatory I am curious to know 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.780
 what alignment will the chepo of the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 tower because they finally won a match 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.519
 that was in kingston and decided to modify 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.010
 things did not work at all in the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.450
 meeting 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.400
 the selection of panama and said the chepo 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.800
 of the tower that Mexico has to think 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.890
 in winning however you do not have to look 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.660
 playing as always but playing as 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.920
 never and lose as always because I 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.210
 that I would then ask the technician to 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.500
 selection is that they effectively win 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.970
 because right now mexico is not 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.890
 even when it's not winning well 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.140
 matches is only tied but 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.820
 thanks to the weakness of the area and to which 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.230
 have been dividing points with everything and 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.190
 that Mexico only has that victory 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.410
 in zone rating 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.270
 then think about improving certain things 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.100
 win the game and get to face 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.570
 italy in maracana next Sunday in 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.430
 First of qualifying for 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.710
 I hope this result is presented to us 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.260
 urge a triumph of mexico and it must be
