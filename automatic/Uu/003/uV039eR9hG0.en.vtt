certain ways and it has to engage these

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:37.000 
certain ways and it has to engage these
three<00:00:26.600> teeth<00:00:27.670> on<00:00:28.670> this<00:00:28.880> over<00:00:29.180> here<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:35.980> put<00:00:36.980> a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
three teeth on this over here I put a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:46.600 
three teeth on this over here I put a
chemical<00:00:37.280> in<00:00:41.590> certain<00:00:42.590> places<00:00:45.310> almost<00:00:46.310> blind

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
chemical in certain places almost blind

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:57.100 
chemical in certain places almost blind
shaft<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:52.520> it<00:00:52.640> doesn't<00:00:53.059> wanna<00:00:55.270> top<00:00:56.270> a<00:00:56.570> little

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
shaft and it doesn't wanna top a little

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:11.649 
shaft and it doesn't wanna top a little
bit<00:01:05.290> and<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.409> suspect<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:08.590> gear<00:01:09.590> is<00:01:10.659> supposed

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
bit and I suspect that gear is supposed

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.600 
bit and I suspect that gear is supposed
the<00:01:12.170> teeth<00:01:12.500> are<00:01:12.799> supposed<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.159> be<00:01:13.340> able<00:01:13.400> to

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the teeth are supposed to be able to

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.990 
the teeth are supposed to be able to
turn<00:01:13.880> separately<00:01:14.659> from<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.020> splines<00:01:16.000> it

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
turn separately from the splines it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.180 
turn separately from the splines it
looks<00:01:17.360> like<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.869> little<00:01:18.080> bit<00:01:18.380> blue<00:01:18.799> right

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
looks like it's a little bit blue right

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.850 
looks like it's a little bit blue right
there<00:01:20.049> that's<00:01:21.049> not<00:01:21.909> necessarily<00:01:22.909> normal<00:01:23.860> so

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
there that's not necessarily normal so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.530 
there that's not necessarily normal so
I'm<00:01:24.950> thinking<00:01:25.310> if<00:01:25.400> I<00:01:25.520> get<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.820> circlip<00:01:26.330> off

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
I'm thinking if I get that circlip off

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.160 
I'm thinking if I get that circlip off
of<00:01:26.750> there<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:28.070> take<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:28.310> off<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.689> may<00:01:30.110> be

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
of there and take that off that may be

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.710 
of there and take that off that may be
the<00:01:30.470> root<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.740> our<00:01:30.890> problem<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:31.750> don't<00:01:32.750> know<00:01:33.610> if

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
the root of our problem I don't know if

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.870 
the root of our problem I don't know if
not<00:01:35.720> being<00:01:35.990> able<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.260> push<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.680> while<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:37.790> in

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
not being able to push it while it's in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.050 
not being able to push it while it's in
one<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> ranges<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.750> normal<00:01:39.140> or<00:01:39.260> not<00:01:40.000> but<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
one of the ranges is normal or not but I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.429 
one of the ranges is normal or not but I
guess<00:01:41.240> we'll<00:01:41.420> find<00:01:41.630> out<00:01:41.750> after<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:42.140> get<00:01:42.320> that

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
guess we'll find out after I get that

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.100 
guess we'll find out after I get that
gear<00:01:42.680> freed<00:01:42.979> up

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.030 

here's<00:01:47.440> their<00:01:47.680> gear<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.610> see<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.830> law

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
here's their gear you see but the law

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.990 
here's their gear you see but the law
here<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.780> turn<00:01:56.110> blue<00:01:56.500> which<00:01:56.860> means<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.280> go<00:01:57.460> real

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
here is turn blue which means it go real

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.100 
here is turn blue which means it go real
hot<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:59.280> it<00:02:00.280> looks<00:02:00.580> like<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:01.630> inner<00:02:02.080> part<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
hot and it looks like the inner part is

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.670 
hot and it looks like the inner part is
a<00:02:05.170> different<00:02:05.560> color<00:02:06.870> so<00:02:07.870> that's<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.229> separate

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
a different color so that's a separate

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.859 
a different color so that's a separate
piece<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.490> those<00:02:09.670> inside<00:02:10.119> splines<00:02:10.570> are

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
piece so those inside splines are

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.600 
piece so those inside splines are
supposed<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.320> turn<00:02:11.560> separate<00:02:12.310> from<00:02:12.490> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
supposed to turn separate from the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.110 
supposed to turn separate from the
outside<00:02:12.940> teeth<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.920> don't<00:02:15.280> look<00:02:15.490> good

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
outside teeth that don't look good

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.480 
outside teeth that don't look good
definitely<00:02:16.840> got<00:02:17.020> hot<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.620> think<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.160> seized

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
definitely got hot I think it seized

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.230 
definitely got hot I think it seized
itself<00:02:18.970> right<00:02:19.210> together<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:21.700> gonna<00:02:21.880> see<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.150> I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
itself right together I'm gonna see if I

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.360 
itself right together I'm gonna see if I
can<00:02:22.450> knock<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.080> out<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:23.800> press<00:02:24.160> that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
can knock that out of there press that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.770 
can knock that out of there press that
over<00:02:24.610> there<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:24.850> don't<00:02:25.090> know<00:02:25.209> if<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.570> save

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
over there I don't know if we can save

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.199 
over there I don't know if we can save
it<00:02:25.959> or<00:02:26.050> not<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.650> have<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.370> look<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.670> up<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:28.060> what

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
it or not I have to look it up see what
