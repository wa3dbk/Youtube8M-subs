00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
coin scored anyway but I'm just worried

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.630 
coin scored anyway but I'm just worried
that<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.710> said<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.460> price

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
that like when I said it all the price

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.220

is<00:02:21.760> gonna<00:02:21.850> go<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.300> I'm<00:02:22.600> gonna<00:02:22.780> lose<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.110> lot

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
is gonna go up and I'm gonna lose a lot

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.210 
is gonna go up and I'm gonna lose a lot
of<00:02:23.350> coins<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.890> could<00:02:24.100> have<00:02:24.220> made<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.870> I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
of coins that I could have made and so I

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.350 
of coins that I could have made and so I
don't<00:02:27.220> know<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.460> do<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.180> probably

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
don't know what to do I think I probably

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.910 
don't know what to do I think I probably
will<00:02:28.600> just<00:02:28.660> sell<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.170> then<00:02:29.440> maybe<00:02:29.620> buy<00:02:29.860> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920
