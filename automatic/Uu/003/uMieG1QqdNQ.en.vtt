00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.620
 Hello place son Commerzbank Webcast around Germany's most popular team 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.800
 The DFB eleven on the way to the 2010 World Cup in 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.799
 South Africa 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.970
 Michael Ballack is Commerzbank Testimonial and gave us his 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.849
 personal assessment of successful wm qualification and the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.289
 perspectives 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.179
 which performance factors were for the captain of the German 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.179
 National team decisive for wm participation 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.590
 here of course it squats and in sum should be enough to Stephen 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.420
 Team Spirit Artist and Draft 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.489
 Closed ambition of the disciplines but sometimes also very very good 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.770
 Football under that we have against the top team wants to see Russia 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.540
 if they can beat twice 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.180
 and percent certainly percent the Finns have made us over stupid 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.130
 So this qualification word sting big Wannsee must be satisfied 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.429
 After closing course, we would like to 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.370
 but who was actually involved in this great success? 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.659
 who has it through his bets, duels and passwords and before 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.310
 all through his goals in our top 11 wm qualification made in the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.110
 Goalkeeper question Rene Adler should have five chances the best chances 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.590
 to have 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.170
 the defensive position with Mertesacker and Heiko Westermann 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.679
 just as firmly underpinned as the left defense side occupied by Philipp Lahm 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.569
 only on the right EU has not solved its occupy yet 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.140
 Andreas Beck is playing here 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.240
 that's at least four wins during the wm qualification 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.890
 the central midfield are captain Michael Ballack and Thomas Hitzlsberger 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.280
 although Simon Rolfes is a real alternative on the wings 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.619
 Bastian Schweinsteiger as well as Piotr Trochowski are responsible for Vortex and im 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.520
 Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose struck a total of 13 "Mario Gomez 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.580
 Although he manages to make ten appearances but succeeds because of his 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.580
 lack of goals not in the top ten 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.580
 As you know, the 2006 World Cup became a summer fairy tale, and so does Michael 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.030
 Ballack can still benefit the team today from Heroku the boys 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.750
 Doric only at Hon have reached Boonen 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.250
 at a young age 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.460
 Aalen for many internationals and Ursula it with good structures team 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.929
 finally and lecturers the sweet tito form 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.699
 Müller has to see if that benefits us and here we see exactly 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.400
 what Michael Ballack means 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.790
 the wm-elf of 2006 is made up of the same 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.770
 the then young players are Lahm Mertesacker Schweinsteiger Podolski 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.390
 still in the team and are among the top performers in 2010 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.940
 What is the significance of our team in 2010 after the last ones are now carried out worldwide 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.029
 and what opportunities 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.639
 Michael Ballack admits 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.529
 which belong to him 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.929
 if you are 0 6 in the semifinals 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.719
 Percent to 8 much to Robers so now would be a sovereign again 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.239
 Qualification plays early qualified with know-how to great 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.849
 Point should then be discussed with the favorites so also openly 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.009
 and I think that the last objective should be seats then 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.169
 only occasionally is the best possible of how you look which player 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.529
 Access is available 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.829
 the mood German team is always a tournament and counts with 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.129
 the favorite 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.259
 the one after his team is on everyone's lips maybe 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.209
 They also have a brisk slogan about the dfb-elf in stock and want 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.069
 even once an international match against national coach Jogi Löw then consider 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.849
 At the bank to Commerzbank with luck they win a texture 7 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.609
 Place directly on the sidelines only come in, of course, they are 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.689
 Not maybe they also encourage some friends or colleagues more Fellbach 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.689
 Info under football professional Commerzbank point d 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.799
 One last question we still have to our Capitano 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.239
 The World Cup will be the career highlight of Michael Ballack 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.480
 the fastest with some Shiite sacrifices 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.400
 as turns out great if then one more would come to us 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.119
 be called 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.959
 of course I'm nice to secure third place 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.949
 the worse to be last world champion 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.949
 and accordingly 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.800
 As you know, "Emperor" Franz Beckenbauer is in the best of hands 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.820
 that was the Commerzbank webcast around the german national team we 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.950
 We look forward to the World Cup until then 2 is serious 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:23.960
 Duisburg 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.930
 Jan Brandts 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.050
 Jupiter 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.550
