you're going to need about 3 to 4

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
you're going to need about 3 to 4
tablespoons<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.700> mayonnaise

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
tablespoons of mayonnaise

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
tablespoons of mayonnaise
and<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.450> he'll<00:02:12.600> need<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.650> two

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and then he'll need one to two

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.180 
and then he'll need one to two
tablespoons<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:15.180> your<00:02:15.450> sriracha<00:02:15.990> now<00:02:16.830> if

tablespoons of your sriracha now if

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.090 
tablespoons of your sriracha now if
you're<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:17.790> familiar<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.630> very<00:02:19.320> hot<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
you're not familiar this is very hot so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.630 
you're not familiar this is very hot so
just<00:02:20.460> taste<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.230> go<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.770> like

really<00:02:24.030> spicy<00:02:24.240> things<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.770> is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
really spicy things so I think this is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.410 
really spicy things so I think this is
really<00:02:26.160> good<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.860> could<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.520> olio<00:02:30.030> mix

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
really good so that could be a olio mix

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.450 
really good so that could be a olio mix
together<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.200> simple<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:31.920> did<00:02:32.340> about

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
together so simple I just did about

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.670 
together so simple I just did about
three<00:02:32.850> tablespoons<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.900> mayonnaise<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
three tablespoons of mayonnaise and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.670 
three tablespoons of mayonnaise and
about<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:36.060> half<00:02:36.350> tablespoons<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
about one and a half tablespoons of the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.220 
about one and a half tablespoons of the
sriracha<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.120> very<00:02:39.360> spicy<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:39.960> it's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
sriracha and it is very spicy but it's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.020 
sriracha and it is very spicy but it's
delicious<00:02:40.470> when<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.190> dip<00:02:41.460> your<00:02:41.490> Brussels

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030

delicious when you dip your Brussels
sprouts<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.450> there<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> definitely

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
half an hour and they should be a little
