00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
going to score so if I did it like so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.710 
going to score so if I did it like so
right<00:02:19.280> off<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.430> bat<00:02:19.579> you<00:02:19.850> said<00:02:20.120> at<00:02:20.269> one<00:02:20.450> two

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
right off the bat you said at one two

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.699 
right off the bat you said at one two
three<00:02:21.079> four<00:02:21.350> five<00:02:21.380> six<00:02:22.010> seven<00:02:22.579> eight<00:02:22.820> nine<00:02:22.880> ten

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
three four five six seven eight nine ten

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.170 
three four five six seven eight nine ten
but<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.739> haven't<00:02:24.890> even<00:02:25.040> tried<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.400> maximize<00:02:25.970> it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
but I haven't even tried to maximize it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.230 
but I haven't even tried to maximize it
so<00:02:26.359> if<00:02:26.480> i<00:02:26.600> was<00:02:26.780> going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.989> maximize<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.799> clearly

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
so if i was going to maximize it clearly

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.750 
so if i was going to maximize it clearly
this<00:02:29.330> one<00:02:29.600> could<00:02:29.900> come<00:02:30.230> down<00:02:30.440> here<00:02:31.130> which

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
this one could come down here which

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.480 
this one could come down here which
would<00:02:31.940> give<00:02:32.090> me<00:02:32.210> another<00:02:32.450> set<00:02:32.840> with<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.170> green

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
would give me another set with the green

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.720 
would give me another set with the green
but<00:02:34.490> hey<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.700> could<00:02:35.090> throw<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.630> here<00:02:36.350> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
but hey I could throw this up here and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.610 
but hey I could throw this up here and
now<00:02:37.730> I'm<00:02:37.850> picking<00:02:38.150> up<00:02:38.210> more<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.690> yellow<00:02:39.260> as

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
now I'm picking up more of the yellow as

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.130 
now I'm picking up more of the yellow as
well<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.640> keep<00:02:40.850> doing<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.600> got<00:02:41.750> 90

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
well and you keep doing that you got 90

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.500 
well and you keep doing that you got 90
seconds<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.100> know<00:02:43.460> we're<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.760> zoomed<00:02:44.270> in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
seconds so I know we're not zoomed in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.680 
seconds so I know we're not zoomed in
but<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.810> think<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.110> can<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> ended<00:02:45.830> up<00:02:45.920> with

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
but I think you can see I ended up with

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.940 
but I think you can see I ended up with
1<00:02:47.690> 2<00:02:47.900> 3<00:02:47.930> 4<00:02:48.290> 5<00:02:48.770> 6<00:02:48.800> 7<00:02:49.460> 8<00:02:50.360> 9<00:02:50.420> 10<00:02:51.140> 11<00:02:51.320> 12<00:02:52.220> 13<00:02:53.120> 14<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.350> 14

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.500 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14
points<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.490> off<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.760> bat<00:02:55.940> not<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.210> very<00:02:56.300> big

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
points just off the bat not a very big

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.240 
points just off the bat not a very big
good<00:02:57.020> score<00:02:57.320> but<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.500> would<00:02:57.650> add<00:02:57.740> a<00:02:57.770> full<00:02:57.980> 90

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
good score but I would add a full 90

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.400 
good score but I would add a full 90
seconds<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.210> you're<00:02:59.420> just<00:02:59.600> shuffling<00:03:00.200> these

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
seconds so you're just shuffling these

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.870 
seconds so you're just shuffling these
around<00:03:00.740> trying<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.190> come<00:03:01.370> up<00:03:01.400> with<00:03:01.520> whatever

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
around trying to come up with whatever

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.790 
around trying to come up with whatever
best<00:03:02.360> combinations<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.260> are<00:03:03.350> going<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.650> give

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
best combinations that are going to give

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.640 
best combinations that are going to give
you<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.950> most<00:03:04.630> scoring<00:03:05.630> points<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.350> can

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
you the most scoring points that you can

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.590 
you the most scoring points that you can
get<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.190> again<00:03:07.880> you're<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.240> trying<00:03:08.480> to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
get and again you're just trying to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.540 
get and again you're just trying to
group<00:03:09.140> them<00:03:09.380> together<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.100> you've<00:03:10.370> got

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
group them together so that you've got

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.490 
group them together so that you've got
at<00:03:10.670> least<00:03:10.700> two<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.210> them<00:03:11.330> because<00:03:12.140> then<00:03:12.320> they

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
at least two of them because then they

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.960 
at least two of them because then they
score<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:14.210> is<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.380> fun<00:03:15.770> fast<00:03:16.490> I'm

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
score and that is it it's a fun fast I'm

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.730 
score and that is it it's a fun fast I'm
telling<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:17.450> great<00:03:17.660> for<00:03:17.900> kids<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.320> colors

it's fun there's some trash talking

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.890 
it's fun there's some trash talking
going<00:03:41.660> on<00:03:42.790> everybody<00:03:43.790> thought<00:03:44.180> there<00:03:44.420> was<00:03:44.570> one

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
going on everybody thought there was one

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.750 
going on everybody thought there was one
bundle<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.560> sticks<00:03:45.830> that<00:03:46.130> was<00:03:46.280> easier<00:03:46.700> to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
bundle of sticks that was easier to

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.940 
bundle of sticks that was easier to
score<00:03:47.240> or<00:03:47.510> easier<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.020> make<00:03:48.170> points<00:03:48.560> off<00:03:48.710> than

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
score or easier to make points off than

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.680 
score or easier to make points off than
the<00:03:49.040> other<00:03:49.190> one<00:03:49.370> however<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.300> hit<00:03:50.480> somebody

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
the other one however it hit somebody

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.600 
the other one however it hit somebody
that<00:03:51.050> didn't<00:03:51.290> do<00:03:51.410> too<00:03:51.590> well<00:03:51.620> with<00:03:51.860> that<00:03:52.130> bundle

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
that didn't do too well with that bundle

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.340 
that didn't do too well with that bundle
so<00:03:52.910> there<00:03:53.060> was<00:03:53.180> all<00:03:53.330> kinds<00:03:53.360> of<00:03:53.780> chatter<00:03:54.050> going

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
so there was all kinds of chatter going

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.930 
so there was all kinds of chatter going
on<00:03:54.530> over<00:03:54.740> that<00:03:54.920> all<00:03:55.640> right<00:03:55.940> color<00:03:56.300> sticks<00:03:57.940> what

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
on over that all right color sticks what

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.780 
on over that all right color sticks what
I<00:03:58.970> found<00:03:59.390> most<00:03:59.720> intriguing<00:04:00.260> about<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.740> is<00:04:01.070> it's

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
I found most intriguing about it is it's

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.970 
I found most intriguing about it is it's
almost<00:04:02.030> like<00:04:02.210> a<00:04:02.240> quick<00:04:02.870> filler<00:04:03.230> if<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.800> had<00:04:03.950> a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
almost like a quick filler if you had a

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.250 
almost like a quick filler if you had a
hardcore<00:04:04.610> gaming<00:04:05.090> group<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.570> could<00:04:05.690> easily<00:04:05.930> be

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
hardcore gaming group it could easily be

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.220 
hardcore gaming group it could easily be
used<00:04:06.290> as<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.680> filler<00:04:07.040> but<00:04:07.850> it<00:04:08.000> really<00:04:08.690> worked<00:04:09.050> in

and then everybody else get to shop the

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.200 
and then everybody else get to shop the
same<00:04:35.900> sticks<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.400> timer<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:37.970> runs

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210

every<00:04:38.479> 90<00:04:38.810> seconds<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:39.500> everything's

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
every 90 seconds so everything's

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.770 
every 90 seconds so everything's
clicking<00:04:40.310> by<00:04:40.610> really<00:04:40.970> fast

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
clicking by really fast

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.290 
clicking by really fast
and<00:04:41.920> it<00:04:42.920> moved<00:04:43.190> around<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.670> think<00:04:43.910> we<00:04:44.060> handled

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
and it moved around I think we handled

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.930 
and it moved around I think we handled
six<00:04:44.810> people<00:04:45.290> in<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:46.130> game<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.430> about<00:04:46.610> ten

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
six people in a game in about ten

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.180 
six people in a game in about ten
minutes<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:48.350> don't<00:04:48.530> have<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.710> lot<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.920> time

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
minutes you don't have a lot of time

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.010 
minutes you don't have a lot of time
invested<00:04:49.400> into<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.330> even<00:04:50.480> if<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.810> blow

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
invested into it so even if you blow

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.840 
invested into it so even if you blow
combination<00:04:51.830> it's<00:04:52.190> not<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.610> end<00:04:52.639> of<00:04:52.790> the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
this eight times in a row but I use it

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.180 
this eight times in a row but I use it
as<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.370> quick<00:05:01.850> filler<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:03.230> it<00:05:03.740> works<00:05:03.919> perfectly

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
as a quick filler and it works perfectly

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.560
