00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.080
 here are the fabrics 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.930
 where modernity took a picture printed out 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.900
 on the printer through the copy such 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.340

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:40.590
 Now I will embroider cherries on fabric 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 for this, I take the pepper and insert the cloth 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.510
 hoop fabric is already set aside so that 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:55.680

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:19.480
