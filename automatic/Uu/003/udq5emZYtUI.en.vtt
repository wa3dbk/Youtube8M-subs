to<00:01:48.960> show<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:50.579> what<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> got<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to show the what you got to do really is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.420 
to show the what you got to do really is
you've<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> go<00:01:52.740> back<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> old

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
you've got to go back to the old

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
you've got to go back to the old
fashioned<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.000> let's<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.750> try<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
fashioned way and let's just try as I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990 
fashioned way and let's just try as I
haven't<00:01:55.619> tried<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.219> let's<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.759> take

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
haven't tried it but let's just take

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.420 
haven't tried it but let's just take
that<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> there<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.159> still<00:01:59.159> don't<00:01:59.369> think

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that out of there I still don't think

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.469 
that out of there I still don't think
it'll<00:01:59.700> work<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.210> hasn't<00:02:00.329> got

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it'll work because it hasn't got

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.499 
it'll work because it hasn't got
youtube.com<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> end<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.479> might

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
youtube.com on the end here so we might

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.110 
youtube.com on the end here so we might
just<00:02:03.899> change<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
just change that and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.060 
just change that and
you<00:02:05.300> make<00:02:05.540> this<00:02:05.720> thing<00:02:05.960> work<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.500> haven't<00:02:06.680> tried

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
you make this thing work I haven't tried

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.980 
you make this thing work I haven't tried
it<00:02:07.130> but<00:02:08.119> let's<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.690> see<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:10.510> click<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:11.750> there

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
it but let's just see and click on there

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.630 
it but let's just see and click on there
I<00:02:12.230> still<00:02:12.560> don't<00:02:12.740> think<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.100> is<00:02:13.160> going<00:02:13.520> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
I still don't think this is going to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.490 
I still don't think this is going to
work<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.150> will<00:02:14.360> will<00:02:14.690> synth<00:02:15.020> is<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> way<00:02:15.470> around

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
work but will will synth is a way around

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500 
work but will will synth is a way around
it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.210 
it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
showing it right so it's because it's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.450 
showing it right so it's because it's
now<00:02:25.610> sitting<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.150> an<00:02:26.330> iframe<00:02:26.780> format<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.280> what

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
now sitting in an iframe format so what

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.340 
now sitting in an iframe format so what
we<00:02:28.610> need<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.820> do<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.510> we'll<00:02:29.690> take<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.110> out

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
we need to do now is we'll take that out

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.410 
we need to do now is we'll take that out
of<00:02:30.410> here<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.610> that's<00:02:31.790> not<00:02:32.090> going<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.360> work

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
of here because that's not going to work

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.720 
of here because that's not going to work
we'll<00:02:33.260> go<00:02:33.410> back<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.860> use<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.190> YouTube<00:02:34.700> thing

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
we'll go back and use the YouTube thing

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.910 
we'll go back and use the YouTube thing
and<00:02:35.330> we'll<00:02:35.540> come<00:02:35.720> back<00:02:35.900> here<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.350> we'll<00:02:36.500> grab

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
and we'll come back here and we'll grab

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.940 
and we'll come back here and we'll grab
it<00:02:37.100> from<00:02:37.250> up<00:02:37.520> here<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.090> I'm<00:02:38.600> pretty<00:02:38.930> sure<00:02:39.050> that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
it from up here and I'm pretty sure that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.010 
it from up here and I'm pretty sure that
that's<00:02:40.190> going<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.670> work<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.240> that's<00:02:41.480> one<00:02:41.810> way

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
that's going to work so that's one way

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.890 
that's going to work so that's one way
of<00:02:42.230> doing<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.710> taste<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:44.300> course<00:02:44.570> there<00:02:44.780> is

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
of doing that taste of course there is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.570 
of doing that taste of course there is
another<00:02:44.930> way<00:02:45.470> of<00:02:45.620> doing<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.280> that's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
another way of doing it and that's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.260 
another way of doing it and that's
getting<00:02:46.880> another<00:02:47.390> plugin<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:49.340> will<00:02:49.940> run<00:02:50.240> in

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
getting another plugin that will run in

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.270 
getting another plugin that will run in
the<00:02:50.570> back<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.020> it's<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.290> WordPress<00:02:51.680> iframe

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.150 
the back and it's a WordPress iframe
plug-in<00:02:52.790> which<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.360> use<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.950> will<00:02:55.130> help

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
plug-in which you can use that will help

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.820 
plug-in which you can use that will help
but<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.180> won't<00:02:56.420> help<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.990> widget<00:02:57.170> bonus

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830
