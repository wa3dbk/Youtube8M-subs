how<00:01:46.350> would<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.710> cure<00:01:46.980> it<00:01:47.010> draws<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.880> leadership

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
how would you cure it draws a leadership

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.360 
how would you cure it draws a leadership
snails<00:01:48.750> gonna<00:01:48.990> be<00:01:49.200> well<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.250> he's

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
snails gonna be well I don't think he's

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.950 
snails gonna be well I don't think he's
going<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.700> show<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.450> way<00:01:51.480> but<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.840> do

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
going to show it in that way but I do

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
going to show it in that way but I do
think<00:01:52.290> he's<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.770> farm<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.550> clearly

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
think he's going to be farm and clearly

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.550 
think he's going to be farm and clearly
in<00:01:54.060> control<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:54.900> players<00:01:55.260> are<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
in control when players are going to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.710 
in control when players are going to
know<00:01:55.680> what's<00:01:55.860> expected<00:01:55.980> of<00:01:56.520> them<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.660> think

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
know what's expected of them and I think

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.360 
know what's expected of them and I think
there'll<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.050> consequences<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:59.190> those

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
there'll be consequences when those

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.940 
there'll be consequences when those
expectations<00:01:59.790> are<00:02:00.330> not<00:02:00.360> imagine<00:02:01.050> so<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.860> think

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
expectations are not imagine so I think

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.050 
expectations are not imagine so I think
in<00:02:02.190> that<00:02:02.280> sense<00:02:02.550> when<00:02:02.760> we<00:02:02.790> talk<00:02:03.030> about

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
in that sense when we talk about

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.340 
in that sense when we talk about
leadership<00:02:03.360> those<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.990> things<00:02:04.140> we're

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
leadership those are the things we're

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.690 
leadership those are the things we're
talking<00:02:04.500> about<00:02:04.830> her<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.550> his

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
talking about her and I think that his

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.850 
talking about her and I think that his
style<00:02:06.030> will<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.470> different<00:02:07.470> than<00:02:07.740> those

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
style will be different than those

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.680 
style will be different than those
people<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.430> think<00:02:08.760> he's<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> end<00:02:09.570> up

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
people but I think he's going to end up

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.560 
people but I think he's going to end up
but<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.320> as<00:02:10.470> clear<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.250> unambiguous<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.000> as

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
but just as clear and unambiguous and as

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.350 
but just as clear and unambiguous and as
in<00:02:13.350> charge<00:02:13.680> as<00:02:13.980> those<00:02:14.250> guys<00:02:14.490> are<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> fact

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
in charge as those guys are is the fact

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.790 
in charge as those guys are is the fact
that<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.660> were<00:02:16.230> talking<00:02:16.470> about<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> defense

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that you were talking about the defense

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.370 
that you were talking about the defense
earlier<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.730> fact<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.210> think<00:02:18.570> do<00:02:19.200> look

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
earlier in fact that you I think do look

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.320 
earlier in fact that you I think do look
at<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.620> there<00:02:19.710> were<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.160> many<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.760> bowls<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
at it there were so many more bowls and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.270 
at it there were so many more bowls and
still<00:02:21.540> needed<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.840> be<00:02:21.900> filmed<00:02:21.990> make<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.920> easier

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
still needed to be filmed make it easier

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.980 
still needed to be filmed make it easier
to<00:02:23.340> make<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> transition<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.360> other<00:02:24.450> words<00:02:24.660> if

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
to make the transition in other words if

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.410 
to make the transition in other words if
you<00:02:25.140> guys<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.650> felt<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.070> were<00:02:26.420> maybe

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
you guys if you felt that you were maybe

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.420 
you guys if you felt that you were maybe
one<00:02:27.750> or<00:02:27.900> two<00:02:27.930> players<00:02:28.320> away<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.740> defense<00:02:29.160> then

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
one or two players away on defense then

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.340 
one or two players away on defense then
maybe<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.600> would<00:02:30.720> stay<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:30.959> what<00:02:31.260> you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
maybe you you would stay with what you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.680 
maybe you you would stay with what you
have<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.830> fact<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.100> there's<00:02:32.690> probably

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
have but the fact that there's probably

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.420 
have but the fact that there's probably
four<00:02:33.930> or<00:02:33.959> five<00:02:34.140> guys<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.709> need<00:02:34.890> it's

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
four or five guys that you need it's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
four or five guys that you need it's
easier<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.990> make<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> change

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
easier to if you have to make a change

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.110 
easier to if you have to make a change
you<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.650> make<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.800> change<00:02:38.070> see<00:02:38.370> here's<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
you can make a change see here's the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.020 
you can make a change see here's the
answer<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.930> i'll<00:02:40.050> give<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.290> really<00:02:40.650> from<00:02:41.030> it

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
answer and i'll give it really from it

answer and i'll give it really from it
shuts<00:02:42.300> up<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.690> us<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.080> frankly<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.650> was

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
shuts up to us and frankly this was

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.560 
shuts up to us and frankly this was
consistent<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.670> all<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.910> interviews<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.390> did

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
consistent in all the interviews we did

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.720 
consistent in all the interviews we did
every<00:02:45.810> office<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.410> coach<00:02:46.590> we<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:46.920> together<00:02:47.100> if

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
every office of coach we in together if

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.000 
every office of coach we in together if
we<00:02:47.940> ask<00:02:48.060> them<00:02:48.500> what<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.709> most<00:02:49.860> difficult

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
we ask them what is the most difficult

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.509 
we ask them what is the most difficult
thing<00:02:50.489> for<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> play<00:02:50.970> against<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
thing for you to play against and the

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.009 
thing for you to play against and the
answer<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.820> all<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.060> those<00:02:54.120> cases<00:02:54.180> was<00:02:54.750> these

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
answer in all of those cases was these

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.490 
answer in all of those cases was these
hybrid<00:02:55.550> 3443<00:02:56.989> which<00:02:57.989> made<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> more<00:02:58.320> difficult

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
hybrid 3443 which made it more difficult

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.990 
hybrid 3443 which made it more difficult
to<00:02:58.980> know<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.580> were<00:02:59.670> going<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> be

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
to know what you were going to be

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.270 
to know what you were going to be
against<00:03:00.330> another<00:03:00.540> given<00:03:00.840> play<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:02.040> i<00:03:02.070> think

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
against another given play so i think

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.100 
against another given play so i think
it's<00:03:02.489> clear<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.820> say<00:03:03.060> that's<00:03:03.300> where<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
it's clear to say that's where the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.020 
it's clear to say that's where the
league<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.470> headed<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:05.400> happen<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.730> be<00:03:05.820> lucky

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
league is headed we happen to be lucky

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.699 
league is headed we happen to be lucky
that<00:03:06.180> we<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.690> we<00:03:06.780> have<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.959> significant

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that we think we have a significant

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.009 
that we think we have a significant
number<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.920> players<00:03:08.360> they<00:03:09.360> could<00:03:09.570> fit<00:03:09.810> into

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
number of players they could fit into

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.699 
number of players they could fit into
either<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.950> 4-3<00:03:11.610> or<00:03:11.640> 3-4<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:12.570> leave<00:03:12.750> given

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
either a 4-3 or 3-4 and then leave given

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.410 
either a 4-3 or 3-4 and then leave given
the<00:03:13.830> coordinator<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.519> option<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.000> being<00:03:15.239> one

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
the coordinator the option of being one

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.930 
the coordinator the option of being one
of<00:03:15.480> these<00:03:15.720> hybrids<00:03:16.170> or<00:03:16.410> committing<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.519> either
