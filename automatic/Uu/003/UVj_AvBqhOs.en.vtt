skeletons like that but they're right

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.110 
skeletons like that but they're right
next<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.650> each<00:04:22.770> other<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.190> i<00:04:23.760> stand<00:04:24.060> in

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
next to each other and i stand in

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.420 
next to each other and i stand in
between<00:04:24.240> them<00:04:24.600> when<00:04:24.750> my<00:04:24.900> zen<00:04:25.140> your

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
Jean and I sit there and when I see

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.620 
Jean and I sit there and when I see
someone<00:04:27.740> running<00:04:27.860> back<00:04:28.370> as<00:04:28.610> if<00:04:29.300> they're<00:04:29.449> about

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
someone running back as if they're about

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.749 
someone running back as if they're about
to<00:04:29.840> teleport<00:04:30.289> I<00:04:30.530> tell<00:04:31.039> you<00:04:31.160> block<00:04:31.340> them<00:04:31.490> and

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
to teleport I tell you block them and

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.370 
to teleport I tell you block them and
the<00:04:31.910> best<00:04:32.300> way<00:04:32.449> to<00:04:32.509> tell<00:04:32.810> if<00:04:33.110> they're<00:04:33.259> running

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
the best way to tell if they're running

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.200 
the best way to tell if they're running
back<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.800> teleport<00:04:34.220> is<00:04:34.430> if<00:04:35.120> they<00:04:36.460> are<00:04:37.460> running

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
back to teleport is if they are running

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.210 
back to teleport is if they are running
back<00:04:38.449> and<00:04:38.660> there's<00:04:38.780> no<00:04:38.990> dragons<00:04:39.500> here<00:04:39.560> that's

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220

back and there's no dragons here that's
a<00:04:40.340> good<00:04:40.460> sign<00:04:40.699> that<00:04:40.729> they<00:04:41.330> are<00:04:41.530> they<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.650> ran

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
a good sign that they are they have ran

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.529 
a good sign that they are they have ran
out<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:43.039> food<00:04:43.280> they're<00:04:43.850> not<00:04:43.940> coming<00:04:44.000> back<00:04:44.360> to

the<00:05:48.380> bots<00:05:48.560> they<00:05:48.860> run<00:05:49.070> out<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.220> food<00:05:49.460> so<00:05:49.520> they

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
the bots they run out of food so they

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.390 
the bots they run out of food so they
