for the recordings with the Metropole I

trusty<00:00:12.410> old<00:00:12.620> Evo<00:00:13.719> which<00:00:14.719> is<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.260> guitar<00:00:15.559> I've

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
trusty old Evo which is the guitar I've

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.400 
trusty old Evo which is the guitar I've
been<00:00:15.889> using<00:00:16.100> for<00:00:16.490> many<00:00:16.699> many<00:00:17.000> years<00:00:17.360> and<00:00:17.600> it's

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
been using for many many years and it's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.970 
been using for many many years and it's
a<00:00:18.500> gem

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
a gem

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.450 
a gem
I<00:00:19.010> call<00:00:19.880> it<00:00:20.029> Evo<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:20.590> then<00:00:21.590> I<00:00:21.619> use<00:00:21.920> this<00:00:22.100> guitar

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
I call it Evo and then I use this guitar

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.010 
I call it Evo and then I use this guitar
here<00:00:22.730> which<00:00:23.120> I've<00:00:23.270> been<00:00:23.300> using<00:00:23.570> for<00:00:23.690> quite<00:00:23.990> a

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
here which I've been using for quite a

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.380 
here which I've been using for quite a
long<00:00:24.260> time<00:00:24.470> also<00:00:26.590> flow<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:27.950> it's<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:28.940> gem<00:00:29.210> and

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
long time also flow and it's a gem and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.120 
long time also flow and it's a gem and
the<00:00:30.050> difference<00:00:30.350> is<00:00:30.530> that<00:00:30.560> flow<00:00:30.890> has<00:00:31.100> a

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
the difference is that flow has a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.090 
the difference is that flow has a
sustainer<00:00:31.670> and<00:00:32.410> that's<00:00:33.410> really<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.770> only<00:00:33.800> two

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
sustainer and that's really the only two

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.670 
sustainer and that's really the only two
guitars<00:00:34.460> oh<00:00:34.700> wait<00:00:35.180> there<00:00:35.329> was<00:00:35.469> another<00:00:36.469> one

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
guitars oh wait there was another one

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.290 
guitars oh wait there was another one
which<00:00:36.860> was<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.039> blue<00:00:37.309> gem<00:00:37.699> that<00:00:37.879> I<00:00:37.940> had<00:00:38.150> as<00:00:38.270> a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
which was a blue gem that I had as a

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.479 
which was a blue gem that I had as a
backup<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.020> black<00:00:39.260> one<00:00:39.530> too<00:00:39.860> but<00:00:40.370> there

is<00:00:46.640> a<00:00:46.730> very<00:00:46.820> interesting<00:00:47.329> guitar<00:00:47.810> that<00:00:48.020> I<00:00:48.050> just

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
is a very interesting guitar that I just

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.150 
is a very interesting guitar that I just
got<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.250> I<00:00:50.120> was<00:00:50.270> very<00:00:50.860> impressed<00:00:51.860> with

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
got and I was very impressed with

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.590 
got and I was very impressed with
because<00:00:52.450> they<00:00:53.450> have<00:00:53.840> this<00:00:54.020> concept<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:55.600> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
because they have this concept that the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.670 
because they have this concept that the
guitar<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:56.930> kind<00:00:57.230> of<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.350> screwed-up

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
guitar is kind of a screwed-up

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.760 
guitar is kind of a screwed-up
instrument<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:58.340> it<00:00:58.579> is<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.620> usually<00:01:00.620> when

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
instrument and it is and usually when

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.590 
instrument and it is and usually when
you<00:01:00.890> tune<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.489> guitar<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.210> particular

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
you tune the guitar to a particular

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.550 
you tune the guitar to a particular
chord<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.339> go<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.519> play<00:01:04.729> another<00:01:04.939> chord

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560

you have a guitar and you play an a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.190 
you have a guitar and you play an a
chord

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.039 

it's<00:01:15.920> very<00:01:16.130> hard<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.490> get<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:16.729> in<00:01:16.820> tune<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.360> if

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
it's very hard to get it in tune and if

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.780 
it's very hard to get it in tune and if
you<00:01:18.200> can<00:01:18.470> get<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:18.920> tune<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.549> tune

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
going to be in tune it's just the nature

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.289 
going to be in tune it's just the nature
of<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:30.290> way<00:01:30.470> notes<00:01:31.190> work<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.789> their

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
of the way notes work and their

of the way notes work and their
overtones<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.440> then<00:01:33.979> if<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.190> do<00:01:34.399> get<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.729> in

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
overtones and then if you do get it in

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.100 
overtones and then if you do get it in
tune<00:01:35.030> with<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.330> name<00:01:35.479> when<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.720> play<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.869> D

happens

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.370 
happens
you<00:01:40.970> could<00:01:41.149> never<00:01:41.390> pick<00:01:41.720> up<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.930> guitar<00:01:42.020> and

them<00:01:46.549> be<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.789> tune<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:47.810> can<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.200> this

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
them be in tune but you can on this

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.800 
them be in tune but you can on this
guitar<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.700> specifically<00:01:50.330> because<00:01:50.479> of

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
guitar and that specifically because of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.620 
guitar and that specifically because of
these<00:01:50.960> people<00:01:51.170> who<00:01:51.500> engineered<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:53.390> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
these people who engineered that the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.809 
these people who engineered that the
difference<00:01:54.080> between<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.770> distance<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.670> the

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
difference between the distance of the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.779 
difference between the distance of the
notes<00:01:56.060> on<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.360> guitar<00:01:57.280> really<00:01:58.280> creates<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
notes on the guitar really creates the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.480 
notes on the guitar really creates the
overtones<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.659> know<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.380> in<00:02:00.619> order<00:02:01.459> for

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
overtones you know and and in order for
