just<00:00:11.920> pull<00:00:12.920> a<00:00:12.950> very<00:00:13.250> simple<00:00:13.610> demographic<00:00:14.210> that

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
just pull a very simple demographic that

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.150 
just pull a very simple demographic that
we<00:00:14.510> did<00:00:14.720> create<00:00:14.990> in<00:00:15.140> our<00:00:15.260> office<00:00:15.680> it's<00:00:15.950> just

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160

we did create in our office it's just
one<00:00:16.340> page<00:00:16.550> demographic<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.500> most

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
one page demographic and the most

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.650 
one page demographic and the most
significant<00:00:19.279> number<00:00:19.640> is<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:20.240> number<00:00:20.270> of

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
significant number is the number of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.560 
significant number is the number of

condition we we knew that this might be
a<00:00:56.719> good<00:00:56.840> opportunity

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.420 

we<00:01:02.360> actually<00:01:02.690> couldn't<00:01:03.260> pretty<00:01:03.590> much<00:01:03.830> walked

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
we actually couldn't pretty much walked

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.160 
we actually couldn't pretty much walked
inside<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.239> building<00:01:05.390> there<00:01:05.810> were<00:01:05.900> three

buildings<00:01:26.900> inside<00:01:27.320> even<00:01:28.130> when<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:28.520> have<00:01:28.700> to

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
buildings inside even when we have to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.210 
buildings inside even when we have to
bring<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.150> structural<00:01:29.690> engineer<00:01:29.780> he<00:01:30.770> gave<00:01:31.070> up

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
bring a structural engineer he gave up

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.980 
bring a structural engineer he gave up
at<00:01:31.400> one<00:01:31.580> point<00:01:31.790> he<00:01:31.970> says<00:01:32.210> I'm<00:01:32.360> sorry<00:01:32.600> I<00:01:32.690> have<00:01:32.960> to

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
at one point he says I'm sorry I have to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.810 
at one point he says I'm sorry I have to
really<00:01:33.320> come<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:33.800> evaluate<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.460> building

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
really come and evaluate the building

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.460 
really come and evaluate the building
when<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.030> building<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.420> empty<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:36.020> was

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
when the building is empty this was

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.850 
when the building is empty this was
impossible<00:01:36.880> but<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:38.869> knew<00:01:39.110> even<00:01:39.560> though<00:01:39.680> we

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
impossible but we knew even though we

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.800 
impossible but we knew even though we
have<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.190> do<00:01:40.340> with<00:01:40.490> structural<00:01:41.030> issues<00:01:41.479> in<00:01:41.690> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
have to do with structural issues in the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.350 
have to do with structural issues in the
building<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:42.619> knew<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.800> what<00:01:43.580> pays<00:01:44.060> back

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
building we knew that what pays back

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.649 
building we knew that what pays back
this<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> great<00:01:45.080> location

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.240 

initially<00:01:50.659> when<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:50.990> went<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.590> city<00:01:51.830> with

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
initially when we went to the city with

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.430 
initially when we went to the city with
our<00:01:52.659> architect<00:01:54.220> we<00:01:55.840> did<00:01:56.840> get<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.170> directions

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
our architect we did get the directions

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.320 
our architect we did get the directions
from<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.860> city<00:01:58.070> what<00:01:58.400> we<00:01:58.670> could<00:01:58.880> do<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.180> what

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
from the city what we could do and what

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.859 
from the city what we could do and what
we<00:01:59.360> cannot<00:01:59.810> do<00:02:00.320> in<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.950> particular<00:02:01.159> location

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
we cannot do in this particular location

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.460 
we cannot do in this particular location
it's<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.470> challenging<00:02:03.950> part<00:02:04.660> for<00:02:05.660> the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
it's the challenging part for the

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.040 
it's the challenging part for the
buildings<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.400> neither<00:02:07.640> remodeling<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.660> the

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
buildings that neither remodeling is the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.170 
buildings that neither remodeling is the
structural<00:02:09.560> work<00:02:09.759> we<00:02:10.759> have<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:10.970> very

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
structural work we have a very

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.350 
structural work we have a very
experienced<00:02:11.840> structural<00:02:12.709> engineer<00:02:13.190> when<00:02:13.459> we

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
experienced structural engineer when we

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.740 
experienced structural engineer when we
he<00:02:14.990> goes<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.709> he<00:02:15.739> evaluates<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.580> building<00:02:16.970> he

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
he goes and he evaluates the building he

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.370 
he goes and he evaluates the building he
would<00:02:18.260> give<00:02:18.530> us<00:02:18.739> pretty<00:02:19.670> much<00:02:20.380> cause

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
would give us pretty much cause

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.890 
would give us pretty much cause
breakdown<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.430> structural<00:02:23.150> work<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.660> we

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
breakdown of the structural work that we

need to do in order to renovate the
building<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:27.920> usually<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:29.180> most

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
building and that is usually in most
