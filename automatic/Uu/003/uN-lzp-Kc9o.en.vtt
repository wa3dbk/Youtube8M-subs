schedule and really turn the corner my
rehab<00:01:52.829> starting<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.640> interval

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
rehab starting to do some interval

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.959 
rehab starting to do some interval
training<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.670> fasted<00:01:56.670> running

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
training which was like fasted running

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.580 
training which was like fasted running
and<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.149> slowed<00:01:57.390> down<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> faster<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.409> just

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and it slowed down and faster and just

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
and it slowed down and faster and just
kind<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.829> make<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.820> achilles<00:02:00.210> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.479> catch

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
kind of make my achilles kind of catch

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.600 
kind of make my achilles kind of catch
up<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> adapt<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.950> different<00:02:01.979> speeds<00:02:02.430> i'm

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
up and adapt to different speeds i'm

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.730 
up and adapt to different speeds i'm
running<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.259> hopefully<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> next

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
running it so and hopefully the next

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.289 
running it so and hopefully the next
couple<00:02:05.009> weeks<00:02:05.159> i'll<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.549> back<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.240> the

turf through some agility stuff and

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.580 
turf through some agility stuff and
hopefully<00:02:09.209> by<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.569> middle<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.869> anime<00:02:10.229> I'll<00:02:10.500> be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
hopefully by the middle of anime I'll be

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.320 
hopefully by the middle of anime I'll be
good<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> go<00:02:10.860> what's<00:02:11.670> been<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> actual

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
good to go what's been the actual

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.760 
good to go what's been the actual
hardest<00:02:13.170> part<00:02:13.410> or

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
hardest part or

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.270 
hardest part or
most<00:02:14.040> difficult<00:02:14.430> thing<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.940> handle<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:16.280> 300

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
most difficult thing to handle with 300

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.850 
most difficult thing to handle with 300
I<00:02:17.460> think<00:02:17.930> whenever<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.140> try<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.380> push<00:02:19.620> too

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
I think whenever you try to push too

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.320 
I think whenever you try to push too
hard<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.580> when<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.180> better

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
hard and when you want it to get better

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.900 
hard and when you want it to get better
so<00:02:21.600> bad<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.370> really<00:02:23.370> work<00:02:23.520> hard<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.850> it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
so bad and you really work hard on it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.520 
so bad and you really work hard on it
but<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> kind<00:02:24.960> of<00:02:24.990> almost<00:02:25.140> sets<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.500> back

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
but it kind of almost sets you back

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.960 
but it kind of almost sets you back
because<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.070> push<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.430> hard<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> next

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
because you push it so hard in the next

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.160 
because you push it so hard in the next
day<00:02:27.060> next<00:02:27.420> couple<00:02:27.660> days<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> can't<00:02:28.050> do

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
day next couple days you can't do

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.900 
day next couple days you can't do
anything<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.220> sore<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.490> I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
anything because it's so sore and I

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.130 
anything because it's so sore and I
think<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> hardest<00:02:30.360> part<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.750> finding<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
think the hardest part is just finding a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.290 
think the hardest part is just finding a
balance<00:02:31.290> between<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.980> want<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> work<00:02:33.090> really

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
balance between I want to work really

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.730 
balance between I want to work really
hard<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.600> get<00:02:33.720> back<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.380> same<00:02:34.530> time<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
hard to get back but at the same time I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.530 
hard to get back but at the same time I
can't<00:02:35.040> work<00:02:35.160> work<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.820> too<00:02:35.970> hard<00:02:36.180> because<00:02:36.330> i'll

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
can't work work it too hard because i'll

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.080 
can't work work it too hard because i'll
limit<00:02:36.960> myself<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.830> number<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.670> days<00:02:38.850> after

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
limit myself for a number of days after

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.360 
limit myself for a number of days after
that<00:02:39.360> coach<00:02:40.290> fitzgerald<00:02:40.890> mentioned<00:02:41.250> that

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
that coach fitzgerald mentioned that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.550 
that coach fitzgerald mentioned that
you're<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.300> self-motivating<00:02:43.200> guy<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.500> you

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
you're a self-motivating guy and you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.460 
you're a self-motivating guy and you
really<00:02:43.770> want<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.550> push<00:02:44.640> yourself<00:02:45.000> hard<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.470> he

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
really want to push yourself hard and he

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
really want to push yourself hard and he
said<00:02:46.680> he's<00:02:46.800> worried<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.220> you're<00:02:47.310> going<00:02:47.400> to

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
said he's worried that you're going to

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.560 
said he's worried that you're going to
push<00:02:47.610> yourself<00:02:47.910> too<00:02:48.000> hard<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.300> kind<00:02:48.540> of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
push yourself too hard is that kind of

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.740 
push yourself too hard is that kind of
Deline<00:02:48.840> you're<00:02:49.050> talking<00:02:49.350> yeah<00:02:49.530> yeah<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.040> think

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
Deline you're talking yeah yeah I think

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.000 
Deline you're talking yeah yeah I think
you<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.780> realized<00:02:52.320> I'm<00:02:52.440> pretty<00:02:52.650> quick<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:52.920> I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
you I realized I'm pretty quick when I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.410 
you I realized I'm pretty quick when I
when<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.250> try<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.460> go<00:02:53.610> too<00:02:53.670> hard<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.210> next

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
when I try to go too hard and the next

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.240 
when I try to go too hard and the next
day<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.600> can't<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.140> tough<00:02:55.350> for<00:02:55.500> me<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.680> walk<00:02:55.890> so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
day I can't it's tough for me to walk so

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.310 
day I can't it's tough for me to walk so
I<00:02:56.490> time<00:02:57.330> strike<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.750> pretty<00:02:57.930> good<00:02:58.050> balance

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
I time strike a pretty good balance

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.960 
I time strike a pretty good balance
between<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.430> guess<00:02:59.580> rehabbing

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
between that and I guess rehabbing

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.390 
between that and I guess rehabbing
through<00:03:00.300> pain<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.720> one<00:03:00.870> thing<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.080> be<00:03:01.470> very

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
through pain is one thing that be very

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.280 
through pain is one thing that be very
careful<00:03:02.820> about<00:03:02.850> right<00:03:03.210> right<00:03:03.630> that's<00:03:03.900> nothing

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
careful about right right that's nothing

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110 
careful about right right that's nothing
i<00:03:04.350> mean<00:03:04.380> i've<00:03:04.590> always<00:03:04.830> liked<00:03:05.490> in<00:03:05.640> pain<00:03:05.850> many

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
couple weeks it's tough because it's all

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.020 
couple weeks it's tough because it's all
about<00:03:49.380> how<00:03:49.470> my<00:03:49.500> body<00:03:49.800> reacts<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.730> know<00:03:50.880> you

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
about how my body reacts you know you

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.840 
about how my body reacts you know you
don't<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.209> know<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.480> sure<00:03:51.660> but<00:03:52.050> uh

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
don't really know for sure but uh

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.160 
don't really know for sure but uh
hopefully<00:03:53.850> next<00:03:54.420> week<00:03:54.600> or<00:03:54.720> two<00:03:54.810> I'll<00:03:54.959> get<00:03:55.080> out

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
hopefully next week or two I'll get out

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.110 
hopefully next week or two I'll get out
and<00:03:55.320> turf<00:03:55.530> start<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.400> little<00:03:56.640> changes

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
and turf start the little changes

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120 
and turf start the little changes
direction<00:03:57.480> stuff<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.930> then<00:03:58.020> I<00:03:58.200> mean<00:03:58.560> it's

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
direction stuff and then I mean it's

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.100 
direction stuff and then I mean it's
again<00:03:59.520> it's<00:03:59.550> all<00:03:59.730> how<00:03:59.880> my<00:04:00.330> Achilles<00:04:00.630> reacts<00:04:00.900> to

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
again it's all how my Achilles reacts to

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.050 
again it's all how my Achilles reacts to
the<00:04:01.500> rehab<00:04:01.650> house<00:04:01.950> or<00:04:02.160> gets<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.700> how<00:04:02.880> are<00:04:03.030> we

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
the rehab house or gets and how are we

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.020 
the rehab house or gets and how are we
can<00:04:03.300> push<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.780> guess<00:04:04.410> going<00:04:04.680> back<00:04:04.940> when<00:04:05.940> you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
can push it I guess going back when you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.790 
can push it I guess going back when you
first<00:04:06.270> started<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.720> rehab<00:04:06.990> process<00:04:07.140> how<00:04:07.530> bad

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
first started the rehab process how bad

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.940

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
was the atrophy

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.970 
was the atrophy
how<00:04:09.489> did<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:09.730> work<00:04:09.940> yeah<00:04:10.450> it's<00:04:10.629> real<00:04:10.810> bad<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
how did you work yeah it's real bad it

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.440 
how did you work yeah it's real bad it
was<00:04:12.129> it<00:04:12.310> just<00:04:12.489> looks<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:12.819> skin<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.300> bones

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
was it just looks like skin and bones

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.780 
was it just looks like skin and bones
pretty<00:04:13.750> much<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:15.099> it's<00:04:15.340> really<00:04:15.489> come<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.730> long

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
pretty much and it's really come a long

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.610 
pretty much and it's really come a long
way<00:04:16.060> but<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.419> still<00:04:16.660> suffer<00:04:17.169> pretty<00:04:17.410> good<00:04:17.500> ways

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
way but I still suffer pretty good ways

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.330 
way but I still suffer pretty good ways
to<00:04:17.769> go<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.269> get<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:20.260> size<00:04:20.500> or<00:04:20.739> was<00:04:20.919> before

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
to go to get it the size or was before

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.670 
to go to get it the size or was before
hopefully<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.300> next<00:04:22.510> five<00:04:23.110> month<00:04:23.380> more<00:04:23.620> than

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
hopefully the next five month more than

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.860 
hopefully the next five month more than
a<00:04:23.800> half<00:04:23.980> it'll<00:04:24.160> be<00:04:24.220> back<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:24.760> they<00:04:25.450> write<00:04:25.630> alas

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
a half it'll be back but they write alas

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.060 
a half it'll be back but they write alas
it<00:04:26.229> was<00:04:26.260> pretty<00:04:26.470> tough<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.770> look<00:04:26.889> I<00:04:27.040> just

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
it was pretty tough to look I just

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.740 
it was pretty tough to look I just
because<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.669> may<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:27.850> look<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.479> bone

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
because that may just look like a bone

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.040 
because that may just look like a bone
and<00:04:28.960> stuff<00:04:29.350> hanging<00:04:29.650> off<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.770> it
