looking<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.360> start<00:00:42.989> looking<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> mall

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
looking and start looking at the mall

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.049 
looking and start looking at the mall
and<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.829> started<00:00:44.160> running<00:00:44.250> numbers<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and I started running numbers on it you

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.630 
and I started running numbers on it you
know<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> dynamics<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.160> crazy

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
know for the dynamics and it was crazy

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.270 
know for the dynamics and it was crazy
it<00:00:47.789> should<00:00:48.149> fly<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> built<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.039> foam

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it should fly so I built on that foam

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.439 
it should fly so I built on that foam
prototype<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.000> showed<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
prototype that I showed you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.080 
prototype that I showed you
you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.719> any<00:00:51.989> flew<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> told<00:00:53.039> her<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.730> 12

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you know any flew so I told her all 12

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.430 
you know any flew so I told her all 12
year-old<00:00:54.270> kids<00:00:54.570> flying<00:00:54.809> around<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> Sunday

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
year-old kids flying around a Sunday

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.619 
year-old kids flying around a Sunday
after<00:00:55.680> upside<00:00:56.129> down<00:00:56.370> doing<00:00:56.789> spins<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.539> all

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
after upside down doing spins and all

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
after upside down doing spins and all
kinds<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.989> crap<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.829> figured<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
kinds of crap with it you figured if the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.760 
kinds of crap with it you figured if the
flat<00:00:59.699> foam<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.120> fly<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.840> rock<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> roll

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
flat foam would fly this rock and roll

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.160 
flat foam would fly this rock and roll
with<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> symmetrical<00:01:02.609> section<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> okay<00:01:03.629> so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
with a symmetrical section on it okay so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.060 
with a symmetrical section on it okay so
you<00:01:04.769> set<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:06.180> yeah<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
you set out to make this thing yeah and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.800 
you set out to make this thing yeah and
we<00:01:08.070> sliced<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> model<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.210> cut<00:01:09.420> took<00:01:09.600> one

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
we sliced up the model we cut took one

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.030 
we sliced up the model we cut took one
of<00:01:09.840> these<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.049> cut<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.770> million

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
of these and cut it into a million

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
of these and cut it into a million
pieces<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.810> long<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
pieces all right so you so long this is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
pieces all right so you so long this is
a<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> Ravel<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.400> monitor<00:01:14.850> our<00:01:14.970> tech<00:01:15.360> model

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a like a Ravel or monitor our tech model

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.920 
a like a Ravel or monitor our tech model
and<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.110> 495<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.939> cut<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.659> like

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and get that 495 and you cut this like

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
and get that 495 and you cut this like
an<00:01:19.080> MRI<00:01:19.320> yeah<00:01:20.130> process<00:01:20.610> without<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.000> wings<00:01:21.150> on

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
an MRI yeah process without the wings on

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
an MRI yeah process without the wings on
I<00:01:21.390> did<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> body<00:01:21.900> first<00:01:22.170> okay<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:22.979> that's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I did the body first okay and so that's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
I did the body first okay and so that's
what<00:01:23.400> these<00:01:23.580> pieces<00:01:24.060> are<00:01:24.390> those<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.960> these

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
what these pieces are those are these

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
what these pieces are those are these
corresponds<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> different<00:01:26.850> parts<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
corresponds to different parts of the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
corresponds to different parts of the
bottom<00:01:27.600> parts<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> them<00:01:28.140> okay<00:01:28.799> wait<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> minute

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
bottom parts of them okay wait a minute

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
bottom parts of them okay wait a minute
you<00:01:30.360> didn't<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.110> Kinkos<00:01:31.500> would<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you didn't take this to Kinkos would you

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.440 
you didn't take this to Kinkos would you
tell<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> trace<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.939> take<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.150> pen

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
tell you trace it you just take a pen

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.359 
tell you trace it you just take a pen
and<00:01:33.479> Kinkos<00:01:34.229> has<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> machine<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> can

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and Kinkos has a machine that you can

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
and Kinkos has a machine that you can
program<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:35.939> whatever<00:01:36.259> percentage<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
program it for whatever percentage of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
program it for whatever percentage of
increase<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.829> want<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.250> these<00:01:38.369> came<00:01:38.700> from

increase you want and these came from

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
increase you want and these came from
the<00:01:39.060> Kinkos<00:01:39.450> yeah<00:01:40.110> crying's<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.100> phones

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
six-foot version notice the wing shape I

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.300 
six-foot version notice the wing shape I
I<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> dragon<00:02:34.260> coming<00:02:34.470> through<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:34.980> was

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
on that one that was 12 years ago I had

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.990 
on that one that was 12 years ago I had
this<00:02:46.500> working<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.069> can't<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.430> by<00:02:47.580> how<00:02:47.700> things

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
this working you can't go by how things

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.210 
this working you can't go by how things
look<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.049> look<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> dynamics<00:02:50.040> of

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
look you have to look at the dynamics of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
look you have to look at the dynamics of
it<00:02:50.370> even<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.269> dragon<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.780> much<00:02:51.930> as<00:02:52.110> that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it even with the dragon as much as that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.890 
it even with the dragon as much as that
looks<00:02:52.769> insane<00:02:53.160> look<00:02:53.940> at<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.269> it's<00:02:54.420> got<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> wing

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
looks insane look at it it's got a wing

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.570 
looks insane look at it it's got a wing
that<00:02:54.930> looks<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.500> bird<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.190> birds<00:02:56.400> have

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that looks like a bird the birds have

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.860 
that looks like a bird the birds have
had<00:02:56.730> how<00:02:56.940> many<00:02:57.120> million<00:02:57.330> years<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.690> evolution

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
had how many million years of evolution

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.009 
had how many million years of evolution
over<00:02:58.380> us<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.700> mean<00:03:00.180> really<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.750> shapes

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
over us that I mean really the shapes

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.199 
over us that I mean really the shapes
decent<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.590> got<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> good<00:03:02.010> airfoil<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.849> it's

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
decent you got a good airfoil on it it's

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.690 
decent you got a good airfoil on it it's
got<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> V<00:03:03.660> tail<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> beech<00:03:04.440> bonanza<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:05.549> how

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
got a V tail like a beech bonanza so how

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.360 
got a V tail like a beech bonanza so how
long<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.560> really<00:03:07.890> look<00:03:08.130> at<00:03:08.310> it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
long can it be if you really look at it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.180 
long can it be if you really look at it
it's<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.720> an<00:03:09.870> airplane<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.410> lot<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.830> guys<00:03:10.950> take

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
it's it's an airplane a lot of guys take

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.500 
it's it's an airplane a lot of guys take
a<00:03:11.220> jet<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.610> they<00:03:11.700> paint<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> face<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.450> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
a jet and they paint the face of a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.970 
a jet and they paint the face of a
dragon<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:12.989> well<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.319> went<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> other<00:03:13.739> way<00:03:13.890> I

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
dragon on it well I went the other way I

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.650 
dragon on it well I went the other way I
took<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.250> dragon<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.670> made<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:14.849> jet<00:03:15.060> out<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.360> all

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
took a dragon I made a jet out of it all

that the head turns in flight and it
actually<00:03:54.989> helps<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> coordinate<00:03:56.190> through<00:03:56.430> the

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
actually helps it coordinate through the

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.940 
actually helps it coordinate through the
turn<00:03:56.730> what<00:03:57.720> happens<00:03:58.049> when<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.319> jaw<00:03:58.500> opens

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
turn what happens when the jaw opens

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.809

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
system that uses a stun-gun circuit so

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.220 
system that uses a stun-gun circuit so
it<00:04:05.400> actually<00:04:06.030> breathes<00:04:06.329> fire<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:07.049> get<00:04:07.200> a
