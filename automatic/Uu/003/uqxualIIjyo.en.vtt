00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
much damage well you see it did get a

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.860 
much damage well you see it did get a
buff<00:03:12.130> going<00:03:12.430> from<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.700> baseline<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.150> 169

but<00:03:16.510> that's<00:03:16.570> really<00:03:17.020> still<00:03:17.470> not<00:03:17.709> enough

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
but that's really still not enough

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.160 
but that's really still not enough

the pathing of the toads was made more

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.570 
the pathing of the toads was made more
in<00:03:20.260> line<00:03:20.440> with<00:03:20.470> what<00:03:20.739> we<00:03:20.769> see<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.130> console

and the guys have been drinking and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.600 
and the guys have been drinking and
slamming<00:03:23.290> energy<00:03:23.590> drinks<00:03:23.890> all<00:03:24.040> day<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.459> they

slamming energy drinks all day and they

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.460 
slamming energy drinks all day and they
really<00:03:24.910> seem<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.209> move<00:03:25.330> around<00:03:25.480> right<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:25.900> but

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
really seem to move around right now but

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.710 
really seem to move around right now but
still<00:03:26.920> there's<00:03:27.489> something<00:03:27.880> missing<00:03:28.360> but<00:03:28.630> the

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
still there's something missing but the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.330 
still there's something missing but the
best<00:03:28.900> part<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.380> from<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.709> renho<00:03:30.010> flair

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
this makes the frogs homed in on their

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.680 
this makes the frogs homed in on their
targets<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.880> give<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> chance<00:03:34.299> for<00:03:34.540> them<00:03:34.660> to

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
targets and give a chance for them to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.320 
targets and give a chance for them to
explode<00:03:35.170> twice<00:03:35.640> effectively<00:03:36.640> making<00:03:37.060> them

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
explode twice effectively making them

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.180 
explode twice effectively making them
deal<00:03:37.570> twice<00:03:37.989> their<00:03:38.200> damage<00:03:38.560> which<00:03:38.830> makes<00:03:39.070> it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
deal twice their damage which makes it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.090 
deal twice their damage which makes it
almost<00:03:39.370> 500%<00:03:40.180> weapon<00:03:40.840> damage<00:03:40.989> for<00:03:41.530> free<00:03:41.890> and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
almost 500% weapon damage for free and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.440 
almost 500% weapon damage for free and
this<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.489> reason<00:03:42.640> why<00:03:42.850> I'm<00:03:42.970> using<00:03:43.120> pierce

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
this is the reason why I'm using pierce

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.570 
this is the reason why I'm using pierce
the<00:03:43.570> veil<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.140> no<00:03:44.260> real<00:03:44.500> mana<00:03:44.739> cost<00:03:45.040> at<00:03:45.250> all<00:03:45.340> I

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
the veil but no real mana cost at all I

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.949 
the veil but no real mana cost at all I
don't<00:03:45.820> have<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.000> worry<00:03:46.180> about<00:03:46.330> wasting<00:03:46.630> any

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
don't have to worry about wasting any

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.930 
don't have to worry about wasting any
mana<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.380> therefore<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.739> 30%<00:03:48.190> increased<00:03:48.730> mana

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
mana so therefore the 30% increased mana

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.550 
mana so therefore the 30% increased mana
cost<00:03:49.180> doesn't<00:03:49.570> really<00:03:49.750> do<00:03:49.959> anything<00:03:50.200> I'm<00:03:50.530> just

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
cost doesn't really do anything I'm just

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.449 
cost doesn't really do anything I'm just
gaining<00:03:50.980> 20%<00:03:51.670> bonus<00:03:51.940> damage<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:54.190> how<00:03:54.280> do<00:03:54.340> you
