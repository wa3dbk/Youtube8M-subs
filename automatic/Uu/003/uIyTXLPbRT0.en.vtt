00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
but not everything because it just gets

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.310 
but not everything because it just gets
too<00:02:03.370> confusing<00:02:03.850> but<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.600> combat<00:02:04.900> Skinner's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320

are<00:02:05.440> all<00:02:05.590> going<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.830> be<00:02:05.920> unique<00:02:06.250> everyone<00:02:06.729> will

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
are all going to be unique everyone will

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.740 
are all going to be unique everyone will
be<00:02:06.940> slightly<00:02:07.210> different

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
be slightly different

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.290 
be slightly different
I'll<00:02:07.840> not<00:02:08.020> make<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.560> same<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:09.729> number<00:02:10.149> them

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
I'll not make to the same so number them

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.560 
I'll not make to the same so number them
the<00:02:11.200> d1<00:02:11.680> once<00:02:12.580> I've<00:02:12.760> got<00:02:12.910> my<00:02:12.940> steel<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
the d1 once I've got my steel and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.229 
the d1 once I've got my steel and
materials<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:15.400> won't<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.730> numbered<00:02:16.030> because

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
materials they won't be numbered because

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.130 
materials they won't be numbered because
they're<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:16.870> production<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.550> yeah

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and it's very hard to see the finish yes

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.650 
and it's very hard to see the finish yes
this<00:02:23.290> camera's<00:02:23.770> not<00:02:23.950> too<00:02:24.160> clever<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.540> it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
this camera's not too clever but it

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.210 
this camera's not too clever but it
stone<00:02:26.380> washed<00:02:27.090> its<00:02:28.470> sanded<00:02:29.470> back<00:02:29.650> then<00:02:30.040> it's

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
stone washed its sanded back then it's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.010 
stone washed its sanded back then it's
rubbed<00:02:30.489> with<00:02:31.470> scotch<00:02:32.470> brite<00:02:33.209> then<00:02:34.209> I<00:02:34.660> changed

rubbed with scotch brite then I changed

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.810 
rubbed with scotch brite then I changed
my<00:02:35.140> mind<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.890> then<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.220> been<00:02:36.430> hit<00:02:36.580> with<00:02:36.700> a

jumping<00:02:57.490> on<00:02:57.580> there<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.320> inspired<00:02:59.320> by<00:02:59.470> brother

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
jumping on there is inspired by brother

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.580 
jumping on there is inspired by brother
Marshalls<00:03:00.490> I<00:03:00.760> saw<00:03:01.420> how<00:03:01.630> he<00:03:01.690> does<00:03:01.990> is<00:03:02.110> jumping

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
Marshalls I saw how he does is jumping

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.560 
Marshalls I saw how he does is jumping
and<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:03.460> thought<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.790> look<00:03:03.940> quite<00:03:04.150> :<00:03:04.480> I'll

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
and I thought that look quite : I'll

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.990 
and I thought that look quite : I'll
give<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.870> go

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
give it a go

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
give it a go
obviously<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.180> used<00:03:07.960> mechanical<00:03:08.590> means<00:03:08.800> he

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
obviously I used mechanical means he

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.120 
obviously I used mechanical means he
uses<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.760> file<00:03:10.110> fair<00:03:11.110> play<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:14.500> yeah<00:03:14.680> did<00:03:14.980> that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
uses a file fair play but yeah did that

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.050 
uses a file fair play but yeah did that
jump<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.550> up<00:03:15.640> at<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.880> front<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.610> it's<00:03:18.850> not

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
jump in up at the front and it's not

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.960 
jump in up at the front and it's not
gonna<00:03:19.240> for<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.690> count<00:03:19.930> was<00:03:20.050> rubbish<00:03:20.970> the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
gonna for this count was rubbish the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.460 
gonna for this count was rubbish the
same<00:03:22.180> jumping<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> other<00:03:22.930> one<00:03:23.080> but<00:03:23.290> I've

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
same jumping is the other one but I've

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.140 
same jumping is the other one but I've
made<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:24.040> tidier<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.220> call<00:03:27.550> it<00:03:27.700> further<00:03:27.910> we

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
made it tidier what I call it further we

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.910 
made it tidier what I call it further we
can<00:03:28.360> actually<00:03:28.480> see<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.650> cool

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
can actually see that is just so cool

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.410 
can actually see that is just so cool
saw<00:03:30.430> industrial-looking

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.520 

obviously<00:03:34.420> done<00:03:34.570> with<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.780> dry<00:03:34.959> file<00:03:37.530> yeah

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
obviously done with the dry file yeah

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.980 
obviously done with the dry file yeah
she's<00:03:38.890> sharp

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
she's sharp

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.330 
she's sharp
now<00:03:40.990> this<00:03:41.140> one's<00:03:41.350> got<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.500> smaller<00:03:41.860> swedge<00:03:42.160> on

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
now this one's got a smaller swedge on

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.980 
now this one's got a smaller swedge on
it<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:43.600> got<00:03:43.750> less<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.230> drop<00:03:44.470> point<00:03:45.990> compare

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
it it's got less of a drop point compare

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.180 
it it's got less of a drop point compare
the<00:03:47.140> two<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.230> looks<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.890> hundred

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
the two but it looks like it's a hundred

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.030 
the two but it looks like it's a hundred
and<00:03:54.280> twenty<00:03:54.610> year<00:03:54.760> old<00:03:55.560> straight<00:03:56.560> out<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.800> the

and twenty year old straight out of the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.860 
and twenty year old straight out of the
future<00:03:57.540> if<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.870> makes<00:03:59.140> sense<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:01.269> he's

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
future if that makes sense and he's

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.430 
future if that makes sense and he's
quite<00:04:02.200> caught<00:04:02.470> anyway<00:04:03.130> that's<00:04:03.519> those<00:04:04.440> I've

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
quite caught anyway that's those I've

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.430 
quite caught anyway that's those I've
also<00:04:05.650> made<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:07.060> couple<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.900> slingshots<00:04:09.360> trapeze
