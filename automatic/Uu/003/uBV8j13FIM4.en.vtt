00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.520
 good morning friends today i want you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.460
 tell about the next korean cream 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.690
 this time make and that cool for school 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.059
 with the name after school baby fondation 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.430
 full lunchbox and link 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.910
 where I took the bibi cream I will leave downstairs in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.490
 Infobox please drop in there 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.460
 so this is one of the few creams that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
 I took thanks to the packaging 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.800
 I could resist I like 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.290
 outer packaging is matte cardboard with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.230
 picture inserted i.e. it is not 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.600
 whole package is like this bibi 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.500
 cream looks inside we open 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 package 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:51.059
 and pull out your clip 3 very 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.370
 a nice pack of polka dots very 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.590
 that is convenient to them easy to hold in your hand 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.969
 it is compact enough and despite 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.969
 the fact that here the product is 40 grams 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.519
 what else did i like this cream with me 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.530
 he hurt a little because I'm together 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.560
 with him managed to fall and 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.610
 banged off part of the cap so when we 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.939
 open the lid 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 we see here is the mirror as well 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.360
 concealer and highlighter which is remarkable 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.890
 This highlighter manufacturer recommends 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.470
 put on the area between the middle 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.810
 brow absolutely horizontally that is 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.420
 so here you are swiping your finger strip 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.700
 from the middle of one brow to the middle 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 the other for what it is done it is done 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.659
 in order to draw attention to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.600
 eyebrows because koreans tend to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.720
 wear wide enough and straight eyebrows 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 Well, they have such a culture so it is accepted 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.079
 and it is here that to the directness of these eyebrows 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.810
 draw attention is recommended here 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.649
 such a straight line and hold 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.130
 to brighten 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:05.490
 this place is so well, I broke down already 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.649
 just about flew a piece under the cover we immediately 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.479
 we find out let's close it better 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.069
 because otherwise your that flies all 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.550
 I will find them bibi cream 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.110
 I do not have a batcher 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.260
 second as always i take the standard 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.660
 the second shade in the first shades here if 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.790
 on the second here is a brunette girl so and so on 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.350
 first shades which are lighter there 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.440
 drawn blonde is not fake 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.750
 just so different packaging y 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
 this product and so under cover 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.430
 dispenser as I said no here 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.920
 such a spatula and cream, it is not light 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:47.670
 his mind is not dark he has a beautiful one 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.489
 here is the middle tone if you put on your hand 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.100
 it can be seen very easily shaded 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.459
 hours I'll take a small drop and just 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:03.390
 I can make out his arm 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.980
 slightly whiter than me and having time with him 37 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.770
 that is, he is quite such 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.330
 well protected and for a time he 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.820
 merges quietly with the skin but all 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.980
 Equal remains see how much cream 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.030
 it seems dark here and how much it 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.830
 becomes light 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.080
 when you spread it over your face 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.720
 consider this and you may have to 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.060
 correct such bibi cream powder 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.130
 because for those who say so not 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.930
 very light-skinned it can be 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.360
 problem he is a little bit 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.019
 leaves in lightness and in times it wreath 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.820
 visible on my yellow skin so in 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.510
 In this case, for me it is a little bit 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.160
 a little bit here was such a disappointment 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.340
 of the advantages I want to note that it is very good 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.070
 this bibi cream falls he hides everything 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.269
 it is rather dense but light 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.150
 that is, he does not require the application of himself 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.860
 in several layers there in two in three layers 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.690
 to hide any redness 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.820
 some kind of skin imperfections + also 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.480
 what is there all in one 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.120
 and proofreader and highlighter and bibi cream 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.150
 that is, taking with you one such 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.250
 the bottle you replace 3 means it 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.410
 very convenient when you go somewhere 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.070
 travel or somewhere else 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.350
 suggested ad-din this here's baby cream and 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.440
 you don't need anything now 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.960
 show concealer concealer perfect 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.960
 idea lower just for me beige 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:47.910
 colors here again which becomes on 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.450
 my arm's a little bit later here he is 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.620
 slightly in branch now I will type still 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.810
 more specifically already show 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.930
 Of course I am such a brutal layer of fire 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.510
 and layering because I have now 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.820
 hands a lot of product but 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.190
 not less, too , but consider 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.920
 that's exactly bruises and some wreaths under 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.290
 his eyes he hides very well and not 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.850
 wrinkles into fine wrinkles too 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.850
 very important because I sometimes 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.770
 happens when you smile and here 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.750
 so here are all concealer going and 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.420
 some strange folds are formed 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.330
 although they are not really in life this 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.100
 concealer does not dry what is great 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.950
 advantage see here and so 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.830
 looks pure beige it seems yes he what 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.200
 very fit to the shade of my skin on 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.210
 actually on the skin it becomes slightly 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:41.370
 here these are more white and pink and pay 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.220
 attention is a drop she started too 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.520
 lighten up a little bit and leave 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.350
 in pink so that those who under the tone 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.510
 skin yellow is such a bright 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.210
 yellow beige like mine 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.370
 this is probably not very bibi cream 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.770
 it will be good because it will be visible 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.470
 the difference between the face and the neck ie the face 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.200
 will be this white and the neck will be 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.140
 a little yellowish is also very important 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.500
 The moment this bibi cream is reflected when 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.840
 a flash of very white color I do not know with what 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.600
 this is due either to a large number 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.820
 from p. I noticed that many bibi cream 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.620
 Asian sin this kind of like in 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.720
 life you and now make up looking in 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.150
 the mirror of everything is fine but as soon as 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.360
 it's worth taking a picture of you all the more so 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.130
 flash everything turns white face and all 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.020
 the rest is framed by some here 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.229
 incomprehensible yellow for me this 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.539
 Of course a small minus highlighter is very 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.310
 nice soft pink pearl 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.120
 so that's white and pink 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.700
 wherever it here 50 he'll put it 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.160
 well distributed and practically 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.890
 disappears on the skin can not be highlighted 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.550
 any sites which you like that is 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:56.490
 you can nose the middle of your forehead between 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.800
 eyebrows that's how the manufacturer suggests 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.570
 highlighter is best mixed with 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.600
 skin and oddly enough even though 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:06.390
 that he is packing pink enough 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.400
 it does not look like that on the skin then there is no 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.470
 this time the wreaths are very beautiful when 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.580
 beautiful nacreous glow why 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:16.590
 so I do not know, but this cream is cream itself 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.230
 the one that is the most my other 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.440
 form of creams go away in folds on the skin 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:25.800
 that is, you see practical here merged 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.420
 skin cream applied to the skin with 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.000
 the rest is still visible when 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.830
 certain lighting that he is whiter and 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.660
 pinker so consider this when 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.060
 I do not have purchases of the first volume 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.250
 I know how he behaves but here is the second tone 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.750
 behaves exactly like that is for 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.890
 it needs to be either slightly lighter 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:45.960
 than i have light skin either just 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.950
 turn your attention to bibi cream and 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.960
 other brands 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.790
 actually I have everything big today 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.050
 Thank you for your attention. I hope that something 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.050
 from the review was helpful
