00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.120
 ah 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.570
 hello youtubers here I bring you a couple of 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.910
 very beautiful earrings here I leave you in the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.960
 links so you can visit as I did 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.080
 this will be test here are both 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.950
 earrings that came out of a couple of closures 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.730
 decomposed so we see step process 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.510
 step to make the earring of the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.489
 good closing clasps 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.260
 I had these two compounds so 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:44.630
 I took the four would be four there 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.750
 You can see how I hung them 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.040
 and of course you can do it the best 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:57.620
 way then with a costume jewelery ring 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:00.680
 we put the head of the closure and there 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.550
 we put the same one I'm going to put it 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.550
 invested 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.050
 there it is and a small decoration 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.050
 we are also going to place 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.000
 and we close 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.960
 then we are going to place the hook and 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.770
 first the decoration goes and then the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.740
 closing head and we close 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.960
 and there are our first earrings 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.060
 very very striking for the others good 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.899
 this is a little more laborious but 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.990
 they are very beautiful as you can see 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.340
 then we are going to occupy two stretches of 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.750
 closing 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.890
 well here this one was already cut like this 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.400
 that would be nothing more than two stretches 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.260
 and let's roll up slowly this 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.950
 will be in a flat way that is 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.950
 the magazine 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:13.930
 and we're going to take it very tight 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.400
 and at the end there we are going to make a small 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.400
 sewing point 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.200
 for those below that are boludos let 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.230
 to roll it in the same way 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.230
 only that leaving half closing towards 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.090
 outside and we are going to sew it has also 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.090
 tight with great care 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.790
 and since we have both what we 're going to 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.180
 to do is unite them and already cooked what 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.110
 we are going to do is put the ring of the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.930
 We are also going to sew it with a 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.020
 golden thread I chose you can choose 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.590
 the same one that occupies this for sewing 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.840
 and that youtubers believe this is all like this 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.210
