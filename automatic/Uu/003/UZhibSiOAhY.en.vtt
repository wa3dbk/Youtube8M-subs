some people said it was an

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:23.380 
some people said it was an
accurate

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.780 
accurate

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.929 
accurate
I<00:01:23.789> use<00:01:24.219> that<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.670> day<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.929> walk

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:25.039 
I use that the other day to walk

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.929 
I use that the other day to walk
to<00:01:25.280> work<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:26.319> 2.1<00:01:27.600> miles

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:28.329 
to work was 2.1 miles

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.249 
to work was 2.1 miles
it's<00:01:28.920> sad<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.859> distance<00:01:30.249> from

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.359 
it's sad that the distance from

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.049 
it's sad that the distance from
my<00:01:30.529> house<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.090> work<00:01:31.259> was<00:01:31.509> 2.2<00:01:32.049> miles

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:32.380 
my house to work was 2.2 miles

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.539 
my house to work was 2.2 miles
so

so
pretty<00:01:33.450> accurate<00:01:33.889> to<00:01:33.999> me<00:01:34.549> when<00:01:34.939> I

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:34.990 
pretty accurate to me when I

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.389 
pretty accurate to me when I
compared<00:01:35.529> to<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.840> Google<00:01:36.149> Maps

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.789 
compared to the Google Maps

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.739 
compared to the Google Maps
now<00:01:39.139> go<00:01:40.020> back<00:01:40.119> here

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:41.139 
now go back here

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:43.130 
now go back here
and<00:01:41.539> next<00:01:41.740> thing<00:01:42.319> is<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.740> heart<00:01:43.130> rate

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.200 
and next thing is the heart rate

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.859 
and next thing is the heart rate
monitor

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:44.259 
monitor

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.049 
monitor
or<00:01:45.429> go<00:01:45.569> here<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:47.499> I<00:01:47.509> just<00:01:47.959> took<00:01:48.049> this

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:48.319 
or go here and I just took this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.660 
or go here and I just took this
measurement

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.060 
measurement

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.169 
measurement
work<00:01:49.939> instantly<00:01:50.420> on<00:01:50.569> the<00:01:50.659> first<00:01:51.020> try

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.209 
ten times what are some like
that<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.829> use<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.529> once<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:00.929> twice<00:02:01.209> a

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.289 
that I use that once or twice a

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.279 
that I use that once or twice a
day<00:02:01.459> for<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:01.909> last<00:02:02.049> month

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.679 
day for the last month
for<00:02:03.200> fifty<00:02:03.560> or<00:02:03.719> sixty<00:02:03.859> times<00:02:04.490> give<00:02:04.679> or

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.759 
for fifty or sixty times give or

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.789 
for fifty or sixty times give or
take<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.740> i've<00:02:05.909> only<00:02:05.990> failed<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.789> its

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:07.009 
take and i've only failed to its

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:07.990 
take and i've only failed to its
only<00:02:07.179> fair<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.560> measure<00:02:07.859> my<00:02:07.990> heart

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.280 
only fair to measure my heart

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.619 
rate

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.480 
rate
five<00:02:09.450> or<00:02:09.519> six<00:02:09.579> times<00:02:10.340> are<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.480> think

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.670 
five or six times are so I think

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.199 
five or six times are so I think
that's<00:02:11.939> a<00:02:11.980> pretty<00:02:12.189> good

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.599 
that's a pretty good

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.990 
that's a pretty good
step<00:02:12.879> up<00:02:13.110> from<00:02:13.299> what<00:02:13.409> it<00:02:13.500> used<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.879> be

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.390 
step up from what it used to be

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.289
