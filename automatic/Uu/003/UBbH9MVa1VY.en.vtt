00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.000
 following a tablet test 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.410
 hp slate 7 more so here we go 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 talk about all that is specs 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 techniques of this tablet then already 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.010
 we will start it's a screen so 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.769
 as the name indicated 7 inches so 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 the resolution is a 1280 resolution 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.189
 by 800 pixels 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 it's a bit of a shame because 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 often says it now practically 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.009
 all the builders have gone to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.050
 tablets with full hd resolutions 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
 I am thinking in particular of the nexus is the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.840
 latest version that is with a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.879
 resolution 1920 by 1200 pixels way for 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.739
 hp shot could have offered us a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.340
 screen with a resolution a little bit 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.930
 more superior to this resolution of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.750
 based 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.860
 then it's a processor like 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 I told you about the first video 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.859
 it's a nvidia tegra 3 processor that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.410
 installs and for once we have a 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.160
 flea tendency and but the tegra 3 at 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.530
 tegra 4 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.570
 it sounds curious but we noticed that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.070
 j is the tegra 3 is much better 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.159
 terms of speed and fluidity 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.979
 it's really much more interesting 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.350
 internally we also have a gig of ram 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.030
 installed we will do it again 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.170
 this criticism is that mom 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.450
 virtually all builders 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.070
 offer tablets with two gigas 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.520
 3 gigabytes of RAM or even on the last 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
 tablets 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 we also find that on this one I 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.729
 can nothing offer us a tablet 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.829
 a little bit beefier in terms of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.060
 ram but for once, it works 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.590
 it's better than some tablets 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.000
 we could test it's pretty fluid 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.460
 so there is not much problem at this 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.259
 level there internal storage it makes 8 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.869
 gigabytes we can go up to 32 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 gigabytes depending on the different 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.030
 models so that's at the network level 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.040
 we have the right to the wifi network so that 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.390
 it's a classic and we also have the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.579
 so right to GPS and bluetooth 4.0 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.689
 so that's ok also one thing 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.439
 that we find regularly on 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.840
 android tablets 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.820
 so I'm going around the table 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.030
 so is there you see there on the side 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.090
 asia has absolutely nothing there right there 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.880
 on the slice I hope we can see 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.920
 so there you have the volume + me 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.770
 here is the button to see set 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.040
 watch out there it's an audio sensor for the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.210
 videoconferencing on the top and that's 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.630
 where it gets interesting with this 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.660
 tablet we have the jack 3.5 mm here it's 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.000
 the charge the charge in micro usb that is 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.340
 right there and especially the most interesting 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.790
 it's here we have a microsd slot on this 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.440
 Tablet 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.690
 they were already offered on the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.890
 first version of the slide this island 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.020
 once again renewed 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.150
 note that this slot can not contain 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.920
 capacities greater than 32 giga on 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.320
 tried with a 64 card it does not happen 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.170
 not at all the card is not him on 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.290
 this side we have nothing I'm going to go on the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.090
 back because there we have on the back of a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.210
 camera so with a sensor that makes 5 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.030
 doubt megapixels are unfortunately not 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.800
 of flash led by Phocean proposed 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.960
 there unfortunately this not proposed and 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.550
 this camera can record in 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.840
 720p and in front right there then it's 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.010
 in the name of finding there usually the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.500
 find it but there it is right on the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.810
 side we have a vga camera that allows to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.370
 videoconferencing 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.690
 so here is a little bit for them 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.120
 technical specifications 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.650
 the table is 3,142 g 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.720
 so that's okay it's a tablet that is 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.070
 very easy to take in hand that is 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.320
 very light and that from a point of view 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.270
 ergonomics is very nice in terms of 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.230
 dimensions it's 100 94 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.390
 this share to 122.7 over a thickness and 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.510
 the thickness is quite impressive 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.970
 because we're still 10 7 mm so 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.770
 it's still 1.7 cm is enough 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.380
 beefy knowing that most 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.180
 shelves now turn to 0.7 mm 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.430
 it's still pretty sturdy 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.170
 here is a little version of android 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.450
 who turns on this tablet if android 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.970
 4 points of jelly bean is a portage 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.990
 to android 4.4 is expected by the end 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.990
 of the year 2014 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 Oh
