little over four inches this way so

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.450 
little over four inches this way so
that's<00:00:45.179> pretty<00:00:45.780> small<00:00:46.050> package<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:46.889> it<00:00:47.039> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that's pretty small package but it you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
that's pretty small package but it you
can<00:00:47.609> fit<00:00:47.909> it<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.269> lot<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.449> places<00:00:48.690> very

Chris

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.440 

see<00:03:10.370> here<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:13.070> one's<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.400> last<00:03:13.550> one<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.360> I

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
see here this one's the last one but I

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.340 
see here this one's the last one but I
think<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.750> can't<00:03:14.900> get<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.140> idea<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:18.320> just

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
think you can't get the idea you just

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.740 
think you can't get the idea you just
line<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.370> up<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.850> then<00:03:19.940> release<00:03:20.030> ones<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.570> line

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
line it up and then release ones in line

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.440 
line it up and then release ones in line
up<00:03:20.870> here<00:03:21.730> probably<00:03:22.730> hit<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.850> little<00:03:23.090> bit<00:03:23.240> better

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
up here probably hit a little bit better

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.970 
up here probably hit a little bit better
if<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.810> wind<00:03:24.050> blowing<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.800> match

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
if the wind blowing and the match

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.120 
if the wind blowing and the match
wouldn't<00:03:25.310> move<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:26.590> but<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.770> can't<00:03:27.980> have

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
wouldn't move it but you can't have

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.530 
wouldn't move it but you can't have
everything<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.580> be<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.850> women<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.300> be<00:03:29.420> all

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
everything to be like women to be all

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:43.960 
everything to be like women to be all
the<00:03:29.690> time<00:03:41.260> it's<00:03:42.260> not<00:03:42.590> hard<00:03:42.830> hit<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.220> match<00:03:43.400> but

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
the time it's not hard hit the match but

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.330 
the time it's not hard hit the match but
it<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.240> difficult<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.720> light<00:03:44.930> them<00:03:45.050> sometimes

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.580 

because<00:03:49.340> whenever<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.940> light<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> match<00:03:50.590> you

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
because whenever you light a match you

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.080 
because whenever you light a match you
can't<00:03:51.830> just<00:03:52.070> hit<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.310> darn<00:03:52.459> thing<00:03:52.700> God<00:03:52.850> just

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
can't just hit the darn thing God just

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.090 
can't just hit the darn thing God just
kind<00:03:53.270> of<00:03:53.330> barely<00:03:53.510> screaming<00:03:54.110> anyway<00:03:54.890> that's

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
kind of barely screaming anyway that's

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.910 
kind of barely screaming anyway that's
the<00:03:55.220> idea<00:03:57.760> it's<00:03:58.760> very<00:03:58.820> very<00:03:59.150> accurate<00:03:59.570> very

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
the idea it's very very accurate very

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.400 
the idea it's very very accurate very
convenient<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:00.980> carry<00:04:01.130> with<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:03.200> think

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
convenient to carry with you and I think

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.960 
convenient to carry with you and I think
it'll<00:04:03.560> fit<00:04:03.739> your<00:04:03.860> bill<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.459> perfect<00:04:04.820> there

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
it'll fit your bill just perfect there

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.449 
it'll fit your bill just perfect there
Chris<00:04:05.239> good<00:04:06.140> luck<00:04:06.320> with<00:04:06.440> your<00:04:06.590> adventure<00:04:06.890> and

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
Chris good luck with your adventure and

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.600
