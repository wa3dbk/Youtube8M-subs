00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.320
 txtr.com 2009 let the edk muffins 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.550
 double chocolate with creamy 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.620
 chocolate filling did bitter and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.719
 Milk chocolate is just that 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.680
 which is very interesting because that is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.350
 a deep-freeze and there is a freezer 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 at edeka because here too 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.510
 list of ingredients is quite long 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 already say and the nutrition to 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.680
 example 36 22 fed right here the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.860
 preparation that will help 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 room temperature about 10 to thaw 60 minutes 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:57.920
 do not leave and do not read after eating 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:57.920
 okay they are now 112 pieces to box 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.940
 then I will always take out 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:13.399
 frozen I'm curious how 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.299
 so it does not taste good because it does not bake 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.159
 only build up 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.810
 but there was none as exact and cream 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.159
 I'll let that stand here now 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.619
 believe a bit longer than I think 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:33.380
 so now have the muffins 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:36.560
 got around 230 hours or so 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.810
 Of course, I cost you a fire 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.750
 cut 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.939
 finally no longer cold in the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.420
 Principle is really just frozen 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.959
 muffins you can also freeze bread 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.119
 a everything is simply not true as 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.200
 he may, and in here so you can see 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.250
 already some creamy leadership 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.860

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.579

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:20.010
 soft, I like it all 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.010
