00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
listen to that you think wow that must

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.630 
listen to that you think wow that must
be<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.570> too<00:01:15.630> close<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> star<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.040> further

be way too close to the star to further

be way too close to the star to further
to<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.939> life<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:18.960> pretty<00:01:19.200> darn

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to be life because that's pretty darn

to be life because that's pretty darn
that's<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.159> short<00:01:20.400> orbit<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.330> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that's that's a short orbit so this is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
that's that's a short orbit so this is
shorter<00:01:22.170> than<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> orbit<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> mercury<00:01:22.979> around

our own Sun must be terribly hot

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
our own Sun must be terribly hot
actually<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> case<00:01:27.270> because

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
actually that's not the case because

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.010 
actually that's not the case because
Gliese<00:01:28.829> 581<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> said<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.329> red<00:01:30.600> dwarf<00:01:30.780> star

radiation<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.640> fact<00:01:35.909> those<00:01:36.329> planets<00:01:36.810> need

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
radiation so in fact those planets need

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
radiation so in fact those planets need

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to snuggle up a lot closer to that star

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.929 
to snuggle up a lot closer to that star
in<00:01:39.630> order<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> warmth<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.640> fact

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
in order to get the warmth so in fact

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.929 
in order to get the warmth so in fact

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.499 
you need yet another measurement
however<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.659> everything's<00:01:55.229> fit<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.210> remains

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
however if everything's fit or remains

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.530 
however if everything's fit or remains
I<00:01:57.540> suspect<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.610> affected<00:02:00.060> temperature

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I suspect that the affected temperature

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.440 
I suspect that the affected temperature
of<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:01.939> determined<00:02:02.939> because<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
of this determined because of the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.350 
of this determined because of the
dynamics<00:02:04.049> right<00:02:04.439> because<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> orbit<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
dynamics right because of the orbit and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.380 
dynamics right because of the orbit and
how<00:02:07.110> our<00:02:07.469> heart<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> central<00:02:08.429> star<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
how our heart is the central star the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.660 
how our heart is the central star the
temperature<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> fact<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
temperature for this or the fact the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.790 
temperature for this or the fact the
temperature<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> surface<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.410> up

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
temperature of this on the surface is up

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.180 
temperature of this on the surface is up
if<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.130> were<00:02:14.250> Rocky<00:02:14.810> allow<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.230> water<00:02:16.800> to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
if it were Rocky allow for water to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.210 
if it were Rocky allow for water to
remain<00:02:17.940> such<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.710> have<00:02:19.920> hope<00:02:20.190> that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
remain such and so we we have hope that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.780 
remain such and so we we have hope that
there<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> possibility<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.080> finding<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:23.760> a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
there is a possibility of finding like a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.540 
there is a possibility of finding like a
water<00:02:24.270> world
