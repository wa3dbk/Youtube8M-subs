00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.830
 aggressive to dynamic tacv my name diego I am half camper is an average 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.830
 of 1 I'm a mid-camper ordering that not only my 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.640
 to define my my style of play that is maybe three words up by 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.009
 position that the group within the field was not an offensive position 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.690
 plays that also require the intelligence that for many times 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.130
 I'm looking for a specialist because 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.030
 in his football requires nothing very big risk competitions and 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.250
 When we want to achieve great goals and actions we have to be 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.170
 a possible rush time perhaps the most important feature and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470
 required in the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.490
 of email contest here is sometimes not as driving with the ball or sometimes 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.620
 a release people my characteristics but it matters 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.370
 I think the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.590
 - but we have to have 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.100
 the soccer player and knows how to control our emotions in why it is a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.450
 sport is not a profession I have lived also says that it creates 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.450
 however expectation ie we suffer a lot 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.369
 pressure collection liability but all this is part 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.670
 in our daily life and the most important 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.630
 and know how to deal with it is what I try to do what else motivates me 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.480
 above all else is the 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.650
 to do what I love I want to play soccer that is to have health conditions 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.640
 for this 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 This is already a huge motivation. 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 the good is the victory in your difficult life together with the companions and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.710
 all this is a recognition of the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.210
 of work that is fidel motivations 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.360
 I'm 22 years old so I have a lot of energy I would like to want to 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.530
 run after doing many things still in the good north 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.670
 but he expects both the first place to be something 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.469
 a good memory that is marked as the common 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.749
 a good player 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.099
 which had many achievements 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.899
 ef 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.189
 and that played very well
