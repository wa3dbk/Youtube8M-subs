00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
little bit like I was mentioning that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.289 
little bit like I was mentioning that
disable<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.680> volume<00:01:17.040> button<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.000> won't

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
disable the volume button so this won't

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.960 
disable the volume button so this won't
now<00:01:18.689> press<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> volume<00:01:19.710> buttons<00:01:20.189> while<00:01:20.790> I'm

now press the volume buttons while I'm
using<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.420> gamepad<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
using the gamepad and you do have that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
using the gamepad and you do have that
the<00:01:23.820> drivers<00:01:24.240> installed<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.900> we'll<00:01:24.990> change

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the drivers installed so we'll change

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.950 
the drivers installed so we'll change
from<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> gamepad<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> keyboard<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.350 

so<00:01:54.530> most<00:01:54.740> importantly<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.640> PlayStation

so most importantly is the PlayStation
