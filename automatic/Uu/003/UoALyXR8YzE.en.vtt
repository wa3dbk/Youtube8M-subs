00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
quite a small and easy target to hit

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.409 
quite a small and easy target to hit
with<00:04:37.030> such<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> big<00:04:37.510> finger<00:04:38.050> whereas<00:04:38.740> with

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
with such a big finger whereas with

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.850 
with such a big finger whereas with
these<00:04:40.419> targets<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.110> little<00:04:41.260> bit<00:04:41.350> smaller<00:04:41.650> and

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
these targets a little bit smaller and

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.080 
these targets a little bit smaller and
my<00:04:41.949> tactical<00:04:42.550> control<00:04:42.729> is<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> little<00:04:43.389> off<00:04:45.090> it's

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
my tactical control is a little off it's

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.610 
my tactical control is a little off it's
pretty<00:04:46.300> much<00:04:46.389> all<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.660> have<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.960> say<00:04:47.139> on<00:04:47.289> this<00:04:47.440> I

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
pretty much all I have to say on this I

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.110 
pretty much all I have to say on this I
mean<00:04:47.770> there's<00:04:47.949> not<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.130> whole<00:04:48.340> lot<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:48.970> it's

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
mean there's not a whole lot to it it's

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.600 
mean there's not a whole lot to it it's
just

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.590 

it's<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.910> cheap<00:04:55.150> run-of-the-mill

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
it's just a cheap run-of-the-mill

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:07.300 
it's just a cheap run-of-the-mill
acoustic<00:04:56.289> guitar

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.950 

so<00:05:08.310> yeah<00:05:08.430> that's<00:05:08.700> pretty<00:05:09.180> much<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.450> for<00:05:09.630> this

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
so yeah that's pretty much it for this

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.200
