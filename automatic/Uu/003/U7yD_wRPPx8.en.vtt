00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 let's begin to value them in a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 plate on a plate in a pan of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:15.590
 yellow April but notice that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.590
 We started with half a spoon 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.119
 talking about half a teaspoon 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.539
 chupi chupi is the neologism of 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.270
 the vegetable miracle 3 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.010
 it's good then that it's hot on 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.170
 utensil that is hot from the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.489
 fat to generate this sound 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.489
 glorious that is going 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.950
 there is 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.950
 if we win with that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340
 because for him 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.809
 I will explain very simply the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.980
 protein from the meat that are in the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.260
 surface 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.720
 at this moment he will stagnate meditating 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.760
 there are chemical reactions although not what 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.920
 look like even if you 're cooking all the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.979
 life there are chemical reactions that make 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.520
 that flow the aromas the flavors the 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.080
 intensities beyond color 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.080
 as my dear land 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.010
 big and hold it huÃ¡scar the media 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.020
 Knowledge is washed by worshiping 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.730
 droplet diet these are 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.830
 pork ribs so it says 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.320
 do with other types of pork cuts 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.720
 because I do not want him to say make known 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.330
 kind of things but chicken because not in 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.210
 a way to cook very simply to 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.520
 plate by contact I do not know and why 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 no and ahead then while it's going 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.200
 worshiping there the shark approaches me 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.820
 very good chemistry this but really 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.250
 an idea but percent this the theme 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.080
 of gold and gold because first the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.200
 Presentation is very important 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.060
 receive a piece of pork cooking 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.600
 doradita and now you want to open you the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.600
 way to throw it out 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.290
 if you come with a with a pale type 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.120
 boiled 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.120
 I do not want apart 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.040
 is the theme of flavor development 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.180
 I myself throw the hat for it 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.020
 recent they gave me the hat is another 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.020
 track we finish 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.849
 do not 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.480
 but with his man seen but with shadow 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.970
 no payment at sight 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.370
 I'm going to impose a little bit of salt 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.769
 Note that obviously we turned 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.930
 that are still recontra tribulation 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.290
 than cooking it properly but the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.750
 Initial gold and already has very well 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.299
 here we have the spice these tidbits to 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.200
 see the house look what is inside 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.780
 this little bowl there is 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.569
 look at all the colors they are is a 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.120
 White pepper mixture to accidenta 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.150
 black pepper with green pepper 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.530
 pink pepper and in each one has a 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.660
 different effect 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.670
 each one has a different intensity 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.900
 but I'm going to collect 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.900
 good pepper colors 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.400
 each one has an itch and an aroma and my 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.940
 collection 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.100
 Why announce any connection 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.320
 preferably by the connection equipment 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.060
 but of course in silver cans you will be 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.060
 of silverware to store cookies 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.569
 silver an air that has the dishes 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.240
 dishes 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.750
 act and wooden spoon 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.750
 this guy 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.450
 of all sizes listen in a way 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.540
 exquisite great for 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.459
 and 9a 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.890
 I do not currently have time to 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:09.709
 collecting more at a time was had 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.379
 the fanaticism of an era the marquillas 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.840
 of cigarettes obviously being small 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.630
 not smoking was a child who 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.639
 I collected marquilla from like others 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.820
 they collect stamps it was called 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.949
 postage stamps and laugh clique 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.830
 in the little green square as he gave a 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.750
 marquita the cigarette that I in the 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.550
 nose to him land where the 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.190
 cigarettes to the whole house 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.400
 well that box is disarmed opens 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.710
 with the brand that was the marquilla me 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.360
 can I had a shoe box and 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.130
 there he is putting all the marks of 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.130
 cigarette but 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.520
 101 a command are telling me to 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:01.979
 here to an Italian ms 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:04.930
 he knows what incredible incredible but no longer 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.539
 a little garlic to the rich situation 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.229
 there that falls as well as droplets as 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:15.060
 as hail that the wave falls on the 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.060
 sheet on the tin on 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.980
 with the print put now and it's very 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.750
 important fundamental taste what 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.820
 will give the differentiation of this 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.250
 chop that is an excellent ground chili 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.040
 Argentine chefs use the line 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.230
 of dressings two anchors two anchors gives 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.660
 life to the flavor of your food very many 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.780
 thanks 2 to almost always allows for 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.660
 here I have bring a jar do not go by 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.710
 please if any beer box for 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.710
 raise it flavor 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.310
 h 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.310
 the fact that Cristina can do 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.000
 the ground mixture 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.520
 and the pepper 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.540
 the beer peppers with that 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.850
 bitter nuance that is to level as 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.940
 always in every way we have to 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.800
 reach equilibrium balance as 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.510
 the beer is yellow we put a 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.680
 little honey to level a butt 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:25.060
 but not much and a little action for 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.060
 generate that level 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.919
 in powder you can use the 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.949
 fresh ginger that peels it strips or if 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:40.849
 It also does not come like that in dust if it puts you 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:43.550
 a little bit of ginger powder 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.590
 and it's very very volatile 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.380
 be careful, this is going to be done 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.840
 about 10 minutes to cook 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.180
 soft fire so that the little ribs will 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.970
 cook or finish cooking in the 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.580
 interior in the center as appropriate 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.319
 but taking the pleasure of the 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.150
 beer and honey and pepper 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.759
 and of sensible and garlic and ground chili 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.740
 and everything that you put in is rich 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.389
 rich then in a while we are going to do the 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.159
 papas bravas that are delicious 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.380
 Accompaniment for all types of meat 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:15.039
 but at this moment I propose to get 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.039
 a magic book 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.840
 in the face of these mother's ailments 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.560
 of conscience 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:39.090
 it's a sign far back the senator 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.090
 the ertzaintza 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:50.980
 We have them here because I need it 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.980
 now we are going to go to a new section 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:59.170
 is going to start next Monday on Monday 

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.580
 starts this new section but we want 

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:04.940
 combine it with an advance with a forward 

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.300
 and it's called Argentine markets and 

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.300
 pegadito
