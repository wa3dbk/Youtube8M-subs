was also a reissue on DVD featuring sort

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970 
was also a reissue on DVD featuring sort
of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> same<00:00:17.580> cover<00:00:18.449> design<00:00:18.930> also<00:00:19.350> released

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
of the same cover design also released

of the same cover design also released
by<00:00:20.220> criterium<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.300> they<00:00:21.600> basically

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
by criterium so I think they basically

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.529 
by criterium so I think they basically
just<00:00:22.050> ported<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.250> laserdisc<00:00:23.820> Edition<00:00:24.269> over

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
just ported the laserdisc Edition over

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
just ported the laserdisc Edition over
to<00:00:24.689> DVD<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.920> don't<00:00:26.310> think<00:00:26.550> there's<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:26.939> real

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to DVD so I don't think there's any real

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.910 
to DVD so I don't think there's any real
reason<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.630> get<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.439> already<00:00:28.590> own

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
reason to get this if you already own

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.919 
reason to get this if you already own
the<00:00:28.949> DVD<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.640> do<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.210> quite<00:00:30.750> an

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the DVD but I do think it's quite an

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.100 
the DVD but I do think it's quite an
amazing<00:00:31.289> cover<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:33.020> well<00:00:34.020> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that is actually printed on so I don't

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
that is actually printed on so I don't
know<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> entire<00:01:14.970> cover<00:01:15.270> has<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.630> sort<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
know the entire cover has this sort of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
imperfections and stuff so you know

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.940 
imperfections and stuff so you know
that's<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> guess<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:22.770> call

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that's you know I guess you could call

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
that's you know I guess you could call
that<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> plus<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.060> gets<00:01:24.360> damaged

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that a plus you know if it gets damaged

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
that a plus you know if it gets damaged
like<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.259> sticker<00:01:25.500> motion<00:01:25.860> stuff<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
like with sticker motion stuff it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.310 
like with sticker motion stuff it
doesn't<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.270> show<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.630> mean<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.110> could

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
doesn't really show I mean you could

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.010 
doesn't really show I mean you could
easily<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.920> assume<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.900> know

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
easily just assume that this you know

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
easily just assume that this you know
little<00:01:31.200> sticker<00:01:31.680> residue<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.820> part

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
little sticker residue here is just part

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.710 
little sticker residue here is just part
of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> design<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.090> cool<00:01:36.090> cover<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
of the design so you know cool cover and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.700 
of the design so you know cool cover and
it<00:01:37.079> doesn't<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.610> too

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
it doesn't really you know get too

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.560 
it doesn't really you know get too
effective<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:41.939> small<00:01:42.090> marks

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
effective if you have some small marks

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
effective if you have some small marks
on<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.229> cool<00:01:43.439> anyway<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.430> got

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
just a very nice design and you know I

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.580 
just a very nice design and you know I
really<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> simple<00:01:53.399> stylistic<00:01:54.590> choices

really like the simple stylistic choices

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.429 
really like the simple stylistic choices
they<00:01:55.920> went<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:57.630> very<00:01:58.259> cool

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
they went with here so very very cool

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.560 
they went with here so very very cool
and<00:01:58.799> here<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.430> also<00:01:59.549> check<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.119> spine

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and here we can also check this spine

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.530 
and here we can also check this spine
know<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.710> actually<00:02:01.860> make<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.540> but

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
know if you can actually make it out but

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.120 
know if you can actually make it out but
this<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.719> criterion<00:02:04.380> collection<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.950> it's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
this is criterion collection and it's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.559 
this is criterion collection and it's
laserdisc<00:02:06.290> 198<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> criterion<00:02:09.000> used<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
laserdisc 198 so a criterion used you

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.470 
laserdisc 198 so a criterion used you
know<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.869> whole<00:02:09.989> spine<00:02:10.619> number<00:02:11.039> thing<00:02:11.520> even

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
know the whole spine number thing even

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.410 
know the whole spine number thing even

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
we fold it out it's a simple gate fold

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.949 
we fold it out it's a simple gate fold
and<00:02:20.380> here<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:20.739> have<00:02:20.980> in<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> interior

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
story and then we can move on to the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.380 
story and then we can move on to the
other<00:02:26.470> side<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.340> got<00:02:27.489> some<00:02:27.640> credits<00:02:28.060> and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
other side and we got some credits and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.920 
other side and we got some credits and
about<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.690> cast<00:02:29.160> chaps<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.340> listings<00:02:30.790> yeah

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
about the cast chaps and listings yeah

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.530 
about the cast chaps and listings yeah
guess<00:02:32.140> that's<00:02:32.380> basically<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:34.060> before<00:02:34.300> we

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
guess that's basically it but before we

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.330 
guess that's basically it but before we
go<00:02:34.720> just<00:02:34.900> then<00:02:35.230> take<00:02:35.410> one<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.860> discs<00:02:36.220> out

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
go just then take one of the discs out

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.760 
go just then take one of the discs out
this<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.819> two<00:02:37.000> disc<00:02:37.239> set<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.050> got<00:02:38.260> one<00:02:38.530> disc

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
this is two disc set so you got one disc

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.229 
this is two disc set so you got one disc
on<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.100> side<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.489> one<00:02:39.670> disc<00:02:39.819> on<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.030> other

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
on this side and one disc on the other

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.850 
on this side and one disc on the other
side<00:02:40.560> I'll<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:41.800> take<00:02:42.100> one<00:02:42.400> out<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.180> show<00:02:43.540> you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
side I'll just take one out to show you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.920 
side I'll just take one out to show you
so<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.310> quite<00:02:45.610> worn<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:46.450> quite<00:02:46.690> old
