00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.800 
these they're basically a headband and
they<00:02:03.190> have<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> chain<00:02:03.880> attached<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.479> them<00:02:04.630> and

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
they have a chain attached to them and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.600 
they have a chain attached to them and
they<00:02:04.869> come<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.409> million<00:02:05.800> different<00:02:06.159> styles

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
they come in a million different styles

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.790 
they come in a million different styles
so<00:02:07.150> I'm<00:02:07.300> going<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.570> go<00:02:07.750> ahead<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.289> push<00:02:08.560> that

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
so I'm going to go ahead and push that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.520 
so I'm going to go ahead and push that
down<00:02:09.070> right<00:02:09.759> behind<00:02:10.179> my<00:02:10.479> two<00:02:10.539> little<00:02:10.869> twisties

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
down right behind my two little twisties

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.740 
down right behind my two little twisties
and<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:12.190> basically<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.730> gives<00:02:13.120> me<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> flat

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
and that basically just gives me a flat

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.690 
and that basically just gives me a flat
surface<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.290> where<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.830> hair<00:02:15.130> jewelry<00:02:15.370> can

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
surface for where my hair jewelry can

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.520 
surface for where my hair jewelry can
lay<00:02:15.910> because<00:02:16.510> when<00:02:16.690> your<00:02:16.840> hair<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.050> all<00:02:17.380> the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
lay because when your hair is all the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.590 
lay because when your hair is all the
way<00:02:17.650> out<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:18.100> almost<00:02:18.310> impossible<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.420> do

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
way out it's almost impossible to do

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.960 
way out it's almost impossible to do
this<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.470> now<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.340> pushed<00:02:21.700> in

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
this so now that I have that pushed in

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.550 
this so now that I have that pushed in
I'm<00:02:22.330> basically<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:22.989> going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> pin<00:02:23.530> down

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
I'm basically just going to pin down

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.380 
I'm basically just going to pin down
these<00:02:24.010> sides<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.730> they're<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> little<00:02:25.239> bit

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
these sides because they're a little bit

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.030 
these sides because they're a little bit
loose<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.200> want<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.530> make<00:02:26.650> sure<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.890> my

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
loose and I want to make sure that my

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.120 
loose and I want to make sure that my
hair<00:02:27.070> jewelry<00:02:27.519> stays<00:02:28.030> put<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.600> day<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.440> after

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
