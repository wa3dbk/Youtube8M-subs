will cam newton outplay Colin Kaepernick
I<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.949> happen<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
I think it can happen I think that the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
I think it can happen I think that the
damn<00:00:27.689> Panthers<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.439> win<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
damn Panthers can win but I like the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.999 
damn Panthers can win but I like the
49ers<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.539> boils<00:00:30.689> down<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.080> experience

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
49ers and it boils down to experience

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.830 
49ers and it boils down to experience
and<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.460> fact<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.210> their<00:00:33.360> offense

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and the fact that I think their offense

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.130 
and the fact that I think their offense
is<00:00:33.989> capable<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.770> doing<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.969> bit<00:00:36.540> more

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
is capable of doing a little bit more

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110 
is capable of doing a little bit more
look<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.280> these<00:00:38.489> teams<00:00:38.879> are

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
look at it this way these teams are

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840 
look at it this way these teams are
extremely<00:00:39.930> similar<00:00:40.309> athletic<00:00:41.309> quarterbacks

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
extremely similar athletic quarterbacks

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000 
extremely similar athletic quarterbacks
who<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.210> throw<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> use<00:00:42.989> their<00:00:43.230> legs<00:00:43.559> they

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
who can throw and use their legs they

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
who can throw and use their legs they
can<00:00:44.250> run<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.030> football<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.200> also<00:00:46.379> stop

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
can run the football they can also stop

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
can run the football they can also stop
you<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.640> defense<00:00:47.910> i<00:00:48.360> mean<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> panthers<00:00:49.079> i

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you on defense i mean the panthers i

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.139 
you on defense i mean the panthers i
think<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.590> stopped<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:49.980> 49ers<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:50.940> held

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
think they stopped the 49ers they held

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
think they stopped the 49ers they held
them<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> nine<00:00:51.600> points<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.410> i<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> 49ers

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
them to nine points but i like the 49ers

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.569 
them to nine points but i like the 49ers
