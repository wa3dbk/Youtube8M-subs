as<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.209> speaker<00:03:00.450> grill<00:03:00.750> you'll<00:03:01.349> see<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.620> does

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
as the speaker grill you'll see it does

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.580

have a slight mirrored reflection to it

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.229 
have a slight mirrored reflection to it
so<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.769> guess<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.159> could<00:03:05.190> kind<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.120> see

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
so I guess you could kind of see

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.150 
so I guess you could kind of see
yourself<00:03:06.599> when<00:03:06.720> taking<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.019> picture<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.980> with

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
very low resolution video 480 x 320 so

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
very low resolution video 480 x 320 so
don't<00:03:15.420> expect<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.840> best<00:03:15.930> video<00:03:16.260> recording

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680
