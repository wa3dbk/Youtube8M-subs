pushes the defenders of so so easily as

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.830 
pushes the defenders of so so easily as
if<00:02:55.489> they<00:02:55.640> are<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:55.760> bloody<00:02:56.269> toys<00:02:56.630> or

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
if they are like bloody toys or

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.350 
if they are like bloody toys or
something<00:02:57.200> man<00:02:57.380> it's<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:58.220> easy<00:02:58.400> for<00:02:58.580> him<00:02:58.850> his

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
something man it's so easy for him his

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.539 
something man it's so easy for him his
set<00:02:59.900> pieces<00:03:00.110> they<00:03:00.410> are<00:03:00.470> pretty<00:03:00.650> good<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.160> had

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
set pieces they are pretty good I had

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.250 
set pieces they are pretty good I had
quite<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> few<00:03:02.180> figures<00:03:02.420> within<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.930> problem

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
quite a few figures within the problem

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.840 
quite a few figures within the problem
is<00:03:03.380> that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
is that

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.150 
is that
don't<00:03:04.030> dip<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.780> well<00:03:04.960> they<00:03:05.620> are<00:03:05.680> always<00:03:05.830> pretty

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
don't dip so well they are always pretty

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.800 
don't dip so well they are always pretty
low<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.610> can't<00:03:06.850> expect<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.420> have<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.600> power

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
low so you can't expect to have a power

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.510 
low so you can't expect to have a power
free<00:03:08.050> kick<00:03:08.200> with<00:03:08.350> him<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:09.040> overall<00:03:09.250> it's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
free kick with him but overall it's

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.160 
free kick with him but overall it's
pretty<00:03:09.580> good<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> big<00:03:10.570> positives

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
pretty good so the big positives

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.070 
pretty good so the big positives
strength<00:03:11.950> dribbling<00:03:12.580> shooting<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.510> skills<00:03:13.840> I

strength dribbling shooting and skills I

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.990 
strength dribbling shooting and skills I
can't<00:03:14.860> really<00:03:15.100> find<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.370> negative<00:03:15.730> with<00:03:15.850> this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
can't really find a negative with this
