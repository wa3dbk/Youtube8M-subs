it's going to happen

it's going to happen
and<00:02:40.989> if<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.290> suppose<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.769> idea<00:02:42.129> is<00:02:42.280> if<00:02:42.400> you

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
and if I suppose the idea is if you

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.979 
and if I suppose the idea is if you
don't<00:02:42.519> recognize<00:02:43.000> really<00:02:43.510> as<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:43.690> don't<00:02:43.870> let

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
don't recognize really as you don't let

don't recognize really as you don't let
it<00:02:44.170> install

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.780 

this<00:02:50.740> might<00:02:50.950> take<00:02:51.160> some<00:02:51.220> time

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.569 

so<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.299> might<00:02:54.569> come<00:02:54.810> back<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.379> later<00:02:55.590> I'm

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
so I might come back to you later I'm

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.190 
so I might come back to you later I'm
also<00:02:56.819> expecting<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:57.989> going<00:02:58.109> to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
also expecting that it's going to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.550 
also expecting that it's going to
restart<00:02:58.409> as<00:02:59.219> well<00:02:59.459> it's<00:03:00.359> taken<00:03:00.810> about<00:03:01.079> 20

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
restart as well it's taken about 20

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.209 
restart as well it's taken about 20
minutes<00:03:01.980> or<00:03:02.219> so<00:03:02.420> one<00:03:03.420> thing<00:03:03.659> that<00:03:03.719> I<00:03:03.870> am<00:03:04.219> quite

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
minutes or so one thing that I am quite

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.020 
minutes or so one thing that I am quite
grateful<00:03:05.549> for<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:07.019> um<00:03:07.670> it's<00:03:08.670> now

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
grateful for is that that um it's now

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.599 
grateful for is that that um it's now
got<00:03:09.329> rid<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:10.019> PowerPC<00:03:10.859> code<00:03:11.129> for<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.489> old

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
got rid of the PowerPC code for the old

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.670 
got rid of the PowerPC code for the old
g3<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.209> form<00:03:12.780> five<00:03:13.140> computers<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.870> so

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
g3 and form five computers and and so

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.099 
g3 and form five computers and and so
hopefully<00:03:16.890> it'll<00:03:17.459> run<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.970> bit<00:03:18.180> faster<00:03:18.750> than<00:03:19.019> it

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
hopefully it'll run a bit faster than it

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.460 
hopefully it'll run a bit faster than it
does<00:03:19.260> at<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.470> moment<00:03:19.859> all<00:03:20.459> right<00:03:21.139> I'll<00:03:22.139> go

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
does at the moment all right I'll go

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.349 
does at the moment all right I'll go
through<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.920> specs<00:03:23.189> it<00:03:23.370> needs<00:03:23.579> now<00:03:24.060> that

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
through the specs it needs now that

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.670 
through the specs it needs now that
might<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.719> a<00:03:24.750> useful<00:03:24.840> thing<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.379> do<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
might be a useful thing to do so a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.379 
might be a useful thing to do so a

which most computers have got these days
ok<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.310> that's<00:04:02.490> your<00:04:02.670> minimum<00:04:03.030> requirements

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
ok so that's your minimum requirements

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.380 
ok so that's your minimum requirements
your<00:04:04.200> recommendations<00:04:05.130> are<00:04:05.460> two<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.940> four<00:04:06.180> gig

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
your recommendations are two to four gig

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.110 
your recommendations are two to four gig
of<00:04:06.510> ram<00:04:06.540> where<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:06.960> has<00:04:07.170> two<00:04:07.410> gig<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.770> ram<00:04:08.120> so

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
of ram where this has two gig of ram so

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.610 
of ram where this has two gig of ram so
it<00:04:09.270> might<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.750> little<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.110> slow<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.470> might

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
it might be a little bit slow it might

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.780 
it might be a little bit slow it might
be<00:04:10.740> useful<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.160> try<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.400> get<00:04:11.490> some<00:04:11.670> more

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
be useful to try and get some more

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.740 
be useful to try and get some more

good<00:04:38.820> okay<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:39.690> on<00:04:40.050> with<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.410> installation

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
good okay so on with the installation

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.540 
good okay so on with the installation
close<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:44.400> are<00:04:44.640> done<00:04:44.880> that's<00:04:45.600> now

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
close that and you are done that's now

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.130 
close that and you are done that's now
hopefully<00:04:47.550> version<00:04:47.970> 9<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.870> didn't

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
hopefully version 9 and it didn't

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.390 
hopefully version 9 and it didn't
require<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.470> restart<00:04:50.180> so<00:04:51.180> that's<00:04:51.330> pretty<00:04:51.540> good

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
require a restart so that's pretty good

just<00:04:55.020> cut<00:04:55.410> out<00:04:55.530> obviously<00:04:56.010> for<00:04:56.340> security

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
just cut out obviously for security

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.370 
just cut out obviously for security
reasons<00:04:57.270> because<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.510> put<00:04:57.690> my<00:04:57.810> address<00:04:57.900> up<00:04:58.229> and
