check out the Audi a3 e-tron at the time

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.630 
check out the Audi a3 e-tron at the time
it<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.930> kind<00:00:31.200> of<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.320> concept<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.980> testbed<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it was kind of a concept a testbed and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.240 
it was kind of a concept a testbed and
it<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:32.790> pure<00:00:33.000> electric<00:00:33.739> fast<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:34.950> over<00:00:35.070> two

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it was pure electric fast for over two

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.490 
it was pure electric fast for over two
years<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.970> we<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.630> variants<00:00:37.110> it's

this<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.239> solution<00:02:21.780> in

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
this is actually the right solution in

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.289 
this is actually the right solution in
the<00:02:22.049> next<00:02:22.320> year's<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.739> avoid<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
the next year's to avoid that the

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.660 
the next year's to avoid that the
consumer<00:02:24.810> gets<00:02:25.079> any<00:02:25.290> compromise<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.310> terms<00:02:26.520> of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
consumer gets any compromise in terms of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.790 
consumer gets any compromise in terms of
performance<00:02:26.849> in<00:02:27.660> terms<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:28.050> range<00:02:28.319> or<00:02:28.620> in

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
performance in terms of range or in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.470 
performance in terms of range or in
terms<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.130> package<00:02:29.489> was<00:02:29.880> there<00:02:30.030> anything<00:02:30.239> in

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
terms of package was there anything in

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.390 
terms of package was there anything in
your<00:02:30.540> development<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.440> technology<00:02:32.069> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
your development of the technology that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.970 
your development of the technology that
is<00:02:32.580> different<00:02:33.209> than<00:02:33.569> just<00:02:34.020> your<00:02:34.290> basic<00:02:34.560> kind

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
is different than just your basic kind

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.309 
is different than just your basic kind
of<00:02:35.040> plug-in<00:02:35.220> hybrid<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.849> car<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.330> electric

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
range of 50 kilometres okay and you can

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.449 
range of 50 kilometres okay and you can
charge<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> battery<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.950> something<00:02:41.370> more

car with the you know
and<00:04:18.410> we<00:04:18.650> know<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.950> especially<00:04:19.100> for<00:04:19.519> the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
and we know that especially for the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.210 
and we know that especially for the
young<00:04:19.820> generation<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.440> must

young generation this is a must
our<00:04:22.400> idea<00:04:23.390> is<00:04:23.450> obviously<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:24.500> can<00:04:24.710> scale

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
our idea is obviously that we can scale

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.560 
our idea is obviously that we can scale
the<00:04:25.190> technology<00:04:25.640> of<00:04:25.700> many<00:04:25.910> many<00:04:26.090> months<00:04:26.270> so

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
the technology of many many months so

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.590 
the technology of many many months so
you're<00:04:26.750> not<00:04:26.930> forced<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:28.520> don't<00:04:28.670> know<00:04:28.850> buy<00:04:29.270> a

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
you're not forced to I don't know buy a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.910 
you're not forced to I don't know buy a
specific<00:04:30.050> car

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
specific car

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.340 
specific car
yeah<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.340> benefit<00:04:31.790> of<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.060> technology<00:04:32.420> able

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
yeah the benefit of this technology able

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.560 
yeah the benefit of this technology able
to<00:04:33.530> enlarge<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.250> offer<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.760> that<00:04:34.790> if<00:04:35.450> you

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
to enlarge the offer so that if you

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.150 
to enlarge the offer so that if you
wanna<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.840> don't<00:04:35.900> know<00:04:36.140> a<00:04:36.350> hatchback<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.980> get

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
advantage it's like mr. Potato Head with

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.850 
advantage it's like mr. Potato Head with
the<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.210> plug-in<00:04:44.630> hybrid<00:04:44.810> mr.<00:04:45.350> potato<00:04:45.650> yeah

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
the the plug-in hybrid mr. potato yeah

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:55.900 
the the plug-in hybrid mr. potato yeah
what<00:04:46.490> about<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.730> plug-in<00:04:47.180> hybrid<00:04:47.210> r8<00:04:54.820> yeah<00:04:55.820> I

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
one but it's good to see the e-tron

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.510 
one but it's good to see the e-tron
program<00:05:08.480> finally<00:05:09.020> taking<00:05:09.440> off<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.890> we're

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
program finally taking off and we're
