what<00:00:01.300> makes<00:00:01.510> voice-o-matic<00:00:01.930> unique<00:00:02.620> is<00:00:02.889> its

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.070 
what makes voice-o-matic unique is its

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.830 
what makes voice-o-matic unique is its
ability<00:00:03.220> to<00:00:03.550> work<00:00:03.760> with<00:00:04.000> just<00:00:04.300> about<00:00:04.450> any

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:04.840 
ability to work with just about any

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.710 
ability to work with just about any
character<00:00:05.410> rig<00:00:05.760> so<00:00:06.760> we<00:00:06.910> have<00:00:07.120> a<00:00:07.150> head<00:00:07.420> model

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
character rig so we have a head model

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.110 
character rig so we have a head model
here<00:00:08.109> set<00:00:08.410> up<00:00:08.440> with<00:00:08.770> more<00:00:09.040> fur<00:00:09.250> and<00:00:09.460> morph

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
here set up with more fur and morph

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.540 
here set up with more fur and morph
targets<00:00:10.660> for<00:00:10.870> the<00:00:10.930> various<00:00:11.440> mouth<00:00:11.800> positions

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
targets for the various mouth positions

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.540 
targets for the various mouth positions
and<00:00:12.790> we<00:00:13.510> already<00:00:13.690> have<00:00:14.140> an<00:00:14.410> audio<00:00:14.830> file<00:00:15.099> loaded

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.550 
and we already have an audio file loaded

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.940 
and we already have an audio file loaded
into<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.880> scene<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:17.350> let's<00:00:17.530> open<00:00:17.680> up

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
into the scene so let's open up

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.880 
into the scene so let's open up
voice-o-matic

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.130 

we<00:00:21.490> have<00:00:21.699> already<00:00:21.910> mapped<00:00:22.420> all<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.960> mouth

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
we have already mapped all the mouth

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.390 
we have already mapped all the mouth
positions<00:00:23.800> so<00:00:24.400> if<00:00:24.490> we<00:00:24.580> press<00:00:24.970> create<00:00:25.359> keys<00:00:25.930> our

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
positions so if we press create keys our

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.950 
positions so if we press create keys our
animation<00:00:27.400> will<00:00:27.580> be<00:00:27.699> generated<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:28.570> ready<00:00:28.779> to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
animation will be generated and ready to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.420 
animation will be generated and ready to
be<00:00:28.989> fine-tuned

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.440 

you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.680 

so<00:00:41.110> if<00:00:41.230> we<00:00:41.410> open<00:00:41.650> up<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.100> curve<00:00:42.430> editor<00:00:42.670> we<00:00:43.510> can

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
so if we open up the curve editor we can

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.540 
so if we open up the curve editor we can
see<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.140> various<00:00:44.470> curves<00:00:44.830> created<00:00:45.430> by

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
see the various curves created by

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.300 
see the various curves created by
voice-o-matic<00:00:46.500> these<00:00:47.500> curves<00:00:47.860> are<00:00:48.070> just

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
voice-o-matic these curves are just

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.850 
voice-o-matic these curves are just
standard<00:00:48.730> morph<00:00:49.030> targets<00:00:49.630> and<00:00:50.050> we<00:00:50.290> can<00:00:50.470> adjust

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
standard morph targets and we can adjust

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.730 
standard morph targets and we can adjust
them<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.250> our<00:00:51.280> liking<00:00:52.080> one<00:00:53.080> of<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.260> very<00:00:53.470> cool

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
them to our liking one of the very cool

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.100 
them to our liking one of the very cool
features<00:00:54.250> in<00:00:54.460> voice-o-matic<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:55.480> that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
features in voice-o-matic is that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.290 
features in voice-o-matic is that
instead<00:00:56.410> of<00:00:56.530> using<00:00:56.860> voice-o-matic<00:00:57.300> default

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
instead of using voice-o-matic default
