00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 the one baking cake or bread too 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.710
 The others burn schnapps in the house 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.420
 cellar and others do the same 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.130
 confidently at home whether that 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.660
 actually worth it and the sausage really 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.340
 this is healthier and tastier too 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.719
 we learn now from wilhelm blatz 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.340
 time namely the author of this book 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.580
 or conscious and there is already beside 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.230
 me 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 I think even in the same shirt they are 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 yes actually is 100% sausage are quasi 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.070
 between sausage and camembert great 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.720
 the parents had also been in the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.460
 own operation and they have with 14 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 years ago her first pigs were dissected 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.390
 and slaughtered I would like to have fun 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.950
 You will be done again 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.920
 grown up from small as they say 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 one is in the stroller and thus in the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 Come to the slaughterhouse and come 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.670
 knew the whole and you were there already 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.550
 and at 14 years was already so far 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.309
 that you work very hard 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.809
 could and there were in the war there must 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.050
 you work anyway you do not have 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.969
 children work protected so but there 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.100
 you have to run away with them today 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.390
 At the beer garden salad we speak too 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 party a bit more about how to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.480
 Confident at home makes it work 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.710
 there is just no longer know one 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.720
 a little bit elaborate one must also like 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
 The sausage is still cooking and everything possible 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 that's why beer garden salad is first available 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 But that is what she herself knew 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 for example, a blood sausage plant body 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.210
 took 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 since we have had some battles and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.650
 we make salad in jackets 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.320
 but as I said when you sausage at home 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.450
 For example, Patrick Marleau san makes himself 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.909
 but were to read a marinade 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.520
 a little bit there first a bit 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.689
 oil into it and if you're comfortable now 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.400
 home would like to do it myself 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 Of course , a few devices have as well 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.490
 for example meat in front of meat grinder is whole 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.040
 important right ahead the most beautiful olives 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.409
 after all, some wine vinegar pepper 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.729
 one has to be a bit careful 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.149
 because they are already salting the economy 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.600
 and the like in it I want so 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.490
 Super fast here , still in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.539
 York are the cutting edge tomorrow 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.260
 a bit small and to have the sausage 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.030
 she also made herself now 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.310
 The must also be full through the meat grinder 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.310
 to be hunted or what do you need for that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.680
 fly so it is so that i have products 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 choose the ones who are up for grabs 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.790
 already want to make yourself sausage then 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.239
 they also have something very good otherwise 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.900
 can you yes supermarket will psi what 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:38.920
 you would have to buy everything 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.819
 live everyone has mostly as a 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.400
 meat grinder 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.220
 and if you are wireless now, for example 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.140
 then they have to do something called so 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.840
 have word leader there in the meat grinder 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.970
 must have where they sat before headers 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.440
 where they have the vox with 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.769
 there I could fill many 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.010
 personally, you buy yourself on the internet 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.569
 for 40 50 euro in sausage students then 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.230
 First, let's do it yourself 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:09.940
 lighter and also of the quality of the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.980
 distribute the program is that 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.750
 much better so now we have that 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.750
 here and now you can get the marinade 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.209
 to let go 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.730
 at least two already in the fridge 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.349
 best their system when they go 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.669
 stand over night so you see 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.599
 now a nice gloss afterwards 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.400
 but I can see that anyway 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.690
 a farmer will ask my two 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400
 It would taste much better 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.389
 better if it happens overnight then 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.389
 is much better 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:47.609
 Rhenish black were you 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.609
 I have not eaten yet 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.769
 so and now we have so they can 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.760
 yes now with these if they sausage 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.440
 they do not need to have been made 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.449
 always together today, I have only good 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.829

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 washing potatoes out of the pan 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.650
 and the last two minutes bacon and 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.760
 to give onions otherwise burn them 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.680
 the onion and then they have the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.330
 burned with the substance separated like that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.330

 That's why I go caramelizing 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.950
 if I make mistakes and fill those 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.230
