00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.620
 This is the classic copy of a smartwatch 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.320
 which is actually a hybrid function 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.169
 between a normal watch and a real one 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.909
 smartwatch i actually have all here 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.110
 color statements that are possible 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.029
 from the classic 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.560
 I also have one here on my wrist 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.630
 equally bound to show how 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.910
 then a bit like that so to 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.530
 your wrist is about what is and is one thing 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.440
 what stands out immediately is reasonable for him 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.090
 she is quite thick and quite big 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.039
 now of course have normal watches 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.390
 which is a bit on the big side so it 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.190
 is a little personal taste or you 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.539
 You can also find it beautiful on it 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.989
 smaller blue jean from the cookie dough 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.460
 pop if you find it too big after it is 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.530
 just a normal watch with the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.269
 normal dial and just one 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.010
 normal analog part whatever you 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.800
 simply set with a button on the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.300
 side but what is behind this is one 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.129
 small screen 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.809
 and actually find one on that screen 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.819
 the yellow smartwatch happened 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.289
 it is water resistant to 100 meters and 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.120
 in addition , he simply works with one 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.589
 normal button cell battery and I think so 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.999
 I also have to replace it every week 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.889
 no that is not the case he works with 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.690
 special blood 4 use one more 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.530
 bluetooth smart technology 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.970
 and they also worked alone with it 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.780
 devices that use bluetooth smart 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.860
 support 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.420
 for a complete list you can click on the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.150
 look at cookie dough website or possibly 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.470
 on smartwatch shop.nl 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.630
 the battery passes through that technology 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.300
 about a year so that's best 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.980
 much dependent on a smartwatch 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.650
 of course you use to me 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.360
 him here in this smartwatch that stands 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.670
 if you look closely you also see the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.680
 digital background say yes 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.170
 what time is it 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.520
 well he is also has a background too 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.570
 lighting option 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.890
 which makes the lighting bit 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.050
 you probably wouldn't turn on now 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.340
 so can see very well in addition 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.320
 he put a number of control buttons on the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.580
 side find the normal button for this 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.130
 the analog part adds a number 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.540
 function buttons an on-off button and more 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.010
 a function button with which through the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.260
 can scroll through notifications 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.880
 and how do I get this notification delivered? 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.200
 well that happens through an app the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.120
 connected to watch cap that have key 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.310
 installed and again you see here too 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.940
 all the reports are that he went through 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.860
 got 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.409
 you can here through the side 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.240
 turn the notifications on or off 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.950
 whatever you want to receive , he feels 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.900
 also passes on all whatsapp notifications 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.880
 You can also use it to him 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.319
 use past music app to go to 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.819
 to go to the next or previous tracks 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.690
 this is done via the buttons on the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.520
 side that finds 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.290
 you can then use those buttons and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.270
 because it has a screen you can 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.530
 really the basic details of one 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.060
 we have notification on the one 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.720
 appointment so all those vibrate and one 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.490
 make a beep 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.040
 and when you look then you really see 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.300
 This screen shows the which appointment 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.850
 that one is about 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.680
 you can also delete notifications so that 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.450
 you have read so you can do it too 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.130
 stop when your foot is concert 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.840
 you don't want you to suddenly go off 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.640
 so that is all possible through 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.190
 means of the device itself or you do not 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.930
 the smartphone for using it too 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.550
 nice option is that you 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.930
 get notification on that did know far 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.430
 be apart then you go 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.990
 smartphone when the watch vibrates 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.920
 and beeping so that you can never do anything 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.030
 to forget 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.920
 and you can also always for you 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.360
 looking up smartwatch 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.130
 by simply pressing the button on the phone 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.110
 Pressing below and when you 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.330
 smartwatch is about just press 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.740
 press the button and then it will just 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.170
 off automatically 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.490
 so you never biology so you don't 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.960
 can find any more just on button 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.180
 and you can also use it as 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.440
 remote control for the camera and one 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.290
 does that work a bit with one 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.940
 delay so yes not really super 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.130
 optimal but it is possible 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.630
 and possibly multiple smartwatches 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.980
 at the same time but more so 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.350
 have carrots associated with it 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.420
 there you want more information 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.070
