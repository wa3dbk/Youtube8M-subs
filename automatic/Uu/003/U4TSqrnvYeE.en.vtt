tremendously<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:28.850> see<00:01:28.999> you're<00:01:29.119> using<00:01:29.270> a

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
tremendously and I see you're using a

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.300 
tremendously and I see you're using a
nozzle<00:01:29.719> what<00:01:29.990> does<00:01:30.109> that<00:01:30.139> do<00:01:30.649> well<00:01:30.889> the<00:01:30.979> nozzle

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
nozzle what does that do well the nozzle

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.649 
nozzle what does that do well the nozzle
makes<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.609> so<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.939> air<00:01:32.090> Direction<00:01:32.569> is

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
makes it so that the air Direction is

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.239 
makes it so that the air Direction is
always<00:01:32.899> leading<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.529> hell<00:01:33.649> in<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.859> hair<00:01:34.009> shaft

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
always leading to hell in the hair shaft

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.190 
always leading to hell in the hair shaft
