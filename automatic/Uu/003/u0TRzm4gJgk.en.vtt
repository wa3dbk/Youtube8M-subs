a<00:02:48.269> skill<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.709> not<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.700> does<00:02:50.849> not

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
a skill but it is not it does not

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.819

a friend named Jesus at work and he's

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.009 
a friend named Jesus at work and he's
probably<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:41.370> best<00:03:41.790> quick<00:03:42.299> scoper<00:03:42.660> I've<00:03:42.780> ever

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
probably the best quick scoper I've ever

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.129 
probably the best quick scoper I've ever
seen<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:44.269> do<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.329> think<00:03:45.600> he's<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.810> best<00:03:45.989> player

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
seen and do I think he's the best player

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.300 
seen and do I think he's the best player
far<00:03:46.950> from<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.480> sarika<00:03:48.480> um<00:03:48.950> yeah<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:49.980> don't<00:03:50.040> think

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
far from it sarika um yeah I don't think

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.500 
far from it sarika um yeah I don't think
he's<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.579> best<00:03:50.730> player<00:03:50.940> but<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.239> think<00:03:51.420> he's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
he's the best player but I think he's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.059 
he's the best player but I think he's
