00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.370
 do not split never die only disappeared in combat after 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.889
 years of growth together 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.960
 the study of business cent plus the microsoft stick to form a study 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.810
 Independent 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.349
 but before saying goodbye not only to the study 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.259
 but also of the jaldo saga which fortunately will not disappear but 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.059
 that will be in the hands of microsoft leave us one last installment of its title 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.099
 more important 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.750
 that are possibly the most important release of 2010 for these 3 60 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 we are talking about nothing less than pulled river 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.660
 one of the most important worlds of the nss nun and fits for the strike against the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.270
 covenant 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.800
 it is here where they train to scare them before going out to fight 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.480
 we will control nole 6 which is a rookie that is part of a squadron 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.040
 formed by six soldiers 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.180
 each one with its own characteristics and in that way 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.950
 that end in the must to the height accompanied by this team always 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.580
 we will have company look 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.960
 this is why the main campaign can be played accompanied by one to three 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.980
 friends depending on the connection mode we choose 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.300
 the planet riad is attacked and we as we leave have to defend it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.850
 the pichi does not have a style markedly from the beginning we had a goal 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.630
 but rather it's like the life of a soldier 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.079
 We have several copitiba that our duty is to do as much as possible 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.760
 siasia on land in fact being guata cánovas the covenant doing civil 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.760
 little machine in the air and why not in space 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.240
 that yes as we advance in history was taking shape and becomes more 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.180
 important 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.870
 to the point that you can buy a current overproduction of a 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.490
 duration between 10 13 hours 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.700
 also that some kilos interesting that amazing scenery you raised lüthi 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.980
 to spies finally account 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.800
 it was the block itself 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.930
 first of all we have to see how to customize our character 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 starts the game 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.570
 we can choose sex and some things are not mature 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.539
 what throughout the ficci we will be able to continue editing some years a day in 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.159
 that the armor of the noble team 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.100
 which are a bench a guard system a partial protection bar 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.599
 as active flash a hologram and the sector 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.709
 the great speed race is the first we will have at our disposal 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.019
 although we also make a plot we can change according to the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:25.869
 let's find 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.609
 It is very important to come at the right time especially in this mode 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.109
 of high difficulty 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.889
 as for moment they simply had weapons 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.039
 both hours of the previous deliveries as well as new ones according to him to form 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.329
 a good amount 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.529
 c quite varied indifference and will not be an icon in this delivery to 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.700
 term will find new enemies rush 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 some really difficult 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.149
 all this will happen obviously when we are in combat in scenarios 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:56.019
 open ceo of enemies that friends at times and with an intelligence 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.239
 artificial rather than acceptable and this is how we get next to the section 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.239
 technical 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:09.269
 we find a completely renewed engine from the hand of bush 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.099
 jecomusa we name will be at certain times with the twins with a lot and 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.129
 tenderloin and it is that it is incredible the date that form rías 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.620
 for example while we are fighting 15 spartan against 20 covenant for giving a 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.909
 example the engine in addition to this supported several explosions in addition to 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.849
 the shots and it's more the more they fly through the air and when I say 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.719
 I mean so much to small merchants 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.229
 another example is when we go in a vehicle and a fellow shoots from 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.489
 the mounted turret 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.379
 and see how the children unleashes a great battle 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.840
 this is why the heat and finally one of the most important threats that you 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.840
 they make you feel in war min 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.879
 but the stumble against graphic spector is able to move all this into account 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:52.919
 That and so much more 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.769
 with count of the intense action is the one that goes of the campaign 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.569
 but it can graphically not impracticable some victories in this 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.259
 appointment 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.220
 that the water is not look at it ready 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.859
 or that some indigenous people ask to take 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.699
 but I repeat it is not noticeable when we have a great battle that we do not solve 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.080
 although in some moments 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.629
 which scenario that we had to bring this motion has denied home 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.629
 these flaws can be noticed more 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.390
 about the multiplayer all to not hear that it is one of the best definition 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.190
 ops + played bylan and is that again bush and has managed to meet this 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.100
 mode we find several game modes some knots very interesting 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.400
 added to those of the previous deliveries 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.889
 in trafic itself we will add points to customize our character 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.039
 like for example adding things in the mature 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.830
 in short the campaign mode is just the beginning of the game be that on the monday 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.249
 we will have hundreds and hundreds of hours of game 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.249
 we can also create our own hands and mines ima peace 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.740
 in short bush and a final form of the fairies is issued 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.009
 we just hope that microsoft will take advantage of this franchise and not the 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:06.510
 Street 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.240
 the best way companies history the great combat that are formed in the 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.860
 same 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.650
 the renewed graphic engine 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.810
 multiple and which ensures hundreds of hours and hours continued and I do it over 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.660
 two behind impossible some details for example that the characters 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.140
 tertiary as if millet are not fully joined another final 10 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.020
 hundred days 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.909
 there is nothing 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:54.769
 Ana
