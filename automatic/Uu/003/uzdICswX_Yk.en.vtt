00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.080
 Hello everyone, I'm on a journey and 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:11.410
 Now I want to show you one interesting 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:14.710
 concept from one of the dreamers can 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.490
 so to speak on the topic eat see the htc 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.100
 one 2 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.210
 although a bit illogical to call looking 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.640
 Sevan 2 since almost Sevan is a hdc one 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.140
 that is, it turns out so learn and 12 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.840
 but none the less 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.190
 itâ€™s just clear what the number 2 means 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:37.109
 how would the next one after and you know 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.370
 that one is a fairly successful product 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.729
 consider this you can say the most 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.420
 popular learn and smartphone and 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:50.710
 in the second generation he is definitely 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.319
 get either a bigger screen or a bigger one 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.929
 size or perhaps even a larger screen 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:01:00.280
 on the same size due to the fact that 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:03.119
 the edges will be much narrower and the upper parts and 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.670
 the bottom will also be narrower than 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.780
 the current flagship I want to note that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.189
 boomsound 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.390
 stayed ie front speakers on 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.659
 front end they stayed 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 well, beats audio is probably already with 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.430
 probability one hundred percent will not be 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.030
 there is also one more picture which 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.479
 displays a more complete picture of this 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.090
 smartphone he is their god and in profile from with 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.670
 back side 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.119
 the important point is that double 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.539
 led-flash and a more powerful camera and 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.179
 also an unusual body form factor 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:47.020
 that the bottom of it gets thinner and 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.969
 something he looks like well I don't know well 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.740
 probably no more baseball bat 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.049
 on the torch of the olympic games 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 which is being held in Sochi Crassus 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.630
 when I shoot a video of this concept 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.149
 the olympic games started sometimes me 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.829
 it seems that it will just fall out myself 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.539
 smartphone here's the top part it will be 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.460
 outweigh the palms so you need 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.190
 carefully 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.700
 take the phone most likely top 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.590
 part 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.220
 because the weight concentration will be on 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.430
 not parts this is a bit illogical 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.930
 but I'm sure that the future smartphone is unlikely 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.540
 so will be though 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.580
 concept is very interesting and can be 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.319
 the future will come up with something like this 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.980
 I also want to mark the card slot 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.510
 of memory 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.470
 most likely it will be for a memory card and 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.090
 one more thing is what's on the glass in 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.140
 logo area and 4 will be 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.349
 fingerprint well of course you ask 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.799
 where do I get all this data from 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.739
 concept phone site with dot com 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.489
 This here on this site there is such a concept 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.879
 tag and there is even a video but unfortunately I 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.269
 I can't show it to you fully 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.420
 how is it protected by copyright then 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.239
 I have already tried to lay out and she 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.269
 copyrighted us this 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.420
 video there is some kind of media company therefore 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.769
 can go on the flow of the radar and with Ivan 2 and 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.819
 being treated and 8 m 8 exclusive 3d concept 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.650
 three hundred twenty eight thousand views 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:28.030
 typed he want to point out that one more 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.370
 moment of iron he will have 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.370
 quad snapdragon 800 three goals 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.450
 bytes of RAM and 4 thousand 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.910
 milliampere battery 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.150
 what of it will be exactly so i'm not 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.730
 sure but maybe here are the first two 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.329
 point exactly they match this hundred 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.090
 percent 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:52.130
 also a nuance regarding the shell and 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.569
 android then there will be android 4 4 kit 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.150
 kat and sense shell 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.750
 60 I can not naively see her bring 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.720
 since these are all this videos here it is so 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.720
 strange I also want to note interesting 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.579
 the factor is that 10 megapixel 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.730
 sorry not having the letter ultra 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.530
 pixel camera and yes and 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.489
 and here's the same fingerprint 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:24.099
 which is in htc area 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:28.030
 fingerprint scanner video 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:30.500
 Now you can see all that for sure 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.539
 fingerprint scanner well in general 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.009
 such a concept tag if you like 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.620
 write in the comments that he is to you 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.560
 liked if not write what you do not 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.620
 liked what it is real unreal well in 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.349
 In general, here I share with you this 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.729
