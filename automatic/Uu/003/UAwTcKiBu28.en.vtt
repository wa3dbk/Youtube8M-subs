00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
software it's not hardly so our device

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.560 
software it's not hardly so our device
to<00:04:33.729> have<00:04:33.970> enough<00:04:34.419> capacity<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:36.360> improve<00:04:37.360> this

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
to have enough capacity to improve this

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.390 
to have enough capacity to improve this
function<00:04:38.080> without<00:04:38.200> any<00:04:38.590> problems<00:04:39.160> nice<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:41.400> so

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
function without any problems nice so so

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
for like you can have 3d 3g and how much

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.860 
for like you can have 3d 3g and how much
better<00:04:54.250> will<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.639> use<00:04:54.669> if<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.150> have<00:04:55.270> 3g<00:04:55.660> is

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
better will it use if you have 3g is

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.659 
better will it use if you have 3g is
only<00:04:56.169> connected<00:04:56.710> down<00:04:56.919> at<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.130> book<00:04:57.310> then<00:04:57.550> it

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
only connected down at the book then it
