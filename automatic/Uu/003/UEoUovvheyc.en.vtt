00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.110
 but he's ready to celebrate this 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.700
 world to which team do you give what 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.429
 it seems if we celebrate together and also 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.530
 we can bet with some rich shots of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.980
 gelatin with a little vodka so now 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.980
 is with me 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.540
 Hello my name is Laura and I'm going to 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.340
 teach cooking healthy and in this 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.230
 day we are going to celebrate because we want 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.450
 to come with you to the world cup and we already know 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.610
 that everything scares kilitos had perhaps 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.260
 nougat quoted so you are if we do 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.759
 in a very rich and healthy way 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 also filled now so that our 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.230
 voting so many things with calories we're going 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.150
 to make some jello shots 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.920
 delicious the key to this is going to be 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.960
 look for light gelatin so you do not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.210
 contain your 20 character with me for 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.070
 show them what do you need I have here 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 a cup of boiling water and what I'm going 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.000
 to do is turn it off and I'll place a 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.500
 about light gelatin 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.210
 remember for my friends who have 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.070
 diabetes gelatin light can 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.290
 turn into a problem but eye 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.699
 any alcohol that your men are going 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.260
 to turn into sugar inside your 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.120
 body so limit yourself with alcohol 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.610
 and well let's put that a sachet 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 I'm going to make a green jelly 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.890
 lemon because the flag of my country is 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.080
 mexico so let's prepare many 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 tricolores of green white and red besides 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.030
 of pineapple shorts with lemon because 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.610
 they are the flag of brazil so what is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.700
 your country and how your flag is prepared 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.770
 dissolves gelatin very well and when 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.990
 no more lumps left, this is ready if 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.370
 you notice, I put out the fire once 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.470
 place the gelatin and it's boiling 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.980
 look here you see the sorcerers there are 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.980
 treat them 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.969
 We are going to place our gelatin in a 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.610
 container and this is missing a portion 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.860
 in the cup of cold water me what 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.479
 is to place the sky this is going to 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.700
 accelerate the process as we are going to do 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.319
 shots of various colors afterwards is a 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.360
 can ortiz to put in the fridge here 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.469
 it is cold and then you can 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.630
 place the other chop 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.030
 then we are going to place ice and this is 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.709
 will speed up the process so look at it 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.990
 I'm going to fill the house with ice and what 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.659
 I'm going to put the envelope 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.840
 of water with which we had to be 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.090
 boiling let's let them melt 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.299
 the heavens and for as long as you let me 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.160
 I teach how many vodka points 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.319
 You can prepare this with tequila 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.090
 vodka now these are the liquors 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.230
 they contain less quantity at their expense than 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.480
 three doctors always recommend you 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.489
 for the diets and the amount for each 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.880
 about gelatin is a shock is a 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.519
 little horse that is an eye ounce make sure 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.190
 that your gelatin is already cold because the 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.840
 alcohol is highly volatile and also 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.220
 evaporates much faster than water 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.800
 that the black one is cold along with the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.500
 I'm going ice 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.070
 and the vodka wheelie and this is 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.420
 ready let's try 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.340
 mine is perfect if you want 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.050
 Be more loaded with partners you can 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.780
 add more vodka I'm fine with 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.340
 one or a vodka wheelie now I'm going to 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.900
 place this same measure that is a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.880
 eighth cup in case you do not have 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.300
 you have a little cup of 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.420
 plastic let's fill this are for 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.700
 my shots from brazil but here I have 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.890
 my empty glasses to do the shows 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.590
 from mexico so I'm going to place a 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.330
 lot of green and right now I'm going to 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.970
 let cool once it is cold 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.100
 I will place the target and then the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.320
 red to made all the shots that you're going to 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.240
 prepare remember that you have to do the 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.580
 same procedure prepares your envelope 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.000
 of gelatin made of vodka uses and 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.650
 ready for the green grass for our 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.440
 white part of the banner I'm going to 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.260
 use chocolate white pudding 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.360
 you can find them without sugar and what 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.790
 what we are going to do is add to our 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.160
 vodka chip as are two cups I'm going to 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.260
 add a vodka shock or you can add 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.940
 two and what is more loaded the envelope 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.060
 of the pudding and remember that you have to 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.200
 be super cold your milk 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.470
 an entire envelope of this pudding 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.950
