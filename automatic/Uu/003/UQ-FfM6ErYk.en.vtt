00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
within ourselves albeit late just to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.719 
within ourselves albeit late just to
have<00:01:31.680> seen<00:01:31.860> those<00:01:31.920> move<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> ball<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.549> quick

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
have seen those move the ball but quick
a<00:01:32.759> second<00:01:33.180> half<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> most<00:01:34.619> important

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
a second half but the most important

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340

proud of them I'm not even aware of that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.160

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
against the mac run on Saturday what

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.880 
against the mac run on Saturday what
type<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.090> team<00:03:59.210> are<00:03:59.480> Bolton<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.900> think<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.710> very

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
type of team are Bolton I think the very

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.290 
type of team are Bolton I think the very
attacking<00:04:01.190> team<00:04:01.460> you<00:04:01.880> know<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.000> think<00:04:02.090> they

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
attacking team you know I think they

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.270 
attacking team you know I think they
made<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.480> lineup<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.140> they<00:04:03.800> come<00:04:04.040> up<00:04:04.130> men

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
made the lineup and they come up men

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.190 
made the lineup and they come up men
forward<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:05.330> think<00:04:05.540> I'll<00:04:05.660> be<00:04:05.810> relatively

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
forward and I think I'll be relatively

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.110 
forward and I think I'll be relatively
quite<00:04:06.500> open<00:04:06.830> game<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:07.550> I<00:04:07.580> don't<00:04:07.670> think<00:04:07.940> it's

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
quite open game so I don't think it's

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.880 
quite open game so I don't think it's
gone<00:04:08.270> in<00:04:08.330> that<00:04:08.450> cage<00:04:08.660> affair<00:04:09.020> but<00:04:09.380> she<00:04:09.740> would

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
gone in that cage affair but she would

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.950 
gone in that cage affair but she would
be<00:04:09.980> used<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.400> say<00:04:10.880> they're<00:04:11.090> gonna<00:04:11.570> hear<00:04:11.720> other

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
be used to say they're gonna hear other

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.950 
be used to say they're gonna hear other
