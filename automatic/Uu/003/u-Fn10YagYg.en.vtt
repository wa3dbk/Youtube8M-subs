there<00:00:02.100> are<00:00:02.190> two<00:00:02.310> examples<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.090> some<00:00:03.149> citrus

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.629 

this<00:00:06.930> here<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:08.389> Miwa<00:00:09.389> kumquat<00:00:10.639> it's

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
this here is a Miwa kumquat it's

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.450 
this here is a Miwa kumquat it's
supposed<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.090> little<00:00:12.240> bit<00:00:12.330> sweeter

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
supposed to be a little bit sweeter

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.760 
supposed to be a little bit sweeter
rounders<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.790> shape<00:00:15.230> than<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> Nogami

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
rounders and in shape than the Nogami

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.120 
rounders and in shape than the Nogami
and<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:18.000> pretty<00:00:18.869> much<00:00:18.990> eat<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> whole<00:00:19.650> thing

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.950 

the<00:00:23.130> rind<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.449> put<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.779> whole

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the rind and all you just put this whole

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.200 
the rind and all you just put this whole
thing<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.320> mouth<00:00:25.670> this<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
thing in your mouth this here is a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.890 
thing in your mouth this here is a
Eustace<00:00:27.900> lime<00:00:28.740> Kwok<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.599> cross

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
Eustace lime Kwok which is the cross

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.729 
Eustace lime Kwok which is the cross
between<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:32.099> Mexican<00:00:32.910> key<00:00:33.239> lime<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:35.010> kumquat

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
between a Mexican key lime and a kumquat

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.819 
between a Mexican key lime and a kumquat
this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.890> interesting<00:00:39.500> let's<00:00:40.500> see<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.739> these

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
this is interesting let's see what these

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:55.280 
this is interesting let's see what these
look<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.100> inside

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.810 

there's<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> pretty<00:00:56.100> good<00:00:56.250> amount<00:00:56.490> of<00:00:56.550> seeds

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
there's a pretty good amount of seeds

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
there's a pretty good amount of seeds
for<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> size<00:00:57.450> of<00:00:57.600> it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.249 

mm-hmm

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
mm-hmm

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.050 
mm-hmm
I<00:01:06.289> guess<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:07.460> supposed<00:01:07.789> to<00:01:07.880> be<00:01:08.030> a

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
I guess it's it's supposed to be a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.289 
I guess it's it's supposed to be a
little<00:01:08.270> bit<00:01:08.360> more<00:01:08.509> hard<00:01:08.750> here<00:01:09.969> than<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.090> key

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
little bit more hard here than the key

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.539 
little bit more hard here than the key
line<00:01:11.539> but<00:01:12.289> you<00:01:12.409> get<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.680> same<00:01:12.890> flavor

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
line but you get the same flavor

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.350 
line but you get the same flavor
I<00:01:14.320> guess<00:01:15.320> it's<00:01:15.530> difficult<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.189> grow<00:01:16.700> key<00:01:17.119> lime

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
I guess it's difficult to grow key lime

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.840 
I guess it's difficult to grow key lime
in<00:01:18.100> cold<00:01:19.100> areas<00:01:22.869> this<00:01:23.869> here<00:01:24.289> it<00:01:24.710> has<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.670> one

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
in cold areas this here it has this one

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.410 
in cold areas this here it has this one
here's<00:01:26.030> just<00:01:26.240> one<00:01:26.420> seed<00:01:27.939> when<00:01:28.939> we<00:01:29.030> pop<00:01:29.240> this

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
here's just one seed when we pop this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:39.120 
here's just one seed when we pop this
whole<00:01:29.630> thing<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:29.960> my<00:01:30.079> mouth<00:01:34.149> okay<00:01:37.299> so<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
whole thing in my mouth okay so the the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.059 
whole thing in my mouth okay so the the
skins<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.220> little<00:01:40.250> bit<00:01:40.490> more<00:01:40.670> sweeter<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
skins a little bit more sweeter so the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.069 
skins a little bit more sweeter so the
skin<00:01:43.310> sort<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.640> offsets<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.329> sourness<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
skin sort of offsets the sourness of the

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.429 
skin sort of offsets the sourness of the
inside<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:47.770> skin<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:48.860> definitely<00:01:50.439> then

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
inside and the skin is definitely then

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.740 
inside and the skin is definitely then
enough<00:01:51.709> to<00:01:51.829> eat<00:01:52.030> we<00:01:53.030> can<00:01:53.179> just<00:01:53.390> eat<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.720> whole

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
enough to eat we can just eat the whole

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.219 
enough to eat we can just eat the whole
thing<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:54.489> mean<00:01:55.489> these<00:01:55.579> are<00:01:55.759> pretty<00:01:55.909> good<00:01:56.229> but

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
thing I mean these are pretty good but

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.850 
thing I mean these are pretty good but
these<00:01:57.380> are<00:01:57.530> good

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
these are good

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.949 
these are good
you<00:01:57.979> could<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.280> could<00:01:58.340> candy<00:01:58.909> these<00:01:59.090> would<00:01:59.840> be

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
you could you could candy these would be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.229 
you could you could candy these would be
good<00:02:00.079> for<00:02:00.229> candying<00:02:00.739> I<00:02:00.890> might<00:02:01.159> try<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.579> or

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
good for candying I might try that or

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.960 
good for candying I might try that or
marmalade<00:02:02.599> I<00:02:03.220> might<00:02:04.220> see<00:02:04.399> if<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.610> can<00:02:04.789> make<00:02:04.939> a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
marmalade I might see if I can make a

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.880 
marmalade I might see if I can make a
mama<00:02:05.270> laid<00:02:05.539> from<00:02:06.319> these<00:02:08.349> that's<00:02:09.349> if<00:02:09.470> my<00:02:09.619> plant

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
mama laid from these that's if my plant

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:20.460 
mama laid from these that's if my plant
survived<00:02:14.680> hmm<00:02:15.940> these<00:02:16.940> are<00:02:17.030> pretty<00:02:17.180> good<00:02:18.670> stop

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
survived hmm these are pretty good stop

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.379 
survived hmm these are pretty good stop
my<00:02:21.470> used<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.130> slime<00:02:22.370> quad<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.850> even<00:02:23.150> sicker

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:23.389 
my used to slime quad is even sicker

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.520 
my used to slime quad is even sicker
than<00:02:23.660> my<00:02:23.989> Miwok<00:02:24.500> kumquat<00:02:26.109> say<00:02:27.109> that<00:02:27.290> ten<00:02:27.500> times

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
than my Miwok kumquat say that ten times

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.280 
than my Miwok kumquat say that ten times
fast<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:29.799> I'll<00:02:30.799> do<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> video<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.900> Eustace

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
fast so I'll do a video on the Eustace

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.460 
fast so I'll do a video on the Eustace
lime<00:02:34.130> Claude<00:02:34.430> show<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.970> condition<00:02:35.660> and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
lime Claude show you the condition and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.170 
lime Claude show you the condition and
the<00:02:36.560> symptoms<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.340> has<00:02:37.459> basically<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the symptoms that it has basically the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.080 
the symptoms that it has basically the
leaves<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:38.690> dried<00:02:39.170> up<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.370> fallen<00:02:40.700> off<00:02:40.850> but

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
leaves just dried up and fallen off but

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.319 
leaves just dried up and fallen off but
I<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.359> don't<00:02:41.450> have<00:02:41.569> died<00:02:42.319> back<00:02:42.590> yet<00:02:43.209> on<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
I really don't have died back yet on the

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.729 
I really don't have died back yet on the
branches<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:44.930> that's<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.590> bit

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
branches so that's a little bit

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.479 
branches so that's a little bit
different<00:02:45.950> than<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:47.889> symptoms<00:02:48.889> of<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.160> Miwa

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
different than the symptoms of the Miwa

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.670 
different than the symptoms of the Miwa
kumquat<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:52.840> let's<00:02:53.840> see<00:02:53.989> what<00:02:54.139> happens<00:02:54.500> with

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
kumquat so let's see what happens with

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.830 
kumquat so let's see what happens with
those<00:02:54.889> two<00:02:55.099> plants<00:02:55.400> but<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.569> what<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
those two plants but this is what the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.580 
those two plants but this is what the
fruit<00:02:57.019> looks<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:59.109> and<00:03:00.109> I<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:00.349> to<00:03:00.440> figure

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
fruit looks like and I have to figure

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.550 
fruit looks like and I have to figure
out<00:03:00.769> what<00:03:00.920> I'm<00:03:01.010> going<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.280> do<00:03:01.370> with<00:03:01.519> these<00:03:02.560> well

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
out what I'm going to do with these well

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.910
