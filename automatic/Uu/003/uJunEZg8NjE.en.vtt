00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
off this it would be this weird part

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.670 
off this it would be this weird part
right<00:04:11.590> here<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:13.510> something<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.260> watch<00:04:14.380> out<00:04:14.650> for

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
and then there's the cool factor there

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.050 
and then there's the cool factor there
is<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.470> button<00:04:21.010> up<00:04:21.280> here<00:04:22.980> right<00:04:23.980> here<00:04:27.060> which

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
is a button up here right here which

is a button up here right here which
shoots<00:04:28.480> out<00:04:28.720> funnels<00:04:29.470> it's<00:04:30.340> awesome<00:04:32.250> cool<00:04:33.250> huh

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
shoots out funnels it's awesome cool huh

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.140 
shoots out funnels it's awesome cool huh
very<00:04:34.600> very<00:04:35.020> cool<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.590> think<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.640> can't

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
very very cool I think that I can't

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.520 
very very cool I think that I can't
remember<00:04:37.240> how<00:04:37.480> many<00:04:37.540> funnels<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.110> came<00:04:38.290> with

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
remember how many funnels it came with

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.670 
remember how many funnels it came with
it<00:04:39.310> might<00:04:39.550> have<00:04:39.640> come<00:04:39.760> with<00:04:39.940> more<00:04:40.150> than<00:04:40.360> two

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
it might have come with more than two

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.100 
it might have come with more than two
like<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.770> said<00:04:41.980> I<00:04:42.010> had<00:04:42.220> my<00:04:42.250> box<00:04:42.640> somewhere<00:04:43.480> out

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
like I said I had my box somewhere out

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.440 
like I said I had my box somewhere out
in<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.440> shop<00:04:44.710> with<00:04:45.040> chars<00:04:45.400> part<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.180> think

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
in the shop with chars part but I think

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.350
