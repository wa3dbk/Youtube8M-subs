 men given by the kitchen 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.759
 Caesar had the pasta first before 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.710
 serve it as is the system 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.930
 first it boiled and then it was held 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.660
 so that all this complements well 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.530
 long areas of libyan kings with the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.990
 butter burned to the garlic and this 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.580
 side are conflicts the tiramisu what 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.640
 We propose several and if you have only 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.560

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.980
 woman almost forty-odd years ago 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.690
 who lives in Argentina and not really the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.940
 good recipes people are going to try their 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.769
 dishes they do not release a single 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.879
 formula the tiramisu from there you what 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.920
 I recommend now because it 's fantastic 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.599
 I still like carts or I'm with the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.340
 anti pastures from there of the street 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.870
 republic india you arrive not you 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.840
 they ask what it does to eat directly 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.849
 It serves you for the table nor letter and there neither 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 letter that's what the kitchen would be 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.120
 Italian traditional and solitary those who 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.799
 they are living here or the same 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.049
 Italians are also the others 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.010
 more modern Italians more fake by 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.629
 so say those who have also 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.489
 implemented a cooking style 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.560
 quite particular following the roots 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.910
 of the italic peninsula here in good 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.280
 aires has mixed a bit of art 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.450
 culture and good has come out a good 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.450
 we will see the ship 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.550
 the best way to start eating a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.590
 good Italian food is of course 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.480
 testing the anti for the entry before 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.890
 to eat some pasta is good 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.410
 eat an antipasto of this type that is 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.300
 like livianito and your appetite wakes you up 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.370
 of a slice of country bread with ham 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.680
 raw brie cheese dried tomatoes and arugula 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.600
 how much can you spend here with a plate 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.790
 like this one with an antipasto a paste a 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.350
 dessert and a good drink and this is a 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.150
 entrance that we charge 26 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.150
 pesos and you have recycled what is 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.100

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.360
 modern italian with as I say with everything 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.130
 a little bit of everything like that and all clear 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.410

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.420
 touch energies grandson of Italian children

 Ground of oregano 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.480

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.280
 Parmesan does not consider them cooks 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.600

 Marble cooking them in the oven 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.639
 which is very different and almost does not 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.990
 find by the highs of that 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.479

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.530
 Desperate control kills us 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.130
 twelve thirty-eight does not bring the pizza 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.960
 the pasta and you had because yes the 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.280

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.050
 from buenos aires the most modern is 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.360
 thrown in the street freedom as well as 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.160

 seriously but it's very good it sounds all 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.880
 sounds good to me at this time and the prices 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.650
 they are good prices are accessible by 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.750
 example for two people who want to 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.370
 eat and have fun at the pizzeria the
