seemed to get better i handle the ball
and<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.390> running<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.720> team<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> leader<00:01:31.470> on

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799

and just running my team as a leader on
the<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.159> i<00:01:32.640> mess<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> biggest<00:01:33.810> thing

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the more i mess is the biggest thing

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.179 
the more i mess is the biggest thing
just<00:01:33.930> getting<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.560> reps<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> point

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
just getting more reps at the point

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.640 
just getting more reps at the point
guard<00:01:35.250> position<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
guard position and

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.740 
guard position and
better<00:01:36.860> idea<00:01:37.160> I<00:01:37.700> think<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.120> lot<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:38.720> a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
better idea I think a lot of that is a

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.120 
better idea I think a lot of that is a
kind<00:01:39.230> of<00:01:39.320> mirrors<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:39.830> know<00:01:39.890> what<00:01:40.040> your

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
kind of mirrors you know what your

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.650 
kind of mirrors you know what your
brother<00:01:40.340> did<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.610> think<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:40.970> coming<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.570> he
