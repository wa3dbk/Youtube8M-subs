00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
reason I don't know why but I always

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.050 
reason I don't know why but I always
seem<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.859> find<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:03.830> these<00:01:04.970> because<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
seem to find that and these because I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.530 
seem to find that and these because I
just<00:01:06.240> picked<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.720> these<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.799> beastly

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
just picked up here these are beastly

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.410 
just picked up here these are beastly
look<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.860> two<00:01:11.640> seconds<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
look at that that's like two seconds and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.030 
look at that that's like two seconds and
it's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> secondary<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:13.950> pretty

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
think it's a little bit cheap in a way I

mean<00:02:59.090> not<00:03:00.090> much<00:03:00.329> cheap<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:02.370> an

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
mean not much cheap but it's it's an

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.190 
mean not much cheap but it's it's an
advantage<00:03:02.730> over<00:03:03.060> someone<00:03:03.420> else<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.870> well<00:03:04.079> if

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
advantage over someone else and well if

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.080 
advantage over someone else and well if
you<00:03:04.290> need<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.590> fair<00:03:04.860> play<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.879> don't

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you need it fair play but if you don't

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.069 
you need it fair play but if you don't
then<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:08.310> doesn't<00:03:08.459> really<00:03:08.549> matter<00:03:08.810> but<00:03:09.810> at<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
then it doesn't really matter but at the

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.960 
then it doesn't really matter but at the
time<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.829> know<00:03:10.950> they've<00:03:11.129> got<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> modded
