00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 hide behind the sounds 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.970
 I choke on tenderness 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:50.250

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.250

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:23.470
 we'll learn how to play the song Zemfira 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.060
 why are you on what are we this song with rhythm in 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.730
 this song is quite complex rhythm 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:38.440
 so I will show you first how to play 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:41.020
 its on drowned out their strings like this 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.620
 rhythm will be in this song let's for 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.760
 begin to divide this rhythm into three parts 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.000
 there will be 5 hits first 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:56.500
 the first blow of fanny with your finger 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 conduct from the sixth string 1 on 4 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:12.970
 hitting up down up down so big 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:20.430
 finger on 6 strokes up and down and three 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.430
 last blow doing up all together 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.430
 now connect the left hand and try 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.430
 play it third on one chord 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.400
 see I apply here as full as loud 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.370
 chords and beats on 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:56.070
 I muffle their stunned strings right 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:59.910
 and with my left hand I take my left hand off 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.790
 strings and cover a little first 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.320
 finger 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.320
 the first string that she did not study and 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:24.390
 right hand i am sometimes a great sorcerer 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:33.000
 finger on the lower strings like this 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:36.870
 instead of hitting down, let's actually 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.890
 consider in detail where we will jam 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:46.130
 1 pound strings full 2 up too 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.130
 our dear 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.770
 further floor air blow up 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.720
 best right hand for color 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:05.280
 ears and right and left hand 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:14.190
 and once again the best in right and left hand 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:21.350
 and the last three blows we will have 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.350
 drowned out all together 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:40.120
 and let's try to play this slowly 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.120
 song with all the chords noble words 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.340
 loosen 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.749
 I'm choking 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:54.990

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:14.710
