if<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.659> wanted<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.200> save<00:02:54.189> a<00:02:54.220> step<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:57.930> could

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
if you wanted to save a step I could

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.539 
if you wanted to save a step I could
have<00:02:59.879> put<00:03:00.879> some<00:03:01.720> paint<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.799> glue<00:03:03.010> or<00:03:03.280> some

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
have put some paint in the glue or some

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.399 
have put some paint in the glue or some
pigments<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.620> would<00:03:05.799> have<00:03:05.920> made<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:08.079> go

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
pigments and it would have made this go

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.099 
pigments and it would have made this go
by<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:09.040> lot<00:03:09.879> but<00:03:10.769> save<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> bit<00:03:12.159> of<00:03:12.220> time<00:03:12.519> in

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109
