00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:11.839 

I<00:00:09.530> would<00:00:10.530> recommend<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.220> eat<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.639> tomato

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
I would recommend that you eat a tomato

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940 
I would recommend that you eat a tomato
every<00:00:12.750> day<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.139> try<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.410> include<00:00:13.740> him<00:00:13.860> in

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
every day so I try to include him in

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
every day so I try to include him in
everything<00:00:14.219> especially<00:00:14.660> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> omelets

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
everything especially in the omelets

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.349 
everything especially in the omelets
because<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:16.710> you've<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.519> your<00:00:17.669> protein

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
because now you've got your protein

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.259 
because now you've got your protein
you've<00:00:19.169> got<00:00:19.409> your<00:00:19.939> carbohydrate<00:00:20.939> which<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.239> a

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269 
you've got your carbohydrate which is a

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.939 
you've got your carbohydrate which is a
complex<00:00:21.720> carbohydrate<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.439> they<00:00:22.529> combined

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
complex carbohydrate and they combined

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.079 
complex carbohydrate and they combined
it<00:00:23.130> perfectly<00:00:23.579> together

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.089 
it perfectly together

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.370 
it perfectly together
so<00:00:24.329> let's<00:00:24.509> show<00:00:24.659> them<00:00:24.749> what<00:00:24.899> we're<00:00:25.050> coming<00:00:25.199> up

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so let's show them what we're coming up

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.960 
so let's show them what we're coming up
with<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:25.679> we've<00:00:25.800> got<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.069> greens<00:00:26.339> we've<00:00:26.849> got

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
with here we've got the greens we've got

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
with here we've got the greens we've got
the<00:00:27.119> tomatoes<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.779> we've<00:00:28.019> also<00:00:28.199> chosen<00:00:28.589> some

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the tomatoes and we've also chosen some

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.159 
the tomatoes and we've also chosen some
black<00:00:29.640> beans<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.329> Chris<00:00:30.659> talked<00:00:30.899> about

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
black beans I think Chris talked about

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.659 
black beans I think Chris talked about
why<00:00:31.319> you<00:00:31.380> chose<00:00:31.499> black<00:00:31.979> beans<00:00:32.220> for<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
why you chose black beans for this I

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.919 
why you chose black beans for this I
chose<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> black<00:00:33.329> beans<00:00:33.539> because<00:00:33.809> they're

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:33.929 
chose the black beans because they're

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.689 
chose the black beans because they're
high<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.079> fiber<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.710> high<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> fiber<00:00:35.280> very

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
high in fiber very high in fiber very

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.430 
high in fiber very high in fiber very
low<00:00:35.879> in<00:00:35.940> calories<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.539> gives<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.109> the<00:00:37.230> feeling

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
low in calories so gives you the feeling

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
low in calories so gives you the feeling
of<00:00:37.679> fullness<00:00:37.890> without<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.550> calories<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
of fullness without the calories so it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.939 
of fullness without the calories so it
actually<00:00:39.960> turns<00:00:40.170> into<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> complete<00:00:40.530> meal

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
actually turns into a complete meal

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.189 
actually turns into a complete meal
because<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.519> have<00:00:41.640> lean<00:00:41.940> protein<00:00:42.390> from

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
because now you have lean protein from

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.900 
because now you have lean protein from
your<00:00:43.379> eggs<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.280> high<00:00:44.399> fiber<00:00:44.670> from

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
your eggs you have your high fiber from

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.630 
your eggs you have your high fiber from
your<00:00:45.030> black<00:00:45.210> beans<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.749> also<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.859> your
