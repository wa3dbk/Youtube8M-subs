00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.460
 I welcome you guys and girls today 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.830
 we have a rubric in the heading 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.620
 why but like this coincided this Friday 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.469
 and on Fridays we have a review on the designer 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.900
 and today I propose to talk about 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.260
 chinese mini iron figurines 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.270
 humans in the sense of humans in the sense of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.740
 team tony stark of in quite 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.859
 unusual form then a couple well and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.609
 three more guys in general, let 's talk about 8 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.730
 figurine 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.000
 yes friends in me it seemed iron 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.480
 wolverine man and this is deadpool yes 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.100
 Others I think you also learned about yes I am up 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 so far has not answered the question 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.050
 why heading in heading 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.149
 today it is one of the BRIC Friday heading 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.700
 but about the Chinese toys, we will 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.870
 speak under a heading called china 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 he is such a china 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 Well, as it is not so sure that the Chinese 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.399
 crafts and other substandard goods 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 will be frequent guests on our channel 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.739
 however, if you like the new rubric 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.479
 I will definitely find a separate one for her 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.850
 day something greeting was delayed 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.520
 drove well and for starters where bought it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 how much I figured it all 8 figures 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.830
 I bought on ebay and they cost only 20 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.590
 bucks without one cent 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.439
 delivery was free but before 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.380
 start and i want to say this all 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 figures the same physiognomy and this is our 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.290
 favorite tony stark as many as eight pieces 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.840
 the whole print face is not even bad 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 the color of the mask is closer to the body that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.759
 looks more realistic than lego however 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.970
 if you look closely you can see that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.909
 somewhere a mustache a little farther at someone almost 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.220
 the mouth has gotten these same whiskers somewhere teeth 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.680
 worn off a little one beard 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.170
 partly for this growth but in principle if 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.689
 masks do not lift everything looks very 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.330
 cool let's start and the first will be 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.340
 iron Man 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.070
 This lamp as accessories for 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.590
 him two round 1 pin sharpen 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.410
 the figure itself is made in green 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.440
 tones that in principle is clear and on the chest 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.110
 instead of the reactor it has a green logo 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.480
 lantern all prints both in front and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.270
 on the whole 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.940
 not bad on the right foot a small joint 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.910
 moved a little print plus some 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.670
 shabby is not the brightest superhero but 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.370
 I liked the Dale and the iron 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.370
 man is a god of thunder 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.860
 as an accessory he has 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.920
 if anyone knows this is his hammer so 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.680
 called painted iron top in blue 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.260
 gray with a small amount 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.560
 red and on his chest flaunts 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.350
 the logo of the torus did not know that the blonde 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.750
 have your logo out of the absurdity wanted 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.760
 would still note and red gloves 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.590
 although who am I kidding this whole set 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.320
 some big nonsense 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.160
 oh well printer torus looks 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.350
 very good front and back 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.140
 next in line is super iron maine 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.170
 as accessories he has nothing 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.680
 although he could however like toru 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.560
 make a cloak would look like it all hit 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.080
 bete lny agree so he looks 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.530
 definitely better 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.780
 dressed iron superman in costume 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.840
 mostly blue and front 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.200
 part of the mask is painted yellow and its 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.590
 chest decorates the letter s prints like a 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.560
 the first two figures have front body 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.560
 both legs and back on supermanâ€™s body 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.230
 the print on the right foot also went a little 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.540
 towards the left foot 4 of whom we 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.170
 let's talk captain iron man 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.530
 America 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.350
 of accessories he has 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.120
 naturally famous shield with a star in 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.819
 the center itself is a piece of iron painted in color 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.290
 stars and stripes in the sense of color 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.230
 american flag 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.930
 and in the forehead the star letter a is burning inside 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.140
 so it does not burn in general 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.900
 and he has prints there in this figure 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.989
 applied high quality and looks very 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.630
 interesting and they are present as the front 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.040
 on the body and legs and back in fact 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.830
 nice option 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.480
 further we have spiedy but more often it is called 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.140
 I don't know why the poodle 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.000
 consonant spidea 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.790
 in the other hand it doesn't matter at all 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.790
 the quality of the figure does not affect 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.090
 iron spider no accessories 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.150
 but there is a print on the mask and his eyes 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.860
 not like the other figures and they have 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.770
 spider eye shape 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.950
 that in my very cool suit light 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.130
 very cool matched think there was 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.370
 it's hard to miss your chest naturally 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.830
 flaunts logo spider prints front 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.650
 settled down from head to toe behind 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.380
 only on the back is a very cute spider 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.169
 the Chinese came sixth on the list with us 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.300
 batman iron man executed he 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.789
 naturally dark colors 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.340
 his suit is painted black with 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:17.190
 yellow splashes to logo 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.620
 Batman looked organic on his chest 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.380
 iron mouse as an accessory for 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.169
 it seems to be a betarang here 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.229
 thought batman lived would not hurt the black 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.900
 Cloak for entourage would say so 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.760
 still add that he has prints on his feet 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.430
 is present only on the thighs have 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.160
 the rest they have prints are also on 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.650
 if at all possible 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.530
 parts of the body of Lego from the shoals 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.229
 I want to note its value 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.780
 masks in the rest of the figure is very even 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.660
 the last but one we are 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.510
 look iron grandfather for this friend 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.050
 He has two richest accessories 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.960
 guns similar to glock 17 as well 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.270
 a pair of katan without which it is simply impossible 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.300
 present the power of deadpool 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.810
 Well, holders for these most Japanese 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.630
 swords 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.240
 painted this handsome naturally in 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.440
 red and black colors on chest can 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.680
 see the logo 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.590
 and prints like everyone has in front and behind 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.710
 perhaps from this figure eights 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.860
 deadpool is one of the best and that's a fact 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.610
 Well, finally, I left my beloved 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.460
 character from marvel wolverine in our 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.130
 case is an iron man and wolverine 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.840
 made it very cool and as 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.930
 additional items 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.240
 he has claws that are identified 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.470
 add epic of this figure 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.380
 add here 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.930
 interesting color scheme and pleasant 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.250
 prints and get at the exit quite 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.740
 cool figure 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.640
 true in wolverine as in lantern and 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.580
 superman 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.280
 print right foot moved to the left apparently 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.590
 some kind of kosovo secret left eye is chinese 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.740
 sprint shaft figures otherwise 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:08.340
 minifigure iron wolverine turned out 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.650
 cool no wonder I left it so to speak 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.260
 for dessert at the end I will say this 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.930
 I wanted to crush these 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.810
 figurines mock so to speak 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.450
 Chinese consumer goods but as it turned out and 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.539
 they can do very interesting things 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.860
 there is another set of iron people with 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.800
 other characters 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.560
