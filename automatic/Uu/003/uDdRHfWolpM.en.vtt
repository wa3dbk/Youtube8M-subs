tell<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.100> um<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.620> painted<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
tell there's to it but um I painted it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.819 
tell there's to it but um I painted it
with<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.539> black<00:00:57.539> paint<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.530> whatever<00:00:58.680> you

problem<00:04:05.340> with<00:04:05.460> getting<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.180> the

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
problem with getting this is the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.970 
problem with getting this is the
faceplate<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.200> can't<00:04:07.470> find<00:04:07.770> them

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
faceplate so you can't find them

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.310 
faceplate so you can't find them
anywhere<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.670> if<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.090> fight<00:04:09.450> use<00:04:09.750> which<00:04:10.110> you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
anywhere and if you fight use which you

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.010 
anywhere and if you fight use which you
will<00:04:10.470> have<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.860> buy<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.100> use<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:12.300> are<00:04:12.480> highly

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
will have to buy it use you are highly

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.120 
will have to buy it use you are highly
likely<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.560> get<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.740> bad<00:04:14.370> one<00:04:14.690> um<00:04:15.799> and

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.590 

everything<00:04:20.130> else<00:04:20.280> pretty<00:04:20.670> stuff<00:04:21.060> cause<00:04:21.299> I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
everything else pretty stuff cause I

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.390 
everything else pretty stuff cause I
didn't<00:04:22.170> have<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.350> say<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.650> screen<00:04:22.950> seems<00:04:23.250> a
