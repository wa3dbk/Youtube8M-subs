00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
crash sound like you know so they're

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.680 
crash sound like you know so they're
very<00:02:24.640> suited<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.150> each<00:02:25.180> other<00:02:25.450> because<00:02:25.630> they

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
very suited to each other because they

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.410

are the same the same line to go with

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.310 
are the same the same line to go with
that<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.750> have<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> 20<00:02:29.230> inch<00:02:29.380> medium<00:02:30.010> ride<00:02:31.320> it's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
that we have a 20 inch medium ride it's

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.720 
that we have a 20 inch medium ride it's
a<00:02:32.380> medium<00:02:32.650> right<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.160> more<00:02:33.490> along<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
a medium right it's a more along the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.820 
a medium right it's a more along the
sort<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.330> heavier<00:02:34.690> heavier<00:02:35.380> side<00:02:35.770> I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
sort of that the heavier heavier side I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.300 
sort of that the heavier heavier side I
think<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.940> still<00:02:37.300> washy<00:02:37.570> enough<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.650> to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
think but it's still washy enough to to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.170 
think but it's still washy enough to to
get<00:02:39.430> away<00:02:39.520> with<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.790> lot<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.000> situations

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
get away with a lot of situations

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.990 
get away with a lot of situations
situations<00:02:40.750> great<00:02:41.620> Bell<00:02:42.000> definitely

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
situations great Bell definitely

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.090 
situations great Bell definitely
piercing<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.690> cutting<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.440> again<00:02:44.740> depends<00:02:45.040> on

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
piercing and cutting so again depends on

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.340 
piercing and cutting so again depends on
how<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.220> play<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:46.870> that's<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.110> great

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
how you play but then that's a great

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.199 
how you play but then that's a great
choice<00:02:47.380> for<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.860> lot<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.310> different<00:02:48.670> situations

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
choice for a lot of different situations

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.870 
choice for a lot of different situations
so<00:02:49.660> they're<00:02:49.780> really<00:02:49.959> cool<00:02:50.370> produced<00:02:51.370> kind<00:02:51.760> of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
so they're really cool produced kind of

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.840 
so they're really cool produced kind of
sound<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.010> really<00:02:54.190> really<00:02:54.340> nice<00:02:54.520> choice

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
sound and a really really nice choice

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.660

medium<00:03:16.510> crash<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:18.120> actually<00:03:19.230> feel<00:03:20.230> like

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
medium crash and I actually feel like

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.920 
medium crash and I actually feel like
that<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:20.980> probably<00:03:21.640> more<00:03:21.910> my<00:03:21.970> sound<00:03:22.480> even<00:03:22.810> than

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
that is probably more my sound even than

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.660 
that is probably more my sound even than
the<00:03:22.959> m-series<00:03:23.709> this<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.100> sort<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.370> something

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
the m-series this is sort of something

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.970 
the m-series this is sort of something
that<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.880> would<00:03:25.660> tend<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.830> lot

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
that I would tend to go to it's a lot

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.509 
that I would tend to go to it's a lot
darker<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.989> still<00:03:29.380> bright<00:03:29.709> enough<00:03:29.950> because

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
darker but still bright enough because

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.810 
darker but still bright enough because
of<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.700> brilliant<00:03:31.000> finish<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.700> is

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
of the brilliant finish but it is it is

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.150 
of the brilliant finish but it is it is
a<00:03:33.850> lot<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.269> lot<00:03:34.300> darker<00:03:34.690> than<00:03:34.810> than<00:03:35.200> than<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
a lot a lot darker than than than the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.850 
a lot a lot darker than than than the
m-series<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.959> thing<00:03:38.170> about<00:03:38.320> this<00:03:38.560> particular

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
m-series the thing about this particular

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.860 
m-series the thing about this particular
line<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.640> sound<00:03:39.880> custom<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.570> supposed

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
line that sound custom is it's supposed

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.150 
line that sound custom is it's supposed
to<00:03:40.989> be<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.140> little<00:03:41.440> bit<00:03:41.620> cheaper<00:03:41.920> than<00:03:42.040> the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
to be a little bit cheaper than the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.410 
to be a little bit cheaper than the
m-series<00:03:42.430> i'm<00:03:42.640> sure<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:42.940> supposed<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.269> be<00:03:43.390> a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
m-series i'm sure it's supposed to be a

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.530 
m-series i'm sure it's supposed to be a
bit<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.570> bit<00:03:44.130> higher<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.400> range<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:45.910> that's

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
bit a bit higher in the range so that's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.780 
bit a bit higher in the range so that's
a<00:03:46.630> really<00:03:46.660> good<00:03:46.989> value<00:03:47.200> crash<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:48.430> i<00:03:48.489> really

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
a really good value crash and i really

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.370 
a really good value crash and i really
like<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.239> lot<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.840> one<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.200> winner

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
like it a lot so that one is a winner

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.699 
like it a lot so that one is a winner
for<00:03:50.470> me<00:03:50.730> over<00:03:51.730> here<00:03:52.230> we've<00:03:53.230> got<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.380> 10<00:03:53.560> inch

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
for me over here we've got a 10 inch

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.430 
for me over here we've got a 10 inch
splash<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.790> we've<00:03:55.150> got<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.330> 16<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.810> China<00:03:56.140> these

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
splash and we've got a 16 in China these

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.050 
splash and we've got a 16 in China these
two<00:03:56.709> are<00:03:56.950> seven<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.250> sound<00:03:57.430> caster<00:03:57.790> as<00:03:57.910> well

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
two are seven the sound caster as well

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.250 
two are seven the sound caster as well
but<00:03:58.180> they're<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.360> different<00:03:58.540> slightly

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
but they're a different slightly

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.210 
but they're a different slightly
different<00:03:59.620> thing<00:03:59.739> these<00:03:59.860> are<00:04:00.010> called<00:04:00.130> the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
different thing these are called the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.470 
different thing these are called the
fusion<00:04:00.580> series<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.060> reason<00:04:01.299> why<00:04:01.360> their

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
fusion series and the reason why their

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.840 
fusion series and the reason why their
fusion<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.959> because<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.769> bell<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.610> little

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
fusion is because the bell and a little

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.220 
fusion is because the bell and a little
bit<00:04:03.940> around<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.330> belt<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.870> brilliant

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
bit around the belt is a brilliant

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.140 
bit around the belt is a brilliant
finish<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:05.860> that's<00:04:06.010> its<00:04:06.280> lathe<00:04:06.580> and<00:04:06.610> polished

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
finish so that's its lathe and polished

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.759 
finish so that's its lathe and polished
and<00:04:07.269> then<00:04:07.720> on<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> outside<00:04:08.049> we've<00:04:08.620> got<00:04:08.650> a

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
and then on the outside we've got a

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.820 
and then on the outside we've got a
traditional<00:04:09.310> Finnish<00:04:10.230> very<00:04:11.230> cool<00:04:11.500> sounding

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
traditional Finnish very cool sounding

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.979 
traditional Finnish very cool sounding
splash<00:04:12.130> speaks<00:04:12.700> very<00:04:12.880> quickly<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.390> it's<00:04:13.870> got

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
splash speaks very quickly and it's got

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:14.880 
splash speaks very quickly and it's got
a<00:04:14.019> little<00:04:14.230> bit<00:04:14.440> of<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.560> different<00:04:14.799> quality

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
a little bit of a different quality

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.560 
a little bit of a different quality
about<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.310> compared<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.880> normal<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.359> normal

long-lasting<00:04:27.669> sort<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.180> decay<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.780> which<00:04:28.930> I

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
long-lasting sort of decay it which I

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.300 
long-lasting sort of decay it which I
quite<00:04:29.080> like<00:04:29.409> as<00:04:29.530> well<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.979> can<00:04:30.099> sort<00:04:30.189> of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
quite like as well so you can sort of

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.469 
quite like as well so you can sort of
double<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.639> as<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.759> crash<00:04:31.000> rather<00:04:31.240> than<00:04:31.360> a

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
double that as a crash rather than a

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.820 
double that as a crash rather than a
really<00:04:31.720> really<00:04:31.870> short<00:04:32.080> accent<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:32.620> that's<00:04:32.770> a

really really short accent so that's a

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.459 
really really short accent so that's a
bit<00:04:32.979> a<00:04:33.159> bit<00:04:33.490> longer<00:04:33.669> so<00:04:33.970> look<00:04:34.120> guys<00:04:35.050> that's<00:04:35.349> a
