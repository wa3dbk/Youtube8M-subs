station<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.240> talk<00:00:21.480> about<00:00:21.810> what's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
station I'm going to talk about what's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.710 
station I'm going to talk about what's
inside<00:00:23.359> this<00:00:24.359> particular<00:00:24.840> tank<00:00:25.260> which<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
inside this particular tank which is a a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
inside this particular tank which is a a
septic<00:00:27.720> tank<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.340> demonstrate

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
septic tank and I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.440 
septic tank and I'm going to demonstrate
by<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.449> inside<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:32.489> disturbance<00:00:33.149> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
by going inside the disturbance that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.819 
by going inside the disturbance that
rainwater<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.130> system<00:00:35.550> makes<00:00:36.800> undoes<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
rainwater in the system makes undoes the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.369 
rainwater in the system makes undoes the
damage<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> does<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.969> other<00:00:39.090> words<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
damage it does in other words if the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.400 
damage it does in other words if the
guttering<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.570> connected<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> downpipe<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
guttering is connected to a downpipe and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
guttering is connected to a downpipe and
then<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> damn<00:00:44.340> pipe<00:00:44.579> goes<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> foul

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
then the damn pipe goes into the foul

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
then the damn pipe goes into the foul
system<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> foul<00:00:47.760> system<00:00:48.180> obviously

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
system then the foul system obviously

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.319 
system then the foul system obviously
goes<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> septic<00:00:49.770> tank<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.329> therefore

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
goes in the septic tank and therefore

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
goes in the septic tank and therefore
creating<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.610> great<00:00:53.610> big<00:00:53.910> surge<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.430> these

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
creating this great big surge and these

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.119 
creating this great big surge and these
systems<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.149> mainly<00:00:57.449> based<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.590> settlement

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
systems are mainly based on settlement

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.619 
systems are mainly based on settlement
well<00:00:59.969> let<00:01:00.539> me<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:00.899> ready<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:02.210> dressed<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
well let me get ready and dressed and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
well let me get ready and dressed and
then<00:01:04.290> I'll<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.739> inside<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> tank<00:01:05.519> hold<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
then I'll go inside the tank hold on a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.950 
then I'll go inside the tank hold on a
second<00:01:10.460> I'm<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.850> got<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> tank

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
second I'm just got to go in the tank

then going down the phenol system and
then<00:04:23.580> into<00:04:23.850> this<00:04:23.970> tank<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.510> disturb<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:25.050> you

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
then into this tank and disturb it you

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.010 
then into this tank and disturb it you
can<00:04:26.070> Arjun<00:04:26.460> that's<00:04:26.820> hundreds<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.600> hundreds

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
can Arjun that's hundreds and hundreds

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.530 
can Arjun that's hundreds and hundreds
of<00:04:28.110> people<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:29.310> very<00:04:29.610> short<00:04:29.730> period<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.420> time
