 the warren 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.840
 wins because the hands are strongest by mom and in places under the storm 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.729

 for her as as time before if that moment and it's with that same one 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.720
 from quebec why 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.030
 it is very low that we saw only rain in the center and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.930
 percent 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.690
 in fact it's all to his credit and to maureillas 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.159
 people who find themselves this bearing is at ronet justo week 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.679
 musical out of the depression system and that's the key in 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.360
 is more 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.629
 importance years 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.590
 so dead and at the barrier he expects gusts up to 70 kilometers 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.019
 on time by the man it is the sustained winds so it varies between 15 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.409
 and 40 43 km to the rti in Quebec it starts to be a little bit more 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.489
 slow the much less as soon as we move away 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.529
 from the heart of the depression system 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.010
 that evening towards his rage always passed all over the sky in the center and the 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.679
 Gaspé scenes this night al-Qaeda has instead gone from 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.679
 garages moving in the air it calms a little bit dense 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.209
 thomas do not apply it 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.489
 in fact 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.629
 no more palermo should have looked a lot at the beginning of the year 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.140
 and it's not the same with the key 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.790
 listen anyway we stop some portions of Quebec during 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.850
 the next few days different wages too low weapons 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.670
 Friday, Saturday, it's going very well 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.470

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.690
 placebo thank you sunny with a few cloudy passages in the grease of 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.440
 parma 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.069
 if it does not change unscathed 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.419
 in a women's center this date is presently for them the sectors of 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.999
 escoumins not dream of bay-comeau% and the saguenay lac-saint-jean speaks about 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.370
 saint-quentin it is 110 millimeters of water 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.340
 over the years 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.690
 next twelve dates 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.770
 the cstb believe in choosing them 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.870
 but still percent to the street soyer for how long can tell me who 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.910
 is shooting 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.900
 behind this depression in the center 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900
 so tonight this night covered with clearings for the only Quebec 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.119
 cloudy with cloudy 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.119
 30 to 40 percent chance of showers and for many 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.869
 but this particular status the right traders 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.510
 does not do a lot there are very nice sun breakthroughs 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.670
 the darbo 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.380
 east of quebec to the station station under the showers reported late a little 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.369
 boost 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:03.930
 and even latifa parliament has not yet given 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.890
 she and her peers at the beautician green greens is that it's the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.120
 bas-saint-laurent gaspésie and new brunswick were elected from 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.149
 madeleine vionnet 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.059
 a lot of rain in these areas 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.209
 because the low pressure system remains stagnant on alert Friday 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.359
 behind clearance 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.950
 I said one day and so Friday cloud with clears for the sector 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.510
 17 17th of May, Saint-Jean, where in fact there is a day of clouds with 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.969
 scattered showers and nathalie 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:30.390
 but this Quebecese these variables did not know cloud 30 for 5 5 min 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.650
 agree with it paid for many even luck for valls
