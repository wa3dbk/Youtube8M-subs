00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.960
 Hi Rim, I 'm going to introduce you this time about malicious plugins. 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.250
 It is. 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.179
 Now, now go back to the end of the film, and also caused damage to some malicious plug-ins 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.660
 Like 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.830
 I'll show you what I can do with the previous plug and be careful now. 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.820
 In a sense 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.450
 Now you can simply create a plugin once . 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.100
 Once the server malicious plug 2 went in and made a bee. 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.800
 Now we will connect to that server. 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:37.970
 4 server connected. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.970
 Now the attacker will now try to connect to the server. 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.430
 Shijo front ofa you see a connection to the server is now visible 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.430
 Let's just try the new Kigo. 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:57.960
 As you can see, now you can see the honor and the good. 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.960
 For example, give an opy 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.700
 Oh, you see less, and now 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:19.210
 You can break it. You see this missing. 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:25.149
 Now you can shut down the server now and then just do it. 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.679
 Then you can manipulate it to another server computer, even now, do you diverge 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.930
 I can do it. 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:34.490
 For example , I will turn off the next program screen 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.190
 Once every 1 Hats secure line 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.190
 Now, in Notepad now you can see the list 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810
 now 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.939
 MINE note points of view geteupnida now looks huge knowledge 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.220
 Finally, now that I'm strong, I can now blow the computer 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.840
 I have a hard drive now 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.500
 Abu can also say that it is not making booting even in spring 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 I will. 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.580
 Now, when you write this way, 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.580
 It will reboot 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.950
 Yes, the computer is shutting down. 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.950
 Almost the server is off and all is off and it starts rebooting 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.750
 So now I can not find and boot . 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.590
 You can watch the clock 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:36.650
 Now this isnt your computer's hard hadagan few days earlier could get blown to boot 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:42.500
 No, but now we can do it again if we do it again. But to Bukgu 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.760
 This means the video in hope, be extremely wary of malicious plug-ins because the money 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.450
 Posted 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.450
 Thank you
