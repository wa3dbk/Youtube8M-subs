00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.599
 with all its internet benefits 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.760
 also brought a new problem that 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.500
 do with the privacy really 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.180
 We are willing to give our 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.740
 personal information to governments and 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.810
 companies and also to possible 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.269
 criminals to know how to protect themselves 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.180
 text code talk to three hackers 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.580
 Argentineans privacy on the internet 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.590
 to protect yourself is quite complicated 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.350
 for me to understand or have factors that 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.379
 are they depend on voice and factors that 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.649
 are external number one configure the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.420
 browser so that all the 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.309
 data maybe not in all sessions 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.200
 but at least take one as 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.180
 user become aware and do it in 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.899
 periodically delete history 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:51.410
 cookies saved passwords data 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.840
 number 2 avoid sites that are 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.210
 of which you do not suspect let's say when 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.739
 one tries to lower an attempt to lower 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.430
 a license to use a program 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.890
 that would normally be payment that's those 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.050
 are the types of sites that there are 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.490
 that avoiding another type would make sense 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.220
 a lot of common sense but a little bit of 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.290
 distrust nobody gives anything in 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.180
 internet one many times of advertising 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 is that the store they tell you is the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.590
 winner number 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.170
 and won all this money enter here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.580
 good common sense you have to keep 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.450
 all the updates to the day that's 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.400
 another type 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.080
 All products updated this in 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.930
 General implies having valid licenses 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.670
 but good in many products that are 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.990
 free yes it's interesting that the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.150
 users adopt the mentality 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.770
 keep them always those in the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.979
 versions recommended by the manufacturer 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.050
 the safest today is the chrome of 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.050
 Google really put many many 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.990
 in effort in security is the browser 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.119
 I would say the second one is firefox and then 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.800
 everyone else the problem that has 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.860
 google especially on a theme of 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.229
 anonymity is that everything is recorded 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.420
 what it does not do especially if one is 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.580
 logged in a service of the ideal is 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.910
 use google without being connected to any 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.910
 service 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.670
 if you do not want to use google you can use 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.580
 for example the one from microsoft 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.310
 bing is what you have to get a little 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 more importance of my life and after 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.709
 there are other special browsers for 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.450
 that for example duckduckgo youtube by 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.610
 example is a case 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.709
 just that he was talking because he is 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.730
 a Google google service with one 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.379
 look for a video on YouTube 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.269
 locked only in the history of 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.220
 your account if you do not want to be anonymous 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.319
 has to then nobody enters and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.610
 absolutely fix all the videos not 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.099
 he was looking at the ideal is not to avoid 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.519
 log in any in any 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.140
 let's say the service before using it in 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.569
 facebook was also good you can not 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.230
 use without being logged in but ideally 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.510
 it would also be achieved using it and then 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.739
 of open immediately to follow 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.440
 using another part of the internet because 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.300
 facebook can treat everyone let's say 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.650
 not all but many places where one 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.590
 sail can be quiet for 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.720
 facebook if one is logged in I am not 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.100
 a regular user of antivirus but if 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.220
 I had to recommend, I think sometimes 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.460
 one of the most options 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.960
 easier to install and more 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.350
 collaborate with users at the 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.120
 good usability we love a cyber 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.460
 what you do not have to do is achieve 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.500
 no service because there are cyber 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.690
 they have another problem that is that 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.820
 generally one can install it 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.500
 keylogger that is software that one what 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.090
 go to the whole keyboard or it does not matter what 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.520
 sure is the place that one can 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.040
 be using the computer can get 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.250
 to be blocking 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.349
 those for ovens the credentials 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.359
 that one has no way of knowing if one 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.010
 has to achieve a site using the 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.019
 systems that have audio site 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.840
 sure for example do not use the keyboard 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.000
 to login if you do not use keyboards in 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.109
 screen that one like me can not go 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.609
 clicking then it's harder to 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.709
 register let's say is like catching 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.420
 a disease doing let's say you know a 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.189
 keyboard was used by a hundred people is very 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.709
 probably one has a cold one touches 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.500
 and it says sick as you know 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.849
 that before bolt you used william 100 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.139
 people that each had the 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.539
 possibility to install software 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:23.250
 malicious google for free you 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:24.990
 allows you to use your password plus a 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.229
 application that you download to your cell phone 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.100
 so that you have your user you 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.200
 password plus a code that changes 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.330
 it's called a token that 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.460
 change every one second then by 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.030
 example you are connected to a cybercafe and 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.010
 someone is reading the information 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.370
 let's say reading your traffic from 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.290
 your computer up to google and you 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.020
 password will never be the same this 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.910
 it's something that has google and companies 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.980
 are other companies are starting to 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.650
 evaluate and implement it as is the case 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.580
 facebook the case of twitter with 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.249
 Regarding public Wi-Fi, although the 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.679
 information is 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.079
 in itself insecure because it makes public 

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:09.369
 most are not encrypted 

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:11.830
 anyone in the cafe can basically 

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:13.990
 listen to what one is 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.440
 browsing, you can capture that 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.660
 is browsing 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.710
 as long as one navigates a site 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.690
 safe 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.360
 One always uses a secure site 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.640
 example with the candadito even if there is 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.250
 listening can not do anything the ideal 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.840
 is to use the two coffees that use 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.280
 for example, read the password to 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.870
 access the web that is not completely 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.780
 public respects to telephones 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.240
 mobile phones nowadays are so 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.840
 modern that almost apply the same 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.460
 rules that a computer because one 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.110
 you can use almost the services of a pc 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.430
 that in a mobile phone in fact a 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.010
 mobile phone is a bit more secure 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.460
 because you make sure that from that 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.660
 only you have access to them 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.330
 tips use the safe version of the 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.190
 site if we say the site has a 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.200
 special application to access 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.850
 It is generally convenient to use that 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.070
 because finally it's going to have a little more 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.650
 of security than using a browser to 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.450
 then access the site actually is 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.139
 a little safer to use a cell phone that 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.900
 use a 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:14.060
 nowadays I use a computer in my 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.140
 opinion does not mean that you can not 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.720
 attack cell 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.380
 especially cell phones 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.990
 which is of massive use as for example 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.790
 iphone iphone the biggest problem of 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.110
 Android in day are the applications that 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.860
 one gets down applications of any 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:36.660
 side and a very large percentage those 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.750
 applications have malicious software 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.330
 the mail precisely on Android not so much 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.010
 an iphone because the iphone apple 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.920
 has a whole process of security that 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.210
 does not stop him from saying that fernando that 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.860
 one can lower one's eyes from any 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.160
 basically and have the same problem 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.970
 that a pc with the one against whom there is no 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:00.060
 so many antivirus for android then 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:03.220
 I would say that in android always use 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.760
 you always have to use the applications 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:09.340
 to provide you in this case and on iphone 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.920
 the application that the store provides 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.540
 art and this was all for today until the 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.540
 new edition of text code 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.660
