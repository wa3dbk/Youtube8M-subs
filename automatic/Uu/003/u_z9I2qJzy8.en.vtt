and<00:00:34.440> dogs<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.520> kids<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:36.360> soon<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
and dogs as you know kids as soon as the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
and dogs as you know kids as soon as the
boat<00:00:36.899> starts<00:00:36.930> bonding<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.879> also<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.059> like

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
boat starts bonding and also just like

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
boat starts bonding and also just like
an<00:00:39.329> alternate<00:00:39.780> running<00:00:40.379> pattern<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.040> i

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
an alternate running pattern because i

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.860 
an alternate running pattern because i
think<00:00:41.460> i<00:00:41.520> said<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.820> my<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.300> second<00:00:42.660> video

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
think i said in my like second video

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
think i said in my like second video
that<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.379> soon<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.160> i'm<00:00:44.370> starting<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that as soon as i'm starting into the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.299 
that as soon as i'm starting into the
higher<00:00:45.149> rounds<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.469> window<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
higher rounds that little window of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.680 
higher rounds that little window of
opportunity<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.420> when<00:00:48.570> you're

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
opportunity you get from when you're

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.880 
opportunity you get from when you're
just<00:00:48.960> gathering<00:00:49.230> your<00:00:49.350> zombies<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
just gathering your zombies in that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
just gathering your zombies in that
small<00:00:50.129> circle<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> parent

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
small circle it's not really a parent

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100 
small circle it's not really a parent
anymore<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.410> because<00:00:53.539> they're<00:00:54.539> spawning<00:00:54.899> at

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
anymore just because they're spawning at

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
anymore just because they're spawning at
a<00:00:55.140> faster<00:00:55.559> rate<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.730> one

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
a faster rate so it's just like one

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.700 
a faster rate so it's just like one
giant<00:00:57.449> wave<00:00:57.719> instead<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:58.410> like

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
giant wave instead of you know like

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.970 
giant wave instead of you know like
couple<00:00:59.430> smaller<00:00:59.640> waves<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.570> um<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.559> running

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
couple smaller waves so um the running

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
couple smaller waves so um the running
pattern<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> start<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.539> same

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
pattern it's just you start out same

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
pattern it's just you start out same
spot<00:01:04.430> instead<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> actually<00:01:05.880> trying<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> go

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
spot instead of actually trying to go

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.609 
spot instead of actually trying to go
into<00:01:06.510> small<00:01:06.750> circles<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.409> going

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
into small circles you're actually going

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.679 
into small circles you're actually going
to<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.830> our<00:01:08.250> head<00:01:08.760> inside<00:01:09.119> where<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to get our head inside where the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
to get our head inside where the
teleporter<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.490> then<00:01:11.760> you're<00:01:11.909> going

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
teleporter is so and then you're going

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.850 
teleporter is so and then you're going
to<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> stairs<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.530> jump<00:01:13.770> out

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to go up the stairs and then jump out

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.050 
to go up the stairs and then jump out
the<00:01:13.979> window<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> try<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> collect

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the window and then you try to collect

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
the window and then you try to collect
them<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.420> bit<00:01:15.630> no<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.350> little

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
them a little bit no do that little

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.160 
them a little bit no do that little
snake<00:01:16.770> thing<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.630> flutter

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.300 
go and turn it on and then just wait on
the<00:01:28.140> other<00:01:28.259> side<00:01:28.530> till<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.070> come

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the other side till they all come

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
the other side till they all come
towards<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> that's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
towards you and then there it is that's

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890 
towards you and then there it is that's
pretty<00:01:31.650> much<00:01:31.740> how<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.100> use<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> trap<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.509> thing

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
pretty much how you use a trap the thing

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780 
pretty much how you use a trap the thing
about<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.200> trap<00:01:34.439> though<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.920> well<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.579> kind

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
about the trap though is well it's kind

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.999 
about the trap though is well it's kind
of<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.939> good<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> bad<00:01:36.570> trap<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:37.979> thing

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of a good and bad trap the good thing

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.550 
of a good and bad trap the good thing
about<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.490> trap<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.930> recharges

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
about the trap is that it recharges

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
about the trap is that it recharges
really<00:01:40.920> fast<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> bad<00:01:42.210> thing<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
really fast but the bad thing is that it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
really fast but the bad thing is that it
doesn't<00:01:43.020> last<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.500> long<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> other<00:01:44.100> traps

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
doesn't last as long as the other traps

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.219 
doesn't last as long as the other traps
so<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> mean<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.119> kind<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> beneficial<00:01:45.930> kind

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
so I mean it's kind of beneficial kind

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.109 
so I mean it's kind of beneficial kind
of<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:47.130> kind<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> disadvantage<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
of it's kind of a disadvantage but it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.910 
of it's kind of a disadvantage but it's
still<00:01:48.299> pretty<00:01:48.360> good<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> bus<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.259> now<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
still pretty good on the bus and now to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.120 
still pretty good on the bus and now to
get<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> dogs<00:01:51.030> part<00:01:51.360> alright<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.890> dogs

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
get to the dogs part alright so the dogs

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
get to the dogs part alright so the dogs
pretty<00:01:53.460> much<00:01:53.579> spawn<00:01:53.939> after<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> couple<00:01:54.750> rounds

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pretty much spawn after a couple rounds

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
pretty much spawn after a couple rounds
there's<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> spawn<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> very

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
there's going to spawn at the very

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
there's going to spawn at the very
beginning<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.329> every<00:01:57.570> round<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
beginning of every round so what you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.020 
beginning of every round so what you
want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.610> take<00:01:59.790> care<00:01:59.969> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
want to do is you want to take care of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
want to do is you want to take care of
them<00:02:00.270> first<00:02:00.509> before<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.229> zombies<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.340> want

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
them first before the zombies you want

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
them first before the zombies you want
to<00:02:02.610> get<00:02:03.210> rid<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> double<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.049> shot

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to get rid of the double with one shot

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.109 
to get rid of the double with one shot
you're<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.280> likely<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.759> rid<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
you're more likely to get rid of the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.300 
you're more likely to get rid of the
dogs<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> miss<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.799> keep<00:02:07.950> shooting<00:02:08.129> a

dogs if you miss just keep shooting a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.469 
dogs if you miss just keep shooting a
couple<00:02:08.489> more<00:02:08.580> times<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.390> know

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
couple more times you know you know

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.940 
couple more times you know you know
their<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.780> shot<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:10.140> kill<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.709> get<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
their one shot one kill if you get the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.160 
their one shot one kill if you get the
show

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
show

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.199 
show
but<00:02:11.260> uh<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:12.250> want<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.550> get<00:02:12.670> rid<00:02:12.819> of<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.970> dogs

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
to shoot and then you'll probably shoot

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.220

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
of times and I don't know it's just I

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.699 
of times and I don't know it's just I
think<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.209> was<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.359> dogs<00:04:10.569> they<00:04:11.380> just<00:04:11.560> like

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
jumped in front of my face and just

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.879 
jumped in front of my face and just
ruined<00:04:13.600> everything<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.260> I'd<00:04:14.440> probably<00:04:14.620> have

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
ruined everything and I'd probably have
