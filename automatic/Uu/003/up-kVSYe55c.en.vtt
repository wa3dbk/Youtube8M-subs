hello<00:00:08.849> everyone<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.300> welcome<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:11.960> you<00:00:12.960> guys

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
hello everyone and welcome to you guys

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.210 
hello everyone and welcome to you guys
son<00:00:14.160> box<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.690> can't<00:00:16.650> take<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.949> away<00:00:17.070> from

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
son box and I can't take this away from

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.320 
son box and I can't take this away from
enough<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:18.240> right<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:20.330> basically

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
enough there we go right so basically

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.160 
enough there we go right so basically
well<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:24.800> game<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.449> is<00:00:27.449> where

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
well this is is a game that is where

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.910 
well this is is a game that is where
it's<00:00:28.289> all<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.529> scientific<00:00:28.920> game<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.599> I

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
it's all the scientific game and I

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.190 
it's all the scientific game and I
suppose<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.040> could<00:00:32.219> say<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.450> sandbox

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
suppose you could say that it's sandbox

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.110 
suppose you could say that it's sandbox
you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:36.710> when<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.770> want

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
you can do what you want when you want

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.569 
you can do what you want when you want
so<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> moment<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.399> 2010<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:43.350> goes

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
so at the moment it's 2010 and it goes

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.430 
so at the moment it's 2010 and it goes
well<00:00:44.579> probably<00:00:44.910> about<00:00:45.239> let's<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> look

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
well probably about let's have a look

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.500 
well probably about let's have a look
it's<00:00:48.649> 14<00:00:49.649> days<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> second<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.930> quite<00:00:52.110> fast

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
it's 14 days a second so it's quite fast

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.340 
it's 14 days a second so it's quite fast
so<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:54.989> shows<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.440> solar<00:00:55.649> system<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
so it just shows our solar system and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.860 
so it just shows our solar system and
was<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.890> doesn't<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> capacity<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.539> would

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
was it doesn't have the capacity I would

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
was it doesn't have the capacity I would
solver<00:01:01.559> let's<00:01:01.949> say<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:03.180> know<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.719> out

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
solver let's say you know you can go out

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.050 
solver let's say you know you can go out
into<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.110> galaxy<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.949> want<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
into the galaxy if you want to do you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
into the galaxy if you want to do you
have<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> load<00:01:06.510> sort<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> simulation<00:01:07.530> for

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
have to load sort of a simulation for

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.580 
have to load sort of a simulation for
that<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.700> pretty<00:01:09.479> fascinating<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that but this is pretty fascinating so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
that but this is pretty fascinating so
you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.890> change<00:01:11.159> anything<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.180> around

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you can change anything you want around

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.219 
you can change anything you want around
like<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> bar<00:01:13.350> point<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> Venus<00:01:15.229> if

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
like a bar point so if we go to Venus if

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.969 
like a bar point so if we go to Venus if
I<00:01:16.530> wanted<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.540> mean<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.830> can

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
I wanted to I don't know I mean we can

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
I wanted to I don't know I mean we can
pause<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.060> never<00:01:21.180> look<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.509> Venus

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
pause this and can never look at Venus

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.590 
pause this and can never look at Venus
you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.170> zoom<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.040> real<00:01:23.640> close<00:01:24.049> there<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.140> go

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
you know zoom up real close there we go

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.770 
you know zoom up real close there we go
so<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> moment<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.700> 0.82<00:01:29.700> earth<00:01:30.150> lots<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so at the moment it's 0.82 earth lots of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.289 
so at the moment it's 0.82 earth lots of
us<00:01:31.970> diameter<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.180> quite<00:01:33.780> spoon<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.700> it's<00:01:35.700> NC

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
us diameter is quite spoon and it's NC

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
us diameter is quite spoon and it's NC
is<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.530> no<00:01:37.740> idea<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.310> doing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
is that I I have no idea what I'm doing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.330 
is that I I have no idea what I'm doing
here<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:39.090> honest<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.979> this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.100> pretty

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
here be honest because this is pretty

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.710 
here be honest because this is pretty
cool<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.420> astronomy<00:01:43.790> genius<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.149> can

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
cool but I on the astronomy genius I can

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.120 
cool but I on the astronomy genius I can
even<00:01:45.960> change<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> name<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.950> new<00:01:49.100> trololol<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
even change the name to a new trololol a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.840 
even change the name to a new trololol a
little<00:01:50.520> long<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.860> busting<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.520> Venus

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
little long so that busting your Venus

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.280 
little long so that busting your Venus
now<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:55.229> change<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.399> earth<00:01:57.290> why

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
now I can change this to on earth why

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.950 
now I can change this to on earth why
not<00:01:58.469> why<00:01:58.740> not<00:01:58.770> wanna<00:01:59.729> there<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:00.719> through

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
not why not wanna there we go through

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.740 
not why not wanna there we go through
this<00:02:01.219> now<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.880> my

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this now this will have my

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.570 
this now this will have my
effects<00:02:04.260> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.860> entire<00:02:05.160> solar<00:02:05.490> system

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
effects on the entire solar system

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.150 
effects on the entire solar system
because<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.050> got<00:02:07.230> one<00:02:07.560> sort<00:02:07.980> of<00:02:08.009> little

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
because because I got one sort of little

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.720 
because because I got one sort of little
change<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:08.789> made<00:02:09.619> not<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> name<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
change are made not the name but the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.280 
change are made not the name but the
actual<00:02:11.970> thing<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:12.720> start<00:02:12.990> orbiting

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
actual thing it will start orbiting

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.810 
actual thing it will start orbiting
really<00:02:14.250> weird<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:17.190> all<00:02:17.430> orbiting

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
really weird so it's it's all orbiting

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.480 
really weird so it's it's all orbiting
the<00:02:18.090> same<00:02:18.300> way<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.510> earth<00:02:18.780> would<00:02:19.520> incense

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
the same way as earth would incense

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.860 
the same way as earth would incense
which<00:02:23.490> means<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.150> changed<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> little

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
which means that it's changed a little

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.390 
which means that it's changed a little
bit<00:02:25.020> now<00:02:26.930> I'm<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.230> excited<00:02:28.590> because<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
bit now I'm really excited because the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.490 
bit now I'm really excited because the
thing<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.060> add<00:02:30.500> practically

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
thing is you can add practically

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.340 
thing is you can add practically
anything<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.100> if<00:02:32.250> i<00:02:32.340> wanted<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> i<00:02:33.090> could<00:02:33.840> add

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
anything so if i wanted to i could add

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.610 
anything so if i wanted to i could add
largest<00:02:35.190> star<00:02:35.400> system<00:02:36.060> which<00:02:36.239> i<00:02:36.390> happen<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
largest star system which i happen to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.690 
largest star system which i happen to
know<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:41.000> Canis<00:02:42.000> Major<00:02:42.450> us<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.700> it

discovered and as you can see it dwarfed
the<00:04:32.740> entire<00:04:33.130> solar<00:04:33.400> system<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:34.120> some<00:04:34.630> little

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
the entire solar system so some little

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:43.800 
the entire solar system so some little
go<00:04:35.140> this<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:36.490> be<00:04:36.580> fun<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:40.170> instantly<00:04:42.570> chaos<00:04:43.570> is

right<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:10.880> even<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.570> sun's<00:05:11.840> moving

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
right so even the sun's moving

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.920 
right so even the sun's moving
everything<00:05:13.460> is<00:05:13.820> going<00:05:14.390> that<00:05:14.750> direction

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
everything is going that direction

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.760 
everything is going that direction
because<00:05:17.350> your<00:05:18.350> anus<00:05:18.620> humerus<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.220> orbiting<00:05:20.770> in

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
because your anus humerus is orbiting in

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.520 
because your anus humerus is orbiting in
fact<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.310> on<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.460> collision<00:05:22.670> course<00:05:23.320> um<00:05:24.340> oh<00:05:26.530> dear

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
fact is on a collision course um oh dear

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.100 
fact is on a collision course um oh dear
yes<00:05:28.100> I<00:05:28.370> believe<00:05:28.580> us<00:05:29.120> has<00:05:29.330> just<00:05:29.510> been<00:05:29.660> destroyed

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
yes I believe us has just been destroyed

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.700 
yes I believe us has just been destroyed
and<00:05:30.940> Neptune<00:05:31.940> on<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.360> other<00:05:32.510> hand<00:05:32.600> is<00:05:32.900> on<00:05:33.350> a

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
and Neptune on the other hand is on a

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.350 
and Neptune on the other hand is on a
collision<00:05:33.980> course<00:05:34.160> as<00:05:34.490> well<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:35.320> it's<00:05:36.320> slowly

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
collision course as well and it's slowly

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.350 
collision course as well and it's slowly
creating<00:05:38.360> velocity<00:05:38.870> towards<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.530> star<00:05:40.360> now

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
creating velocity towards the star now

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.220 
creating velocity towards the star now
you<00:05:41.420> may<00:05:41.720> think<00:05:41.990> oh<00:05:42.320> this<00:05:42.710> is<00:05:42.980> so<00:05:43.190> no<00:05:43.520> oh<00:05:44.230> well

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
i mean i can add a entice solar system

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.030 
i mean i can add a entice solar system
formed<00:05:58.760> to<00:05:59.320> so<00:06:00.320> if<00:06:00.410> i<00:06:00.500> wanted<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:00.890> add<00:06:01.040> I'd<00:06:01.370> no<00:06:01.790> I

orbiting the Sun but I screwed anyway so
this<00:06:23.520> this<00:06:23.789> this<00:06:24.180> earth<00:06:24.449> is<00:06:24.660> going<00:06:24.900> like<00:06:25.050> this

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
this this this earth is going like this

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.570 
this this this earth is going like this
and<00:06:26.690> it's<00:06:27.690> all<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.930> twirly<00:06:28.380> sheep<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:29.009> other

and it's all the twirly sheep and other
oh<00:06:29.910> my<00:06:30.270> god<00:06:30.539> temperature<00:06:31.289> is<00:06:32.990> 1000<00:06:34.490> 1000

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
oh my god temperature is 1000 1000

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.689 
oh my god temperature is 1000 1000
Celsius<00:06:35.880> so<00:06:36.169> you<00:06:37.169> know<00:06:37.289> you<00:06:37.650> call<00:06:37.889> under<00:06:38.430> 40

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
Celsius so you know you call under 40

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.279 
Celsius so you know you call under 40
degrees<00:06:38.970> a<00:06:39.000> hot<00:06:39.240> day<00:06:39.509> the<00:06:40.259> film<00:06:40.849> this<00:06:41.849> is<00:06:42.000> like

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
degrees a hot day the film this is like

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.020 
degrees a hot day the film this is like
so<00:06:43.289> also<00:06:43.949> I<00:06:44.009> can<00:06:44.160> show<00:06:44.310> you<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.520> mass<00:06:44.789> of<00:06:44.820> the

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
so also I can show you the mass of the

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.580 
so also I can show you the mass of the
earth<00:06:45.240> so<00:06:45.949> if<00:06:46.949> I<00:06:47.130> want<00:06:47.310> to<00:06:47.460> I<00:06:48.650> kilogram<00:06:49.650> yeah

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
earth so if I want to I kilogram yeah

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.490 
earth so if I want to I kilogram yeah
and<00:06:53.270> yeah<00:06:54.270> you<00:06:54.330> can<00:06:54.599> see<00:06:54.750> that<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:54.990> earth<00:06:55.289> is

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
and yeah you can see that the earth is

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.279 
and yeah you can see that the earth is
practically<00:06:56.340> burn<00:06:56.639> a<00:06:57.030> little<00:06:57.690> bit<00:06:57.900> call<00:06:58.080> it

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
practically burn a little bit call it

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.070 
practically burn a little bit call it
does<00:06:58.440> not<00:06:58.620> solve<00:06:59.479> but<00:07:00.479> the<00:07:00.599> earth<00:07:00.720> is<00:07:00.870> just

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
does not solve but the earth is just

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.370 
does not solve but the earth is just
roasted<00:07:01.560> it's<00:07:02.130> nothing<00:07:02.460> it's<00:07:02.810> so<00:07:03.810> awful<00:07:04.349> and

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
roasted it's nothing it's so awful and

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.860 
roasted it's nothing it's so awful and
might<00:07:04.710> as<00:07:04.770> well<00:07:04.919> just<00:07:05.099> have<00:07:05.250> some<00:07:05.400> fun<00:07:05.610> and<00:07:05.909> do

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
and there we go the earth is now a

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.780 
and there we go the earth is now a
massive<00:07:16.670> thing<00:07:18.410> it's<00:07:19.410> a<00:07:19.830> thing<00:07:20.190> as<00:07:20.310> big<00:07:20.700> as

Jupiter something either way it's made a

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.000 
Jupiter something either way it's made a
collision<00:07:25.680> course<00:07:25.710> and<00:07:26.420> oh<00:07:27.420> dear<00:07:28.020> everything

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
collision course and oh dear everything

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.040 
collision course and oh dear everything
has<00:07:29.130> gone<00:07:29.280> into<00:07:29.460> their<00:07:29.760> entire<00:07:30.660> solar<00:07:30.960> system

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
has gone into their entire solar system

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.270 
has gone into their entire solar system
has<00:07:31.410> been<00:07:31.560> sucked<00:07:32.070> into<00:07:32.280> this<00:07:33.060> star<00:07:34.280> massive
