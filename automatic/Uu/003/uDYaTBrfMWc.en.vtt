playing some switch and destroy on

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.370 
playing some switch and destroy on
ambush<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.950> got<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.550> shotgun<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
ambush and got the shotgun and for a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.170 
ambush and got the shotgun and for a
second<00:01:58.650> I<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:58.830> wondering<00:01:59.160> why<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.370> shotguns

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
second I was wondering why the shotguns

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.700 
second I was wondering why the shotguns
always<00:02:00.480> have<00:02:00.600> 12<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> name<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.650> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
always have 12 in the name and I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.860 
always have 12 in the name and I
remembered<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.250> was<00:02:02.370> 12-gauge<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.690> guess

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
remembered it was 12-gauge and I guess

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.740 
remembered it was 12-gauge and I guess
that's<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.700> bullet<00:02:06.000> thingy<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.450> shoot

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that's the the bullet thingy they shoot

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380 
that's the the bullet thingy they shoot
but<00:02:07.050> when<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.230> said<00:02:07.470> gauge<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.819> thinking<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
but when I said gauge I was thinking of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140 
but when I said gauge I was thinking of
the<00:02:09.629> things<00:02:10.129> skater<00:02:11.129> kids<00:02:11.430> put<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.670> their<00:02:11.730> ears

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the things skater kids put in their ears

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.020 
the things skater kids put in their ears
I<00:02:12.480> also<00:02:13.470> got<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.890> desert<00:02:14.220> eagle<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:14.700> today

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
I also got the desert eagle here today

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
I also got the desert eagle here today
and<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.569> deagle<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.140> probably<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.830> best

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and the deagle is probably the best

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.369 
and the deagle is probably the best
pistol<00:02:17.220> ever<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:18.000> can't<00:02:18.599> think<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.080> any<00:02:19.319> other

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
pistol ever I can't think of any other

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.860 
pistol ever I can't think of any other
pistol<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.099> beats<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.550> out<00:02:20.790> classes<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.510> I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
pistol that beats it out classes it I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.320 
pistol that beats it out classes it I
put<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> sniper<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.310> 40<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> greatest<00:02:24.150> sniper

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
put a sniper and 40 the greatest sniper

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.199 
put a sniper and 40 the greatest sniper
of<00:02:24.599> all<00:02:24.720> time<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.140> know<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.760> 40<00:02:26.760> deagle

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
of all time you know and 40 deagle

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.330 
of all time you know and 40 deagle
collapse

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
collapse

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.460 
collapse
so<00:02:28.459> we<00:02:28.550> reckoned<00:02:28.910> with<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.840> pick<00:02:30.050> up<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.319> guy

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
so we reckoned with as I pick up the guy

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.040 
so we reckoned with as I pick up the guy
for<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.830> first<00:02:31.069> win<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.849> first<00:02:32.180> round<00:02:32.599> and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
for the first win of the first round and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.890 
for the first win of the first round and
look<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.590> stupid<00:02:34.069> five<00:02:34.610> match<00:02:34.940> bonus

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
sure people can still do all the 10th

prestige<00:03:55.640> lobbies<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.569> stuff<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.170> mean<00:03:58.090> called

prestige lobbies and stuff I mean called

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.849 
prestige lobbies and stuff I mean called
it<00:03:59.299> before<00:03:59.690> they<00:03:59.989> probably<00:04:00.260> don't<00:04:00.440> care<00:04:00.590> much

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
it before they probably don't care much

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.080 
it before they probably don't care much
about<00:04:00.889> it<00:04:01.280> anymore

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
about it anymore

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.430 
about it anymore
I'll<00:04:02.540> probably<00:04:02.750> end<00:04:02.930> up<00:04:03.049> shutting<00:04:03.290> the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
I'll probably end up shutting the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.650 
I'll probably end up shutting the
server's<00:04:03.889> off<00:04:04.040> well<00:04:04.370> no<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:04.700> probably<00:04:05.120> won't<00:04:05.389> I

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
server's off well no I probably won't I

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.210 
server's off well no I probably won't I
was<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.079> thinking<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.889> know<00:04:06.920> how<00:04:07.100> they

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
was just thinking like you know how they

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.610 
was just thinking like you know how they
showed<00:04:07.400> off<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.670> halo<00:04:07.940> 2<00:04:08.120> servers<00:04:08.450> cuz<00:04:08.959> of

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
showed off the halo 2 servers cuz of

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.150 
showed off the halo 2 servers cuz of
reach<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.639> was<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.760> normal<00:04:10.970> Xbox<00:04:11.540> game<00:04:12.160> so

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
reach but that was a normal Xbox game so

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.069 
reach but that was a normal Xbox game so
god<00:04:13.340> for<00:04:13.579> probably<00:04:13.880> has<00:04:14.030> some<00:04:14.239> life<00:04:14.810> in<00:04:15.019> it

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
god for probably has some life in it

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.039 
god for probably has some life in it
servers<00:04:15.709> for<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.489> while<00:04:16.669> longer<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.930> know<00:04:18.019> I

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
servers for a while longer you know I

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.659 
servers for a while longer you know I
wonder<00:04:18.320> if<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.470> server's<00:04:18.950> like<00:04:19.160> an<00:04:19.280> actual

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
wonder if the server's like an actual

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.729 
wonder if the server's like an actual
machine<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:20.299> just<00:04:20.510> says<00:04:20.720> like<00:04:20.989> at<00:04:21.200> Microsoft

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
machine that just says like at Microsoft

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.850 
machine that just says like at Microsoft
Chloe<00:04:22.340> before<00:04:22.610> server<00:04:23.240> do<00:04:23.510> not<00:04:23.690> turn<00:04:23.930> off<00:04:24.080> or<00:04:24.500> I

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
Chloe before server do not turn off or I

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.770 
Chloe before server do not turn off or I
don't<00:04:25.460> even<00:04:25.729> know<00:04:25.880> any<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.240> stuff

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
don't even know any of that stuff

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.560 
don't even know any of that stuff
but<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.590> know<00:04:27.740> how<00:04:27.920> to<00:04:27.980> do<00:04:28.190> people<00:04:28.490> with<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:29.330> good

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
but I know how to do people with a good

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.290 
but I know how to do people with a good
connection<00:04:30.460> if<00:04:31.460> you're<00:04:31.700> on<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.820> bad<00:04:31.970> connection

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
connection if you're on a bad connection

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.320 
connection if you're on a bad connection
probably<00:04:32.810> USP<00:04:33.170> is<00:04:33.200> better<00:04:33.470> but<00:04:33.770> if<00:04:34.090> if<00:04:35.090> you're

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
probably USP is better but if if you're

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.270 
probably USP is better but if if you're
rocking<00:04:35.720> three<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.200> four<00:04:36.410> bar<00:04:36.620> dusted<00:04:36.980> eagle

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
rocking three to four bar dusted eagle

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.310 
rocking three to four bar dusted eagle
is<00:04:37.550> all<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.150> way<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.810> this<00:04:39.020> thing<00:04:39.200> is

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
is all the way and this thing is

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.159 
is all the way and this thing is
ridiculous<00:04:39.980> power<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:41.600> modern<00:04:41.870> warfare<00:04:41.990> 2

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
ridiculous power and modern warfare 2

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.200 
ridiculous power and modern warfare 2
they<00:04:42.530> gave<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.889> poop<00:04:43.100> low<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.340> recoil<00:04:43.820> and

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
they gave it a poop low to recoil and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.240 
they gave it a poop low to recoil and
it's<00:04:44.510> actually<00:04:44.810> weaker<00:04:45.139> than<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.440> Magnum<00:04:45.889> so

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
it's actually weaker than the Magnum so

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.030 
it's actually weaker than the Magnum so
just<00:04:46.520> use<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.760> Magnum<00:04:47.260> when<00:04:48.260> this<00:04:48.440> game<00:04:48.650> where

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
just use the Magnum when this game where

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.330 
just use the Magnum when this game where
it<00:04:49.250> truly<00:04:49.490> shines<00:04:49.910> use<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.450> all<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.690> way<00:04:50.840> I

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
it truly shines use it all the way I

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.200 
it truly shines use it all the way I
wonder<00:04:52.340> if<00:04:52.400> it's<00:04:52.550> good<00:04:52.669> in<00:04:52.790> Counter<00:04:53.180> Strike

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210
