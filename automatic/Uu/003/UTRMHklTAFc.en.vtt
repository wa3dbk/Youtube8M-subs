00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.660
 we are all here in a new video of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.820
 gta 5 and this one to bring a stereo that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.070
 is in gt5 mob story but for the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.949
 new generation of consoles and it's about 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.359
 to go picking peyote for all 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.850
 saints and is comes to be the same as 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.980
 when we collect the parts of the car 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 the yen is worth but without it seems to me that 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 When you gather all you have nothing, you do not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.170
 I know but good what makes every time 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 that you take a peyote worth is a 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.960
 hallucinogen and what it does is that you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.309
 you turn an animal is worth in this case 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.380
 in this which exists here of the mount 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 chile here is here next it's worth it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 you compete is a bird I have not tried 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.850
 it's still okay I think there are 27 all over the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 he tried it I've seen it on youtube 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.680
 so then I'm going to try to see who 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.610
 I become because they say it is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 random you become once and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 location you become a bird 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.640

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.329

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.740
