00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
I will say that there was some of that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.359 
I will say that there was some of that
in<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.430> movie<00:01:29.970> some<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.450> imagery<00:01:30.810> was

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
in this movie some of the imagery was

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.020

very<00:01:32.369> intense<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.509> scary<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
very intense and scary because it is a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.620 
very intense and scary because it is a

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
purpose because the ending is so

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.219 
purpose because the ending is so
