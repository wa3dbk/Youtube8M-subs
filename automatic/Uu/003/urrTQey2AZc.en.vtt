 Hi everyone, this time using love fan backs for iphone 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:17.440
 Introduce how to support and exchange icons 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:25.050
 This is the way, but we are proceeding on the assumption that the ios 6 jailbreak environment 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.050
 You can change the icon even if you are not jailbreaking until ios 5 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:34.660
 The image may be picked up, but in the case of the terminal of Retina Display 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:40.600
 Please make it a 114 monkey 114 monkey 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:45.130
 This time, try to make the turtle head If you're using pixelmator 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:49.480
 Please save in png format 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.750
 Please open love fan backs if you can replace images 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.760
 Apps such as Tomorrow are among the user upgrades 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 Double-click the app you want to support 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:06.850
 Icon is in the folder of application name up 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:13.690
 Please select the thumbnail of the icon that you think the thumbnail will come out of the icon 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:17.480
 The name is such a name in the case of Retina Display Other application name love dog png 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.870
 There is also what is written and which is the icon of Retina etc. 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.220
 You might want to if your do not know try to open 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:29.500
 You may delete the original image, but for now 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:35.730
 I will keep it renamed and not referenced 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.730
 Change the name of the image to be replaced and press Copy from the curtain 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.960
 After this, if you are in jailbreak, sbs and then respring from 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.960
 Please adapt 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:55.880
 If you are ambitious, return your language environment to another country, as with Respring. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.880
 Should be able to adapt 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.300
