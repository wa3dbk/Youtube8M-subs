00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.040
 to be well equipped follow the tests 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.600
 of your favorite gear with free rade 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.300
 coop point attitude what it is about 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.190
 surf sports on the internet hello 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.440
 Cyril for freeride live tv 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 arÃªches of Beaufort is too spend 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 on the river holy so my two 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.539
 news on the river is a ski that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 have led in the range with a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 new decor then not will mix its 176 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.189
 in river it's easy skiing for everything 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 the world that wants to manage is for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.790
 someone who wants a ski freeride nose 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.020
 with a short radius that does like more 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.980
 along the track for me it's a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.600
 hazard 60 40 to 70 years roughly speaking it's up to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 to ski with which we will need the radius 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.680
 short we shot very easily without 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.590
 force that's what is not very 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 rigid rock and roll flexibility and that's 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.700
 a service that really manages playful 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
 here it is a ski even someone I will go 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.789
 who lacks some technical baggage he 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.190
 will manage to keep it very 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.719
 easily without forcing it's not this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.800
 that they ask for wallace thighs and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.280
 for someone who does not have what is 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.020
 not too demanding which is not tiring 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.430
 which goes well after when we will start 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.110
 to go back a bit in you say if we want 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.119
 to draw a little inside 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.009
 the limit one must not hesitate to the 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.560
 watch a little bit there 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.570
 not hesitate to take it in the hut 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.330
 684 compared when we go to see registered a 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.950
 little bit more 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.150
 someone who will rely more on the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.250
 big curve to go small at 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.270
 power who certainly have if you have this 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.860
 who is around the waist 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.810
 it's very very good 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.430
 stickers a good versatility is 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.080
 really short radius on the track this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.790
 who had precipitated a halo 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.240
 rivers it's true that in the range 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.140
 scott 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.700
 today what to understand 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.040
 that he did what happened 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.640
 we're going to be on bata widths at 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.290
 his relatives 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.430
 and it's true that these inscriptions are 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.810
 a little bit in competition with the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.700
 range I think that was doing what is 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.920
 still a little more peach more 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.080
 rigid 1 worry about ya as more of 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.340
 stiffness more holding the river that goes 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.740
 to be a more fun ski easier 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.090
 with a new type lower so voila 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.500
 everything will depend a little bit too much 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.540
 but if we are looking for maximum performance 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.490
 known to go on a kid who are looking for 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.619
 the side a little easier on 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.540
 patients to rivers and after that it's also 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.280
 important of his own youn and the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.280
 rebirth is much more accessible
