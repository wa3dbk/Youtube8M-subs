00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello friends i am javi mix and in this 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.440
 opportunity to present you this 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.140
 excellent driver invention x 8 mm and 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.140
 of this presentation this review this 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.820
 review of this driver is with everything 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.990
 the love then for the people that I 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.490
 Follow through social networks 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.220
 special for my friends 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.740
 Ecuadorians in Juan Carlos and 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.659
 giovan de ibarra ecuador businessmen 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.220
 Colombians who had requested that 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:32.329
 they sent me this device so that 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.840
 work and to do the 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.730
 review to this driver and to ask 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.230
 the good minister in relative stories 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.470
 can say that it is an excellent device 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.230
 I would rate it from entering like this from 1 to 10 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.230
 I would rate it with a functional 8 two 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.350
 Little things there because I do not like them 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.630
 It seems that they take away some of 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.180
 functionality but in general then 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.930
 it's an excellent device because apart from 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.750
 be the economic one is compact 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.290
 has worked with virtual digite tractor 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.360
 cerrato apart from being a minister 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.210
 digital or controller that can only 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.070
 connect two disconnect devices 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.490
 to consider is in a way that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.090
 it becomes a a mixer 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.110
 analogous that you can connect him / her 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.260
 table and it also has its two 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.630
 control microphone inputs and inputs 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.970
 of bass and brightness the audio quality 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.729
 it is well although it is not the best because 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.430
 it works 16 bits 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.990
 I've mapped it mapping is the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.090
 personalization of the device 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.270
 mapping driver so that in this 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.030
 opportunity for me to work from this 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.560
 way just as for anyone has 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.660
 parents tele and under half shined with 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.180
 a mat made in rubber 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.670
 totally with the potentiometers the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.130
 look strong we have here what is the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.090
 extensive that the sampler has assigned 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.710
 8 7 6 5 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.710
 we have also made 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.269
 the change looks that I have assigned the 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.760
 filter we have the parameters of the effect 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.060
 the volume of the sampler where we change 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.590
 in the effective to anoint the flyer in 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.569
 order and have a plan that sting what 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.700
 want to put can not be assigned to 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.030
 through this key that is assigned 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.319
 by default and this is where we change it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.470
 the size of what was attached 4 to 2 or 4 6 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:41.150
 to 8 the excellent latency the answer 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.360
 perfect and has strict channels 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.760
 how I told them about their processes 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.569
 losses in the key to generate light 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.450
 to do it in a way we can assign 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.879
 the photo and motorcycle extras with an answer 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.030
 to a very accurate excellent sensitivity 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.280
 has a very good sound card the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.610
 Low and medium low bass gain 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.549
 All channels have a switch for 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.430
 which to listen to the hearing aids 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:13.360
 the knobs are rubber removed 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.820
 an easy to lend to dark environments 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.290
 and we could talk about the outputs 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.580
 exits at this time we are going to 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.210
 tell him the back 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.220
 has two outputs 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.710
 rca 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.090
 and the connectors balanced in addition 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.090
 the extra output that is the put 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.060
 and we have this cross to see what it is 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.950
 changeable we can change the moment 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.430
 that has noise and can be dismantled 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.110
 perfectly 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.650
 the silent on and off 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.170
 the plus two points against this 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.310
 controller would be that necessarily 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.770
 you must connect it to the current 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.230
 electric has an adapter 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.120
 current we find that connected to the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.520
 current account that is necessary without 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.630
 be affected because your machine does not 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.600
 it works and another one of the issues is that 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.330
 the sound the sound quality despite 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.330
 of being good is not the best work at 16 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.130
 bits that we could improve it with 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.989
 our songs and we have in our 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.470
 computer computers we have a 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.419
 the songs in a good resolution of 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.790
 sound either language or an mp3 not so 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.280
 compressed we would work excellent with 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.080
 this driver comes back another thing that I 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.840
 forgot to highlight 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.629
 the nets the lighting has a 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.169
 elektra system visualize the level 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.060
 of output where the volume and level of 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.580
 output of the song we can observe 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.330
 here as it is rising going up going down 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.370
 and we can look at the monuments and then 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.189
 besides the lighting that is important 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.849
 for when we have dark places 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:04.090
 let's look a little bit without light to 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.510
 that we can observe well what is 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.810
 and it ends very well that there will be a 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.419
 nice presentation and have a nice 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.430
 presentation I do not put a good device and 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.460
 it works as we are leaving it in 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.560
 this moment works with virtual dj and 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.050
 this virtual way I said with which 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.479
 this driver is working 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.980
 there we are observing very well with the 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:34.300
 ritual of good apparatus 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.460
 and there we see that it is working 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.940
 effectively then my recommendation 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:45.170
 is that they can very well buy it either 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:51.500
 indicate and amateur or the professional dj 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:53.090
 You can also do that, of course, in 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.370
 General meets all needs 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.700
 basic for a good a good rumba 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.260
 for a good day is more then 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.410
 thank you all for the 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.470
 attention given until this review 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.960
 sterbik only that can also 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.610
 leave them in the description of the video the 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.530
 description made by the manufacturer of 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.530
 apparatus for you to observe it 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.360
 and thank you for your attention 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.580
 who hesitated 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.830
 your mind
