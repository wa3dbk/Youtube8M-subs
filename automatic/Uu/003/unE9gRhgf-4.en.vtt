00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.080
 Hello everybody, probably every driver 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.800
 whose car's manual box 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.200
 gears 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 Sooner or later may be in such 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.779
 unpleasant situation when 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.850
 clutch cable breaks well if someone does not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.309
 knows how to get out of this situation, the 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.420
 risks spending a lot of time or 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.239
 money or both that and that I already in such 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.940
 the situation turned out several times in 12 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.230
 years and now I solve this problem 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.160
 in just 10 minutes 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.870
 Today I want to share my experience and 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.950
 show a couple of ways how you can 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.850
 to repair 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.640
 cable clutch in the field after 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.600
 second purchase of the cable I decided that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.219
 repair process somehow we need to cheapen 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.070
 if we have enough length left 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.060
 the cable is for us to repair only 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 require a standard standard terminal strip 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.160
 if the cable is already short then accordingly 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 will need to still buy a cable I bought on 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.400
 flea market a piece of high-quality cable rope 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.280
 probably still times scoop divided it into 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.920
 several pieces of appropriate length 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 Well, in the trunk I always have a couple 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.290
 pieces 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:37.979
 lying just in case well and here we are 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.260
 got such clips here is very useful 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.920
 the thing therefore I recommend to everyone the place 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.799
 occupy 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 but you never know where it can be useful except 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.880
 cable repair in my case in order 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.979
 to clamp it freely go in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.729
 automatic cable tension controller 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.880
 clutch two corners need to be removed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.880
 file so that all edges are littered 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.119
 for the second way to repair us 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.760
 you will need a piece of pipe and a regular washer 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.060
 pulling the cable through the tube then 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:24.040
 through the puck and return the cable back 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:26.430
 Into the tube, the more tightly the cable will be 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.349
 it will be safer to enter the phone 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.080
 connection well and accordingly 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.600
 it will be harder there 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.620
 to get the cable that I have on 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.739
 grip twice thicker than this 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.790
 so itâ€™s not easy to start with his hands 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.790
 better to use pliers 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.670
 The first version of the attachment to me after all 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.959
 like more because you can quickly 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.769
 and easier 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.870
 adjust the length of the cable in order 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.750
 to make this connection even more 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.470
 reliable, you can try to return the cable 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.620
 back to the clamp if this works out 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.569
 connection will be as reliable as possible 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.060
 he will not break out 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.880
 will not slip reliably 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 the puck is fixed in this case 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.500
 principle is no longer necessary to insert 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.769
 without even tightening the screw and screwdriver 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.849
 break this connection already 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.849
 will not succeed 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.189
 even if the screws completely unscrew everything 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.849
 anyway you need to make a lot of effort 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.959
 to break 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.959
 this connection 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.490
 Here, in principle, this repair is finished 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.430
 as you can see we saved a lot of time and 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.650
 no financial costs but on my 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.889
 This is all thank you for your attention and to the new 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.889
 meeting
