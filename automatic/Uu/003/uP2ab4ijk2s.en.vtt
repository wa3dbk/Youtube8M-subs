 how the knee reacts under load 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 the body plays with the psyche 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.870

 minimum but minimum you can 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.280
 also do a lot and we have that 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.880

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.160
 So the system just fits easily 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.130

 Jointness with special treatments 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.230
 the last years have been shown 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.030
 that just the top people especially the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.860
 with several disciplines that simply the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.049
 have a very high demand 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.600
 to organize somewhat individually 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.519
 some even completely outside of the team 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.769
 I do not want that but some 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.540
 at least partially and I think so 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.190
 that it is a very good solution for me 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.780
 to still do it in a team but still 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.269
 very individualized and fall in the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.090

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.780
 enjoy early summer 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.180
 everything could be so nice there 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.310
 can not create elevations with typical 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.140
 this rose for the Austrian 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.520
 ladies team around anna fenninger too 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.590
 beat 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.660
 condition bolt at the beginning of 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.670
 preparation for the olympic games 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.190
 everything is the trainer as usual 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.710
 new jürgen creeper solves herbert mandl 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.970
 and is based on good mood in 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.620
 the Team 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.780
 the teambuilding game is so great 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.150
 because 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.580
 we are on the road together for a long time 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.180
 and there are very many 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.940
 non-contact and when the team 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.990
 works is also this long time 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.170
 So much easier, the team's that 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.180
 and there it gets stronger as possible in the team 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.220
 individual training within the framework of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.350
 Team this is the way of anna 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.260
 fenninger and her osv colleagues 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.430
 even the well-deserved recovery finds 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.739
 in a team framework 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 it is lazing a lot 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.000
 individual matter 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.860

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.460
 full satisfaction 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.990
 Nevertheless, there are always small ones 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.990
 setbacks to ribosomes
