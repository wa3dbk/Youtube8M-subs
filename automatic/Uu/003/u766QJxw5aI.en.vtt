be<00:00:48.180> attacked<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.379> want<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> type<00:00:49.739> /f<00:00:50.610> space

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
be attacked you want to type /f space

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.340 
be attacked you want to type /f space
map<00:00:51.719> enter<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.210> you'll<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:54.989> no

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350

factions<00:00:55.949> near<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> gray

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
factions near me and all the gray

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
factions near me and all the gray
negative<00:00:59.160> signs<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.789> means<00:01:00.109> there's<00:01:01.109> no

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
negative signs that means there's no

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.130 
negative signs that means there's no
