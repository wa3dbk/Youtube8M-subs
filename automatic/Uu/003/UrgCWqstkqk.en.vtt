00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.990
 hello good of all guys that such 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120
 Welcome to watch one more day as you see 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.160
 today I bring you a new video in this 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.650
 case is a video analyzing the new 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.410
 formations that we will have in fifa 14 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.900
 ultimate int and as you can see here we have the 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.540
 first that will be one of the new ones is 4 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.790
 141 As you can see, it's very similar to 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.250
 old 451 the only thing this time 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.770
 we replaced ele mc that we had before 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.020
 for a mc that will give us balance 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.790
 there in the middle of the field and 12 months or 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.260
 they will not be such advanced players 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.329
 like the old 451 that had 2 ms os 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.909
 will continue to have mmd by bands that 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.640
 will link with the striker I think 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.800
 it will be a not very used training although 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.769
 yes that can be good training for 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.780
 play to the touch look for the back of the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.899
 defenses with that single point there to have 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.489
 two quick shots down the wings the 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.130
 next training that we are going to analyze 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:02.330
 is the 4 1 2 1 2 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.610
 this new formation 4 1 2 1 2 as you see 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.950
 replace the old mmd by 2 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.520
 mc is that they will play a little more 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.110
 open to me honestly I do not 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.790
 convinces a lot this new formation all 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.550
 I will try it anyway then I like it in my 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 game is how you know it 's high that I think 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.940
 that this training to play high that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.110
 it's going to be very very good since we can 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.580
 have four guys that play it well or 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.240
 that does not have speed that is not going to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.979
 be the speed of the game an mc or that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.119
 the paste well that links well with the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.729
 front I think it can be a 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 interesting information but I think that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.440
 it's going to be adapt to it you can not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.320
 have the typical m 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.240
 Christian ronaldo di marÃ­a a ya correr 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.210
 by the bands I think there will be 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.430
 analyze it well in the game and we'll see 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.780
 how is the next formation that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.660
 let's analyze is the new 442 this 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.150
 new variant of the 442 will be much more 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.260
 defensive as you know replaces the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.940
 old 12 months by 2 mcd is that I 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.190
 I think it's going to be one of a deformation 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.649
 which is going to be used to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.660
 defensively if you suffer enough then 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.770
 that hold the position well I think 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.660
 what I did not like about this 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.160
 formation that is going to have a lot of space 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.780
 between the middle of the field and the front 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.120
 I think there is too much space I 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.400
 like to play with so much space 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.060
 we will have if same as with the old 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.129
 442 the balance with the mdm and with the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.200
 side so they do not rise so much but 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.400
 I think I do not know, I think it's going to be 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.650
 a formation that is not going to be too 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.180
 popular in the next fixed the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.879
 next training let's analyze 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.690
 will be the new 451 as you know this new 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:47.549
 451 replaces the old mc by 12 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.079
 months that happens that we will accumulate 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.190
 a lot of midfielder in the center of 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.560
 field and it will be a very very difficult d 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.900
 to overcome that barrier at the center of 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.640
 field we do not have any own mcd but 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.090
 I think that 13-month barrier is going to 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.680
 be very difficult to overcome 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.500
 agglutinate we have many people in the middle 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.270
 and it will be very very difficult to pass too 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.120
 it can be an interesting training very 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.980
 similar to the old 4-2-3-1 also a 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.019
 style more or less 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.780
 and let's move on to analyze what I 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.650
 I think it will be the new formation 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.140
 star 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.120
 the new 4-2-3-1 that you see replaces 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.080
 to the old e mc2 that were playing 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.640
 open for 2 m for an emmy and an md 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.549
 as you know in this new formation 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.459
 we are going to be able to put a Christian 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.709
 ronaldo d md let's put a 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.959
 di Maria for example you can be a 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.090
 madness before with the old mc or if 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.909
 they were fast it was also going pretty well 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.700
 with I do not remember to put a bale tiff 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.310
 of mc or the truth was pretty good and I 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.680
 I think this training is going to be going to 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.720
 be the most used this year that balance 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.849
 between midfield two midfielders 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.459
 defensive that will keep you well the 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.870
 defensive zone very well I think it's 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.970
 a formation that will be the first 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.400
 training that you use in this new fifa 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.910
 14 the next formation we're going 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.590
 analyze how you are seeing is the new 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.130
 433 in defensive as you see this 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.170
 training 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.410
 it is a formation a defensive variant 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.660
 of the old 433 as you see the two 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.590
 players the two old semesters that 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.990
 they played open to be mcds and so 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.630
 we will only have one mc that I believe 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.860
 that this training can also be 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.740
 It can be interesting because I do not 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.010
 previous 433 I did not like it much because 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.710
 the mc of the mc climbed too high and 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.360
 it left me very sold between there was much 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.460
 spaces always caught me between 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.890
 lines to the counter and no no just me 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.310
 convince this training can be that 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.380
 is well there will have to be tested and 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.170
 let's move on to analyze the next 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.130
 formation that is also another 433 this 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.690
 time in a containment 433 as you see 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.080
 one of the mc is where he plays for the 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.330
 medium happens to be mcd that can also 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.909
 be interesting since 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.430
 we will keep the open fish that 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.560
 will be the attackers and yet send 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.509
 we'll have an uncle we have to fix to the 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.129
 position in the center of the field that does not 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.199
 will move a lot will not go up much for 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.360
 up and we will have a balance there that 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.729
 It can be quite interesting 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.169
 everything will be try it as I say the 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.930
 next training that we will analyze 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.300
 as you can see in 433 in its most variant 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.759
 offensive as you are seeing in this 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.349
 occasion the sides with penetrate with 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.240
 the extremes as something that can be 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.259
 also quite interesting we can 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.270
 put marcelo with penetrated with Christ 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.919
 and we can make some pretty hybrids 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.020
 quite interesting there no longer 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.180
 We will have to be dependent on 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.710
 other factors we already have there is a link 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.520
 strong for example with this to ronaldo 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.229
 also say that the mc ele mc that happens 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.449
 is that it was more in the middle will happen to 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.940
 be a mc or that will play behind the 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.810
 forward that may be for my taste 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.310
 crazy because to me sincerely as 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.659
 I already told you I did not like it very much 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.060
 because they went too high then 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.889
 imagine you already having one that is your 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.129
 own position in between 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.539
 I do not know, I'd have to try it but I do not 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.879
 it ends up convincing it gives me enough 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.789
 fear and the last training already so 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:20.879
 if the last one we will have new in this 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.460
 fifa 14 will be the 4 3 3 in variant 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.370
 also with false 9 as you see we do not have 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.979
 no own center forward we will have 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.479
 a playmaker in this formation can go 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.900
 pretty good for example to put 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.580
 Suarez or to put rooney in 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.800
 mediapunta as you see also with 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.669
 penetrate the sides with the ends 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.969
 and the mlm c-lm central happens to be a mc 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:46.740
 of also there we can to this is this 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:48.060
 training gives me good thorn I think that 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.650
 It can be quite interesting because 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.870
 the most advanced cadres were the 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.389
 left end extreme right have 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.550
 to Christian and to di Maria for example 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.590
 how do I know how are you putting in the same 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.870
 example always with more player 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.270
 advance can be very very good for 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.310
 example and have a Suarez behind 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.749
 playmaker who has a good shot a 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.520
 good blow or that does not stand out for its 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:10.780
 speed I think it can be 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.250
 quite interesting 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.710
 and it's a training that also 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.810
 like to try the first good since 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.169
 we are also going to remember that as 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.760
 as they already said in this new feef to not 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.919
 have predetermined formations for 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.110
 the players who will come without training 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.840
 tours you can use several in 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.700
 Various templates with different 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.639
 different formations one thing that there 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.350
 that applaud that he has done very well and 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.940
 nothing that I hope you liked this 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.610
 video that I hope you have clarified 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.710
 some doubts and that nothing liza liked 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.770
 subscribe to migrations of follow me in 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.770
 twitter and see you in the next video 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.770
 goodbye
