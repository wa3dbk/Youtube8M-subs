for<00:00:13.710> something<00:00:13.860> then<00:00:14.099> i'm<00:00:14.250> mentally<00:00:14.610> prepared

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
for something then i'm mentally prepared

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.580 
for something then i'm mentally prepared
for<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.240> as<00:00:15.299> well<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.199> done<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> right

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
for it as well so I've done the right

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.230 
for it as well so I've done the right
training<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.250> think<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:17.580> fit<00:00:17.880> enough<00:00:17.910> or

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
training and I think I'm fit enough or

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.820 
training and I think I'm fit enough or
strong<00:00:18.359> enough<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.750> wearing<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.740> you

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
strong enough for wearing is that you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.560 
strong enough for wearing is that you
need<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.430> root<00:00:20.640> then<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.180> pretty

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
need to be for the root then I'm pretty

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.450 
need to be for the root then I'm pretty
go<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.920> your<00:00:22.980> confidence

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
go for it so you get your confidence

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.820 
go for it so you get your confidence
from<00:00:24.449> knowing<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:24.990> you're<00:00:25.109> physically

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
from knowing that you're physically

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.710 
from knowing that you're physically
prepared<00:00:26.550> yeah<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.090> physically<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
prepared yeah you physically up to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
prepared yeah you physically up to
you've<00:00:27.869> done<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.109> training<00:00:28.730> but<00:00:29.730> are

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you've done the right training but are

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.410 
you've done the right training but are
there<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.080> no<00:00:31.349> times<00:00:31.800> where<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.460> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
there are there no times where you you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000 
there are there no times where you you
do<00:00:33.630> actually<00:00:33.870> think<00:00:34.410> even<00:00:34.860> though<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
do actually think even though I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.560 
do actually think even though I
physically<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:35.820> example<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.300> end<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
physically like for example on end of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.750 
physically like for example on end of
the<00:00:36.630> affair<00:00:36.719> where<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.610> than

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the affair where you are more than

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.010 
the affair where you are more than
physically<00:00:39.210> prepared<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.610> but<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.989> know

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
physically prepared for it but you know

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.389 
physically prepared for it but you know
you<00:00:43.170> couldn't<00:00:43.559> bring<00:00:43.649> yourself<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.370> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you couldn't bring yourself to do it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.040 
you couldn't bring yourself to do it
well<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.000> tend<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.510> routes<00:00:45.719> which<00:00:45.930> are

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
well they tend to be on routes which are

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.450 
well they tend to be on routes which are
really<00:00:46.170> scaring<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.890> might<00:00:47.010> hit<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> ground

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
really scaring you might hit the ground

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.040 
really scaring you might hit the ground
and<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.850> don't<00:00:48.030> tend<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.420> those<00:00:48.600> kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and I don't tend to do those kind of so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
and I don't tend to do those kind of so
what<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:49.610> richwood<00:00:50.610> would<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.510> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
what time richwood would you do you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
what time richwood would you do you
still<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.110> routes<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.649> are<00:00:52.829> considered

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
still do routes that are considered

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.319 
still do routes that are considered
dangerous<00:00:53.789> by<00:00:54.090> some<00:00:54.629> yeah<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.890> i<00:00:56.329> generally

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
dangerous by some yeah but i generally

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.729 
dangerous by some yeah but i generally
i'm<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:57.840> into<00:00:58.050> routes<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.620> hit

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
i'm not into routes where you can hit

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.020 
i'm not into routes where you can hit
the<00:00:58.859> ground<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.370> hurt<00:00:59.579> yourself<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the ground and really hurt yourself and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.849 
the ground and really hurt yourself and
that's<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> very<00:01:00.690> easy<00:01:00.960> i<00:01:01.289> try<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that's the kind of very easy i try to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
that's the kind of very easy i try to
avoid<00:01:02.129> those<00:01:02.340> routes<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> big

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
avoid those routes I'm not really a big

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.840 
avoid those routes I'm not really a big
head<00:01:03.719> pointer<00:01:04.640> okay<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.470> about

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
head pointer okay so but what about

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.320 
head pointer okay so but what about
roots<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.060> big<00:01:09.330> big<00:01:09.750> knobs<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:11.000> not<00:01:12.000> hitting

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
roots with big big knobs but not hitting

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
roots with big big knobs but not hitting
the<00:01:12.360> ground<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.960> house<00:01:13.080> yeah<00:01:13.260> Mystic<00:01:14.010> Falls

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the ground your house yeah Mystic Falls

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.340 
the ground your house yeah Mystic Falls
so<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.939> justify<00:01:15.330> those<00:01:15.750> though<00:01:16.049> could

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so how do you justify those though could

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
so how do you justify those though could
feel<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> trained<00:01:17.369> yourself<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.939> be

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
feel how have you trained yourself to be

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.179 
feel how have you trained yourself to be
able<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.570> big<00:01:18.750> force<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> guess

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
able to take big force so now I guess

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.679 
able to take big force so now I guess
I'm<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.729> gun<00:01:20.939> oh<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.390> i've<00:01:21.479> taken

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
I'm just a bit gun oh really i've taken

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.090 
I'm just a bit gun oh really i've taken
