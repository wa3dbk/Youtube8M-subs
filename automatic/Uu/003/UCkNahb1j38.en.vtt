on speaking of names does anybody else
find<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.579> odd<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.719> both<00:00:36.960> somehow<00:00:37.440> know

find it odd that they both somehow know

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.299 
find it odd that they both somehow know
everyone's<00:00:38.610> name<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.770> hear

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
everyone's name and not just that I hear

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.560 
everyone's name and not just that I hear
they're<00:00:41.460> both<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> keep<00:00:42.090> detailed

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
they're both like to keep detailed

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.380 
they're both like to keep detailed
records<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.500> us<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:44.789> both<00:00:45.120> seem

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
records on all of us but they both seem

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
records on all of us but they both seem
like<00:00:45.600> pretty<00:00:45.989> generous<00:00:46.559> guys<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
like pretty generous guys which is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
like pretty generous guys which is
probably<00:00:48.030> why<00:00:48.270> we've<00:00:48.480> loved<00:00:48.870> both<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.289> them

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
probably why we've loved both of them

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
probably why we've loved both of them
with<00:00:49.530> wish<00:00:49.800> lists<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:50.750> desperately

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
with wish lists and then desperately

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.139 
with wish lists and then desperately
hope<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.110> come<00:00:52.320> through<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.770> us<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hope they come through for us the more I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.869 
hope they come through for us the more I
think<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.199> guess<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> few

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
think of it I guess there are a few

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689 
think of it I guess there are a few
important<00:00:57.420> differences<00:00:57.949> for<00:00:58.949> example<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
important differences for example I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
important differences for example I
don't<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:00.719> Jesus<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.440> known<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.739> wearing

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
don't think Jesus was known for wearing

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.759 
don't think Jesus was known for wearing
velvet<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.180> Center<00:01:03.780> seems<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.290> obsessed

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
velvet but Center seems to be obsessed

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
velvet but Center seems to be obsessed
all<00:01:05.150> plus<00:01:06.150> no<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.630> has<00:01:06.750> ever<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.049> gives<00:01:07.229> Jesus

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
all plus no one has ever it gives Jesus

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440 
all plus no one has ever it gives Jesus
of<00:01:07.799> ranking<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> through<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> chimney<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
of ranking in through the chimney and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.140 
of ranking in through the chimney and
eating<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.780> their<00:01:09.960> cooking<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.610> end<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
eating all their cooking in the end I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.109 
eating all their cooking in the end I
keep<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.530> Santa's<00:01:14.189> naughty<00:01:14.790> or

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
keep going back to Santa's naughty or

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.020 
keep going back to Santa's naughty or
nice<00:01:15.540> distinction<00:01:16.430> if<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.640> being<00:01:17.850> totally

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
nice distinction if we're being totally

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
nice distinction if we're being totally
honest<00:01:18.540> we'll<00:01:19.320> probably<00:01:19.560> find<00:01:19.950> ourselves

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
honest we'll probably find ourselves

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.120 
honest we'll probably find ourselves
hoping<00:01:20.549> Santa<00:01:21.060> isn't<00:01:21.540> too<00:01:21.780> strict<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.500> at

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
hoping Santa isn't too strict or at

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.420 
hoping Santa isn't too strict or at
least<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.670> hope<00:01:23.820> ease<00:01:24.000> grading<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> curve

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
least we hope ease grading on a curve

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.190 
least we hope ease grading on a curve
