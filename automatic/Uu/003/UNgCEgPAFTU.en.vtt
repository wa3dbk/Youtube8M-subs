00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.699
 aside I'll tell you a couple of little things 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.550
 more important so that you can 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.429

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.899
 blank what good then here I leave a tweet 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.270

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.760
 binner wood in gta 5 then effectively 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.340
 we have caught and good tyrant in 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.739
 parachute by binner side and the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.879
 truth is that we have not gotten it 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.300
 we have got 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.859

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.179
 that I was also doing you already know 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.780
 that we can not play online because 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:59.420
 because I'm banned and I do not 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.550
 I can do something else because it 's going in 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 the whole play so neither creating another 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.880
 account then I can I can remove the banner 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.840
 good as I say the challenge because that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.310
 consists of getting us to one side of I came 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.649
 no wood and then we went there and good such 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.850

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.599

 kind of metal bars not that good 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.069

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.599
 transparent glass because I many 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.909
