00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.970
 at 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.750
 it's the world that park 7918 we get 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.190
 found today on a video well 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.480
 special then a video simply 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.550
 that I'm going to start I'm going to you 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.240
 explain how to make a glitch on 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.490
 GTA 5 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.680
 after of course the update 1.13 which 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.630
 happened on May 13 to 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.740
 lunch a bit then so before anything 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.480
 as you may have noticed at their 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.829
 little dedication to Mr. Gold Doctor 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.270
 for starters it's simple we see 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.430
 really explain it the fastest 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.260
 possible you need a motorcycle then 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.670
 to start then you put the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.200
 pack or just putting yourself to me 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.390
 of passengers so when you press 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.310
 on select you have the right to put 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.080
 in open box mode is you the 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.760
 put in passenger mode simply 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.230
 so nothing extraordinary you 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.900
 ask your buddy that put all 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.350
 simply as a passenger by putting himself in 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.470
 face glv all you have to do 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.490
 after that, take your car 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.720
 you can copy 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.370
 so I personally took it in there 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.590
 because it's one of the most expensive you 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 take ladder in your garage you the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.579
 come out and at the moment be very careful 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.750
 important at the moment you go out there 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.610
 must it be first you you 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.920
 go out and after you go out 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.960
 ask your friend to go out of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.730
 simply get off the bike in 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.590
 down from the bike the kind was to 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.930
 this price a lot of bugs and he's not going 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.340
 simply your personal experience is 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.570
 left simply while you 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.760
 could have noticed I have a second 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.500
 golden age thanks to its rise is simple 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.670
 after you ladder pony who was copied 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.140
 which is a little further from 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.550
 to say that you just took 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.210
 put it back in your garage so that it 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.100
 the backup 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.409
 after you get out of your 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.150
 garage but very important attention 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.400
 after that remains to be seen but we do not know 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.100
 I never advise you anyway 2 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.810
 simply asked for anne 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.760
 your buddy to simply go to al 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.380
 hader we never know if she from spain 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.090
 that's it but it's good to learn 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.409
 actually spent helping spawn sarah that 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.670
 remains to be seen but let's take no 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.650
 risks 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.970
 this is me I'm not in danger 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.460
 thought he did not pick up why I 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.689
 I'm just bugs 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.399
 here I am not at the blitz and 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.840
 only there is this disc the glitch 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.670
 there that I found interesting to do 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.990
 then I do not why after a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.550
 offered some like that without more 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.500
 but now I'm not going to make one 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.630
 chain especially on it a sacred 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.340
 good so it's nice near you have 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.770
 you just have to ask your friend 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.569
 although they just go out you 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.700
 take your pad you go to the los 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.890
 santos who stops closest 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.290
 just then we're going 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.080
 at los santos that stops there there is a 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.019
 small manip businessman they only last 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.280
 not hard works on the paws this is a 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.690
 glitch which is as I explained to you 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.880
 who has who is simply available 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.750
 after version 1.13 if you too 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.519
 are lacking money 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.930
 this is the moment the squat is all 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.400
 simply to be able to buy 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.440
 new apa the new vehicles and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.269
 the custom is here so it's easy 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.470
 go in front of the los santos custom you 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.160
 simply have your mobile 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.110
 Internet 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.519
 you are simply going to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.299
 cars bought at their trip and 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.860
 transport 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.720
 you go down all the way down the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.670
 support according to Ms. Dallaire 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.980
 so this category you go down to 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.900
 do what do from below is punished everything says in 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.060
 down to just take it to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.350
 their beauty is then three miles from 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.380
 there you need three thousand dollars 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.840
 you buy the rebel in any 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.280
 what color or without shu then 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.959
 you put it in the category that 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.160
 then you want in the house 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.170
 you want but be careful 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.250
 well where you have me after one time 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.720
 that it's done you go into your 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.459
 contact you put yourself in place of the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.700
 door of the form be open well to 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.630
 same time you call your mechanic 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.630
 but it's paid for at any time 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.430
 door closes simply you advance 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.930
 why do not close back 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.670
 in it's going to make a kind of little bug 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.170
 you simply clicked on 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.450
 the apartment where you bought there at 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.280
 the time you bought their beautiful 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.560
 pardon you click on the rebel but 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.359
 this is a past mania difficult and it 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.799
 will you click on the rebel and at 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.740
 same time you click on europe 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.840
 she then you rely on x 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.880
 the island strafed you right arrow 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.890
 here it is either xbox or 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.150
 you strafe the right arrow it's going 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.550
 simply put you in the category 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.800
 custom or not you put you go 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.990
 to sell once to sell you 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.880
 go see the little thing that the little 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.520
 gauge at the bottom right alongside 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.680
 choose you could notice then 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.180
 you wait until seven days arrive and 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.010
 you wait for this gauge to start again 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.030
 so very important that she leave but 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.650
 really very important 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.410
 just because it's all right 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.640
 simply save after what makes 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.370
 that the game will believe that you have 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.049
 never sold your vehicle 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.070
 but you still have the golden thune 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.710
 that's how you've noticed 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.270
 I loved 711 none of the argan tree while 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.270
 simply 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.790
 emma hader and at my house, that's it 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.960
 simply won 711 1000 and in 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.310
 the more you can do that every ten 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.260
 minutes a really there is not even any 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.460
 period of time if it can point out to 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.350
 sell them then you can do that to 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.970
 infinity so of course you that you 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.570
 have a friend who motivates him to do it 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.310
 quite simply 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.020
 so I tried to pass it one of my 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.070
 friends we can not then that's what 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.510
 they want to visit 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.950
 use this necessarily 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.210
 vehicle not the vehicle of another I 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.890
 can not pass my car is entitled 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.960
 otherwise it would be too much but there you go 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.220
 I hope in any case that this glitch will 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.480
 you will like and help you all 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.500
 simply help you simply 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.900
 enrich you 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.030
 for this new update which 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.230
 promises a famous shot and who has when 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.750
 even a lot to buy from 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.150
 custom stuff and whatever it is 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.710
 and that's it and all that so five here we are 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.930
 I mean in a moment when we have 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.370
 still need a lot of money 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.170
 simply invites you to try to 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.130
 do this glitch like I told you I 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.480
 do not expect to put me either at 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.550
 glitch but why not show some 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.000
 glitches interesting and important to those 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.000
 who ask 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.780
 that's it and for those who are 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.880
 would ask young people do not plagiarize people 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.290
 about it there I really do it for 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.700
 my for my pleasure simply 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.530
 for my subscribers who do not know it and 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.820
 that they must simply have benefited 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.820
 a fault if it's possible 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.670
 I hope you like it I tell you 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.530
 just the next one for a 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.390
 next video exposes he knows well 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.390
 it's beautiful and it's claude to you 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.390
 the 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.320
 full
