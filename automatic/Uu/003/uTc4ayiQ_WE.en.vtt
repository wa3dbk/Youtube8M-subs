this outside just because it's probably
a<00:00:09.750> better<00:00:10.759> lighting<00:00:11.759> situation<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.349> I'm

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
a better lighting situation this is I'm

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.129 
a better lighting situation this is I'm
going<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.219> concentrate<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.540> eastern<00:00:15.929> half

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
going to concentrate on the eastern half

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.380 
going to concentrate on the eastern half
of<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.379> United<00:00:16.710> States<00:00:16.980> right<00:00:17.220> now<00:00:17.390> where

of the United States right now where
we're<00:00:18.600> at<00:00:18.830> with<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.760> sinkholes

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
we're at with the sinkholes

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.210 
we're at with the sinkholes
that<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:22.020> occurring<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> regular<00:00:23.850> basis

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
that are occurring on a regular basis

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.970 
that are occurring on a regular basis
all<00:00:26.220> over<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.660> country<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.500> seem<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.859> be

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
all over the country but they seem to be

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.430 
all over the country but they seem to be
happening<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:30.199> in<00:00:31.199> lines<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:33.079> along<00:00:34.079> major

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
happening in in lines or along major

happening in in lines or along major
rivers<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.329> mountain<00:00:38.210> regions<00:00:39.210> along

rivers and and mountain regions along

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.100 
rivers and and mountain regions along
the<00:00:40.140> edges<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.890> mountain<00:00:41.280> regions<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:42.110> so

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the edges of mountain regions not so

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.279 
the edges of mountain regions not so
much<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.219> mountains<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.629> haven't

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289

really come across any that have
happened<00:00:48.120> inside<00:00:48.989> mountain<00:00:49.469> regions<00:00:49.800> but

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
happened inside mountain regions but

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
happened inside mountain regions but
mostly<00:00:50.340> along<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> edges<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> mountain

mostly along the edges of mountain

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.310 
mostly along the edges of mountain

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of broken it up into different different

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.400 
of broken it up into different different

here the Appalachian region is one

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.920 
here the Appalachian region is one
region<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.700> mountains<00:03:05.090> seem<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.480> be<00:03:05.600> pretty

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
region the mountains seem to be pretty

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.680 
region the mountains seem to be pretty
much<00:03:06.489> intact<00:03:07.489> there's<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.180> whole<00:03:08.420> lot<00:03:08.450> of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
much intact there's not a whole lot of

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.590 
much intact there's not a whole lot of
sinkholes<00:03:08.959> happening<00:03:09.380> inside<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.950> mountains

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
sinkholes happening inside the mountains

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.090 
sinkholes happening inside the mountains
until<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:11.840> down<00:03:11.989> here<00:03:12.049> into<00:03:12.590> Tennessee

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
until you get down here into Tennessee

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.820 
until you get down here into Tennessee
and<00:03:13.340> then<00:03:13.430> it's<00:03:13.670> mostly<00:03:14.540> valley<00:03:14.810> areas<00:03:15.320> but<00:03:15.560> in

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
and then it's mostly valley areas but in

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.270 
and then it's mostly valley areas but in
between<00:03:16.220> mountains<00:03:17.950> when<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.040> get<00:03:19.190> into

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
between mountains when you get into

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.910

Louisiana<00:03:22.570> from<00:03:23.570> New<00:03:23.780> Orleans<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.470> travels

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
Louisiana from New Orleans it travels

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.440 
Louisiana from New Orleans it travels
north<00:03:25.190> along<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.640> Mississippi<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.330> what

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
north along the Mississippi this is what

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.750 
north along the Mississippi this is what
I<00:03:26.510> call<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.810> Mississippi<00:03:27.410> region<00:03:27.769> travels

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
I call the Mississippi region travels

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.250 
I call the Mississippi region travels
north<00:03:29.060> along<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.420> Mississippi<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:32.720> Cairo

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.009 
north along the Mississippi in Cairo
right<00:03:33.739> here<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:35.030> seems<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.140> split<00:03:36.709> off<00:03:37.750> on<00:03:38.750> the

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
right here it seems to split off on the

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.860 
right here it seems to split off on the
Ohio<00:03:39.110> River<00:03:39.519> which<00:03:40.519> travels<00:03:41.390> right<00:03:41.540> up<00:03:41.720> the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
Ohio River which travels right up the

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
Ohio River and then the Wabash River it

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.610 
Ohio River and then the Wabash River it
goes<00:03:46.640> north<00:03:46.940> along<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.570> need<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.200> do<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.350> lot

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
goes north along that I need to do a lot

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.570 
goes north along that I need to do a lot
more<00:03:48.650> research<00:03:50.440> but<00:03:51.440> then<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:52.040> know<00:03:52.130> again<00:03:52.400> on

how<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:52.170> did<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:53.000> was<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:55.650> just<00:04:55.950> went<00:04:56.130> in

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
how I did this was I I just went in

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.510 
how I did this was I I just went in
googled<00:04:56.670> you<00:04:57.420> know<00:04:57.570> sinkholes<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.500> then<00:04:59.430> I

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
googled you know sinkholes and then I

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.400 
googled you know sinkholes and then I
would<00:04:59.670> go<00:04:59.850> state-by-state<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.930> I'd<00:05:01.110> find

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
would go state-by-state and I'd find

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.330 
would go state-by-state and I'd find
that<00:05:01.560> there's<00:05:01.830> this<00:05:02.130> pattern<00:05:02.640> that<00:05:04.340> emerged

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
that there's this pattern that emerged

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.710 
that there's this pattern that emerged
now<00:05:06.150> if<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.510> notice<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.110> this<00:05:07.380> region<00:05:07.650> here

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
now if you notice that this region here

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.650 
now if you notice that this region here
is<00:05:09.720> pretty<00:05:10.110> much<00:05:10.790> separated<00:05:11.790> from<00:05:12.450> this

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
is pretty much separated from this

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.470 
is pretty much separated from this
region<00:05:13.110> here<00:05:13.530> which<00:05:14.400> has<00:05:14.610> separated<00:05:15.270> from

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
region here which has separated from

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.450 
region here which has separated from
this<00:05:15.690> region<00:05:16.080> here<00:05:16.410> which<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:16.920> separated<00:05:17.430> from

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
this region here which is separated from

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.940 
this region here which is separated from
this<00:05:17.760> region<00:05:18.180> here<00:05:18.450> so<00:05:19.290> you<00:05:19.350> have<00:05:19.590> four

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
this region here so you have four

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.260 
this region here so you have four
distinct<00:05:20.460> regions<00:05:22.100> okay<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.460> these<00:05:23.940> four

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
distinct regions okay in these four

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.430 
distinct regions okay in these four
distinct<00:05:24.750> regions

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
distinct regions

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.100 
distinct regions
if<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:26.160> tectonic<00:05:26.610> plates<00:05:27.210> keep<00:05:27.510> pulling

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
if the tectonic plates keep pulling

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.200 
if the tectonic plates keep pulling
apart<00:05:28.230> as<00:05:28.680> they<00:05:28.890> are<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.610> have<00:05:29.790> been<00:05:30.030> doing

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
apart as they are and have been doing

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.170 
apart as they are and have been doing
with<00:05:30.540> this<00:05:31.190> pole<00:05:32.190> shift<00:05:32.520> that's<00:05:32.730> going<00:05:33.030> on

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
with this pole shift that's going on

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.020 
with this pole shift that's going on
that<00:05:33.450> it<00:05:34.380> can<00:05:34.530> actually<00:05:34.860> pull<00:05:35.130> these<00:05:35.400> areas

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
that it can actually pull these areas

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.909 
that it can actually pull these areas
apart<00:05:36.450> which<00:05:36.630> would<00:05:36.840> which<00:05:37.380> would<00:05:37.560> mean<00:05:37.710> it

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
apart which would which would mean it

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.770 
apart which would which would mean it
would<00:05:38.070> split<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.520> eastern<00:05:39.120> part<00:05:39.630> of<00:05:39.660> the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
would split the eastern part of the

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.200 
would split the eastern part of the
United<00:05:40.140> States<00:05:40.169> into<00:05:40.770> one<00:05:41.100> two<00:05:41.280> three<00:05:41.760> four

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
United States into one two three four

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.050 
United States into one two three four
different<00:05:42.660> regions<00:05:43.110> now<00:05:44.070> these<00:05:44.370> four

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
different regions now these four

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.020 
different regions now these four
different<00:05:45.270> regions<00:05:45.930> here<00:05:46.820> are<00:05:49.520> autonomous<00:05:50.520> to

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
different regions here are autonomous to

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.620 
different regions here are autonomous to
each<00:05:51.180> other<00:05:52.700> separated<00:05:53.700> by<00:05:53.910> mountains<00:05:54.390> and

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
each other separated by mountains and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.790 
each other separated by mountains and
rivers<00:05:55.620> so<00:05:56.570> in<00:05:57.570> in<00:05:57.900> in<00:05:58.110> each<00:05:58.410> will<00:05:58.770> be

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
rivers so in in in each will be

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.890 
rivers so in in in each will be
interesting<00:05:59.460> would<00:05:59.760> be<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.090> find<00:06:00.360> out<00:06:00.570> if

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
interesting would be to find out if

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.600 
interesting would be to find out if
right<00:06:01.410> here<00:06:01.830> would<00:06:02.400> be<00:06:04.280> because<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:05.430> do<00:06:05.580> have

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
right here would be because you do have

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.700 
right here would be because you do have
a<00:06:06.530> high<00:06:07.530> region<00:06:08.040> in<00:06:08.450> Michigan<00:06:09.450> but<00:06:10.290> if<00:06:10.470> this

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
a high region in Michigan but if this

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.560 
a high region in Michigan but if this
area<00:06:11.040> here<00:06:11.490> got<00:06:11.669> cut<00:06:11.880> across<00:06:12.120> it<00:06:12.300> could<00:06:12.450> turn

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
area here got cut across it could turn

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:19.250 
area here got cut across it could turn
this<00:06:12.810> area<00:06:13.020> into<00:06:14.600> a<00:06:15.600> big<00:06:16.350> island<00:06:18.260> just

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
this area into a big island just

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.740 
this area into a big island just
interesting<00:06:19.950> to<00:06:20.100> see<00:06:20.310> all<00:06:20.490> this<00:06:20.760> how<00:06:21.060> how<00:06:21.510> its

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
interesting to see all this how how its

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.360 
interesting to see all this how how its
coming<00:06:22.080> together<00:06:22.200> and<00:06:22.680> how<00:06:22.919> all<00:06:23.220> these

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
coming together and how all these

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.310 
coming together and how all these
sinkholes<00:06:23.789> are<00:06:24.120> connected<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:24.810> linked<00:06:25.169> in

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
sinkholes are connected and linked in

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.450 
sinkholes are connected and linked in
such

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
such

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.930 
such
manner<00:06:26.729> that<00:06:27.030> there<00:06:29.810> they<00:06:30.810> could<00:06:31.110> possibly

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
manner that there they could possibly

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.150 
manner that there they could possibly
create<00:06:32.940> a<00:06:33.530> division<00:06:34.530> of<00:06:34.680> the<00:06:35.520> landmasses<00:06:37.160> with

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
create a division of the landmasses with

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.339 
create a division of the landmasses with
major<00:06:38.580> sinkholes<00:06:39.180> happening<00:06:39.720> water<00:06:40.139> of

major sinkholes happening water of

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.260 
major sinkholes happening water of
course<00:06:40.590> will<00:06:40.830> rush<00:06:41.039> in<00:06:41.220> from<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.580> oceans<00:06:42.000> and

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
course will rush in from the oceans and

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.210 
course will rush in from the oceans and
and<00:06:42.569> take<00:06:42.870> those<00:06:43.080> regions<00:06:43.500> right<00:06:43.680> over

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
and take those regions right over

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.350 
and take those regions right over
all<00:06:45.030> right<00:06:45.180> well<00:06:45.449> leave<00:06:46.410> your<00:06:46.560> comments<00:06:47.099> and
