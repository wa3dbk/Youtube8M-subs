00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.570
 almost alive as resurrected this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.330
 woman at twenty thousand the warrior of 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.150
 the clumsy shelter to eyzies the work of 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.249
 isabelle dns who used a method 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.720
 most modern 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.759
 I could collaborate to make his 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.759
 reconstitution with the Institute of 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.489
 criminal searches of rosny they have 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.689
 process in the same way as in a 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.250
 criminal investigation 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.070
 that is, they could do a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.469
 study of the skull and communicate to me 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.100
 thicknesses of soft tissue ie 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.460
 skin and muscles and from these 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.679
 data 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.170
 I worked on the molding of his 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:52.160
 skull with these thickness data for 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.170
 the reconstitute entitled expensive original 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.589
 this exhibition explores the amazing 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.390
 diversity of facies of our ancestors 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:05.180
 skinned in three dimensions so one 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.680
 do not see a big difference with 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.600
 a skinned sapiens if I tell you 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.369
 present and in profile would have flagrantly 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.290
 you will have a projected head with a 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.799
 year very very project a chin 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.290
 receding 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.270
 but we do not really realize 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.759
 no it's really interesting because 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 we are still relatively close to 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.869
 the nerve man and between forensic medicine 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.969
 and the art installations 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.430
 technology magnifies this exhibition 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.300
 like this projection on curtains 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.850
 hard 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.700
 it's a landmark for the visitor who 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.979
 we are really on the border of art 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.960
 and so we could use all the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.329
 supports that we wanted here are very 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.299
 a lot of technologies and then 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.630
 a lot of very simple support comes out 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.020
 but that is really sublime every 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.179
 part of the expensive work of origins to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.210
 see until October at the eyzies of 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.210
