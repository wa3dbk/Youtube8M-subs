00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
circumference and that's the key a loop

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.179 
circumference and that's the key a loop
just<00:02:04.749> big<00:02:05.229> enough<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.619> go<00:02:05.770> around<00:02:05.889> the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
can go around that once you attach it

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.620 
can go around that once you attach it
then<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.950> won't<00:03:19.190> go<00:03:19.400> back<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.120> know<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:20.540> you

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
then it won't go back so you know if you

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.530 
then it won't go back so you know if you
see<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.620> sticks<00:03:22.549> directly<00:03:23.299> into<00:03:23.480> that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
see so it sticks directly into that

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.660 
see so it sticks directly into that
small<00:03:23.930> loop<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.560> then<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:25.250> kind<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.519> helps

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
small loop and then that kind of helps

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.509 
small loop and then that kind of helps
