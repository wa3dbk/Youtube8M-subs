 Hello dear friends Swami channels 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.310
 and give you my name is edward and today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.089
 I'll show you how to make protein 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.089
 cocktail 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.570
 make homemade protein sees school once 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.460
 on time the powder is theoretically possible but 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.750
 It is unlikely that we will succeed if you 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.940
 doing in dense medium 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.950
 the intensity is in front of you 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.500
 the task is to build up extremely quickly 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.809
 muscle mass you quite fit it 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.520
 way how to do one by yourself 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.430
 so for this we need a blender 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.670
 milk, it is desirable to take lean eggs 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.040
 banana leaves are also not fat and nuts 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.989
 you can use them at will eggs 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.460
 can use cheese and but preferably 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.589
 they still cook so as not to catch 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.780
 some kind of disease from something like 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.449
 salmonellosis and so while the egg is boiled 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.610
 mix the rest of the ingredients we cut 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.610
 banana slices and throw in a blender 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.370
 Now open cottage cheese and throws 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.920
 pour nuts there too 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.040
 we clear the fallen eggs and also 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.910
 throw them in a blender and pour 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.910
 half a liter of milk 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.850
 close the lid and start the blender 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:46.800
 and our protein shake is ready morphine 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.810
