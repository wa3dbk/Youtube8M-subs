00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.920
When Anne Loxley, the curator of the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.020
survey show, said that the exhibition

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.140
was going to Adelaide at the Samstag

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.210
I looked up the museum's website and saw

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.250
the building and thought "Whoa, what a magnificent building"

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.300
and checked the space and I was so

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.430
pleased that the paintings were coming to this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.600
marvelous space and as you can see

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.710
it's just been superbly hung

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.800
and suberb professionalism with

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.870
everything and it just looks right.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.930
The Band one was done in New York

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.990
but from that moment on and when I came

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.070
back to Australia, living in South Australia

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.160
at the time, I painted all the works

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.350
back here so there's that nice

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.420
correlation now of being at home so to speak.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.460
The paintings reflected

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.540
an expression of how I wanted

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.440
to see my work evolve over a long period.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.020
I wanted to find myself, so to speak

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.730
in the 20th century to see what was

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.250
important to me as a young painter

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.380
and it came under the term of

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.460
well, several terms to describe it

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.570
both, Colour Form, Colour Feild, Hard Edge

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.670
Classical Abstraction and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.790
there was that general excitement to what I was perceiving

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.860
at the time and the series from the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.890
Bands developed into the Canto paintings

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.970
which I started in New York at the end of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.160
'63 going into '64 and then

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.670
when I came back to Australia towards the end of '65

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.730
kept on developing the Canto series

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.820
I went from the Cantos to the Persian paintings which

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.840
I wanted to use a more decorative sort of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.150
feel to colour.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.250
From the Persians it went into a total

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.440
change then with the Modular Constructions

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.450
and I thought, can I take these shapes

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.730
out of the rectangle, take it out of the square

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.970
push it out into the negative area

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.260
what's normally the negative area.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.610
This is what I did

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.710
was to break open that form of the rectangle and square.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.820
I reverted back to painting

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.930
with a group of works called the Link paintings

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.100
and that term sort of describes

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.290
the intent again, to go from the Links

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.340
into the Stains.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.440
I closed off the white areas

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.610
and made them an all over paint

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.810
structure and that was where Montauk Red comes in

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.870
It comes back to making marks with a brush

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.030
at the same time putting paint on in broad areas

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.500
and the person I looked to with that

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.040
particular group was Monet

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.310
and one of the great paintings

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.460
is the all over paintings where he takes out the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.650
horizontal line, that which makes it a landscape

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.770
depicts it as a landscape.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.790
There's the sky, the horizon

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.850
here's the water lilly field. He takes that out

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.970
and all of a sudden it becomes very frontal.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.560
Pollock sees this.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.560
This is one of the influences of Jackson Pollock.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.550
This whole series of the all overness

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.750
from edge to edge, top to bottom

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.820
the saturation of this magnificent paint area

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.900
this field of colour, this American content of

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.990
what painting can be

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.030
with this strong sense of colour, expansive colour.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.140
It's not contained like Cubism within the parameters of this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.330
this area here, it's VOOM!

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.450
It often looks you know, sort of chaotic

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.650
you know, pouring on paint and sort of hoping that

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.940
something's going to happen, but everything's highly complex

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.050
and very much sort of

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.210
decided before it happens.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.380
I'm not content with just sort of leaving it and thinking

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.480
"Oh well, it's a nice painting, ho hum"

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.700
Painting's become chewing gum for the mind

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.900
when that sort of thing's happened.
