00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
channel instead of triple channel it has

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.840 
channel instead of triple channel it has
of<00:00:53.579> course<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.239> new<00:00:54.660> support<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.850> p55

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of course a new support for the p55

of course a new support for the p55
chipset<00:00:57.059> instead<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> x58<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.910> are

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
chipset instead of the x58 so there are

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
chipset instead of the x58 so there are
some<00:01:00.329> differences<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> architecture<00:01:02.100> and

some differences in the architecture and
the<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.460> merging<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> Northbridge<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the way it's merging the Northbridge and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.520 
the way it's merging the Northbridge and
Southbridge<00:01:04.970> together<00:01:05.970> into<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.750> ok<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
Southbridge together into one ok so that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
Southbridge together into one ok so that
does<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.950> its<00:01:08.130> benefits<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.049> reducing

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
does have its benefits in reducing

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.710 
does have its benefits in reducing

Idol<00:02:25.470> here's<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.580> motherboard<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.210> I

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
Idol here's the motherboard like I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.470 
Idol here's the motherboard like I
mentioned<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> MSI<00:02:28.110> motherboard<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
mentioned the MSI motherboard and the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.750 
mentioned the MSI motherboard and the
memory<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:30.990> well<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> haven't<00:02:32.190> overclocked

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
memory as well I haven't overclocked

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.420 
memory as well I haven't overclocked
anything<00:02:33.600> yet<00:02:34.020> okay<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:35.160> are<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
anything yet okay so here are the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.490 
anything yet okay so here are the
results<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:37.400> I'm<00:02:38.400> running<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.790> HD<00:02:39.630> 48<00:02:39.990> 90s<00:02:40.320> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
results and I'm running to HD 48 90s and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.590 
results and I'm running to HD 48 90s and
crossfire<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.280> motherboard<00:02:41.550> okay<00:02:42.330> so

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
crossfire on this motherboard okay so

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.580 
crossfire on this motherboard okay so
just<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.020> know<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.940> also<00:02:45.290> when<00:02:46.290> we

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
just so you know that and also when we

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.590 
just so you know that and also when we
look<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.190> temperatures<00:02:47.850> on<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.300> again

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
look at the temperatures on it again

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.790 
look at the temperatures on it again
like<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.230> said<00:02:49.430> idle<00:02:50.430> about<00:02:50.820> 30<00:02:51.800> degrees

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
like I said idle about 30 degrees

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.560 
like I said idle about 30 degrees
Celsius<00:02:53.280> roughly<00:02:53.730> depending<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.300> cores

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
Celsius roughly depending on the cores

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.690 
Celsius roughly depending on the cores
here<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.020> you're<00:02:55.110> looking<00:02:55.350> at<00:02:55.500> maximum<00:02:56.490> load

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
here that you're looking at maximum load

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520 
here that you're looking at maximum load
you'll<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.210> maybe<00:02:57.360> 50<00:02:57.900> degrees<00:02:58.260> Celsius

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
you'll get to maybe 50 degrees Celsius

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.120 
you'll get to maybe 50 degrees Celsius
full<00:02:59.460> load<00:02:59.760> all<00:03:00.060> four<00:03:00.720> cores<00:03:01.080> going<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:01.980> then

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
full load all four cores going but then

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.310 
full load all four cores going but then
again<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.580> didn't<00:03:02.940> overclock<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.420> CPU<00:03:03.630> yet

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
again I didn't overclock the CPU yet

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.680 
again I didn't overclock the CPU yet
right<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.680> still<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.950> 2<00:03:05.130> point<00:03:05.310> 6<00:03:05.580> gigahertz<00:03:06.330> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
right it still a 2 point 6 gigahertz and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.270 
right it still a 2 point 6 gigahertz and
there<00:03:07.290> are<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> temperature<00:03:07.920> readings

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
there are the temperature readings

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.050 
there are the temperature readings
alright<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:10.110> increase<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:11.060> clock

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
alright so if we increase the clock

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.940 
alright so if we increase the clock
speed<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.540> 3<00:03:12.690> point<00:03:12.900> 3<00:03:13.020> or<00:03:13.200> 4<00:03:13.410> gigahertz<00:03:13.710> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
speed to 3 point 3 or 4 gigahertz and

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.860 
speed to 3 point 3 or 4 gigahertz and
overclock<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.430> obviously<00:03:15.210> we're<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
overclock it obviously we're going to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.900 
overclock it obviously we're going to
get<00:03:16.020> better<00:03:16.230> results<00:03:16.770> here<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.400> 3d<00:03:17.700> mark

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
get better results here the 3d mark

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.180 
get better results here the 3d mark
results<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:18.930> example<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.410> CPU<00:03:19.800> scores

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
results for example the CPU scores

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.090 
results for example the CPU scores
increase<00:03:20.730> as<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.540> overclock<00:03:22.170> but<00:03:22.890> how<00:03:23.040> does

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
increase as we overclock but how does

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.930 
increase as we overclock but how does
this<00:03:23.450> compare<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.750> other<00:03:25.260> CPUs<00:03:25.830> here's<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.580> PC

comparing<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.320> other<00:03:31.440> CPUs<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.070> does<00:03:32.220> better

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
comparing to other CPUs it does better

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.420 
comparing to other CPUs it does better
than<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.790> Phenom<00:03:33.270> 2's<00:03:33.570> ok<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.740> does<00:03:34.980> beat

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
than the Phenom 2's ok so it does beat

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.860 
than the Phenom 2's ok so it does beat
the<00:03:35.640> phenom<00:03:35.940> ii<00:03:36.150> x4<00:03:36.830> 955<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.160> 965<00:03:38.820> at<00:03:39.090> default

the phenom ii x4 955 and 965 at default

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.410 
the phenom ii x4 955 and 965 at default
and<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.320> overclocked<00:03:40.890> speeds<00:03:41.280> as<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.240> see

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
and it overclocked speeds as you can see

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.490 
and it overclocked speeds as you can see
here<00:03:42.780> ok<00:03:43.410> now<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.340> course<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.390> do<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.290> to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
here ok now of course I do have to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.710 
here ok now of course I do have to
overclock<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.790> three<00:03:47.970> point<00:03:48.180> three<00:03:48.360> or<00:03:48.510> four

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
overclock to three point three or four

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.449 
overclock to three point three or four
gigahertz<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.290> CPU<00:03:49.680> in<00:03:50.010> order<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.430> to

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
gigahertz the CPU in order for it to

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.230 
gigahertz the CPU in order for it to
beat<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.690> core<00:03:51.930> i7<00:03:52.470> at<00:03:52.890> default<00:03:53.400> speeds<00:03:53.760> ok<00:03:54.180> so

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
beat the core i7 at default speeds ok so

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.720 
beat the core i7 at default speeds ok so
keep<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:54.959> mind<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.440> did<00:03:55.800> run<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.070> SI

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
keep that in mind I did run the SI

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.260 
keep that in mind I did run the SI
Sandra<00:03:58.340> benchmarks<00:03:59.340> here<00:03:59.520> just<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.910> see<00:04:00.090> what

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
Sandra benchmarks here just to see what

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.820 
Sandra benchmarks here just to see what
it<00:04:00.360> had<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.660> say<00:04:00.810> about<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.140> ranking<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
it had to say about the ranking and it

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.820 
it had to say about the ranking and it
also<00:04:02.010> concurred<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.940> does<00:04:03.120> beat<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
also concurred that it does beat the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.580 
also concurred that it does beat the
intel<00:04:04.830> core<00:04:05.100> 2<00:04:05.130> quads<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.360> quads<00:04:06.630> here<00:04:07.020> as<00:04:07.200> you

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
intel core 2 quads the quads here as you

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.000 
intel core 2 quads the quads here as you
can<00:04:07.620> see<00:04:07.800> and<00:04:08.280> also<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.670> AMD<00:04:09.180> Phenom<00:04:09.600> 2<00:04:09.870> 965<00:04:10.680> at

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
can see and also the AMD Phenom 2 965 at

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.250 
can see and also the AMD Phenom 2 965 at
the<00:04:11.400> default<00:04:11.790> 3.4<00:04:12.480> gigahertz<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.020> it<00:04:13.110> does

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
the default 3.4 gigahertz so it does

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.789 
the default 3.4 gigahertz so it does
beat<00:04:13.470> those<00:04:13.709> as<00:04:13.980> well<00:04:14.790> ok<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:16.230> does<00:04:16.410> verify

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
beat those as well ok so it does verify

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.590 
beat those as well ok so it does verify
it<00:04:16.859> now<00:04:17.100> how<00:04:17.549> much<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.120> priced<00:04:18.390> well

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
it now how much is it priced well

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.170 
it now how much is it priced well
roughly<00:04:18.959> going<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.500> about<00:04:19.590> $200<00:04:20.520> u.s.<00:04:20.850> right

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
roughly going for about $200 u.s. right

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.940 
roughly going for about $200 u.s. right
now<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.600> here's<00:04:21.780> some<00:04:21.960> pricing<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.800> might

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
now so here's some pricing you might

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.200 
now so here's some pricing you might
find<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> bit<00:04:23.400> cheaper<00:04:23.430> ten<00:04:23.940> dollars

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
find it a bit cheaper ten dollars

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.379 
find it a bit cheaper ten dollars
cheaper<00:04:24.390> here<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.810> there<00:04:25.130> if<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.640> do<00:04:27.060> some

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
cheaper here and there if you do some

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.480 
cheaper here and there if you do some
test<00:04:27.689> like<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.110> did<00:04:28.259> here<00:04:28.530> just<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.919> see<00:04:29.310> how

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
test like I did here just to see how

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.760 
test like I did here just to see how
long<00:04:29.639> does<00:04:29.759> it<00:04:29.819> take<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.379> re-encode<00:04:31.379> a<00:04:31.439> video

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
long does it take to re-encode a video

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.999 
long does it take to re-encode a video
for<00:04:32.039> example<00:04:32.129> from<00:04:32.759> avi<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.479> mp4<00:04:34.139> so<00:04:34.710> here's<00:04:34.919> a

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
for example from avi to mp4 so here's a

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.790 
for example from avi to mp4 so here's a
500<00:04:35.460> mega<00:04:35.639> fall<00:04:35.849> that<00:04:36.029> I'm<00:04:36.150> rien<00:04:37.020> coding<00:04:37.439> it

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
500 mega fall that I'm rien coding it

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.869 
500 mega fall that I'm rien coding it
says<00:04:38.099> that<00:04:38.249> it's<00:04:38.370> going<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.550> take<00:04:38.699> about

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
says that it's going to take about

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.550 
says that it's going to take about
approximately<00:04:39.509> 30<00:04:39.810> seconds<00:04:40.259> to<00:04:40.379> do<00:04:40.529> that

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
approximately 30 seconds to do that

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.890 
approximately 30 seconds to do that
whole<00:04:40.919> fall<00:04:41.159> and<00:04:41.430> convert<00:04:41.789> it<00:04:41.939> it<00:04:42.120> actually

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
whole fall and convert it it actually

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.450 
whole fall and convert it it actually
took<00:04:43.139> 23<00:04:44.039> seconds<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:45.180> convert<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:46.319> from<00:04:46.860> one

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
took 23 seconds to convert it from one

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.760 
took 23 seconds to convert it from one
file<00:04:47.729> type<00:04:47.999> to<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.569> other<00:04:48.689> okay<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.349> re-encode

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
file type to the other okay to re-encode

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.640 
file type to the other okay to re-encode
that<00:04:50.120> if<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.330> increase<00:04:51.599> an<00:04:51.870> overclock<00:04:52.319> this<00:04:52.529> the

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
that if I increase an overclock this the

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.070 
that if I increase an overclock this the
four<00:04:52.860> gigahertz<00:04:53.129> it<00:04:53.430> takes<00:04:53.580> like<00:04:54.180> 16<00:04:54.629> seconds

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
four gigahertz it takes like 16 seconds

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.839 
four gigahertz it takes like 16 seconds
it<00:04:55.199> takes<00:04:55.289> even<00:04:55.499> less<00:04:55.770> okay

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
it takes even less okay

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.089 
it takes even less okay
so<00:04:57.240> pretty<00:04:58.020> good<00:04:58.169> results<00:04:58.590> there<00:04:58.740> as<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.979> can

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
so pretty good results there as you can

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.589 
so pretty good results there as you can
see<00:04:59.279> so<00:04:59.460> if<00:04:59.550> you're<00:04:59.699> up<00:04:59.909> doing<00:05:00.180> any<00:05:00.330> video

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
see so if you're up doing any video

as well ok so just for your information
now<00:05:31.710> when<00:05:32.460> overclocking<00:05:33.300> a<00:05:33.389> CPU<00:05:33.750> like<00:05:33.930> this

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
now when overclocking a CPU like this

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.990 
now when overclocking a CPU like this
obviously<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.830> want<00:05:35.009> a<00:05:35.039> good<00:05:35.219> CPU<00:05:35.669> cooler

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
obviously you want a good CPU cooler

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.249 
obviously you want a good CPU cooler
that's<00:05:36.389> how<00:05:36.569> I<00:05:36.599> got<00:05:36.900> it

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
that's how I got it

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.269 
that's how I got it
2<00:05:37.909> 4<00:05:38.909> gigahertz<00:05:39.210> hassle-free<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:40.169> of<00:05:41.039> course

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
2 4 gigahertz hassle-free and of course

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.269 
2 4 gigahertz hassle-free and of course
I<00:05:41.400> up<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.969> voltage<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.569> 1.3<00:05:43.050> -<00:05:43.439> as<00:05:43.620> you<00:05:43.889> can<00:05:44.099> see

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
I up the voltage to 1.3 - as you can see

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.089 
I up the voltage to 1.3 - as you can see
here<00:05:44.520> from<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:44.729> 1.2<00:05:45.360> volts<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:46.560> multiplier

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
here from the 1.2 volts the multiplier

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.670 
here from the 1.2 volts the multiplier
was<00:05:47.279> increased<00:05:47.669> at<00:05:47.819> 21<00:05:48.330> times<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.500> bus

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
was increased at 21 times and the bus

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.559 
was increased at 21 times and the bus
speed<00:05:49.919> is<00:05:50.159> at<00:05:50.399> 1<00:05:52.039> 90.5<00:05:53.039> megahertz<00:05:53.639> ok<00:05:54.060> that's

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
speed is at 1 90.5 megahertz ok that's

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.379 
speed is at 1 90.5 megahertz ok that's
how<00:05:54.750> we<00:05:54.870> get<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.259> Deford<00:05:55.680> gigahertz<00:05:56.009> and<00:05:56.430> you

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
how we get that Deford gigahertz and you

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.709 
how we get that Deford gigahertz and you
can<00:05:57.539> see<00:05:57.659> here<00:05:57.839> that<00:05:57.870> our<00:05:58.050> full<00:05:58.469> load

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
can see here that our full load

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.839 
can see here that our full load
overclocked<00:06:00.719> it's<00:06:01.620> close<00:06:01.979> to<00:06:02.189> 70<00:06:02.550> degrees

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
overclocked it's close to 70 degrees

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.240 
overclocked it's close to 70 degrees
Celsius<00:06:03.029> it<00:06:03.509> might<00:06:03.659> not<00:06:03.810> touch<00:06:04.050> 70<00:06:04.500> in<00:06:04.649> some

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
Celsius it might not touch 70 in some

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.379 
Celsius it might not touch 70 in some
cases<00:06:05.669> but<00:06:05.789> it's<00:06:05.939> close

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
cases but it's close

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.570 
cases but it's close
ok<00:06:06.629> still<00:06:06.839> within<00:06:07.050> limits<00:06:07.469> so<00:06:08.189> there<00:06:08.339> you<00:06:08.430> go

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
ok still within limits so there you go

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.279 
ok still within limits so there you go
terrific<00:06:08.939> processor<00:06:09.719> great<00:06:10.080> for
