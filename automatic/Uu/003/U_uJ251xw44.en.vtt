hey<00:00:06.180> so<00:00:06.870> where<00:00:07.350> did<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.859> earth<00:00:07.980> come<00:00:08.340> from<00:00:09.080> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
hey so where did the earth come from the

most<00:00:10.290> known<00:00:10.759> scientific<00:00:11.759> theory<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.870> big

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
most known scientific theory is the big

pretty<00:00:17.250> cool<00:00:17.490> huh<00:00:17.869> well<00:00:18.869> before<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.070> Big<00:00:20.189> Bang

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
pretty cool huh well before the Big Bang

what a black hole is indiscernible video

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.170

anyway<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.040> singularity<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
anyway think of a singularity like a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.240 
anyway think of a singularity like a
vacuum<00:00:42.540> sucking<00:00:43.050> everything<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
vacuum sucking everything up when the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
vacuum sucking everything up when the
vacuum<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.730> full<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.270> pops<00:00:45.539> well<00:00:46.260> imagine<00:00:46.440> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
vacuum is full it pops well imagine that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.750 
vacuum is full it pops well imagine that
about<00:00:47.219> only<00:00:48.200> about<00:00:49.200> 10<00:00:49.860> quadrillion<00:00:50.160> times

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
about only about 10 quadrillion times

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.900 
about only about 10 quadrillion times
larger<00:00:53.899> flinging<00:00:54.899> gas<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.770> debris<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.670> off

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
larger flinging gas and debris going off

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.959 
larger flinging gas and debris going off
in<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.329> directions<00:00:58.640> isn't<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.670> pretty

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
in all directions isn't that pretty

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.049 
in all directions isn't that pretty
crazy<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:01.199> blew<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.250> singularity<00:01:02.699> blew

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
crazy when blew up the singularity blew

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.370 
crazy when blew up the singularity blew
up<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.809> gas<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.860> debris<00:01:05.220> boom<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:06.810> all

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
up and then gas is debris boom then all

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.620 
up and then gas is debris boom then all
explain<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:07.979> happens<00:01:08.250> later<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.180> an

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
explain what happens later now but an

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
explain what happens later now but an
imagined<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> bomb<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:11.310> off<00:01:11.549> inside<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.000> an

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
imagined it bomb going off inside of an

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.969 
imagined it bomb going off inside of an
egg<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:13.170> how<00:01:13.439> compact<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.530> small<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
egg that's how compact and small a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.630 
egg that's how compact and small a
singularity<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:18.080> but<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.890> basically<00:01:20.369> much

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
singularity is but it's basically much

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
singularity is but it's basically much
larger<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> small<00:01:22.170> compared<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> space

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
larger but it's small compared to space

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359 
larger but it's small compared to space
in<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> universe<00:01:23.810> well<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.890> explosion

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
in the universe well as so explosion

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
in the universe well as so explosion
continued<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.090> cool<00:01:27.270> down<00:01:27.299> pieces<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.200> debris

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
continued to cool down pieces of debris

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.940 
continued to cool down pieces of debris
and<00:01:28.619> gases<00:01:29.040> beginning<00:01:29.729> sticking<00:01:30.090> together

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
and gases beginning sticking together

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
and gases beginning sticking together
eventually<00:01:32.180> growing<00:01:33.180> two<00:01:33.360> stars<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> planets

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
eventually growing two stars and planets

eventually growing two stars and planets
also<00:01:34.950> known<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.670> Earth<00:01:35.880> Jupiter<00:01:36.299> Mars<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.259> all

also known as Earth Jupiter Mars and all
those<00:01:37.950> other<00:01:38.159> good<00:01:38.520> planets

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
those other good planets

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.580 
those other good planets
all<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.000> sooner<00:01:42.720> collected<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
all of this is sooner collected into the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.820 
all of this is sooner collected into the
disk<00:01:43.860> called<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.400> solar<00:01:44.700> nebula<00:01:45.590> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> like

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
disk called a solar nebula kind of like

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.570 
disk called a solar nebula kind of like
a<00:01:46.860> CD<00:01:47.160> but<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:48.120> much<00:01:48.450> larger<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.920> process

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
a CD but much much larger this process

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.060 
a CD but much much larger this process
took<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.120> billion<00:01:51.570> years<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.380> did<00:01:52.950> not

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
took about a billion years it did not

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.910 
took about a billion years it did not
take<00:01:53.370> like<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.820> couple<00:01:54.000> seconds<00:01:54.650> well<00:01:55.650> about

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
take like a couple seconds well about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.060 
take like a couple seconds well about
five<00:01:56.220> billion<00:01:56.580> years<00:01:56.970> later<00:01:57.300> some<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.860> gas

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
five billion years later some of the gas

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.570 
five billion years later some of the gas
become<00:01:59.640> our<00:01:59.850> son<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.080> let<00:02:01.530> there<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.770> light<00:02:02.250> we

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
become our son so let there be light we

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.600 
become our son so let there be light we
get<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.850> Sun<00:02:03.120> we<00:02:03.690> have<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.960> earth<00:02:04.400> without<00:02:05.400> the

commentary but anyway guys but then the
earth<00:02:25.320> was<00:02:25.560> formed<00:02:25.980> well<00:02:26.760> i'm<00:02:27.090> daniel<00:02:27.780> and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
earth was formed well i'm daniel and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.080
