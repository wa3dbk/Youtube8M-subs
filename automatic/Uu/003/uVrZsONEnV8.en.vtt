 Do not you live with me? 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.379
 let it go I'm here within the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.020
 environments we already did with cars around 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.670
 Let's see how far these grills there 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.289
 say they had these grids 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.809
 I'm going to leave the car in this position. 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.410
 Right, I left the positioning car . 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.039
 like this 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.649
 that way they will get out of the vehicle and 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.840
 Let's get away from here so the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.950
 grades are reborn to become commonplace 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.869
 car beauty 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.479
 so come on where are we more 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.670
 environment here is a little bit to 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.410
 far away there is nothing to avoid taboo 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.979
 When I get back here, it's okay. 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.050
 about right back we do 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.840
 that very catapult catapult catapult 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.489
 very fucking human through the vehicle with 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.250
 You are seeing the bars and they were born. 

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:32.560
 therein disclosed within the vehicle 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.360
 not approach to avoid disclosing 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.860
 Because it's complicated meanwhile, my 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.899
 friend joÃ£o vitor is walking by that 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.270
 Moretto and it will arrive more or less in this 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.069
 position he arrives in that position I go 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.770
 put a character very close there there 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.860
 more or less, so right is it 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.940

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.619
