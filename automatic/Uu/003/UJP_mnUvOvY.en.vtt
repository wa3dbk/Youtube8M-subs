00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 catch the flag this game what 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.220
 We will use for children between 8 to 14 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.240
 years and the material that we will use will be 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.300
 flags hoops and cones for this game 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.730
 we will place what are the hoops which 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.080
 we will put the flags we can use 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.830
 like flags, breastplates 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.529
 and around the rings we will place the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.789
 cones which serve to 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.519
 represent the safe area 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.480
 we do the same with the other hoop the other 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.730
 part of the field 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.489
 and then we will put a part 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.309
 of the field two red rings which 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.949
 they will represent the jail and they are two others 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.380
 more on the other side we will place the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.240
 players 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.060
 and the game objective is very simple 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.860
 simply the players of a team 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.040
 they should go to the other 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.790
 field of the opposite team to catch the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.790
 flag 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.120
 in this case the game starts we see with 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.820
 a player moves 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.420
 to the opposing team field take the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.799
 flag 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 I have taken it goes and puts it in its 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.040
 territory therefore has five 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.250
 flags and the other team stays with 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.250
 three 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.730
 let's see next another case 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.850
 we see that the player goes to the field 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.630
 opposite but spied on when caught 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.840
 you have to go to the team jail 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.820
 in which he has caught the same 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.560
 try another of the purple team but it 's 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.890
 caught and goes to jail 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.590
 we see below another case one goes away 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.380
 of the green team to catch a flag 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.280
 but while it comes out it's also caught 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.310
 therefore you must leave the flag 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 on your site and you will have to go to the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.850
 jail 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.730
 how can we free the players that 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.410
 they are in the houses is very simple 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.600
 simply the players should go 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:12.300
 catch it 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.420
 and take it to your field this game 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.090
 would finish once the team has 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.830
 captured the four team flags 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.110
 otherwise having eight in total 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.910
 important points in this game are that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.430
 students can not be thrown in the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.190
 safe area of the other team ie 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.130
 all cones can only be released 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.050
 one person from prison at a time and for 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.700
 last you can not catch a flag and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.010
 save the person from prison 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.600
 same time good that's all I hope 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.040
 that you have liked already you know for more 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.300
