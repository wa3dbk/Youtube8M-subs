second to one second delay and obviously
you<00:03:23.430> can<00:03:23.519> change<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.940> with<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> response

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
you can change that with the response

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.360 
you can change that with the response
time<00:03:27.380> as<00:03:28.380> well<00:03:28.590> whenever<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.100> push<00:03:29.280> the

I've<00:05:01.740> discovered<00:05:01.830> is<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.670> you<00:05:02.790> have<00:05:02.880> a

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
I've discovered is that if you have a

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.460 
I've discovered is that if you have a
command<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.420> is<00:05:03.660> allowed<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.930> be<00:05:04.140> run<00:05:04.320> when

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
command that is allowed to be run when

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.380 
command that is allowed to be run when
the<00:05:04.590> phone<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.860> locked<00:05:05.040> such<00:05:05.760> as<00:05:05.910> toggle<00:05:06.240> Wi-Fi

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
the phone is locked such as toggle Wi-Fi

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.020 
the phone is locked such as toggle Wi-Fi
or<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.720> flashlight<00:05:07.100> it'll<00:05:08.100> work<00:05:08.340> if<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.940> only

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
or a flashlight it'll work if and only

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.000 
or a flashlight it'll work if and only
if<00:05:09.240> your<00:05:10.050> trigger<00:05:10.320> starts<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.770> short

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
if your trigger starts to the short

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.510 
if your trigger starts to the short
pulse

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
pulse

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.750 
pulse
so<00:05:12.360> right<00:05:12.480> now<00:05:12.600> Wi-Fi<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.050> on<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:14.430> they<00:05:14.580> lock

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
so right now Wi-Fi is on and they lock

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.260 
so right now Wi-Fi is on and they lock
the<00:05:14.910> phone<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.880> then

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
the phone and then

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.800 
the phone and then
-<00:05:19.930> pulses<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:21.810> Wi-Fi<00:05:22.810> is<00:05:22.870> off<00:05:24.569> again<00:05:25.569> this

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
- pulses and Wi-Fi is off again this

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.050 
- pulses and Wi-Fi is off again this
only<00:05:25.990> works<00:05:26.470> if<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:27.430> starts<00:05:27.699> with<00:05:27.789> a<00:05:27.849> short

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
only works if it starts with a short

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.469 
only works if it starts with a short
pulse<00:05:28.270> so<00:05:28.990> I'm<00:05:29.050> gonna<00:05:29.139> turn<00:05:29.319> Wi-Fi<00:05:29.680> back<00:05:29.860> on

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
pulse so I'm gonna turn Wi-Fi back on

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.170 
pulse so I'm gonna turn Wi-Fi back on
just<00:05:31.479> cuz<00:05:31.660> it's<00:05:31.810> easier<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:32.169> see<00:05:32.789> but<00:05:33.789> if<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:34.000> try

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
just cuz it's easier to see but if I try

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.779 
just cuz it's easier to see but if I try
to<00:05:34.240> trigger<00:05:34.509> this<00:05:34.780> with<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.440> long<00:05:35.770> pulse<00:05:41.789> when

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
to trigger this with a long pulse when

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:54.450 
to trigger this with a long pulse when
the<00:05:42.849> phone<00:05:43.030> is<00:05:43.060> off<00:05:43.330> it<00:05:44.229> won't<00:05:44.380> work<00:05:50.669> so<00:05:53.460> the

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
the phone is off it won't work so the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.180 
the phone is off it won't work so the
trigger<00:05:54.639> has<00:05:54.909> to<00:05:55.120> start<00:05:55.479> with<00:05:55.539> a<00:05:55.659> short<00:05:55.870> pulse

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
trigger has to start with a short pulse

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.520 
trigger has to start with a short pulse
that<00:05:57.190> limits<00:05:57.610> you<00:05:57.759> to<00:05:58.000> three<00:05:58.470> commands

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.080 

because<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.680> have<00:06:02.770> one<00:06:03.069> short<00:06:03.220> pulse<00:06:03.550> two

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
because you have one short pulse two

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.980 
because you have one short pulse two
short<00:06:04.300> pulse<00:06:04.569> or<00:06:05.139> three<00:06:05.409> short<00:06:05.620> pulses<00:06:06.990> so

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
short pulse or three short pulses so

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.689 
short pulse or three short pulses so
hopefully<00:06:08.409> the<00:06:08.560> Pressy<00:06:08.979> team<00:06:09.159> updates<00:06:09.580> the

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
hopefully the Pressy team updates the

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.370 
hopefully the Pressy team updates the

people have been running into and that's
