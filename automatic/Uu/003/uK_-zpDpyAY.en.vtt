otherwise you can put that as well as
you<00:02:28.019> don't<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> dehydrator<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:29.750> Banali

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you don't have a dehydrator in Banali

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.640 
you don't have a dehydrator in Banali
so<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.250> pot<00:02:32.730> with<00:02:33.450> water<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:34.500> you

bowl up and then it will you notice the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.310 
bowl up and then it will you notice the
heat<00:02:39.810> will<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.440> melt<00:02:41.600> then<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.810> next<00:02:43.140> thing

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
heat will just melt then the next thing

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.400 
heat will just melt then the next thing
you<00:02:43.470> want<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:44.130> add<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.060> calculator<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.200> have
