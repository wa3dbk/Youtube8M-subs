00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.190
 So I grabbed the novel 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.040
 The novel tells you a bit about the group phase of his 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.619
 View run 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.539
 the man to start the first game 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.559
 since the first game 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.069
 still in the front 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:16.049
 17 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.009
 but much stronger than expected 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.009
 that do not really come into play 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.119
 there is a Alexandre Weill not really good hit but to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:26.730
 right holds 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.960
 lost in the end even when it was scarce 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 could and his next play still in ninth place 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.660
 no longer on a poster also the group stage against against conquers as 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 difficult but that is against any Team Australia 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.070
 rock solid 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.780
 I think 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.770
 Limburg II not very good though 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.350
 it was also in Rome and the result when we win the first round CD 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.340
 Did you know that every game win? 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.600
 although time was difficult and also one or the other tight lap 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.550
 are processed 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.550
 conwert all satisfied with our performance 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.580
 I think that the result is okay, it was relatively close 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.970
 but still 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.260
 thinking to close the car earlier 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.240
 Heidi Weko where they are with full-blown jeans we will not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.700
 prevent 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.970
 it has to go out a bit 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.620
 Sender found 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.730
 then here are generally surprised that it is already expected that he 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.150
 Not 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 strong playing 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.990
 as the cheapest belongs 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.300
 relative 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 Utl a good player in Kirdorf 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.630
 Customer teams such as Greven have played and Prof 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.120
 could celebrate some successes 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.250
 as she encountered here relationship to Russia God loves you now 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.000
 personally not thought 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.340
 play so well 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.760
 I think the map two was not quite cheap for us if Lucas thoughtful 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.710
 is relatively fresh 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.560
 also not insured now for some time playing together or on the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.370
 the artist to further optimize 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.650
 go out of Jan 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.660
 it should be a direction 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 the reasonableness would be given to sludge 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.179
 River can come 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.179
 per week to our customers because you stop too little money 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.679
 Buying or saving all the offenders and when buying is the risk 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.949
 relatively high that you are discussed 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.039
 There comes so bad rhythm and it gets fast 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 one exchanges bakes one loves 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 therefore 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.109
 just because the unpredictable want 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.719
 by the occurrence of 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.939
 Do IT for you 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.499
 amazed or off 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:43.229
 But you do not have to be exactly the one you do not meet with me 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.989
 Last year, relatively fast going in the community 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.059
 In vain I have also had in advance 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.149
 but that a bit surprised but so strong against us on the 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.639
 is there still two or 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.389
 like that in my opinion just because we ranked a couple 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.039
 Do not have that much self-confidence right now 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.909
 so i think i am 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.319
 Goats but actually does not actually count 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.319
 I think we are relatively good at the fire though 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 Mundt dismissed the fact that he already agreed 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.429
 XML or close 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.259
 Veteran who play what 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.089
 can stand and always 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.629
 April unusual 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.439
 Federer through 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.309
 That was almost eleven minutes until the war front Macy s ish 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:33.539
 again there is no money 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.169
 End time Gibbs 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.459
 Every day you have the most likely 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.459
 Stevia is also so that I have some conclusions and 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.939
 Adelbert understatement 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.989
 and thereby actually two pieces with 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.989
 Schenk and the UN, so to speak, "but the development becomes easy 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.489
 on or educator 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.759
 carrying part 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.849
 you always have to be interested in heroes as many others 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:01.889
 or Washington 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.889
 Mertesacker had to 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.459
 who have passed underweight blood 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.959
 because we knew that we were offensive and it is committed 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.829
 Olympique 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.959
 May AFP - if wanted by doing 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.959
 and we have just targeted and Hamburg Munich and Leverkusen 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.050
 did not go up German team 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.930
 but still relatively high 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.150
 become clear but happy to win the test matches 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.050
 and of course every game 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.909
 and on went against and 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.969
 sales and laterally so successful and third place 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:39.230
 on the last question 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.849
 for what it's better here 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.539
 as the next opponent PC or 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.539
 Name changed 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.939
 "When I hit the ball 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.090
 unpleasant Bailey l 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.090
 because he does not really earn anything 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.559
 That's why both companies have to go play 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.739
 the Queen is finally playing so Einstein will be watered and 

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.729
