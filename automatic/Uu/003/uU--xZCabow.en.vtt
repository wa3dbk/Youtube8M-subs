00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.610

 shots wait shot do not you give to the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.189
 simulators to learn from the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.500
 circuits that that was given before 

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:01.479
 start the world championship yes we 're good what 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.400
 We used a lot to learn the 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.900
 circuits including circuits that do not 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.210
 we had run but the formula one to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.960
 the best yes yes that to know the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.750
 traced is logical that was missing 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.729
 in exchange from the level and that's why not 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.490
 you can not see it or try it on the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.930
 game no matter how real it is, but yes 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.170
 the layout is important 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.750
 know him and yes that helped us to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.159
 learn it before going out on track and you 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.869
 you have hit a bit with the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.770
 video game console among the agents of 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.930
 paddock or if during the planes with the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.350
 psp jornales and niko I ever 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.149
 also playing the motogp as marking 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.530
 times in some circuit yes I have 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.770
 I saw my very bad brother very 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.539
 vitiated with niko a lot with terol and to see 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.100
 who bit the fastest time and did not 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.320
 I know how I was doing I do not know who won 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.610
 the last one arrives the new generation of 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.770
 video game consoles I think you're there at 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.440
 I am already from the sale looking for 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.240
 we will create here what do you think is good 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.940
 well I was playing a little bit 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.320
 but but I liked it a lot, I think 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.510
 If I have to play well, I have to 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.490
 practice much more but not very real 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.310
 car brake did see if 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 marked the line with abs and all not very 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.750
 real very very real pulling already to life to 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.340
 the real life at the end because we will have 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.010
 we can climb inside the car when 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.470
 the play and have even accidents but 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.660
