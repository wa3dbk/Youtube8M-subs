actually<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.850> tutorial<00:00:18.210> video<00:00:18.449> up

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
actually do have a tutorial video up

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.960 
actually do have a tutorial video up
with<00:00:18.930> how<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.080> perform<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.710> six<00:00:19.949> pool<00:00:20.189> now

with how to perform the six pool now

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
with how to perform the six pool now
we're<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.449> we're<00:00:21.840> looking<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> map<00:00:22.410> steps<00:00:23.189> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
we're on we're looking at a map steps of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.519 
we're on we're looking at a map steps of
war<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.300> very<00:00:24.689> dangerous<00:00:24.930> map<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
war this is a very dangerous map to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.929 
war this is a very dangerous map to
encounter<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:26.130> sort<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.490> early<00:00:26.789> game

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
encounter any sort of early game

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
encounter any sort of early game
aggression<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> rush<00:00:27.960> distance<00:00:28.380> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
aggression because the rush distance is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.620 
aggression because the rush distance is
incredibly<00:00:29.010> short<00:00:29.250> don't<00:00:30.119> quote<00:00:30.359> me<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
incredibly short don't quote me on this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
incredibly short don't quote me on this
but<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> shortest<00:00:32.219> rush

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
but I do think this is the shortest rush

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
but I do think this is the shortest rush
distance<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> game<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.559> players

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
distance in the game for two players

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.280 
distance in the game for two players
Maps<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.790> pretty<00:00:36.210> ridiculous<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:36.960> quickly

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
Maps it's pretty ridiculous how quickly

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.930 
Maps it's pretty ridiculous how quickly
you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.190> forces<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.820> your

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you can get now your forces to your

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.180 
you can get now your forces to your
opponent's<00:00:39.300> base<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.350> because<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> six

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
opponent's base so because of that a six

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.190 
opponent's base so because of that a six
pool<00:00:41.399> becomes<00:00:41.610> especially<00:00:42.329> dangerous<00:00:42.570> I'm

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
pool becomes especially dangerous I'm

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
pool becomes especially dangerous I'm
now<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.950> mind<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.550> facing<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> Zerg

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
now with that in mind when facing a Zerg

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910 
now with that in mind when facing a Zerg
opponent<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.050> map<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.559> always<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> good

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
opponent on this map it's always a good

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.350 
opponent on this map it's always a good
idea<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.370> ahead<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.670> scout<00:00:47.879> them<00:00:48.059> early

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
idea to go ahead and scout them early

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
idea to go ahead and scout them early
I'm<00:00:48.690> asking<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> Protoss<00:00:49.620> player<00:00:49.860> here

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I'm asking to see a Protoss player here

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
I'm asking to see a Protoss player here
is<00:00:50.219> scouting<00:00:50.489> right<00:00:51.210> after<00:00:51.660> he<00:00:51.870> drops<00:00:52.260> his

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
is scouting right after he drops his

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.529 
is scouting right after he drops his
first<00:00:52.739> pylon<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.460> want<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.059> first<00:00:54.300> first

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
first pylon as I want one first first

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.110 
first pylon as I want one first first
pylon<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:55.050> nine<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.530> brought<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.670> scout<00:00:56.940> out

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
pylon at nine I brought this scout out

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
pylon at nine I brought this scout out
because<00:00:57.300> again<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:57.930> small<00:00:58.079> map<00:00:58.500> very<00:00:58.859> short

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
because again very small map very short

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
because again very small map very short
rush<00:00:59.280> distance<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.270> were<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.629> face<00:01:00.809> his

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
rush distance if we were to face his

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.680 
rush distance if we were to face his
exposure<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.399> very<00:01:02.940> dangerous<00:01:03.210> for

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
exposure it would be very dangerous for

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
exposure it would be very dangerous for
us<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.439> bringing<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> scout<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:05.400> going

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
us so bringing in the scout we're going

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.740 
us so bringing in the scout we're going
to<00:01:05.580> take<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> look<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.030> his<00:01:06.150> vision<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> see

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to take a look at his vision to see

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.969 
to take a look at his vision to see
exactly<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
exactly what they see it's just so you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
exactly what they see it's just so you
can<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> expect<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.330> moving<00:01:09.600> in

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
can know what to expect when moving in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
can know what to expect when moving in
as<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.340> move<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.700> he's<00:01:11.909> got<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
as you can see you move in he's got a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
as you can see you move in he's got a
spawning<00:01:12.390> pool<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.170> six<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.650> seven

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
spawning pool and about six or seven

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
spawning pool and about six or seven
drones<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.640> telling<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.360> there

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
drones that's telling it right there

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810 
drones that's telling it right there
he's<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> six<00:01:16.950> pool<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.549> gonna<00:01:17.670> be

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
he's going for a six pool it's gonna be

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.280 
he's going for a six pool it's gonna be
hitting<00:01:18.060> me<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.390> early<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.930> some<00:01:18.960> serve

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
hitting me very early with some serve

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
hitting me very early with some serve
lengths<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> proper<00:01:20.610> response<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
lengths so the proper response then is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.410 
lengths so the proper response then is
to<00:01:21.780> wall<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.369> particular<00:01:23.909> map<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
to wall off on this particular map in a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
to wall off on this particular map in a
lot<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> cases<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
lot of cases what you can do it with the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
lot of cases what you can do it with the
larger<00:01:27.390> maps<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.470> make<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> small

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
larger maps is you can just make a small

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.789 
larger maps is you can just make a small
choke<00:01:30.000> point<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.479> stick<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.020> zealot<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.650> or

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
choke point and stick your zealot one or

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
choke point and stick your zealot one or
two<00:01:31.920> zealots<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.090> would

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
two zealots right there and that would

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.749 
two zealots right there and that would
stop<00:01:33.509> any<00:01:33.689> incoming<00:01:34.079> Zerg<00:01:34.409> links<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.369> problem

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
stop any incoming Zerg links the problem

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.600 
stop any incoming Zerg links the problem
with<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.000> particular<00:01:36.210> map<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.610> again

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
with this particular map is that again

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.920 
with this particular map is that again
it's<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:38.939> small<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's so small that they can have the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.569 
it's so small that they can have the
zerglings<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.500> before<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.220> get

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
zerglings in before you can actually get

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.120 
zerglings in before you can actually get
your<00:01:41.640> first<00:01:42.060> sell<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.479> out<00:01:42.770> making<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> pretty

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
your first sell it out making it pretty

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
your first sell it out making it pretty
much<00:01:44.369> impossible<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:45.119> did<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.479> block

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
much impossible now did it block

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
much impossible now did it block
ourselves<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.460> not

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
ourselves in here but it's really not

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.600 
ourselves in here but it's really not
that<00:01:47.939> huge<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> deal<00:01:48.979> because<00:01:49.979> again<00:01:50.430> what

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that huge of a deal because again what

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
that huge of a deal because again what
we're<00:01:50.759> looking<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.720> choke<00:01:51.960> as

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
we're looking to do is get this choke as

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.889 
we're looking to do is get this choke as
you<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.860> Zerg<00:01:53.070> player<00:01:53.340> here<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
you can see the Zerg player here is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.149 
you can see the Zerg player here is
knocking<00:01:54.899> off<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.200> pylon<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.829> he<00:01:55.950> knows

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
knocking off that pylon because he knows

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
knocking off that pylon because he knows
that<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.000> choke<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.810> weakest<00:01:58.170> point

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that with this choke the weakest point

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.719 
that with this choke the weakest point
is<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.860> pylon<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.610> can

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
is going to be that pylon so if you can

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.889 
is going to be that pylon so if you can
take<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.119> he's<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.750> able<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
take that out he's going to be able to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.260 
take that out he's going to be able to
break<00:02:01.110> into<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> base<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.060> what

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
break into the base so basically what

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.819 
break into the base so basically what
you<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.630> do<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.869> upon<00:02:04.170> seeing<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> six

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
you want to do is upon seeing the six

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.069 
you want to do is upon seeing the six
pool<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.360> go<00:02:06.450> ahead<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> wall

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
pool you want to go ahead and get a wall

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.960 
pool you want to go ahead and get a wall
off<00:02:07.259> we're<00:02:07.560> looking<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.860> doing<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.369> two<00:02:08.550> gateway

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
off we're looking at doing a two gateway

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.790 
off we're looking at doing a two gateway
wall<00:02:09.239> off<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.009> trying<00:02:11.459> to

wall off right here and then trying to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.620 
wall off right here and then trying to
boost<00:02:12.130> out<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> zealot<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.850> time<00:02:13.030> before<00:02:13.480> these

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
boost out a zealot in time before these

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.180 
boost out a zealot in time before these

arguments combusted or as you can see

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.340 
arguments combusted or as you can see
we're<00:02:15.430> only<00:02:15.640> not<00:02:16.270> even<00:02:16.300> three<00:02:16.780> minutes<00:02:17.050> into

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
we're only not even three minutes into

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.350 
we're only not even three minutes into
game<00:02:17.560> time<00:02:17.830> which<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.220> more<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:18.610> almost<00:02:19.090> two

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
game time which is more like almost two

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
minutes in real time and we already have

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.260 
minutes in real time and we already have
certain<00:02:21.310> things<00:02:21.400> knocking<00:02:21.850> at<00:02:21.970> our<00:02:22.090> front

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
certain things knocking at our front

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.030

first elk go ahead and chrono boost it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.260 
first elk go ahead and chrono boost it
out<00:02:26.070> try<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.100> say<00:02:27.310> your<00:02:27.490> rally<00:02:27.640> point<00:02:27.940> right

out try to say your rally point right

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.600 
out try to say your rally point right
outside<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:28.960> that<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.890> zealot<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.370> pop<00:02:30.580> right

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
outside so that the zealot can pop right

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.760 
outside so that the zealot can pop right
out<00:02:30.970> unfortunately<00:02:31.840> there<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.350> little<00:02:32.650> bit

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770

out unfortunately there was a little bit
of<00:02:32.890> issue<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.460> L<00:02:33.610> did<00:02:33.850> go<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.210> wrong

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
of issue that is L did go on the wrong

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.830 
of issue that is L did go on the wrong
side<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.430> as<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.730> see<00:02:36.790> here<00:02:37.180> because<00:02:37.390> of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
side and as you can see here because of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.120 
side and as you can see here because of
that<00:02:37.960> these<00:02:38.200> Earthlings<00:02:38.620> are<00:02:38.800> gonna<00:02:38.950> actually

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
that these Earthlings are gonna actually

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.030 
that these Earthlings are gonna actually
be<00:02:39.340> able<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.520> take<00:02:39.700> down<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:41.290> gateway<00:02:41.650> they

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
be able to take down this gateway they

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.830 
be able to take down this gateway they
took<00:02:42.220> down<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.550> pylon<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.390> we're<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.690> very

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
took down that pylon so we're in a very

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.300 
took down that pylon so we're in a very
tough<00:02:44.080> spot<00:02:44.260> right<00:02:44.440> here<00:02:44.620> at<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.950> Protoss

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
tough spot right here at the Protoss

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.490 
tough spot right here at the Protoss
player<00:02:45.610> but<00:02:45.820> all<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.540> not<00:02:46.570> lost<00:02:46.750> yet<00:02:47.200> we're

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
player but all is not lost yet we're

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.050 
player but all is not lost yet we're
finishing<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.460> wall<00:02:48.640> off<00:02:48.820> we're<00:02:49.000> gonna

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
finishing that wall off we're gonna

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.850 
finishing that wall off we're gonna
continue<00:02:49.330> building<00:02:49.780> behind<00:02:50.260> these<00:02:50.410> buildings

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
continue building behind these buildings

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.860 
continue building behind these buildings
so<00:02:51.370> if<00:02:51.460> they<00:02:51.610> knock<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.970> down<00:02:52.000> we're<00:02:52.840> still

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
so if they knock it down we're still

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.970 
very low economy they should have very
little<00:04:15.160> on<00:04:15.280> their<00:04:15.430> base<00:04:15.640> at<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.480> point<00:04:16.980> so

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
little on their base at this point so

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.270 
little on their base at this point so
you<00:04:18.010> should<00:04:18.340> do<00:04:18.459> pretty<00:04:18.970> well<00:04:19.180> against<00:04:20.080> them

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
you should do pretty well against them

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.680 
you should do pretty well against them
if<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.430> just<00:04:21.460> knock<00:04:21.970> out<00:04:22.150> some<00:04:22.360> zealots

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
if you just knock out some zealots

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.850 
if you just knock out some zealots
really<00:04:22.930> quickly<00:04:23.289> hit<00:04:23.470> them<00:04:23.620> hard<00:04:23.979> and

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
really quickly hit them hard and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.189 
really quickly hit them hard and
them<00:04:25.069> fast<00:04:25.449> again<00:04:26.449> you<00:04:26.629> haven't<00:04:26.810> had<00:04:27.080> your

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
them fast again you haven't had your

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.749 
them fast again you haven't had your
economy<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.770> serve<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.129> all<00:04:28.219> because<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.550> did

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
economy to serve it all because you did

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.670 
economy to serve it all because you did
manage<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.090> wall<00:04:29.419> that<00:04:29.629> in<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.080> stop<00:04:30.349> the<00:04:30.379> Zerg

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
manage to wall that in and stop the Zerg

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.020 
manage to wall that in and stop the Zerg
mix<00:04:30.889> from<00:04:31.009> getting<00:04:31.280> in<00:04:31.340> your<00:04:31.460> base<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:31.969> you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
mix from getting in your base so you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.869 
mix from getting in your base so you
should<00:04:32.360> be<00:04:32.509> all<00:04:32.629> set<00:04:32.930> for<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.229> most<00:04:33.379> part

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 
should be all set for the most part

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.920 
should be all set for the most part
moving<00:04:34.879> in<00:04:34.969> with<00:04:35.120> these<00:04:35.240> four<00:04:35.479> zealots<00:04:35.810> can

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
moving in with these four zealots can

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.360 
moving in with these four zealots can
see<00:04:36.139> what<00:04:36.289> damage<00:04:36.439> we<00:04:36.710> can<00:04:36.830> do<00:04:36.949> again<00:04:37.189> they<00:04:37.310> do

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
see what damage we can do again they do

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.640 
see what damage we can do again they do
have<00:04:37.610> very<00:04:37.819> little<00:04:38.020> they<00:04:39.020> are<00:04:39.050> building<00:04:39.319> spine

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
have very little they are building spine

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.230 
have very little they are building spine
crawler<00:04:39.889> which<00:04:40.069> is<00:04:40.189> very<00:04:40.340> smart<00:04:40.580> at<00:04:41.120> this

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
crawler which is very smart at this

crawler which is very smart at this
point<00:04:41.509> of<00:04:41.599> the<00:04:41.689> game<00:04:41.810> that's<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.080> only<00:04:42.259> thing

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 
point of the game that's the only thing

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.200 
point of the game that's the only thing
that's<00:04:42.590> really<00:04:42.710> going<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:42.979> help<00:04:43.520> defend<00:04:43.939> them

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
that's really going to help defend them

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.360 
that's really going to help defend them

get behind you at all that's that's when
you're<00:04:58.550> gonna<00:04:58.639> be<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:59.000> weakest<00:04:59.360> there<00:04:59.539> as<00:04:59.659> you

00:04:59.769 --> 00:04:59.779 
you're gonna be the weakest there as you

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.570 
you're gonna be the weakest there as you
can<00:04:59.810> see<00:04:59.930> pulling<00:05:00.560> some<00:05:00.740> units<00:05:01.009> behind<00:05:01.189> to

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
can see pulling some units behind to

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.209 
can see pulling some units behind to
kill<00:05:01.759> off<00:05:01.909> new<00:05:02.120> zealots

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
kill off new zealots

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.529 
kill off new zealots
so<00:05:04.219> yeah<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.490> just<00:05:04.699> want<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.180> make<00:05:05.300> sure<00:05:05.449> you

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
so yeah you just want to make sure you

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.610 
so yeah you just want to make sure you
try<00:05:05.719> not<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.990> get<00:05:06.139> into<00:05:06.289> that<00:05:06.439> position

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
try not to get into that position

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.490 
try not to get into that position
basically<00:05:07.629> it's<00:05:08.629> kind<00:05:08.870> of<00:05:09.020> tough<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.199> do

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
basically it's kind of tough to do

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.839 
basically it's kind of tough to do
obviously<00:05:09.710> because<00:05:10.400> there<00:05:10.520> aren't<00:05:10.729> always

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
obviously because there aren't always

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.450 
obviously because there aren't always
walls<00:05:11.810> for<00:05:12.379> you<00:05:12.439> to<00:05:12.529> put<00:05:12.680> your<00:05:12.770> back<00:05:12.949> against

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
walls for you to put your back against

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.790 
walls for you to put your back against
especially<00:05:14.029> with<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.050> spine<00:05:15.319> crawler<00:05:15.620> here

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
especially with the spine crawler here

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.219 
especially with the spine crawler here
that<00:05:15.979> made<00:05:16.129> that<00:05:16.250> difficult<00:05:16.819> but<00:05:17.060> we've<00:05:17.960> still

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
that made that difficult but we've still

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.689 
that made that difficult but we've still
been<00:05:18.259> making<00:05:18.650> our<00:05:18.740> zealots<00:05:19.039> this<00:05:19.129> entire<00:05:19.490> time

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
been making our zealots this entire time

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.010 
been making our zealots this entire time
even<00:05:19.759> where<00:05:20.210> that<00:05:20.360> while<00:05:20.539> that<00:05:20.569> engagement

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
even where that while that engagement

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.740 
even where that while that engagement
was<00:05:21.349> going<00:05:21.680> on<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:22.789> know<00:05:22.909> you<00:05:22.969> always<00:05:23.539> want<00:05:23.719> to

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
was going on you know you always want to

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.390 
was going on you know you always want to
make<00:05:23.840> sure<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.169> stay<00:05:24.349> on<00:05:24.379> top<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.740> your<00:05:24.889> macro

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
make sure you stay on top of your macro

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.939 
make sure you stay on top of your macro
and<00:05:26.330> once<00:05:26.599> we<00:05:26.750> get<00:05:26.840> another<00:05:27.080> sizable<00:05:27.590> force<00:05:27.830> to

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
and once we get another sizable force to

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
dealt I mean we were just in his base we

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:30.909 
dealt I mean we were just in his base we
saw<00:05:29.779> what<00:05:29.960> he<00:05:30.020> had<00:05:30.199> which<00:05:30.409> was<00:05:30.589> absolutely

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
saw what he had which was absolutely

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.800 
saw what he had which was absolutely
nothing<00:05:31.190> one<00:05:31.520> spine<00:05:31.819> crawler<00:05:32.089> spawning<00:05:32.479> full

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
nothing one spine crawler spawning full

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.619 
nothing one spine crawler spawning full
couple<00:05:33.500> drones<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:33.949> the<00:05:34.039> Queen<00:05:34.339> once<00:05:35.300> we<00:05:35.479> get

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
couple drones and the Queen once we get

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.809 
couple drones and the Queen once we get
about<00:05:35.870> I<00:05:36.169> don't<00:05:36.620> know<00:05:36.710> eight<00:05:37.009> or<00:05:37.250> ten<00:05:37.460> village

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
about I don't know eight or ten village

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:39.219 
about I don't know eight or ten village
and<00:05:38.000> we<00:05:38.089> move<00:05:38.270> in<00:05:38.449> that's<00:05:38.659> pretty<00:05:38.900> much<00:05:39.050> going

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
and we move in that's pretty much going

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.779 
and we move in that's pretty much going
to<00:05:39.319> be<00:05:39.409> into<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:39.740> game<00:05:39.919> he's<00:05:40.310> not<00:05:40.490> gonna<00:05:40.669> have

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
to be into the game he's not gonna have

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.100 
to be into the game he's not gonna have
enough<00:05:40.969> at<00:05:41.120> that<00:05:41.240> point<00:05:41.479> to<00:05:41.599> stop<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.050> that's

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
enough at that point to stop and that's

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.420 
enough at that point to stop and that's
exactly<00:05:42.409> what<00:05:42.680> we're<00:05:42.830> doing<00:05:42.949> here

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
exactly what we're doing here

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.550 
exactly what we're doing here
and<00:05:44.210> getting<00:05:44.509> ready<00:05:44.629> for<00:05:44.750> a<00:05:44.900> transition<00:05:45.409> just

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
and getting ready for a transition just

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.260 
and getting ready for a transition just
in<00:05:45.740> case<00:05:45.919> it's<00:05:46.099> necessary<00:05:46.279> and<00:05:46.849> we<00:05:47.029> stopped

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
in case it's necessary and we stopped

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.790 
in case it's necessary and we stopped
the<00:05:47.419> six<00:05:47.629> pool<00:05:47.839> and<00:05:48.020> we<00:05:48.139> feel<00:05:48.469> like<00:05:48.620> we're

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
the six pool and we feel like we're

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.689 
the six pool and we feel like we're
probably<00:05:48.889> gonna<00:05:49.159> be<00:05:49.279> able<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.460> kill<00:05:49.610> them

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
probably gonna be able to kill them

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.279 
probably gonna be able to kill them
right<00:05:49.849> now<00:05:50.000> but<00:05:50.389> that<00:05:50.569> doesn't<00:05:50.900> mean<00:05:50.990> that<00:05:51.050> we

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
right now but that doesn't mean that we

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:52.659 
right now but that doesn't mean that we
shouldn't<00:05:51.440> prepare<00:05:51.830> for<00:05:52.009> the<00:05:52.069> possibility<00:05:52.639> of

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
shouldn't prepare for the possibility of

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.850 
shouldn't prepare for the possibility of
them<00:05:52.849> not<00:05:53.029> dying<00:05:53.330> so<00:05:54.229> we're<00:05:54.349> gonna<00:05:54.439> be<00:05:54.620> start

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
them not dying so we're gonna be start

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.339 
them not dying so we're gonna be start
getting<00:05:55.129> some<00:05:55.339> gas<00:05:55.520> at<00:05:56.060> this<00:05:56.419> point<00:05:56.750> and

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
getting some gas at this point and

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:58.540 
getting some gas at this point and
probably<00:05:57.710> going<00:05:57.979> to<00:05:58.039> be<00:05:58.099> looking<00:05:58.310> to<00:05:58.370> get<00:05:58.490> a

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
probably going to be looking to get a

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.070 
probably going to be looking to get a
cyber<00:05:58.819> nice<00:05:59.060> core<00:05:59.330> after<00:05:59.419> this<00:05:59.719> so<00:05:59.870> we<00:05:59.960> can

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
cyber nice core after this so we can

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.619 
cyber nice core after this so we can
tack<00:06:00.289> up<00:06:00.469> if<00:06:00.650> necessary<00:06:01.270> but<00:06:02.270> this<00:06:02.419> is

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 
tack up if necessary but this is

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.390 
tack up if necessary but this is
probably<00:06:03.349> going<00:06:03.589> to<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.800> end<00:06:03.949> of<00:06:04.069> the<00:06:04.159> player

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
probably going to the end of the player

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.029 
probably going to the end of the player
here<00:06:04.839> again<00:06:05.839> they<00:06:05.990> sacrificed<00:06:06.529> our<00:06:06.650> economy

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
here again they sacrificed our economy

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.769 
here again they sacrificed our economy
so<00:06:07.189> much<00:06:07.370> by<00:06:07.580> going<00:06:07.789> for<00:06:07.909> that<00:06:07.969> hard<00:06:08.240> six<00:06:08.539> pool

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
so much by going for that hard six pool

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.019 
so much by going for that hard six pool
that<00:06:09.650> there<00:06:09.889> really<00:06:10.159> is<00:06:10.370> little<00:06:10.669> they<00:06:10.789> can<00:06:10.939> do

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
that there really is little they can do

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.129 
that there really is little they can do
to<00:06:11.180> recover<00:06:11.449> even<00:06:11.870> if<00:06:12.229> they<00:06:12.439> play<00:06:12.710> wisely

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
to recover even if they play wisely

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.450 
to recover even if they play wisely
trying<00:06:15.139> to<00:06:15.229> get<00:06:15.319> a<00:06:15.349> roche<00:06:15.589> warren<00:06:15.889> here<00:06:16.189> and<00:06:16.370> in

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
trying to get a roche warren here and in

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.040 
trying to get a roche warren here and in
fact<00:06:16.639> got<00:06:16.909> up<00:06:17.060> and<00:06:17.240> we've<00:06:17.360> been<00:06:17.539> and<00:06:17.750> he<00:06:17.870> did

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
fact got up and we've been and he did

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.300 
fact got up and we've been and he did
get<00:06:18.199> some<00:06:18.349> roaches<00:06:18.529> out<00:06:18.800> then<00:06:19.009> that<00:06:19.159> would<00:06:19.279> be

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
get some roaches out then that would be

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.829 
get some roaches out then that would be
very<00:06:19.430> difficult<00:06:20.000> for<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.210> Protoss<00:06:20.569> player

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839 
very difficult for the Protoss player

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.079 
very difficult for the Protoss player
but<00:06:21.169> just<00:06:21.979> trying<00:06:22.159> to<00:06:22.250> knock<00:06:22.400> off<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.789> SAS

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089 
but just trying to knock off the SAS

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:25.030 
but just trying to knock off the SAS
farming<00:06:23.990> pool

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
farming pool

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.470 
farming pool
which<00:06:25.430> is<00:06:25.520> our<00:06:25.640> players<00:06:25.850> gonna<00:06:26.060> be<00:06:26.120> moving<00:06:26.390> up

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
which is our players gonna be moving up

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.970 
which is our players gonna be moving up
his<00:06:26.630> units<00:06:26.990> but<00:06:27.290> it's<00:06:27.470> not<00:06:27.620> gonna<00:06:27.800> be<00:06:27.860> enough

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
his units but it's not gonna be enough

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.680 
his units but it's not gonna be enough
these<00:06:28.220> zealots<00:06:28.460> are<00:06:28.640> so<00:06:28.850> so<00:06:29.120> strong<00:06:29.420> or<00:06:29.660> the

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
these zealots are so so strong or the

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.320 
these zealots are so so strong or the
game<00:06:29.990> that's<00:06:30.980> pretty<00:06:31.400> much<00:06:31.610> gonna<00:06:31.880> be<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.210> end

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
game that's pretty much gonna be the end

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.940 
game that's pretty much gonna be the end
of<00:06:32.420> the<00:06:32.540> game<00:06:32.720> right<00:06:32.930> here<00:06:33.200> and<00:06:33.500> me<00:06:33.620> take<00:06:33.830> it

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
of the game right here and me take it

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.000 
of the game right here and me take it
out<00:06:35.080> taking<00:06:36.080> out<00:06:36.170> that<00:06:36.320> spine<00:06:36.590> probably

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
out taking out that spine probably

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.620 
out taking out that spine probably
taking<00:06:37.460> out<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.730> Queen<00:06:38.000> and<00:06:38.210> then<00:06:38.300> probably

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
taking out that Queen and then probably

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.880 
taking out that Queen and then probably
going<00:06:38.810> straight<00:06:39.020> for<00:06:39.170> the<00:06:39.230> hatchery<00:06:39.620> after

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
going straight for the hatchery after

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.160 
going straight for the hatchery after
that<00:06:40.010> point<00:06:40.310> so<00:06:40.760> yeah<00:06:40.970> I<00:06:41.300> just<00:06:41.600> again<00:06:41.840> a<00:06:41.900> quick

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
that point so yeah I just again a quick

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.710 
that point so yeah I just again a quick
overview<00:06:42.500> as<00:06:42.740> to<00:06:42.770> what<00:06:42.980> to<00:06:43.100> do<00:06:43.250> come<00:06:44.210> on<00:06:44.390> such<00:06:44.690> a

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
overview as to what to do come on such a

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.360 
overview as to what to do come on such a
small<00:06:45.020> map<00:06:45.230> like<00:06:45.440> this<00:06:45.620> it's<00:06:45.860> always<00:06:46.040> good<00:06:46.340> to

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
small map like this it's always good to

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.460 
small map like this it's always good to
Scout<00:06:46.670> your<00:06:46.820> surrogate<00:06:47.030> ponent<00:06:47.390> early<00:06:47.660> if<00:06:48.290> you

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
Scout your surrogate ponent early if you

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.900 
Scout your surrogate ponent early if you
do<00:06:48.650> see<00:06:48.830> that<00:06:48.920> I'm<00:06:49.010> going<00:06:49.220> for<00:06:49.340> that<00:06:49.460> six<00:06:49.700> but

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
do see that I'm going for that six but

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.700 
do see that I'm going for that six but
what<00:06:50.030> you're<00:06:50.150> gonna<00:06:50.210> want<00:06:50.480> to<00:06:50.570> do<00:06:50.720> is<00:06:50.870> block

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
what you're gonna want to do is block

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.170 
what you're gonna want to do is block
off<00:06:51.950> because<00:06:52.250> you're<00:06:52.550> not<00:06:52.640> gonna<00:06:52.790> be<00:06:52.970> able<00:06:53.030> to

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
off because you're not gonna be able to

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.030 
off because you're not gonna be able to
get<00:06:53.420> out<00:06:53.600> a<00:06:53.630> zealot<00:06:54.110> in<00:06:54.230> time<00:06:54.440> before<00:06:54.710> they<00:06:54.950> get

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
get out a zealot in time before they get

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.590 
get out a zealot in time before they get
there<00:06:55.220> six<00:06:55.430> Durge<00:06:55.640> links<00:06:55.940> so<00:06:56.210> you<00:06:56.300> won't<00:06:56.480> be

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
there six Durge links so you won't be

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.120 
there six Durge links so you won't be
able<00:06:56.690> to<00:06:56.750> create<00:06:56.990> that<00:06:57.080> zealot<00:06:57.530> pinch<00:06:57.800> choke

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
able to create that zealot pinch choke

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.250 
able to create that zealot pinch choke
um<00:06:58.400> that<00:06:58.850> a<00:06:58.880> lot<00:06:59.060> of<00:06:59.150> players<00:06:59.360> like<00:06:59.450> to<00:06:59.720> do<00:06:59.840> just

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
um that a lot of players like to do just

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.900 
um that a lot of players like to do just
because<00:07:00.350> it's<00:07:00.590> so<00:07:00.740> small<00:07:00.800> you<00:07:01.280> won't<00:07:01.730> have

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
because it's so small you won't have
