00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.440
 Possibility of acquisition to save party expenses based on new 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.159
 was 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.159
 It is a work that is not different from multiple committees 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.710
 Even if you're operating after 11:30, it's not a big deal at all in color 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.710
 I'm listening 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.699
 The highest temperature on the day is that the Securities Commission will heat the street at the same hospital. 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.029
 It is not when using 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.319
 6 minutes later 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.990
 I think it's on the wall 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.790
 So there are no hits 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.580
 I will reply in the same building 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.030
 Tokyo Dome will be 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.350
 It is not enough to enter the Hall of Fame, but the warm air Dell is in the second half 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.850
 Foreigners will come to Japan until Japan 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.650
 The builder who attached them is still a camera in a few years 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.660
 I was following 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.200
 What the hell is this 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.860
 It is this correspondence 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.060
 High performance 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.290
 Accept it 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.620
 It is to give in that, but this is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.170
 It is a problem of solar panel, but 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560
 This is feverish, isn't it? 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.150
 That fever Tetsuo 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.090
 Sweet meat in the ventilation fan in that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.930
 Check it's simple 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.370
 One pair is quite easy, due to sunlight 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.980
 The temperature of the black aluminum panel rises at the outside 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.240
 The cold air that was thrown in was hit by this heat 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.130
 Being 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.529
 That it is circulated and heated through the story of solarpanel 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.010
 Enter this month into the room and warm up the leads 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.170
 It is the light law of the sun that you often see on the roof 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.820
 It is a solar panel to say, but this is a little different 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 It is a system 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
 I commented that it was like this 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.299
 Local securities 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.650
 Even at the experimental facility 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.420
 The temperature of this time when the wind of about Matsui blew in vigorously 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.250
 Is shopping street 8.8 times 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.230
 40-46% of air temperature heated and taken in by the parturition panel 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.640
 Before and after 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.410
 I have the same venue 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.140
 I just can not think that jr is the heat of the panel, but now 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140
 The place can adjust the humidity Figure 1 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.549
 Yesterday and today 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.309
 As outside temperature fell below 20 degrees 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.539
 Although it took around 20 o'clock in the US, though 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.959
 Stove type products in the morning 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.959
 It will not be from the place of that next 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.439
 It is one panel of people 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.290
 The same amount of message that burns 3 liters of voting 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.959
 It means that it can be taken into the room 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.959
 You can expect savings according to the task 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.690
 Before the opening ceremony of this day 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.899
 As usual with 245 accompanying mid-year products have not yet heard success 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:55.510
 I want to join even when growth in 2008 is large 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.899
 I take care of you 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.899
 I think that I was well done at the time of crime 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.989
 This layer is Asahikawa as a part of the previous work focusing on the current law tokachi 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.310
 Which house or facility is operating 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.310
 It is a system to be watched in the future 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.909
 I also say windows7 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.119
 Raw material price will be reversed in agent negotiations 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.339
 I can not cope with the Japanese defensive team 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.069
 A lot of it 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.109
 There was no other way to use this 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.079
 I also less
