00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.220
 and still only for the good 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.630
 there are no values 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.250
 in this video you are talking a little about the technique in which 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.160
 several guitarists 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.700
 others use and abuse 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.830
 I'm trying to spend a little of what I always do 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.830
 I'm going to start with those who know the correct position of the left hand 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.020
 When are you going to pick it up? 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.970
 on the guitar 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.980
 and make this time if you fail to see the colleague here in that region 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.790
 already with three 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.100
 Messi than we are of them is well concluded 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 this will hurt in many ways 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.520
 your performance with live matches 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.870
 and you will not be able to reach 100% of this system 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.710
 which can harm your hand 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.800
 what do you like doing you need 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.030
 only they go wrong 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.440
 the being is one puts google back here 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.010
 and I left once 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.910
 the clip is possible 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.220
 What difference do you decide to make? 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.890
 and you leave everything from the colleague here
