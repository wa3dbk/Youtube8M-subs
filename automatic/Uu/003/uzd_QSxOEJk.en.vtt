00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:06.210
 of artists of the bearings 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.830
 some artists present in the church and I'm already at 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.830
 the work were delivered to the camera 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.749
 this summer the censorship church of jura s turned into 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 the time of an exhibition 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050
 the third edition of the international workshop of tier artists 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.410
 and ideas have matured for five years since 2007 because we are a little hello 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.080
 artist concept 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.580
 Parisians have done 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.480
 and we find ourselves here we oppose we decided to 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.480
 extend it for a meeting that had already taken place in poland 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.380
 among others françois and polish 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.890
 and then as Richard lives on the naked plateau 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.640
 passionate crime 1st of July 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.990
 time after the artists make resistance on the set 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.990
 this third edition of that she said 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.440
 during the discussions we had impromptu between artists 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.310
 tadic why not give a title this title that lends itself well because the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.620
 artists are above all people who resist who resists at the hour go 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.430
 at the super boring 10% 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.180
 the current one and who to refuse mediocrity that counts depth in 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.200
 the horror in their work mulched we are here on the territory 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 of resistance lol I come from a region the northern mining basin where the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.330
 resistance to count even pear 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 I think the word came naturally 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.090
 between the 17th of July and the 15th of August, so it is 30 years 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.159
 contract workshop exhibitions of French artists 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.249
 the life of artists 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.030
 Europeans 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.909
 koné intention to develop in Corsica the partnership with artists of the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.420
 whole world this year we had 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.480
 colonel of florac 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.980
 Ukrainian 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 Roman 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.560
 many romanians 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.249
 nissan motor are at stake 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.689
 you share 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.429
 experience 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.719
 creative with strangers wait for champion of doubt 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.869
 and then hope a great chance that we could spot most of them down the 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:19.659
 closed off 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.109
 at the level of Slavic countries are driven by religion to chuck a 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.409
 nanny escapes 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.840
 relatively common 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.939
 it is once again that it is also and above all their job in the future 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.009
 much heavier gold 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.649
 accurate that others did 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.649
 are more attached to a tree at the realization 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.339
 we are no longer in the car in certainly 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.759
 this group of painters the opportunity to exchange 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.939
 and to indulge 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.939
 about abstract painting and art in general 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.910
 abstract painting it takes all the time 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.920
 the interiority of the character is a little all the portrait we are at 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.069
 looking for ourselves when everything goes crazy 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.019
 we are not in the process 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.719
 why present something while white laurent hurt me to 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.669
 the essential thing is 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.139
 % and it's like asking 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.749
 a hundred of one can not live 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.559
 in need an inner necessity as one says one says this 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.679
 who really is something that 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.769
 who is needed to pass you 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.739
 the sellers of the world of the hopes of the moments of pleasure of enjoyment 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:30.949
 as for the book 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.819
 sometimes from bus 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.149
 sensations in europe 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.639
 no longer believing in an option with a shoe just childhood memories 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.259
 do not remember it's small sensations by defining their 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.619
 invoices to amounts at his post 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.619
 but it's actually good 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.639
 I'm looking for someone else I'm looking for another 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.639
 the kind of immigration actually makes it 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.429
 what I'm trying to say something by doing it 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.099
 molinié painting is a little overused it's a little poor relative 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.989
 of 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.049
 yes the help of drones 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.849
 major cultural events 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.989
 aurélie is important for him and for the painters and sculptors to show 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:16.859
 than 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.729
 I do not blame any force 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.939
 painting is not dead we can still exist and create beautiful and 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:25.020
 make sense of the head 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.020
 on the eve of arrival at cover 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.229
 the public is not always receptive to contemporary art 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.939
 artists who will present well conscience 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.020
 you have to practice yourself to be able to realize 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.599
 of the commitment to know if we can not 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.289
 not really realize it 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.050
 but we can see the result 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.259
 the linebacker makes every year 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.050
 while the public is very attentive to the result of May 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.879
 in reality it is not that the most important is the approach 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.030
 I do not think people are still prepared at the Harold Hall 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:03.960
 figurative 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.280
 powerful not to bring them back for our others seem essential it's from a 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.470
 great simplicity of the game and yet people do not understand it so so and 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.470
 so a whole job of Benedictine 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.360
 which is not to do in France 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 high rate of return in this field of plastic art 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.289
 the problem is that here we are in a rural school school boufflers 2% 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.419
 we practice an abstract painting it's as if you speak about language 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.009
 foreign parts make up 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.009
 so maybe it's going to come best time runners for people to 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.340
 accustoms post this kind of work pretty few of them two exposure 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.139
 abstract it is she 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.139
 so tonight in high school for fun and see you again try to leave yourself for 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.969
 telly because we see 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.469
 I can not not try 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:55.909
 explanations 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.449
 all show explanations for 100 m - moubarak m 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:04.009
 no one can contradict 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.009
 the feeling of emotions next 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.180
 for artists to be 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.220
 no need to explain it's hard to explain his work already 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.150
 but we can understand the work of others more easily 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.580
 for this counselor 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.199
 the afro-cuban confront them in front of the white canvas as before the 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.009
 blank page 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.860
 of table however look benevolent compared to the work of others he 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.069
 is not necessary to know to be hot 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.460
 in love shock we do not know then 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.650
 and yet this shock is happening 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.590
 as a big idea that we have similar shocks it's not we can 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.980
 ascend or ignored rate of music and concord my control it's a 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.099
 wrist and yet on a flop 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.319
 so all affected all the explanations for me they are they 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.889
 are futile 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.020
 they are not necessary 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.479
 I think people are looking for too much explanation because in our 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.080
 education e there are always answers to questions gold in full turn 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.120
 in poetry there is no answer it's not the answers are the 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.149
 questions simply
