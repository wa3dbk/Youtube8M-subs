00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.750
 following what he had told them in 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.750
 the previous video I'm going to do some 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.970
 short videos 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.400
 first of all because I think that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.680
 you are going to pay more attention to them 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.200
 will be less tiring and in 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.880
 second place because in general they are going to 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.780
 try to answer that question 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.690
 they are doing to me and that I am going to them 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.340
 make graphics like that so that they understand 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 without any doubt 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.400
 the question was how to make to put 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.040
 a one how to make a one 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.800
 figure in black is cut out on a 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.500
 background like this for example that's called 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.520
 in backlight photography that is to say it is taken 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.350
 the background light 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.690
 to measure an exact exposure and not the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.570
 light that may have 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.820
 the figure that is always a light that 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.230
 comes from behind therefore it is much more 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.920
 dark 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.060
 so when you take that measurement 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.220
 they usually come out pretty black 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.180
 However, we photos can 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.830
 Look for the same effect. 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.130
 say who are the authors of this 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.970
 photo this is a backlight this too 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 it is a backlight and this a backlight 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.810
 we are going to use this fund 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.690
 to do our own simulate 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.110
 our own backlight to start 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.120
 to start I'm going to choose a figure 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.780
 how is this 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.490
 it does not matter that the background is so even 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.280
 I looked for it just to be more 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.430
 quick the video but this has nothing 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.240
 what to do with cuts because when I say 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.510
 the clipping videos many did 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.450
 question a little and rightly that is 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.060
 very easy to make a cut when the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.520
 funds are as ready or as simple as 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 this but I already showed you how 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.730
 they can make the most complicated funds 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.820
 can be cut in this case as 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.610
 it's so simple with just the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.910
 Quick selection tool us 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.490
 we can make a selection of the background 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.530
 look 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.530
 I go selecting by parts 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.810
 there it is and here as we do not lack a 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.989
 we're going to take 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.280
 we will complete the selection in this 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.470
 now the selection is made but 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.440
 and the selection of the fund therefore 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.690
 removing the padlock from the layer so that 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.150
 admit a modification simply 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.430
 let's press the delete key and with 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.459
 that we already have our trim well 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.020
 let's work then on this 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.710
 background 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:12.190
 we drag as we already know what is done 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.700
 we drag our image just 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.000
 trimmed 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.849
 and we pass it to the bottom we can already 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.770
 get rid of this and obviously we're going to 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.400
 resize this with control t 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.940
 we have the resize the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.950
 resizing the image and already 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.140
 We can post where we 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.630
 we want, I think that in this size, 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.350
 enough for what I'm trying 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.870
 to show you you have here a 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.450
 image that obviously is not a backlight 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.760
 absolute because it is very clear in 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.940
 the face on the shirt the pants is 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.060
 black so that does not count to achieve 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.940
 that this becomes a silhouette 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.550
 pressing the control key and doing 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.240
 click on the figure here of the layer 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.390
 us what we managed to select 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.040
 nothing more than that which is a cut to 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.140
 from there we have several methods 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.360
 several tools within the photoshop 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.140
 to darken and let's go for example 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.100
 picture adjustments and let's curves in 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.200
 curves let's give it all the darkness 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.570
 that we want to give him if not 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.520
 we want it to be so much we can 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.660
 do a little less 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.460
 and with that we have our image already 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.539
 backlighting 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.330
 a control of d we select make 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.060
 enter and we already have our figure to 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.480
 locate it where we want now 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.950
 look 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.130
 this is the whole process is all the 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.650
 mechanism that requires making a 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.320
 backlight if we think that 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.550
 it still takes a little more 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.780
 we are simply going to select again 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.350
 pressing control and clicking on 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.920
 the in the cut and we can go back to 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.340
 use our curves or else 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.370
 just come to a brush to a 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.920
 brush that has black color here and what 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.680
 we can do very soft here is the hundred 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.500
 Per hundred we can do 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:30.069
 26% let's say we give it a little more and 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.840
 we darkened this part but not so much 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:37.720
 so that it disappears completely 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.720
 well once we have this is already 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.090
 the figure as theoretically we 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.030
 we want now it 's a matter of locating it 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.610
 as I said where you better 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.569
 look like if you want the sun to look 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.699
 not there they have the cut the only thing that 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:58.660
 we have to do is combine these two 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:03.560
 layers we do click shift here 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.320
 right button and we say combine 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.460
 visible 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.070
 and we already have a single image 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.940
 we see it or we do not see it 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.450
 to see that it is a single image 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.720
 well up here this very short video very 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:25.770
 simple but I think that as I said today 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.770
 the most graphic way for the one that 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.740
 they have the doubt is that I show them with 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.780
 a video beyond that is shorter 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.990
 of which some may prefer 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.610
 although others prefer them this way it has been 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.550
 as always a great pleasure to be with 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.550
 you and it will be up to my next video
