00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
saying anyways a lot when it's just the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.500 
saying anyways a lot when it's just the
same<00:00:47.309> thing<00:00:51.440> ok<00:00:52.440> no<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.850> thought<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.329> can

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
same thing ok no but I thought I we can

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
same thing ok no but I thought I we can
do<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:54.750> enough<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.260> no<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:56.550> took<00:00:56.699> me<00:00:56.760> at

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
do down enough but no it took me at

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.910 
do down enough but no it took me at
least<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.300> 14<00:00:57.989> ultra<00:00:58.260> balls<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> catch<00:00:58.710> this

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
least like 14 ultra balls to catch this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.390 
least like 14 ultra balls to catch this
this<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.039> probably<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> harder

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
this is probably one of the harder

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.899 
this is probably one of the harder
pitches<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.950> anyways<00:01:07.950> I'm

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pitches to get it in anyways I'm

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.960 
pitches to get it in anyways I'm
checking<00:01:09.210> my<00:01:09.570> moose<00:01:09.750> ice<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.200> stuff<00:01:10.970> blah

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
blah blah so keeps bursting out of the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.510 
blah blah so keeps bursting out of the
ultra<00:01:17.130> balls<00:01:18.560> one<00:01:19.560> after<00:01:19.950> another<00:01:19.979> after

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
ultra balls one after another after

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.390 
ultra balls one after another after
another<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.600> should<00:01:21.750> carry<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.140> least<00:01:22.400> 40

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
another you should carry at least 40

another you should carry at least 40
multiples<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:29.400> catch<00:01:29.579> each<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:30.060> at<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.380> very
