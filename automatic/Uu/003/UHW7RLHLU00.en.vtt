after<00:00:34.280> all<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:34.820> cannot<00:00:35.210> build<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.930> strong

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
after all you cannot build a strong

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.510 
after all you cannot build a strong
foundation<00:00:37.330> with<00:00:38.330> bad<00:00:38.809> materials<00:00:39.470> but<00:00:40.370> now

that we've got the materials taken care

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.900 
that we've got the materials taken care
of<00:00:42.170> let's<00:00:43.100> talk<00:00:43.370> a<00:00:43.400> little<00:00:43.670> bit<00:00:43.880> about

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
would be the stance and by the way we're

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.770 
would be the stance and by the way we're
fairly<00:00:52.070> fortunate<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:52.670> pull<00:00:52.820> we<00:00:53.030> are<00:00:53.239> our

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
fundamentals are not near as complex as

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.490 
fundamentals are not near as complex as
a<00:00:55.670> lot<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:56.030> sporting<00:00:56.330> activities<00:00:56.510> for<00:00:57.440> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
forearm should be straight down should

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.310 
forearm should be straight down should
be<00:01:41.810> straight<00:01:42.170> down<00:01:42.410> when<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.550> tip<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:44.290> about<00:01:45.290> a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
be straight down when the tip is about a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.280 
be straight down when the tip is about a
quarter<00:01:45.770> inch<00:01:45.800> from<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.400> cue<00:01:46.910> ball<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:48.110> don't

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
quarter inch from the cue ball you don't

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.990 
quarter inch from the cue ball you don't
want<00:01:48.560> your<00:01:48.680> arm<00:01:48.890> forward<00:01:49.430> like<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.760> you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
want your arm forward like this you

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.090 
want your arm forward like this you
can't<00:01:50.210> follow<00:01:50.480> through<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.620> don't<00:01:51.800> want<00:01:51.980> your

arm<00:01:52.310> back<00:01:52.580> like<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.090> because<00:01:53.420> your<00:01:53.570> first

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
arm back like this because your first

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.930 
arm back like this because your first
motion<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.290> gonna<00:01:54.440> make<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.710> go<00:01:54.830> down<00:01:54.860> as<00:01:55.730> it

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
motion is gonna make it go down as it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.090 
motion is gonna make it go down as it
goes<00:01:56.090> down<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:57.020> want<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.380> be<00:01:57.500> right<00:01:57.680> in<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
goes down you want it to be right in the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.460 
goes down you want it to be right in the
middle<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.670> its<00:01:59.450> curvature<00:01:59.930> right<00:02:00.080> where<00:02:00.290> at

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
middle of its curvature right where at

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.100 
middle of its curvature right where at
its<00:02:00.620> lowest<00:02:01.010> point<00:02:01.270> now<00:02:02.270> your<00:02:02.480> upper<00:02:02.900> arm

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
its lowest point now your upper arm

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.500 
its lowest point now your upper arm
might<00:02:03.920> be<00:02:04.100> fairly<00:02:04.370> parallel<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.330> ground

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
might be fairly parallel to the ground

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.450 
might be fairly parallel to the ground
but<00:02:05.780> it's<00:02:05.930> not<00:02:06.110> important<00:02:06.590> because<00:02:06.680> some

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
but it's not important because some

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.520 
but it's not important because some
people<00:02:07.730> get<00:02:07.850> real<00:02:08.090> low<00:02:08.330> which<00:02:08.929> forces<00:02:09.289> your
