guy<00:01:59.259> coming<00:01:59.650> through<00:01:59.890> taking<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.909> tops<00:02:01.150> off

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
guy coming through taking the tops off

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.120 
guy coming through taking the tops off
and<00:02:01.750> then<00:02:01.900> they<00:02:02.080> just<00:02:02.290> drop<00:02:02.560> into<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.860> truck

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
and then they just drop into the truck

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.310 
and then they just drop into the truck
there<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.640> then<00:02:04.390> they<00:02:04.540> have<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.720> stop<00:02:05.079> and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
there and then they have to stop and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.440 
there and then they have to stop and
fill<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.500> truck<00:02:05.890> up<00:02:06.100> several<00:02:06.430> times<00:02:06.579> for

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
fill that truck up several times for

fill that truck up several times for
each<00:02:07.509> row<00:02:07.840> when<00:02:08.289> it's<00:02:08.409> full<00:02:08.649> day<00:02:08.860> they<00:02:09.159> take

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
each row when it's full day they take

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.069 
each row when it's full day they take
the<00:02:09.489> load<00:02:09.640> back<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.149> sorting<00:02:10.659> facility

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
the load back to the sorting facility

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.479 
the load back to the sorting facility
where<00:02:11.230> they<00:02:11.379> sort<00:02:11.650> everything<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:12.159> kind<00:02:12.370> of

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
where they sort everything to kind of

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.890 
where they sort everything to kind of
get<00:02:12.579> it<00:02:12.730> started<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.180> their<00:02:13.360> production<00:02:13.750> line

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
get it started on their production line

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.449 
get it started on their production line
which<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:14.409> this<00:02:14.560> shot<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:14.980> right<00:02:15.220> here

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
which is what this shot is right here

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.240 
which is what this shot is right here
all<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.940> binds<00:02:16.150> are<00:02:16.360> being<00:02:16.540> hung<00:02:16.750> on

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
all the binds are being hung on

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.250 
all the binds are being hung on
and<00:02:17.400> then<00:02:17.580> they<00:02:17.730> slide<00:02:18.120> across<00:02:18.450> where<00:02:19.080> they

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and then they slide across where they

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.280 
and then they slide across where they
await<00:02:19.650> stripping<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.700> sorting<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:22.020> here

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
await stripping and sorting so here

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.460 
await stripping and sorting so here
they're<00:02:22.470> all<00:02:22.640> crashing<00:02:23.640> together<00:02:24.320> waiting<00:02:25.320> to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
they're all crashing together waiting to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.320 
they're all crashing together waiting to
go<00:02:25.620> through<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> mill<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.790> was<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.150> was

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
go through the mill it was I was

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
go through the mill it was I was
impressed<00:02:27.600> with<00:02:27.900> kind<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
impressed with kind of with the the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.670 
impressed with kind of with the the
basic<00:02:30.060> engineering<00:02:30.420> involved<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.230> actually

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
basic engineering involved to actually

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.710 
basic engineering involved to actually
separate<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.160> cones<00:02:32.820> from<00:02:33.240> all<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.600> other

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
separate the cones from all the other

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.640 
separate the cones from all the other
plant<00:02:34.050> material<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:36.090> was<00:02:36.240> kind<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.650> basic

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
plant material it was kind of basic

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.040 
plant material it was kind of basic
basic<00:02:38.550> gravity<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.360> kind<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.630> what<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:39.840> use

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
basic gravity is kind of what they use

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.949 
basic gravity is kind of what they use
their<00:02:40.380> hands<00:02:40.680> off<00:02:40.950> yep<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:42.030> automated

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
their hands off yep it's all automated

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.930 
their hands off yep it's all automated
and<00:02:43.380> then<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.860> also<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.160> fans<00:02:44.610> blowing

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
and then you also have fans blowing

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.390 
and then you also have fans blowing
across<00:02:45.240> here<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.840> obviously<00:02:46.709> leaves<00:02:47.100> will

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
across here that obviously leaves will

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.699 
across here that obviously leaves will
blow<00:02:47.700> off<00:02:47.910> much<00:02:48.300> more<00:02:48.540> easily<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.470> cones

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
blow off much more easily so the cones

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.250 
blow off much more easily so the cones
fall<00:02:50.070> back<00:02:50.310> down<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.360> leaves<00:02:51.660> get<00:02:51.870> sorted

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
fall back down and the leaves get sorted

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.410 
fall back down and the leaves get sorted
out<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.190> pretty<00:02:53.340> much<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.610> final<00:02:54.150> stage

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
out so this is pretty much a final stage

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.630 
out so this is pretty much a final stage
of<00:02:54.600> sorting<00:02:54.989> it's<00:02:55.200> mostly<00:02:55.800> cones<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:56.459> but

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
of sorting it's mostly cones here but

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.030 
of sorting it's mostly cones here but
it's<00:02:56.760> still<00:02:56.940> catching<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.420> few<00:02:57.600> leaves<00:02:57.930> all<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it's still catching a few leaves all the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280 
it's still catching a few leaves all the
cones<00:02:59.220> will<00:02:59.459> roll<00:02:59.640> down<00:02:59.670> those<00:03:00.290> eventually

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
cones will roll down those eventually

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.229 
cones will roll down those eventually
and<00:03:01.500> all<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> leaves<00:03:01.920> will<00:03:02.250> roll<00:03:02.489> up<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.000> over

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
and all the leaves will roll up and over

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.590 
and all the leaves will roll up and over
so<00:03:03.270> there's<00:03:04.140> more<00:03:04.560> sorting<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.820> as<00:03:06.030> you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
so there's more sorting going on as you

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.180 
so there's more sorting going on as you
can<00:03:06.750> see<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.080> cones<00:03:07.290> are<00:03:07.530> bouncing<00:03:07.950> their<00:03:08.070> way

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
can see the cones are bouncing their way

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.750 
can see the cones are bouncing their way
down<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.610> leaves<00:03:08.820> are<00:03:09.000> being<00:03:09.810> carried<00:03:10.080> up<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
down the leaves are being carried up and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.600 
down the leaves are being carried up and
this<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> pretty<00:03:12.989> much<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.440> cones<00:03:13.770> on

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
this is a pretty much just cones on

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.930 
this is a pretty much just cones on
their<00:03:14.880> way<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.420> oast<00:03:15.630> or<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.290> big<00:03:16.500> kiln

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
their way to the oast or the big kiln

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.430 
their way to the oast or the big kiln
where<00:03:17.940> they<00:03:18.060> all<00:03:18.209> get<00:03:18.420> dried<00:03:18.720> out<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.200> now

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
where they all get dried out and now

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.949 
where they all get dried out and now
we're<00:03:19.620> actually<00:03:19.739> at<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.280> kiln<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.690> thing

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
we're actually at the kiln so this thing

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.880 
we're actually at the kiln so this thing
just<00:03:22.290> drops<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.580> bunch<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.299> cones<00:03:24.570> down<00:03:24.930> until

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
just drops a bunch of cones down until

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.910 
just drops a bunch of cones down until
it<00:03:26.750> senses<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.470> can't<00:03:28.680> drop

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
it senses that it's it can't drop

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.380 
it senses that it's it can't drop
anymore<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.489> then<00:03:29.580> it'll<00:03:29.700> move<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.120> little<00:03:30.269> bit

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
anymore and then it'll move a little bit

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.130 
anymore and then it'll move a little bit
and<00:03:30.660> keep<00:03:30.870> filling<00:03:31.280> each<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.519> these<00:03:32.610> sections

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
and keep filling each of these sections

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.800 
and keep filling each of these sections
it's<00:03:34.140> actually<00:03:34.350> moved<00:03:34.799> out<00:03:35.040> within<00:03:35.750> less<00:03:36.750> than

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
it's actually moved out within less than

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.960 
it's actually moved out within less than
a<00:03:37.049> day<00:03:37.320> it's<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.220> think<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.820> was<00:03:38.910> like

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
a day it's it's I think it was like

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.340 
a day it's it's I think it was like
seven<00:03:39.269> or<00:03:39.330> eight<00:03:39.450> hour<00:03:39.600> doesn't<00:03:40.019> rate<00:03:40.170> I've

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
seven or eight hour doesn't rate I've

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.050 
seven or eight hour doesn't rate I've
been<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.830> this<00:03:40.980> area<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.519> then<00:03:41.640> they<00:03:41.790> large

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
been in this area and then they large

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.449 
been in this area and then they large
seconds<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.780> then<00:03:42.870> when<00:03:43.049> they<00:03:43.200> empty<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.950> they

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
seconds and then when they empty it they

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.280 
seconds and then when they empty it they
actually<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:45.690> kind<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:46.260> a

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
actually that you can see kind of like a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.710 
actually that you can see kind of like a
burlap<00:03:46.739> material<00:03:47.310> below<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.970> they'll<00:03:48.450> lift

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
burlap material below and they'll lift

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.390 
burlap material below and they'll lift
all<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.530> dump<00:03:49.739> them<00:03:49.829> out<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.160> doors

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
all that up and dump them out the doors

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.479 
all that up and dump them out the doors
on<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.730> other<00:03:50.880> side<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.420> wood<00:03:52.320> behind<00:03:53.130> this

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
on the other side so wood behind this

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.130 
on the other side so wood behind this
guy<00:03:53.700> he's<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.329> checking<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.690> moisture

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
guy he's just checking the moisture

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.720 
guy he's just checking the moisture
right<00:03:55.320> now<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.829> can<00:03:55.950> see<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.250> doors<00:03:56.489> on

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
right now but you can see the doors on

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.640 
right now but you can see the doors on
the<00:03:56.820> other<00:03:56.940> side<00:03:57.239> those<00:03:57.480> will<00:03:57.630> open<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.200> all

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
the other side those will open and all

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.050 
the other side those will open and all
these<00:03:58.799> cones<00:03:59.100> will<00:03:59.310> get<00:03:59.430> dumped<00:03:59.760> out<00:03:59.850> that

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
these cones will get dumped out that

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.069 
these cones will get dumped out that
side<00:04:00.829> so<00:04:01.829> very<00:04:02.549> very<00:04:02.790> critical<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.720> check<00:04:03.930> the

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
side so very very critical to check the

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.500 
side so very very critical to check the
moisture<00:04:04.579> otherwise<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:05.940> actually<00:04:06.299> have

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
moisture otherwise you can actually have

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.890 
moisture otherwise you can actually have
not<00:04:07.140> just<00:04:07.380> not<00:04:08.100> dry<00:04:08.430> cones<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.060> spontaneous

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
not just not dry cones but spontaneous

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.530 
not just not dry cones but spontaneous
combustion<00:04:10.640> with<00:04:11.640> those<00:04:11.850> cones<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.390> can

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
combustion with those cones you can

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.509 
combustion with those cones you can
actually<00:04:12.660> have<00:04:12.930> pretty<00:04:13.380> severe<00:04:13.739> fires<00:04:14.010> check

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
actually have pretty severe fires check

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.259 
actually have pretty severe fires check
out<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.700> helped<00:04:15.180> us<00:04:15.299> flying<00:04:15.630> out<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.970> well

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
that we saw at hopping in they dump it

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.350 
that we saw at hopping in they dump it
right<00:05:05.180> into<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:06.099> static<00:05:07.099> shield<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:08.270> know

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
right into a static shield you know

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.869 
right into a static shield you know
light<00:05:08.569> barrier<00:05:08.990> bag<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.529> they<00:05:09.699> flush<00:05:10.699> with

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
light barrier bag and they flush with

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.830 
light barrier bag and they flush with
nitrogen<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.419> they<00:05:12.699> they<00:05:13.699> seal<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.509> up<00:05:14.569> and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
nitrogen and they they seal it up and

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.570 
nitrogen and they they seal it up and
box<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.319> up<00:05:15.379> and<00:05:15.590> set<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.860> out<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.069> door<00:05:16.250> then

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
box it up and set it out the door then

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.879 
box it up and set it out the door then
they<00:05:16.729> have<00:05:16.909> us<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.599> head<00:05:18.080> straight<00:05:18.379> onto<00:05:18.650> you

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.499 
day of that is actually going to a lot
of<00:05:31.159> sessions<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.789> mean<00:05:31.909> you<00:05:32.000> get<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.150> tour<00:05:32.389> of

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
of sessions I mean you get a tour of

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.869 
of sessions I mean you get a tour of
hopping<00:05:33.469> in<00:05:33.650> itself<00:05:33.949> but<00:05:34.219> then<00:05:34.400> there's<00:05:34.610> some

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
hopping in itself but then there's some

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.540 
hopping in itself but then there's some
sessions<00:05:35.150> were<00:05:35.839> different<00:05:36.800> brewers<00:05:37.189> yeast

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550
