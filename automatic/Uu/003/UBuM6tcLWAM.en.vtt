the<00:00:02.939> log<00:00:03.179> base<00:00:03.659> X<00:00:03.959> plus<00:00:04.410> 3<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.859> X<00:00:05.370> cubed<00:00:05.879> plus<00:00:06.330> X

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the log base X plus 3 of X cubed plus X

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.209 
the log base X plus 3 of X cubed plus X
minus<00:00:07.140> 2<00:00:07.620> all<00:00:08.220> over<00:00:08.280> X<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.540> equal<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.929> 2<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:11.040> this

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
minus 2 all over X is equal to 2 so this

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.160 
minus 2 all over X is equal to 2 so this
is<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> log<00:00:11.759> equation<00:00:12.480> there's<00:00:12.660> two<00:00:12.809> ways<00:00:12.960> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
is a log equation there's two ways to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.470 
is a log equation there's two ways to
solve<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.590> log<00:00:13.769> equation<00:00:14.429> if<00:00:14.549> there's<00:00:14.730> logs<00:00:15.030> on

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
solve a log equation if there's logs on

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.620 
solve a log equation if there's logs on
both<00:00:15.719> sides<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.910> simplify<00:00:17.910> both<00:00:18.150> sides<00:00:18.420> as

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
both sides we simplify both sides as

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.840 
both sides we simplify both sides as
much<00:00:18.810> as<00:00:18.930> possible<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.590> then<00:00:19.770> drop<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
much as possible and then drop the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.779 
much as possible and then drop the
logarithms<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.769> in<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.920> case<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.580> have

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
logarithms or in this case what we have

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.300 
logarithms or in this case what we have
is<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> logarithm<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.230> side<00:00:25.500> we

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
is we have a logarithm on this side we

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
is we have a logarithm on this side we
do<00:00:26.460> not<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.849> logarithm<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> side<00:00:27.840> so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
do not have a logarithm on the side so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.779 
do not have a logarithm on the side so
we're<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> take<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.490> switch<00:00:29.760> it

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
we're going to take this and switch it

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.359 
we're going to take this and switch it
into<00:00:29.970> exponential<00:00:30.750> form<00:00:31.230> now<00:00:31.980> when<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> go<00:00:32.219> to

into exponential form now when I go to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
into exponential form now when I go to
switch<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> exponential<00:00:33.719> form<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.469> base

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
switch this to exponential form the base

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.100 
switch this to exponential form the base
of<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.130> log<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.670> X<00:00:35.820> plus<00:00:36.120> 3<00:00:36.360> will<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> base

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.310 
of my log the X plus 3 will be the base
of<00:00:37.700> my<00:00:38.700> exponent<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> switch<00:00:40.079> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
of my exponent when I go to switch this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.490 
of my exponent when I go to switch this
over<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.690> I<00:00:42.690> always<00:00:42.930> tell<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.200> students

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
over and I always tell my students

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.610 
over and I always tell my students
logarithms<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.489> equal<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.570> exponent<00:00:46.320> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
logarithms are equal to exponent this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.910 
logarithms are equal to exponent this
too<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> exponent

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
too right here will be the exponent

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.180 
too right here will be the exponent
right<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.410> part<00:00:52.800> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
right over here and then this part is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
right over here and then this part is
what<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.600> equal<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.870> my

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
what this is equal to so there is my

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.410 
what this is equal to so there is my
transition<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.500> log<00:01:01.500> equation<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:03.329> an

transition from a log equation to an

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.179 
transition from a log equation to an
exponential<00:01:04.229> equation<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.220> bass<00:01:05.549> stays<00:01:06.360> here

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
exponential equation the bass stays here

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.200 
exponential equation the bass stays here
the<00:01:08.189> exponent<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.659> placed<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the exponent it's placed up here and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
the exponent it's placed up here and
then<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.360> part<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> answer

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
then this part is going to be the answer

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.499 
then this part is going to be the answer
down<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.580> what<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.850> equal<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> down

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
down here or what it's equal to down

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.789 
down here or what it's equal to down
here<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.470> need<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
here so what I need to do is I need to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.490 
here so what I need to do is I need to
simplify<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.340> left<00:01:20.820> side<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.960> X<00:01:22.200> plus

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
simplify this left side here that X plus

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
simplify this left side here that X plus
3<00:01:22.770> i'm<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> show<00:01:23.159> work<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.640> over<00:01:23.909> here

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
3 i'm going to show work right over here

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.160 
3 i'm going to show work right over here
x<00:01:24.270> plus<00:01:24.570> 3<00:01:24.930> times<00:01:25.710> X<00:01:25.950> plus<00:01:26.460> 3<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> X

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
x plus 3 times X plus 3 is what the X

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.890 
x plus 3 times X plus 3 is what the X
plus<00:01:28.380> 3<00:01:28.590> squared<00:01:28.979> represents<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.689> i'm

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
plus 3 squared represents and so i'm

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
plus 3 squared represents and so i'm
going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.350> distribute<00:01:31.530> twice<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.700> x

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
going to distribute twice here the x

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.200 
going to distribute twice here the x
times<00:01:33.180> X<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> x<00:01:33.780> squared<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:35.100> x<00:01:35.310> times<00:01:35.579> 3<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.970> 3

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
times X is x squared the x times 3 is 3

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.429 
times X is x squared the x times 3 is 3
x<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:38.159> three<00:01:38.430> goes<00:01:38.640> through<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.259> 3x<00:01:40.560> +<00:01:42.439> +

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
x the three goes through we have 3x + +

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.039 
x the three goes through we have 3x + +
9<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.880> left<00:01:45.180> side<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.659> we're<00:01:45.869> going

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
9 so on this left side here we're going

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.260 
9 so on this left side here we're going
to<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.530> x<00:01:46.860> squared<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to have x squared now this is going to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.740 
to have x squared now this is going to
be<00:01:48.329> plus<00:01:48.570> 6x<00:01:50.509> plus<00:01:51.509> 9<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:52.170> equal<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:53.159> X<00:01:54.090> cubed

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
be plus 6x plus 9 is equal to X cubed

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.080 
be plus 6x plus 9 is equal to X cubed
plus<00:01:55.710> X<00:01:56.149> minus<00:01:57.149> 2<00:01:57.509> all<00:01:57.899> over<00:01:57.960> X<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> don't

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
plus X minus 2 all over X so I don't

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
plus X minus 2 all over X so I don't
like<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.360> fraction<00:02:00.899> over<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.799> get

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
like this fraction over here so to get

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.469 
like this fraction over here so to get
rid<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.340> fraction<00:02:02.790> i<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.270> multiply

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
rid of a fraction i can do is multiply

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.630 
rid of a fraction i can do is multiply
both<00:02:03.960> sides<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> denominator<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
both sides by the denominator of this

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.199 
both sides by the denominator of this
fraction<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.960> when<00:02:07.140> i<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:10.760> i'll<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.940> put

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
fraction so when i do that i'll just put

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.640 
fraction so when i do that i'll just put
parentheses<00:02:12.629> around<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
parentheses around that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130 
parentheses around that
when<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.189> that<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.909> X<00:02:15.209> reduces<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:15.989> that

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
when I do that this X reduces with that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.679 
when I do that this X reduces with that
x<00:02:16.319> over<00:02:16.590> there<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.879> fraction<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.510> not

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
x over there and so the fraction is not

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.830 
x over there and so the fraction is not
there<00:02:18.870> anyway<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.319> have<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.860> X<00:02:20.010> cubed<00:02:20.540> plus<00:02:21.540> X

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
there anyway we have the X cubed plus X

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.559 
there anyway we have the X cubed plus X
minus<00:02:22.739> two<00:02:23.280> remaining<00:02:24.000> over<00:02:24.299> there<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
minus two remaining over there on the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.720 
minus two remaining over there on the
right<00:02:24.659> now<00:02:25.650> over<00:02:25.920> here<00:02:26.159> we<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
right now over here we have to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.809 
right now over here we have to
distribute<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.510> X<00:02:27.810> through<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.400> three

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
distribute this X through to all three

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.610 
distribute this X through to all three
of<00:02:29.849> these<00:02:30.030> terms<00:02:30.359> so<00:02:30.959> we're<00:02:31.049> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.379> X

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
of these terms so we're going to have X

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.670 
of these terms so we're going to have X
cubed<00:02:31.980> over<00:02:32.129> here<00:02:32.459> plus<00:02:33.329> 6x<00:02:33.840> squared<00:02:35.060> plus<00:02:36.060> 9x

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
cubed over here plus 6x squared plus 9x

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.460 
cubed over here plus 6x squared plus 9x
and<00:02:38.329> this<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:39.659> nice<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.109> when<00:02:40.439> i

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and this is really nice because when i

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.390 
and this is really nice because when i
go<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.680> combine<00:02:41.129> like<00:02:41.340> terms<00:02:41.400> i'm<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
go to combine like terms i'm going to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.280 
go to combine like terms i'm going to
swing<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.760> stuff<00:02:45.239> over<00:02:45.569> here<00:02:45.599> over<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.139> this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
swing this stuff over here over to this

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.589 
swing this stuff over here over to this
right<00:02:46.530> side<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.040> when<00:02:47.549> i<00:02:47.579> do<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.790> i<00:02:48.209> take

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
right side and when i do that i take

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.289 
right side and when i do that i take
away<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.170> x<00:02:49.349> cube<00:02:49.739> here<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.310> take<00:02:50.790> away<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> x

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
away the x cube here and take away the x

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.649 
away the x cube here and take away the x
cube<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.840> there<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.349> leaves<00:02:52.859> me<00:02:53.129> with

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
cube is there and that leaves me with

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.270 
cube is there and that leaves me with
nothing<00:02:54.659> for<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> X<00:02:55.349> cubes<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:55.889> these

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
nothing for the X cubes because these

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.339 
nothing for the X cubes because these
are<00:02:56.519> reduced<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.299> these<00:02:57.780> are<00:02:57.840> being

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
are reduced you know and these are being

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.860 
are reduced you know and these are being
subtracted<00:02:58.560> out<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.939> right<00:03:00.060> as<00:03:00.269> swing<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.720> x

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
subtracted out all right as swing the x

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.910 
subtracted out all right as swing the x
over<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.379> minus<00:03:01.680> X<00:03:02.239> minus<00:03:03.239> X<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:04.739> that's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
over here so minus X minus X so that's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.500 
over here so minus X minus X so that's
just<00:03:05.099> going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> fit<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.579> there<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:06.239> plus

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
just going to fit in there and then plus

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.789 
just going to fit in there and then plus
two<00:03:06.840> plus<00:03:07.170> two<00:03:08.159> over<00:03:08.310> here<00:03:09.319> so<00:03:10.319> let<00:03:10.500> me<00:03:10.590> rewrite

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
two plus two over here so let me rewrite

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.729 
two plus two over here so let me rewrite
this<00:03:11.129> left<00:03:11.430> side<00:03:11.639> there<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.060> no<00:03:12.420> X<00:03:12.629> cube<00:03:12.900> we're

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
this left side there is no X cube we're

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.059 
this left side there is no X cube we're
going<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:13.889> have<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> positive<00:03:14.370> 6x<00:03:15.180> squared

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
going to have a positive 6x squared

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:27.259 
going to have a positive 6x squared
minus<00:03:17.069> X<00:03:19.129> plus<00:03:20.129> 9<00:03:20.489> plus<00:03:22.489> 20<00:03:23.870> plus<00:03:24.870> 9<00:03:25.410> x<00:03:25.699> is<00:03:26.699> equal

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
minus X plus 9 plus 20 plus 9 x is equal

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.490 
minus X plus 9 plus 20 plus 9 x is equal
to<00:03:27.449> 0<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.790> then<00:03:29.790> we're<00:03:30.269> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.810> have<00:03:30.989> 6x

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
to 0 and then we're going to have 6x

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.710 
to 0 and then we're going to have 6x
squared<00:03:32.659> plus<00:03:33.659> 8x<00:03:35.150> plus<00:03:36.150> 2<00:03:36.449> is<00:03:37.290> equal<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.680> 0<00:03:37.889> and

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
squared plus 8x plus 2 is equal to 0 and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.300 
squared plus 8x plus 2 is equal to 0 and
we<00:03:39.720> have<00:03:39.870> our<00:03:40.079> second<00:03:40.470> degree<00:03:40.560> equation<00:03:41.129> set

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
we have our second degree equation set

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.640 
we have our second degree equation set
equal<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.609> 0<00:03:41.909> and<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.810> solve<00:03:43.109> this<00:03:43.319> i<00:03:43.440> want<00:03:43.530> to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
equal to 0 and to solve this i want to

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.960 
equal to 0 and to solve this i want to
make<00:03:43.709> things<00:03:43.949> a<00:03:44.040> little<00:03:44.129> bit<00:03:44.280> easier<00:03:44.400> i<00:03:44.579> notice

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
make things a little bit easier i notice

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.879 
make things a little bit easier i notice
that<00:03:45.000> these<00:03:45.239> are<00:03:45.449> all<00:03:45.569> even<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.650> i'm<00:03:46.709> going<00:03:46.799> to

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
that these are all even so i'm going to

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.960 
that these are all even so i'm going to
do<00:03:46.949> a<00:03:46.979> GCF<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.669> two<00:03:47.909> on<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.510> if<00:03:48.780> i<00:03:49.790> pull<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
do a GCF of two on this if i pull the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.750 
do a GCF of two on this if i pull the
two<00:03:51.180> out<00:03:51.449> of<00:03:51.629> this<00:03:51.780> we're<00:03:52.590> going<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:53.250> or<00:03:53.430> divide

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
two out of this we're going to or divide

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.420 
two out of this we're going to or divide
the<00:03:53.940> two<00:03:54.060> all<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.239> should<00:03:54.629> say<00:03:54.919> we<00:03:55.919> are<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.340> to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
the two all I should say we are going to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.369 
the two all I should say we are going to
have<00:03:56.639> six<00:03:57.150> divided<00:03:57.449> by<00:03:57.599> two<00:03:57.659> is<00:03:57.840> three<00:03:58.169> x

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
have six divided by two is three x

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.229 
have six divided by two is three x
squared<00:03:59.989> 8/2<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.199> 4x<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.159> then<00:04:03.060> 2/2<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.229> one

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
squared 8/2 is 4x and then 2/2 is one

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.780 
squared 8/2 is 4x and then 2/2 is one
and<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.419> let<00:04:06.569> me<00:04:06.659> write<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:06.989> up<00:04:07.169> here<00:04:07.379> now<00:04:07.790> so

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
and so let me write this up here now so

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.490 
and so let me write this up here now so
we<00:04:08.909> have<00:04:09.000> two<00:04:09.290> three<00:04:10.290> x<00:04:10.470> squared<00:04:10.639> plus<00:04:11.639> 4x<00:04:12.500> plus

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
we have two three x squared plus 4x plus

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.050 
we have two three x squared plus 4x plus
1<00:04:13.829> is<00:04:14.489> equal<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.879> zero<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:17.370> 2<00:04:17.609> i'm<00:04:17.909> just

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
1 is equal to zero so the 2 i'm just

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.339 
1 is equal to zero so the 2 i'm just
going<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.239> bring<00:04:18.449> down<00:04:18.599> right<00:04:18.780> here<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:18.959> i'm

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
going to bring down right here and i'm

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.149 
going to bring down right here and i'm
going<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.739> factor<00:04:19.949> this<00:04:20.549> trinomial<00:04:22.159> right

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
going to factor this trinomial right

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.410 
going to factor this trinomial right
here<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:25.310> i'm<00:04:26.310> going<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.490> do<00:04:26.580> factors

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
here and i'm going to do factors

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.560 
here and i'm going to do factors
3x<00:04:27.750> squared<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.440> it's<00:04:28.560> going<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.710> be<00:04:28.770> three<00:04:29.070> x

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
3x squared so it's going to be three x

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.800 
3x squared so it's going to be three x
times<00:04:30.570> X<00:04:30.980> gives<00:04:31.980> me<00:04:32.250> 3x<00:04:32.700> squared<00:04:33.210> on<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> front

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
times X gives me 3x squared on the front

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.140 
times X gives me 3x squared on the front
now<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.380> only<00:04:34.590> fact<00:04:34.920> is<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> one<00:04:35.400> or<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.670> positive

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
now the only fact is a one or a positive

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.400 
now the only fact is a one or a positive
one<00:04:36.330> now<00:04:37.260> help<00:04:37.860> me<00:04:38.360> get<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.420> positive<00:04:39.750> for<00:04:40.320> in

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
one now help me get a positive for in

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.690 
one now help me get a positive for in
the<00:04:40.500> middle<00:04:40.680> here<00:04:40.800> i'm<00:04:41.280> going<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.580> use

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
the middle here i'm going to use

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.870 
the middle here i'm going to use
positive<00:04:41.940> 1<00:04:42.450> times<00:04:42.750> positive<00:04:42.840> 1<00:04:43.470> now<00:04:44.460> how<00:04:44.820> do

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
positive 1 times positive 1 now how do

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.660 
positive 1 times positive 1 now how do
we<00:04:45.000> get<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.270> positive<00:04:45.900> for<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.350> middle

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
we get this positive for in the middle

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.870 
we get this positive for in the middle
just<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.820> check<00:04:47.850> in<00:04:48.290> when<00:04:49.290> i<00:04:49.320> do<00:04:49.440> 3<00:04:50.130> x<00:04:50.430> times

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
just the check in when i do 3 x times

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.160 
just the check in when i do 3 x times
one<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:52.140> is<00:04:52.350> 3x<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.190> when<00:04:53.820> i<00:04:53.850> do<00:04:53.940> 1<00:04:54.360> times<00:04:54.870> X

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
one that is 3x and when i do 1 times X

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.030 
one that is 3x and when i do 1 times X
that's<00:04:55.620> one<00:04:56.040> x<00:04:56.250> +<00:04:56.630> 1<00:04:57.630> x<00:04:57.870> +<00:04:58.200> 3<00:04:58.230> x<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.860> going<00:04:58.950> to

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
that's one x + 1 x + 3 x is going to

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.650 
that's one x + 1 x + 3 x is going to
give<00:04:59.220> me<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.400> 4x<00:04:59.880> in<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.150> middle<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:00.480> this

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
give me the 4x in the middle so this

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.070 
give me the 4x in the middle so this
works<00:05:00.930> out<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.590> 3x<00:05:01.950> x<00:05:02.160> 3<00:05:02.400> x<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.790> 3x<00:05:03.060> squared<00:05:03.510> the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
works out the 3x x 3 x is 3x squared the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.400 
works out the 3x x 3 x is 3x squared the
1<00:05:04.320> times<00:05:04.590> 1<00:05:04.950> is<00:05:04.980> 1<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:05.910> then<00:05:06.480> when<00:05:06.660> i<00:05:06.690> add<00:05:06.960> the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
1 times 1 is 1 and then when i add the

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.440 
1 times 1 is 1 and then when i add the
outers<00:05:08.190> in<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.490> inners<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:09.000> comes<00:05:09.180> out<00:05:09.330> to

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
outers in the inners it comes out to

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.320 
outers in the inners it comes out to
that<00:05:09.630> 4x<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:11.580> let<00:05:11.730> me<00:05:11.820> just<00:05:11.970> erase<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.510> now

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
that 4x so let me just erase that now

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.040 
that 4x so let me just erase that now
and<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:17.370> two<00:05:17.580> factors<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.240> i<00:05:18.300> have<00:05:18.570> i<00:05:18.870> need

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
and the two factors that i have i need

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.000 
and the two factors that i have i need
to<00:05:19.170> set<00:05:19.380> equal<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.710> 0<00:05:20.040> so<00:05:20.670> i<00:05:20.700> have<00:05:20.820> 3x<00:05:21.150> plus<00:05:21.780> 1<00:05:22.080> is

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
to set equal to 0 so i have 3x plus 1 is

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.490 
to set equal to 0 so i have 3x plus 1 is
equal<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.400> 0<00:05:23.640> x<00:05:24.300> plus<00:05:24.660> 1<00:05:24.950> is<00:05:25.950> equal<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.400> 0<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:27.500> we

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
equal to 0 x plus 1 is equal to 0 and we

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.720 
equal to 0 x plus 1 is equal to 0 and we
have<00:05:28.620> 3x<00:05:28.950> is<00:05:29.400> equal<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.940> negative<00:05:31.070> 1/3<00:05:32.070> on<00:05:32.520> both

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
have 3x is equal to negative 1/3 on both

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.870 
have 3x is equal to negative 1/3 on both
sides<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.380> we<00:05:34.380> have<00:05:34.620> negative<00:05:34.980> one-third<00:05:35.610> and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
sides and we have negative one-third and

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.800 
sides and we have negative one-third and
then<00:05:36.720> i<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:36.840> x<00:05:37.230> plus<00:05:37.620> 1<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:38.850> equal<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.300> 0<00:05:39.540> so<00:05:39.780> i

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
then i have x plus 1 is equal to 0 so i

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.930 
then i have x plus 1 is equal to 0 so i
subtract<00:05:40.260> 1<00:05:40.500> on<00:05:40.590> both<00:05:40.710> side<00:05:40.950> that<00:05:41.160> x<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.640> equal

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
subtract 1 on both side that x is equal

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
subtract 1 on both side that x is equal
to<00:05:42.030> negative<00:05:42.060> 1<00:05:42.540> over<00:05:42.750> there<00:05:43.640> so<00:05:44.640> my<00:05:45.600> answers

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
to negative 1 over there so my answers

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.100 
to negative 1 over there so my answers
are<00:05:46.050> going<00:05:46.200> to<00:05:46.260> be<00:05:46.410> negative<00:05:47.130> one-third<00:05:47.670> and

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
are going to be negative one-third and

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.260 
are going to be negative one-third and
negative<00:05:49.110> 1
