at<00:01:32.770> Georgia<00:01:33.009> I<00:01:33.550> did<00:01:34.150> make<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.660> change<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
at Georgia I did make a change in the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.800 
at Georgia I did make a change in the
uniform<00:01:35.619> which<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.759> still<00:01:37.270> going<00:01:37.509> on<00:01:37.750> today

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
uniform which is still going on today

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.890 
uniform which is still going on today
and<00:01:38.530> at<00:01:39.040> that<00:01:39.070> time<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.850> was<00:01:40.090> probably<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.509> risky

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
and at that time it was probably a risky

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.900 
and at that time it was probably a risky
change<00:01:41.410> because<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:41.979> do<00:01:42.220> something<00:01:42.460> like<00:01:42.610> that

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
change because we do something like that

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.240 
change because we do something like that
you<00:01:43.660> sure<00:01:43.869> better<00:01:44.110> win<00:01:44.350> because<00:01:44.650> sometimes

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
you sure better win because sometimes

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.970 
you sure better win because sometimes
people<00:01:45.369> don't<00:01:45.820> take<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.300> very<00:01:46.570> very<00:01:46.980> but

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
people don't take to it very very but
