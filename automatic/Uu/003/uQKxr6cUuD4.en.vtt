incredible let's take a look at it now

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.049 
incredible let's take a look at it now
first<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> literally<00:00:38.790> the

first of all this is literally the
biggest<00:00:39.210> laptop<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:39.870> ashy<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.140> makes

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
biggest laptop that's ashy but makes

you<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> throw<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.789> thing<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> will

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you want to throw out this thing it will

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
you want to throw out this thing it will
do<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.230> point<00:00:49.440> six<00:00:49.680> figure<00:00:49.860> hurt

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
do it as a one point six figure hurt

do it as a one point six figure hurt
Intel<00:00:50.579> Core<00:00:50.820> i7<00:00:50.969> mobile<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.199> actually<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
Intel Core i7 mobile it's actually the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.540 
Intel Core i7 mobile it's actually the
i7q<00:00:54.210> M<00:00:54.360> series<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.050> basically<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:56.370> one

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
i7q M series but basically it's one

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
i7q M series but basically it's one
point<00:00:56.789> six<00:00:57.030> normally<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> 2.8

gigahertz<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.399> turbo<00:00:59.760> mode<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.059> you're

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
gigahertz in turbo mode so if you're

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.670 
gigahertz in turbo mode so if you're
running<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.359> single-threaded<00:01:00.780> application

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
running a single-threaded application

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
running a single-threaded application
that<00:01:02.399> doesn't<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:02.879> four<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.600> actually

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that doesn't use all four or actually

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
that doesn't use all four or actually
all<00:01:03.989> eight<00:01:04.229> threads<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> does<00:01:05.280> have

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
all eight threads because it does have

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
all eight threads because it does have
hyper<00:01:05.549> threading<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.270> will<00:01:06.390> overclock<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
hyper threading it will overclock a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
hyper threading it will overclock a
single-core<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> 2.8<00:01:09.150> giga

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
single-core all the way up to 2.8 giga

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.390 
single-core all the way up to 2.8 giga
it's<00:01:09.600> making<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> extremely<00:01:10.439> extremely<00:01:11.070> fast

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's making it extremely extremely fast

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
it's making it extremely extremely fast
for<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.270> your<00:01:12.540> average<00:01:12.810> applications<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
for all your average applications it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.899 
for all your average applications it
will<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.979> give<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> big<00:01:14.610> boost<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
will really give you a big boost in

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.609 
will really give you a big boost in
performance<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.750> it'll<00:01:16.020> save<00:01:16.140> power<00:01:16.470> when

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
performance but it'll save power when

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
performance but it'll save power when
you're<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.880> basically<00:01:17.880> using<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.210> for

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you're not basically using it for

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
you're not basically using it for
gigabytes<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.080> ddr3<00:01:19.680> memory<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.220> also<00:01:20.549> on

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
gigabytes of ddr3 memory are also on

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
gigabytes of ddr3 memory are also on
board<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.270> 500<00:01:21.960> gigabyte<00:01:22.080> SATA<00:01:22.409> hard<00:01:22.590> drive

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
board a 500 gigabyte SATA hard drive

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.350 
board a 500 gigabyte SATA hard drive
gives<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> plenty<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> space<00:01:23.549> plus<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
gives you plenty of space plus it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.170 
gives you plenty of space plus it
actually<00:01:24.810> has<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.380> area<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> dock<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:27.000> an

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
actually has the area or the dock for an

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640 
actually has the area or the dock for an
additional<00:01:27.810> hard<00:01:28.080> drive<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> wanted

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
additional hard drive so if you wanted

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
additional hard drive so if you wanted
to<00:01:28.740> run<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.979> 500<00:01:29.579> gigabyte<00:01:30.299> hard<00:01:30.450> drives<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to run to 500 gigabyte hard drives you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.270 
to run to 500 gigabyte hard drives you
could<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> terabyte<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.130> no

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
could do that have a terabyte on here no

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.170 
could do that have a terabyte on here no
problem<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.170> glossy<00:01:35.130> front<00:01:35.310> 18.4

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
problem now it is a glossy front 18.4

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.219 
problem now it is a glossy front 18.4
and<00:01:36.299> through<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.780> interesting

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and through the very interesting

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.420 
and through the very interesting
resolution<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.890> resolution<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.340> actually

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
resolution this resolution is actually

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
resolution this resolution is actually
1680<00:01:39.240> by<00:01:39.750> 9:45<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.329> hi-def<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.200> do

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
1680 by 9:45 so it is hi-def it will do

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.039 
1680 by 9:45 so it is hi-def it will do
720p<00:01:43.799> no<00:01:44.280> problem<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.210> 1080p

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
720p no problem but it will not do 1080p

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.179 
720p no problem but it will not do 1080p
but<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> big<00:01:47.070> concern

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
but that's not really a big concern

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.649 
but that's not really a big concern
because<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.700> gonna<00:01:47.820> automatically<00:01:48.360> scale

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
because it's gonna automatically scale

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539 
because it's gonna automatically scale
up<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.290> does<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.920> dedicated

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
up now this does have a dedicated

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.190 
up now this does have a dedicated
graphics<00:01:50.790> card<00:01:51.180> which<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.390> very<00:01:51.600> nice<00:01:51.750> it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
graphics card which is very nice it's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649 
graphics card which is very nice it's
actually<00:01:52.290> got<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> GeForce<00:01:53.340> GTX<00:01:53.670> 360<00:01:54.210> mobile

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
actually got the GeForce GTX 360 mobile

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.370 
actually got the GeForce GTX 360 mobile
and<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.140> got<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.619> gigabyte<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.340> gddr5<00:01:57.320> ok<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and it's got one gigabyte of gddr5 ok so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.569 
and it's got one gigabyte of gddr5 ok so
get<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> give<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.520> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
get that it's got one you give out of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.179 
get that it's got one you give out of
gddr5<00:01:59.909> internal<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.079> has<00:02:01.229> over<00:02:01.590> 1.2

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
gddr5 internal but it has over 1.2

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.209 
gddr5 internal but it has over 1.2
gigabytes<00:02:02.490> more<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:04.020> share<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.950> memory<00:02:05.159> which

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
gigabytes more of share to memory which

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.740 
gigabytes more of share to memory which
I<00:02:05.399> couldn't<00:02:05.640> share<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> ddr3<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
I couldn't share from the ddr3 from the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.570 
I couldn't share from the ddr3 from the
40s<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.170> ddr3<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.429> get<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
40s of ddr3 that you have so you get a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.699 
40s of ddr3 that you have so you get a
total<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:09.330> point<00:02:09.720> almost<00:02:09.989> 2.3

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709

for<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.879> graphics<00:02:14.209> person<00:02:14.450> give<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.660> huge

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
for the graphics person give you huge

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.410 
for the graphics person give you huge
huge<00:02:15.620> huge<00:02:15.800> performance<00:02:16.340> increases<00:02:16.640> compared

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
huge huge performance increases compared

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.390 
huge huge performance increases compared
to<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.810> regular<00:02:18.050> card<00:02:18.500> even<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:19.160> less

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
to just the regular card even with less

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.070 
to just the regular card even with less
memory<00:02:19.760> or<00:02:19.879> without<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> GDR<00:02:20.510> five<00:02:20.690> memory<00:02:20.930> so

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
memory or without the GDR five memory so

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.240 
memory or without the GDR five memory so
very<00:02:21.319> very<00:02:21.470> impressive<00:02:21.739> as<00:02:21.890> far<00:02:22.069> as<00:02:22.160> that's

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
very very impressive as far as that's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.910 
very very impressive as far as that's
concerned<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.540> does<00:02:23.720> also<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.440> full

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
concerned now it does also have a full

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.949 
concerned now it does also have a full
keyboard<00:02:25.099> it's<00:02:25.940> got<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> large<00:02:26.390> flat<00:02:26.720> keys

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
keyboard it's got the large flat keys

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.229 
keyboard it's got the large flat keys
that<00:02:27.110> I'm<00:02:27.200> very<00:02:27.319> much<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:29.030> also

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
that I'm very much like it's also

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.490 
that I'm very much like it's also
backlit<00:02:29.599> which<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:29.989> really<00:02:30.170> cool<00:02:30.319> when<00:02:30.410> you're

pretty cool now moving on to the front
there's<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.410> little<00:04:30.650> bit<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.800> stuff<00:04:30.949> going<00:04:31.130> on

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
there's a little bit of stuff going on

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.430 
there's a little bit of stuff going on
up<00:04:31.310> in<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.520> front<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.789> have<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.440> manual

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
up in the front you have a manual

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.629 
up in the front you have a manual
antenna<00:04:33.949> switch<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.280> if<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:34.400> want<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.550> turn

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
antenna switch so if you want to turn

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.430 
antenna switch so if you want to turn
off<00:04:34.729> your<00:04:34.940> wireless<00:04:35.300> it's<00:04:35.479> right<00:04:35.660> there<00:04:35.900> and

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
off your wireless it's right there and

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.930 
off your wireless it's right there and
then<00:04:36.620> over<00:04:36.889> here<00:04:36.919> is<00:04:37.190> your<00:04:37.310> media<00:04:37.639> card<00:04:37.880> reader

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940

I believe it's a five and one media card

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.110 
I believe it's a five and one media card
reader<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.770> your<00:04:39.979> SD<00:04:40.370> cards<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:40.759> your<00:04:40.910> XD

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
again this is a core high 750 720 qm so

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.689 
again this is a core high 750 720 qm so
that's<00:05:54.020> a<00:05:54.110> very<00:05:54.530> very<00:05:54.770> nasty<00:05:55.010> processor<00:05:55.580> that

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
that's a very very nasty processor that

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.640 
that's a very very nasty processor that
is<00:05:55.820> gonna<00:05:55.970> give<00:05:56.180> a<00:05:56.449> lot<00:05:56.960> of<00:05:57.020> heat<00:05:57.259> as<00:05:57.380> well<00:05:57.500> as<00:05:57.620> a

caused me aback very very pretty not
much<00:06:20.389> of<00:06:20.509> a<00:06:20.570> design<00:06:20.840> there<00:06:21.020> actually<00:06:21.380> is<00:06:21.470> a

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
much of a design there actually is a

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.170 
much of a design there actually is a
grating<00:06:21.979> in<00:06:22.099> here<00:06:22.340> I<00:06:22.490> don't<00:06:22.699> think<00:06:22.849> we<00:06:23.060> could

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
grating in here I don't think we could

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.540 
grating in here I don't think we could
ever<00:06:23.389> show<00:06:23.599> it<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:23.990> you<00:06:24.110> on<00:06:24.259> camera<00:06:24.560> so<00:06:25.280> you<00:06:25.370> see

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
ever show it to you on camera so you see

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.580 
ever show it to you on camera so you see
we<00:06:25.610> can<00:06:25.729> zoom<00:06:25.820> in<00:06:25.940> there's<00:06:26.090> Jimmy<00:06:26.360> get<00:06:27.289> all<00:06:27.440> in

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
we can zoom in there's Jimmy get all in

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.620 
we can zoom in there's Jimmy get all in
there

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
there

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.390 
there
yes<00:06:29.630> there<00:06:29.930> it<00:06:30.020> is<00:06:30.110> you<00:06:30.229> see<00:06:30.259> it<00:06:30.440> does<00:06:31.159> have<00:06:31.340> a

yes there it is you see it does have a
very<00:06:31.729> slight<00:06:32.120> grid<00:06:32.539> pattern<00:06:32.990> throughout

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
very slight grid pattern throughout

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.070 
very slight grid pattern throughout
