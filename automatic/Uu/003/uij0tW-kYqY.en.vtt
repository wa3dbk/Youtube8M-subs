00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.880
 yes 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.150
 for raúl jiménez the best thing would be to emigrate 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.280
 to football in Europe at this time of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 his career and not wait six months as 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 the directive of the america pretends it 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 for so he could earn a place in the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 preseason and the beginning of the league with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.509
 Porto Portugal as well as 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.429
 they did with diego but they are things that 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.140
 Now, for example, the tournament starts and 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.749
 are in the preseason then the best 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.350
 It would be if it's my turn to leave now 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:35.600
 six months is the tournament ah 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 half already has the technician a team 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 now yes that defined then it would be more 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.720
 difficult to adapt but good what 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.370
 I touch you I tell you where I have to 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.690
 I have to show what I am 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 capable and what I can do 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.769
 concentrated I think I showed it the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.809
 last game the two good the two 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.400
 matches that I had to enter from 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.100
 change I think I've done it good 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.480
 way good way and good to be 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.159
 I do not know what is being negotiated 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.589
 found that it may be probable that 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.449
 I'm leaving but also like that if I stay 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.159
 nothing happens I'm not in the biggest club 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.020
 from mexico and I'm very happy here only 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.940
 the case of alan polished raúl jiménez said 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.590
 which supports the most to his friend without 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.970
 However, it does not share the forms of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.650
 have come forward to train with the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.600
 tiger team 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.550
 this is a great friend that I already know him 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 since a long time since the tournament 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 toulon 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.650
 two years 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.680
 and well I feel that out there he 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.780
 He says that contract ended 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.690
 that the federation and tickets say no 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.150
 so now it is a 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.250
 get into a problem and we 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.180
 comment on that alone so it's not going to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 bring to nothing I feel that he is a one 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.340
 good person a great guy who always 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.530
 work a hundred to be stuck in your 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.090
 team maybe now I do not know if there's 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.880
 taken a good one a bad edition but 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.090
 but good I feel that always 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.300
 work like this a hundred and good and it will be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.860
 good decision I went for that he 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.660
 everyone makes their decisions now yes 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.720
 that does not put us each one this goes by 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.280
 the way he wants and the good thing to support him 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.770
 not to the maximum as I say is a great 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.660
 friend and finally support the forward 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.340
 He talked about the match that America will have 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.380
 against the atletico of madrid of this 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.550
 Wednesday at the Aztec stadium assured 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.710
 which is a great opportunity for 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.780
 face the champion of Spain with
