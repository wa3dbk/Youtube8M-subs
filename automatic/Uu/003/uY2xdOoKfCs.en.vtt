00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.509 

it'll<00:02:55.090> vibrate<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.980> should<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.310> matched

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
it'll vibrate and it should be matched

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.070 
it'll vibrate and it should be matched
up<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.819> every<00:02:58.090> time<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.269> push<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.660> vibrate

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
up so every time you push the vibrate

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.490 
up so every time you push the vibrate
button<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.980> receiver<00:03:00.370> should<00:03:00.519> vibrate<00:03:04.500> okay

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
button the receiver should vibrate okay

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.589 
button the receiver should vibrate okay
so<00:03:05.980> we<00:03:06.099> know<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.220> it's<00:03:06.430> matched<00:03:06.610> up<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:07.390> next

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
so we know that it's matched up the next

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.699 
so we know that it's matched up the next
thing<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.959> do<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.319> this<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
thing that you do and this is the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.570 
thing that you do and this is the
important<00:03:09.160> part<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:10.269> make<00:03:10.450> sure<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:11.769> you

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
important part is you make sure that you

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.660 
important part is you make sure that you
put<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:14.250> battery<00:03:15.250> cover<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.920> very<00:03:17.920> securely

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
put the battery cover on very securely

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.420 
put the battery cover on very securely
you<00:03:19.630> got<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.900> push<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:20.230> down<00:03:20.410> all<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.340> way

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
you got to push it down all the way

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.780 
you got to push it down all the way
around<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.819> edges<00:03:22.440> making<00:03:23.440> sure<00:03:23.829> that<00:03:24.640> it's

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
around the edges making sure that it's

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.710 
around the edges making sure that it's
pushed<00:03:25.060> down<00:03:25.299> all<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:26.230> way<00:03:26.379> to<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.799> lip<00:03:27.720> all

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
pushed down all the way to the lip all

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.020 
pushed down all the way to the lip all
the<00:03:29.110> way<00:03:29.230> around<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.549> what's<00:03:30.730> going<00:03:30.910> to

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
the way around that is what's going to

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.089 
the way around that is what's going to
keep<00:03:31.329> your<00:03:31.569> batteries<00:03:32.049> from<00:03:32.410> popping<00:03:32.920> out

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
keep your batteries from popping out

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.940 
keep your batteries from popping out
when<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:34.299> vibrating<00:03:34.720> or<00:03:35.500> when<00:03:35.650> your<00:03:35.769> dog<00:03:35.920> is

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
when it's vibrating or when your dog is

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.420 
when it's vibrating or when your dog is
active<00:03:36.599> if<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.780> vibrate<00:03:38.200> if<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.620> batteries

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
active if the vibrate if the batteries

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.910 
active if the vibrate if the batteries
vibrate<00:03:39.910> out<00:03:40.120> then<00:03:40.959> you're<00:03:41.470> going<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.799> lose

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
vibrate out then you're going to lose

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.690 
vibrate out then you're going to lose
communication<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.660> light<00:03:43.840> may<00:03:44.079> still<00:03:44.349> be<00:03:44.500> on

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.089 
the short prongs on a long-haired dog
let's<00:04:34.030> put<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.330> long<00:04:34.479> prongs<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:37.740> they<00:04:38.740> screw

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
let's put the long prongs on they screw

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.140 
let's put the long prongs on they screw
over<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.550> threaded<00:04:39.880> studs<00:04:41.880> they<00:04:42.880> don't<00:04:43.060> have

over the threaded studs they don't have
to<00:04:43.240> be<00:04:43.300> much<00:04:43.539> tighter<00:04:43.979> than<00:04:44.979> finger<00:04:45.400> tight<00:04:45.639> but

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
to be much tighter than finger tight but

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.080 
to be much tighter than finger tight but
you<00:04:46.570> should<00:04:46.750> check<00:04:46.990> them<00:04:47.139> every<00:04:47.260> now<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.680> then

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
you should check them every now and then

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.730 
you should check them every now and then
anyway<00:04:49.590> now<00:04:50.590> if<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.729> still<00:04:51.969> matched<00:04:52.210> up<00:04:52.740> when

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
anyway now if it still matched up when

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.950 
anyway now if it still matched up when
you<00:04:53.830> push<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.479> vibrate<00:04:55.479> button

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
you push the vibrate button

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.070 
you push the vibrate button
it<00:04:56.440> should<00:04:56.680> vibrate<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.729> light<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.060> still<00:04:58.240> on

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.520 

okay<00:05:02.080> now<00:05:02.380> we'll<00:05:02.800> test<00:05:03.069> the<00:05:03.310> shock<00:05:04.380> with<00:05:05.380> the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
okay now we'll test the shock with the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.409 
okay now we'll test the shock with the
test<00:05:05.740> light<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.789> make<00:05:06.910> sure<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.180> shock<00:05:07.389> is

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
test light to make sure the shock is

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.439 
test light to make sure the shock is
working<00:05:08.190> rather<00:05:09.190> than<00:05:09.430> getting<00:05:10.120> shocked
