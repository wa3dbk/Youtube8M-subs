00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.370
 after we have you in one of the last 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.990
 have shown consequences like a motorcycle 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 Things are really going winter today 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.320
 why do you like your motorcycle again 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 the hibernation of right is 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.099
 which products could use for it 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.750
 And so you should be aware before 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.990
 so in the new season the first time 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 The navi goes to the street 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 and can give us a little bit about the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.600
 products this polo tell only once 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 of course we say the motorcycle for 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 a firm stand that we have already 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.660
 The main stand at the moment learning luxury 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.730
 A car lift is the main stand 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.460
 not given , we use of all you 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.980
 tube a mounting stand recommends 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.149
 Simply because of the one school 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.280
 has polished up for switzerland 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.600
 that means he is also universal but in 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.309
 the width so i put it on every one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.690
 motorcycle can vote and the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.809
 Rubberizing ensures that nothing 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 So first sold safe stand 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 for the motorcycle 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 yes and what is next to the topic 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 Oil change we had in ours 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.489
 hibernal following recommended to everyone 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.079
 in case of oiling before wintering 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.579
 that would not have changed yet 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 probably now is the right one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.080
 time for it completely correct one 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.020
 should before winter hibernate the motorcycle 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 that oil change motorcycle is not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 so nice it is recommended to everyone 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.110
 Fall to the season start we use here 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.570
 by racing memic and was until 19.40 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.270
 Mineral is for this motorcycle 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 recommended oil of a viscosity us 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.420
 Of course, other oils still have in 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.770
 other viscosities also as half 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 more synthetic than synthetic oils 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.860
 both in 4 liters a downtime liter 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.240
 get this data which probably for 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.460
 which motorcycle will find Diana bike 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.909
 database to want our stores like 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.509
 also on the internet, of course, too 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.579
 always the right oil filter then 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.720
 of the champion or may brand was that 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.110
 are the two companies we are here 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.000
 used with every ball change 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.799
 lasted then i saw you have 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.290
 something very special for 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.360
 the theme of oil change that's what we're talking about 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.329
 have the drain plug of 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.280
 Schabus is the potential of the engine 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.930
 warm one loosens the screw and the first 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.610
 Of course, oil runs over your hands and 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.030
 we will avoid this in the future 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.060
 this cast steel drain plug this 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.920
 screw the I indicate the dresdner 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.230
 ask your oil drain plug pure 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.459
 the lid closes so downwards 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.739
 that I do not muck the valve 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.170
 can use around with this adapter 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.670
 piece the ultimately the fresh oil 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.920
 then later into the more egomaniacal 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.629
 run in through a hose that is 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.370
 this valve opens the bayonet 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.530
 Closure inside and only through 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.819
 this opening can be flowing the oil 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.370
 a very great story 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.769
 There is a great story in all 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.410
 possible sizes also with us over the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.410
 database internet or stop in store too 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.120
 see which adapter invention 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.800
 what should you do for the season start 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.660
 So pay attention to the topic of general care 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.629
 Of course, the start of the day is very important 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.129
 Battery if we do not have the battery 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.260
 had used device over the winter 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.330
 then you should now the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.310
 Battery once again fresh momentum too 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.810
 let come that she is fully charged 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.220
 has the necessary power and for the first time 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.910
 to start the motorcycle 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.010
 we do that with the company sitec 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.170
 have only the 5 1 parade device that is 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.700
 We can deliver up to 5 amps per hour 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.590
 loading that is very good that is suitable 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.720
 even for cars that means very much 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.549
 universally applicable is also about 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.780
 winter always to let that's called 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.549
 if the battery is what i always have 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.049
 always recommends winter from need 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.299
 Can you charge the battery with a charger? 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.670
 let turn only when the battery power 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:33.950
 has gone down to 11.6 is over 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:36.950
 Turned out once charged has battery 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.670
 pole position clean with parties 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.579
 so they do not smear new ones 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.170
 can oxidize now first yes exactly 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.480
 Oil change made battery checked 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.670
 surely you have to go too 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.310
 a little bit on the general care 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.260
 look that one for example the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.030
 chain re-lubricate you also have one 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.549
 own chain spray with you in the program 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.079
 also from the region determine our 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.810
 white cities stand here too with one 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.790
 good test again it is 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.160
 in any case before the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.780
 season start again on the chain 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.000
 to apply so that you hold relatively little 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.069
 the chain has an effect in there 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.169
 well, what should I check ? 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.150
 there motorcycle before it really starts 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.300
 perform once again I would like to 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.650
 there 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.660
 So just look at the profile 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.890
 how to make the profile out of the air and 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.370
 Check again that you can here 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.570
 make wonderful about this device 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.360
 reduced tire pressure in winter 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.410
 Partially 02 03 was that she will 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.370
 at first not much but can 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.470
 be decisive 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.180
 then stop if you found this 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.650
 to the gas station or over your own ob 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.600
 refill the missing air 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.040
 always recommended is again 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.020
 so optical check really 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.600
 functioning blinkers are that really 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.160
 the headlamps then slow down 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.930
 again a light brake check 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.280
 make and when rolling times very short 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 the brake still works 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.130
 so you do not in case of a fall 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.630
 into the void thus intervenes with the right one 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.890
 preparation can be there soon 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.830
 go back to the new one 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.420
 Motorcycle season just a few small ones 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.170
 Checkup on the bike is still going on 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.820
 change times 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.530
 as it did not before winter 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.550
 then the first miles in the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.550
 come back next year
