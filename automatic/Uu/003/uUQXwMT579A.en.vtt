00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.500
 hello everyone with you finish too 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.880
 of today's series I would like to share 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.710
 with you so let's say that's features The Do 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.470
 life hacking can be called 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.810
 which I use when building 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:23.419
 different things to us in the world of minecraft 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.970
 Well let's give it in order first if 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.310
 you appear here in the ordinary world and you 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.679
 see that dofiga grass and most 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.079
 players start here now standing so 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.480
 run to taxi this grass and so on 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.760
 Well, I would not say that this is the most 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.550
 a productive way of putting it away to 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.160
 clean large areas 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.080
 whether from leaf foliage and grass and so forth 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.210
 This garbage can be used 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.400
 simply air we put water she is very 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.810
 well spreads out a lot of things 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.980
 Look here just a little bit 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.230
 buckets look like but how many 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.539
 the territories were cleaned up later in the creative 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:10.909
 also we fly we collect all sources 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:13.069
 the waters that we guided the bucket and we 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.079
 it turns out a clean area from 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.259
 foliage true some blocks sometimes 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.409
 stay on it is much more convenient than here 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.149
 so every block to clear well go to 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.429
 the second 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.340
 many players very often flock to 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:31.189
 so that you need to clear a lot 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.109
 space about there some kind of excess 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.200
 block and start like this 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.450
 go clean and so on it is also not 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.149
 the most productive way guys he is not 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.889
 saves you time to quickly clean 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.609
 large territories from the land i am you 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:48.109
 I advise you to use this 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.619
 running do such a scapula for an ambulance 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.319
 a hand 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.560
 so we did see now 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.560
 switch ourselves to survival mode and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.560
 look 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.299
 it essentially always saves time and 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.039
 I want to tell you that it is pretty 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.750
 convenient way to clean large 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.760
 territory align some 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.040
 territory so on if you have too 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.550
 uneven world turned out and so , etc. and 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.040
 etc. 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.870
 In short, the options can be very 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.950
 many different 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.200
 but in this case it is very, very, very I 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.650
 would say a handy thing the third life hack 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.220
 guys in minecraft construction 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.840
 this is when you need to build some 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.600
 some walls very much or some 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.239
 long fence and you often start 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.620
 do this in the way we build walls 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.530
 build walls 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:50.190
 still building walls doing such a circle later 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.380
 still doing such a circle then doing again 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.320
 a circle and in such a way we simply 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.170
 fly in a circle on our around our 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.440
 buildings while we're here layer by layer this 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.260
 sat not finish as I do it in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.829
 jump three blocks up clamping 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.410
 shift 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.400
 slowly eating just holding the shift 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.560
 forward button and right mouse button 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 just now i'm nothing is nothing 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.360
 do no action forward button 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 forward button is clamped shift and right 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.860
 mouse button all we do not need anything 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.739
 control is very simple very easy 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.280
 it is much easier for me personally 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.470
 plus addition to this addition 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.250
 It turns out much faster, we look 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.120
 already put three rows of blocks and made 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.400
 whole wall 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.079
 of course in survival mode you will 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.570
 possibility only two blocks height 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.430
 set but also in creative mode this too 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.859
 significantly saves time look 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.600
 how fast is it all done with you 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.640
 don't need to control anything and very 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.440
 low probability that you get off 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.549
 put some extra fruit wrong 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.790
 place and vova will need to clean later 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.500
 Well, I hope these three lifehacks to you 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.530
 the future of your buildings somehow 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.419
 way, well , help and the last fourth 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.390
 life hack now we go to him a 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.550
 fourth life hacking guys, I would like it 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.510
 here to talk about how I fill 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.820
 large bodies of water let's say so in 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.070
 buildings when you need to drain some 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.040
 space for example you want to make 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.810
 some kind of colosseum right in the ocean round 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.550
 round such a coliseum wide big 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.919
 In this case, the use of large 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.930
 space you want to fill it 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.360
 drain of course this thing does not work 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.700
 although if you play on versions 18 of that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.930
 same sponge but to get it 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.580
 play pretty pretty here but if you 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.900
 just want to drain it 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.850
 use sand fleas or gravel in 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.270
 In this case, using sand now 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.820
 you will see why it is easy and simple in 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.830
 In this case, well, I'm in mode now. 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.840
 the creative works on it all 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.330
 calm and in survival mode let's 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.000
 come down now there will be no us 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.980
 Imaginary that Nalchik see yes and here 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.440
 our sand which we set let's 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:16.220
 let's for the existence of such realism I 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.160
 take a stack of torch in myself make them 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.169
 in general it is not difficult for anyone to set up 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.930
 torch 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:29.060
 we clean run we put the torch we remove 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.310
 put the torch and did not have time put the torch all 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.790
 look we have drained and space 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.790
 if a 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.540
 deep ocean you need 30 there 40 blocks 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.390
 in depth 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.360
 drain the water you yourself understand what it is 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.740
 much easier than just standing 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.750
 with a shovel like this every block 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.970
 dig and wait while it pours 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.280
 Well, I hope that these life hacks were 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.710
 useful for you if it's put huskies 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.630
 really so thank you all for 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.770
 attention and I say goodbye to you before 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.770
 next episodes for now
