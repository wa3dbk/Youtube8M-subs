00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
pull it over the part and attach it to

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.899 
pull it over the part and attach it to
the<00:00:57.970> front<00:00:58.239> there's<00:00:58.960> no<00:00:59.769> volume<00:01:00.040> curls<00:01:00.640> where

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
the front there's no volume curls where

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.789 
the front there's no volume curls where
it's<00:01:01.030> under<00:01:01.449> directive<00:01:01.900> where<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.559> don't

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
it's under directive where you don't

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.710 
it's under directive where you don't
push<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:03.610> forward<00:01:03.939> you<00:01:04.059> actually<00:01:04.390> pull<00:01:04.600> it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
push it forward you actually pull it

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.830 
push it forward you actually pull it
back<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.290> then<00:01:05.830> there's<00:01:06.130> normal<00:01:07.090> curls<00:01:07.600> that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
back and then there's normal curls that

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.140 
back and then there's normal curls that
are<00:01:07.990> just<00:01:08.200> hooked<00:01:09.189> down<00:01:09.340> right<00:01:09.790> at<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.000> base

this<00:03:57.770> in<00:03:57.950> my<00:03:58.100> hair<00:03:58.340> then<00:03:59.210> start<00:03:59.570> putting<00:03:59.720> my

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
this in my hair then start putting my

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.230 
this in my hair then start putting my
makeup<00:04:00.050> on<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.650> then<00:04:00.860> after<00:04:01.370> I'm<00:04:01.910> done<00:04:02.090> my

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
makeup on and then after I'm done my

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.910 
makeup on and then after I'm done my
makeup<00:04:02.390> then<00:04:02.810> I'll<00:04:02.930> take<00:04:03.110> it<00:04:03.140> down<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.710> longer

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
makeup then I'll take it down the longer

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.860 
makeup then I'll take it down the longer
you<00:04:04.130> let<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.370> cool<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:05.210> better<00:04:05.450> it's<00:04:05.750> gonna

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
you let it cool the better it's gonna

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.350 
you let it cool the better it's gonna
stay<00:04:06.320> so<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:06.890> let<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.250> hair<00:04:07.550> cool<00:04:07.580> for<00:04:08.150> about

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
stay so you let the hair cool for about

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.660 
stay so you let the hair cool for about
10<00:04:08.600> minutes<00:04:08.840> I'm<00:04:09.320> gonna<00:04:09.770> start<00:04:10.130> taking<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.490> out

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
10 minutes I'm gonna start taking it out

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.000 
10 minutes I'm gonna start taking it out
it's<00:04:10.910> easier<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.510> cleaner<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.560> start<00:04:12.800> taking

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
it's easier and cleaner to start taking

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.070 
it's easier and cleaner to start taking
them<00:04:13.190> out<00:04:13.280> from<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.520> bottom<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.930> just

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
them out from the bottom so you just

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.440 
them out from the bottom so you just
take<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.500> curl<00:04:15.680> down<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.459> can<00:04:16.580> see<00:04:16.820> how

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
take the curl down and you can see how

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.020 
take the curl down and you can see how
nice<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.870> curl<00:04:18.080> is<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.590> don't<00:04:19.040> comb<00:04:19.430> my<00:04:19.640> fingers

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
nice the curl is I don't comb my fingers

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.849 
nice the curl is I don't comb my fingers
through<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.390> or<00:04:20.540> anything<00:04:20.780> until<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.410> get<00:04:21.650> all

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
through it or anything until I get all

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.070 
through it or anything until I get all
of<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.160> hair<00:04:22.370> down<00:04:22.480> so<00:04:23.480> I<00:04:23.510> just<00:04:23.750> keep<00:04:23.900> taking

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
of the hair down so I just keep taking

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.710 
of the hair down so I just keep taking
the<00:04:24.350> hair<00:04:24.530> out<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:27.620> clips<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.510> then<00:04:29.510> will

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
the hair out of the clips and then will

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.750 
the hair out of the clips and then will
style<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:30.650> I<00:04:30.680> took<00:04:30.770> out<00:04:31.040> all<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.490> clips

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
style it so I took out all of the clips

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.340 
style it so I took out all of the clips
and<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.840> what<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.110> looks<00:04:33.260> like

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
and this is what it looks like

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.290 
and this is what it looks like
undisturbed<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.310> haven't<00:04:34.640> run<00:04:34.760> my<00:04:34.910> fingers

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
undisturbed I haven't run my fingers

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.270 
undisturbed I haven't run my fingers
through<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.630> anything<00:04:35.960> yet<00:04:36.290> I<00:04:36.530> just<00:04:36.980> like<00:04:37.130> to

hair<00:04:40.520> spray<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.530> then<00:04:42.550> sometimes<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.700> like<00:04:43.880> to

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
hair spray and then sometimes I like to

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.640 
hair spray and then sometimes I like to
have<00:04:44.120> my<00:04:44.210> client<00:04:44.419> flip<00:04:44.870> their<00:04:45.020> head<00:04:45.200> over<00:04:45.470> and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.409 
run my fingers through it the other way
but<00:04:47.419> for<00:04:48.410> visual<00:04:49.160> purposes<00:04:49.370> I'll<00:04:50.090> do<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.330> this

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
but for visual purposes I'll do it this

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.750

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
way so I'll just spray a little bit of

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.000 
way so I'll just spray a little bit of
shine<00:04:52.970> spray<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.390> my<00:04:53.540> hands<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:54.980> I

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
shine spray on my hands just so that I

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.680 
shine spray on my hands just so that I
don't<00:04:55.280> get<00:04:55.580> all<00:04:55.700> those<00:04:55.850> little<00:04:56.090> frizzy<00:04:56.480> use

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
don't get all those little frizzy use

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.970 
don't get all those little frizzy use
and<00:04:56.900> stuff<00:04:57.140> like<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.410> then<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.530> just<00:05:00.770> take

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
and stuff like that and then I just take

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.920 
and stuff like that and then I just take
my<00:05:01.160> hands<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.790> run<00:05:02.060> through<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.360> route

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
my hands and run through the route

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.360 
my hands and run through the route
break<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:04.040> up<00:05:05.590> make<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.710> curls<00:05:06.950> look<00:05:07.100> really

natural

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.020 

and<00:05:21.620> you<00:05:21.680> can<00:05:21.800> even<00:05:22.009> brush<00:05:22.220> through<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.759> with

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
and you can even brush through this with

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.900 
and you can even brush through this with
a<00:05:23.060> boar<00:05:23.330> bristle<00:05:23.360> brush<00:05:24.129> so<00:05:25.129> that<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.520> smoothes

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
a boar bristle brush so that it smoothes

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:33.820 
a boar bristle brush so that it smoothes
it<00:05:26.000> out<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.360> turns<00:05:26.569> it<00:05:26.720> more<00:05:26.900> into<00:05:27.169> waves<00:05:32.830> once

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
it out and turns it more into waves once

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.740 
it out and turns it more into waves once
you've<00:05:33.979> broken<00:05:34.159> up<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.580> curl<00:05:34.789> enough<00:05:35.120> to

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
you've broken up the curl enough to

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.390 
you've broken up the curl enough to
where<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.080> like<00:05:36.259> it<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.650> just<00:05:36.979> like<00:05:37.129> to<00:05:37.280> do

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
where you like it I just like to do

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.580 
where you like it I just like to do
another<00:05:37.699> small<00:05:38.300> little<00:05:38.690> mist<00:05:38.930> of<00:05:39.110> hairspray

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
another small little mist of hairspray

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.029 
another small little mist of hairspray
just<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:40.370> keep<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.729> so<00:05:41.210> remember<00:05:41.750> how<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.710> want

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
just to keep it so remember how I want

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.980 
just to keep it so remember how I want
it<00:05:43.190> don't<00:05:43.580> put<00:05:43.789> too<00:05:43.970> much<00:05:44.000> on<00:05:44.330> or<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.840> will

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
it don't put too much on or that will

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.469 
it don't put too much on or that will
weigh<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.229> hair<00:05:45.259> down<00:05:45.620> even<00:05:46.159> more<00:05:46.190> and

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
weigh the hair down even more and

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.779 
weigh the hair down even more and
they'll<00:05:47.479> still<00:05:47.870> fall<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:49.400> this<00:05:49.520> is<00:05:49.639> what

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
they'll still fall so and this is what

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.420 
they'll still fall so and this is what
it<00:05:49.879> looks<00:05:50.030> like<00:05:50.860> after<00:05:51.860> you<00:05:51.979> did<00:05:52.129> the<00:05:52.159> pink

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
it looks like after you did the pink

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.540 
it looks like after you did the pink
curl<00:05:52.639> set<00:05:52.879> and<00:05:53.060> these<00:05:53.180> will<00:05:53.330> stay<00:05:53.539> all<00:05:53.840> day<00:05:54.550> you

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
curl set and these will stay all day you

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.189 
curl set and these will stay all day you
don't<00:05:55.610> have<00:05:55.699> to<00:05:55.880> worry<00:05:56.060> about<00:05:56.210> it<00:05:57.460> petechia<00:05:58.460> on

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
don't have to worry about it petechia on

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.650 
don't have to worry about it petechia on
take<00:06:00.199> you<00:06:00.380> long
