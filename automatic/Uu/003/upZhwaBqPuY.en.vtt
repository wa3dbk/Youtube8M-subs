00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.209 
okay now a lot of people especially with
the<00:01:57.390> original<00:01:57.750> Vibrams<00:01:58.500> were<00:01:58.619> very<00:01:58.829> concerned

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the original Vibrams were very concerned

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.910 
the original Vibrams were very concerned
about<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> lack<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.759> padding<00:02:00.560> now<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> first

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
about the lack of padding now the first

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.560 
about the lack of padding now the first
thing<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.250> apparent<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
thing that's apparent with the with the

thing that's apparent with the with the
Bakula<00:02:04.200> Evo<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.430> slightly

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
Bakula Evo is that there is slightly

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.029 
Bakula Evo is that there is slightly
more<00:02:05.939> padding<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> barefoot<00:02:07.350> purist

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
more padding and for a barefoot purist

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.279 
more padding and for a barefoot purist
okay<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:09.030> barefoot<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
put off and they probably won't even

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.559 
consider this shoe and to be honest it
did<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.140> did<00:02:17.290> worry<00:02:17.530> me<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.770> little<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.569> when

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
did it did worry me a little bit when

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.670 
did it did worry me a little bit when
when<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.900> first<00:02:20.140> got<00:02:20.349> it

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
when I first got it

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160 
when I first got it
one<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.700> my<00:02:21.790> gripes<00:02:22.060> with<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.510> vibram<00:02:22.930> and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
one of my gripes with the vibram and

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.350 
one of my gripes with the vibram and
Bakula<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.950> original<00:02:24.250> model<00:02:24.520> was<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:25.090> when

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
Bakula the original model was that when

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.440 
Bakula the original model was that when
running<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.810> on<00:02:26.020> asphalt<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.830> tarmac<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
running on on asphalt and tarmac all the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.050 
running on on asphalt and tarmac all the
time<00:02:28.660> they<00:02:28.959> do<00:02:29.019> wear<00:02:29.349> out<00:02:29.380> because<00:02:30.069> especially

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
time they do wear out because especially

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.300 
time they do wear out because especially
running<00:02:31.239> at<00:02:31.480> speed<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.380> heel<00:02:32.590> does<00:02:32.860> wear<00:02:33.099> out

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
running at speed the heel does wear out

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.630 
running at speed the heel does wear out
quite<00:02:33.640> quickly<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.900> me<00:02:35.519> obviously<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.550> do

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
quite quickly and for me obviously I do

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.880 
quite quickly and for me obviously I do
like<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> barefoot<00:02:37.360> experience<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.110> want<00:02:38.709> that

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
like the barefoot experience I want that

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.120 
like the barefoot experience I want that
and<00:02:39.099> natural<00:02:40.019> strike<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.650> want<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.920> be<00:02:42.010> able

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
and natural strike and I want to be able

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.759 
and natural strike and I want to be able
to<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.550> soft<00:02:42.970> cushioned<00:02:43.930> landing<00:02:44.590> that

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
to have that soft cushioned landing that

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.520 
to have that soft cushioned landing that
comes<00:02:44.980> not<00:02:45.580> from<00:02:45.640> padded<00:02:46.420> trainers<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.380> from

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
comes not from padded trainers but from

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.590 
comes not from padded trainers but from
actually<00:02:47.890> from<00:02:48.010> all<00:02:48.160> those<00:02:48.310> tendons<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.360> many

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
actually from all those tendons and many

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.860 
actually from all those tendons and many
many<00:02:49.900> many<00:02:50.670> tiny<00:02:51.670> little<00:02:51.970> bones<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.510> your<00:02:52.540> foot

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
many many tiny little bones in your foot

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.039 
many many tiny little bones in your foot
and<00:02:53.700> absorbing<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.850> impact<00:02:54.940> as<00:02:55.420> nature

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
and absorbing the impact as nature

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.979 
and absorbing the impact as nature
intended<00:02:56.470> not<00:02:56.769> through<00:02:56.980> cuddly<00:02:57.280> trainers<00:02:57.640> so

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
intended not through cuddly trainers so

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.410 
intended not through cuddly trainers so
for<00:02:58.989> me<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.680> was<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> concern<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:01.209> not<00:03:01.390> a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
for me it was a concern but not a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.070 
for me it was a concern but not a
massive<00:03:01.720> one<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.049> think<00:03:02.709> it's<00:03:02.830> one<00:03:03.069> one<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:04.080> 1.5

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
massive one I think it's one one and 1.5

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.449 
massive one I think it's one one and 1.5
millimeters<00:03:05.590> or<00:03:05.739> something<00:03:06.010> like<00:03:06.099> that<00:03:06.160> more

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
millimeters or something like that more

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.089 
millimeters or something like that more
so<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.269> think<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.900> back<00:03:08.230> heel<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.500> around<00:03:08.769> seven

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
so I think the back heel is around seven

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.580 
so I think the back heel is around seven
millimeters<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.840> padding<00:03:10.840> whereas<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.530> is

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
millimeters and padding whereas this is

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.370 
millimeters and padding whereas this is
around<00:03:11.980> eight<00:03:12.160> eight<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.580> half<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:14.260> be

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
around eight eight and a half and to be

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.900 
around eight eight and a half and to be
honest<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.739> probably<00:03:14.920> build<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.340> up<00:03:15.489> in<00:03:15.700> in

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
honest I probably build that up in in

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.180 
honest I probably build that up in in
hard<00:03:16.329> skin<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:16.780> my<00:03:16.900> feet<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.320> get<00:03:17.859> rid<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.070> it

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
hard skin on my feet and get rid of it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.890 
hard skin on my feet and get rid of it
and<00:03:18.340> build<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.609> up<00:03:18.640> again<00:03:18.820> over<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.480> course<00:03:19.720> of

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
and build it up again over the course of

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.800 
and build it up again over the course of
the<00:03:20.769> year<00:03:21.010> anyway<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:22.150> be<00:03:22.209> honest<00:03:22.420> not<00:03:22.750> a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the year anyway so to be honest not a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.770 
the year anyway so to be honest not a
lot<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.790> noticeable<00:03:25.390> there<00:03:25.660> is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
lot but it is it is noticeable there is

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.610 
lot but it is it is noticeable there is
more<00:03:25.959> pad<00:03:26.140> in<00:03:26.260> there<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:28.780> be<00:03:28.900> honest<00:03:29.109> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
more pad in there to be honest the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.830 
more pad in there to be honest the
quality<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.430> shoe<00:03:30.670> in<00:03:30.940> my<00:03:31.239> opinion<00:03:31.630> is

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
quality of this shoe in my opinion is

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.990 
quality of this shoe in my opinion is
better<00:03:32.019> than<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.440> original<00:03:32.470> Vibram<00:03:33.190> okay<00:03:33.670> so

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
better than the original Vibram okay so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.460 
better than the original Vibram okay so
it's<00:03:34.209> slightly<00:03:34.359> heavier<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.989> is<00:03:35.230> slightly

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
it's slightly heavier it is slightly

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.949 
it's slightly heavier it is slightly
more<00:03:35.620> padded<00:03:36.069> and<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.030> quality<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.720> my

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
more padded and but the quality in my

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.620 
more padded and but the quality in my
opinion<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.769> better<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.299> think<00:03:40.510> they're

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
opinion is better so I think they're

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.900 
opinion is better so I think they're
more<00:03:40.750> durable<00:03:40.989> they<00:03:41.739> last<00:03:41.980> better<00:03:42.250> these<00:03:42.760> were

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
more durable they last better these were

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.240 
more durable they last better these were
really<00:03:43.180> done<00:03:43.359> close<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.690> 100<00:03:44.049> miles<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:45.130> be

trainers<00:04:38.370> now<00:04:39.370> what<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.580> think<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.660> they've

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
trainers now what I think so they've

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.960 
trainers now what I think so they've
they've<00:04:41.530> increased<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.220> padding<00:04:42.520> which<00:04:42.850> I

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
they've increased the padding which I

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.670 
they've increased the padding which I
think<00:04:43.210> reduces<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.870> barrier<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.350> entry<00:04:44.500> for

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
think reduces the barrier to entry for

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.370 
think reduces the barrier to entry for
new<00:04:44.830> people<00:04:45.539> but<00:04:46.539> one<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.870> other<00:04:46.900> barriers

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
new people but one of the other barriers

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.640 
new people but one of the other barriers

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
run in in Vibrams is the fact that they

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.040 
run in in Vibrams is the fact that they
look<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.590> bit<00:04:53.620> strange<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:55.330> don't<00:04:55.690> think<00:04:55.930> the
