00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.099
 to the next episode of jam versys fame 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.660
 the first episode of this series is 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.950
 really well received by you for that 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.660
 In any case I want myself only then 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.849
 I really know what kind of support I have 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.980
 received from you and therefore gives 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.630
 it is already the second episode today and 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.220
 today it's about my job and chamberlain 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.200
 billionaire a cost 500 points that 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.090
 my job is the camp for this 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.070
 episode and the other player is 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.750
 pierre emerick aubameyang the cost 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.940
 3000 coins are that a bit 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.920
 closer to the two players 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.210
 and there we can see pierre emerick 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.149
 aubameyang has 95 76 shooting 73 matches 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.160
 78 drilling and 76 header 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.539
 he has five in six games 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.640
 gates shot and two templates 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.190
 did not make 28 thousand cross 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.350
 tasted with the basic msl and seven 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.899
 contracts mountain high medium but is tuned 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.879
 as 85 large right foot three standes applies 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.870
 and three stars we could and he is coming 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.909
 from gabon and play at borussia 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.280
 Dortmund and the game at Hannover 96 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.540
 less readers is also a big 85 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.399
 middle middle work rates so 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.500
 actually a little worse right foot 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.659
 Three put it is just that 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.369
 same has cost me 500 and six 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.600
 games and eight goals and three templates 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.180
 80 84 72 shooting what the most important 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.700
 cities are what job again 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.290
 conspicuous 56 match play has come up 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.270
 But I'll even more in the video 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.560
 and this part is coming so slowly now 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.070
 let me turn and first I want from you 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.570
 knowledge 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.189
 do you think that was an eleven meter 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.450
 write in the comments I think 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.130
 but already it did not 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.060
 Whistled where later to the engine 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.710
 That's why it was not won 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.939
 first come to who from 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.189
 the two play better and what is 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.899
 that was better with the players 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.399
 really strong now the two 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.600
 players selected I wanted only one 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.340
 put job against lewandowski 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.259
 noticed that someone like him with one 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.630
 comparable to other players is there 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.770
 will come later and yes what draws 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.330
 they are the two players out of one 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.360
 both very fast 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.400
 but with 95 88 ps one does not feel 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.740
 really a difference both very much 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.150
 In any case, just the whole thing 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.830
 away with the three stars and the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.119
 three stars so it applies to both 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.500
 both are not the strongest 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.800
 left foot but he is definitely in 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.000
 order 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.520
 The three quick money anyway 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.350
 to talk away what I noticed is 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.570
 That jobs are actually dribbling relatively 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.430
 can compose well with that too though 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.110
 mine has the speed triple is the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.790
 Close to the body if you are not straight 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.890
 In the sprint job is almost almost 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.350
 equivalent, the pass is, however, at 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.850
 Obermann definitely better if you have one 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.260
 you also want to have passports 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.160
 playing in the storm as oriente 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.170
 then you can do a bit of the game 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.370
 you should definitely core regions 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.410
 young he does not bring cost you so 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.480
 much is a web server used the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.040
 way the fame player even 73 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.420
 in contrast to the conclusion 56 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.730
 that is why one of these discipline 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.959
 definitely better just because you have no 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.550
 It can be so easy to play fat 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.440
 but where is interesting is the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.990
 shot and I personally think that 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.790
 ship actually better 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.230
 Graduation is discreetly better than 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.450
 that's what you feel in the game as well 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.300
 I really think sometimes quite well he a 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.990
 Very very good graduation in the 16 except 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.000
 to 16 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.800
 definitely the better protection at job 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.650
 also has very very low long scholz 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.930
 but strafraum comes up definitely 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.340
 not nearly over job maybe 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.019
 at the same time but I think that might be 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.300
 even a little bit better is better 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.550
 and yes so much for both are 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.739
 really close but strong 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.790
 at least in the 16er a little better too 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.380
 I think with pleasure 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.300
 can one say that often the better 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.590
 Player is still very important 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.350
 is with these two players is the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.810
 header and there is jeff mayer after 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.080
 also better he has 93 jumping power 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.950
 is 1 85 tall would have 76 jump power 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.030
 and at the same time 185 also big ship 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.860
 wins just about every headball duel 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.420
 really this is that goalkeeper from the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.709
 not eleven-meter given situation 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.880
 really came into being through profit 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.320
 every headball duel if he is not straight 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.060
 behind a player is so 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.850
 somehow if that still jumps before and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.989
 Rescue in the air really wins 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.910
 every duel one because he jump so 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.930
 Strong and big, the body is stronger 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.790
 that means he is not so easy 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.769
 daily up is not special either 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.720
 weak but at least I do not think so 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.850
 as strong as job that leads you completely 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.650
 clearly and that's why I think so 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.209
 you can compare the two well 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.000
 However, in the end I think that 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.040
 Ship a little bit 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.660
 at least if you are not better 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.070
 bit on a headball plays what yes 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.350
 many do this year he is on everyone 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.640
 good case his work racemag you notice 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.660
 not really medium video 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.459
 I think so synonymous for the ears 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.640
 home video actually even more forward 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.490
 as only so much more I would do it 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.530
 say that 's it and the winner of this 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.420
 Episode is the first time since me 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.030
 Do this series and what he did yesterday 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.250
 jam and my job i would do now 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.930
 to accept the accusation that is so 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.770
 but because I am fan 96 as is 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.080
 not because I can actually 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.240
 I have to suffer relatively little 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.580
 to say honestly and that's why I have 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.650
 because absolutely objective garden picture and the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.600
 job is against the winner of this deep 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.010
 Episode simply because yes the values 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.050
 actually are relatively the same apart 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.820
 From the two you can actually fit 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.230
 are the two completely the same but the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.910
 head is just better that's why he has 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.020
 you won this episode you can me 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.790
 We like to write in the comments 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.690
 finds better and again james 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.770
 suggest 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.570
 I will be back to matching 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.310
 looking for players that fits yes that 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.690
 today class with the right grandpa what 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.860
 We should like each other next time 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.210
 I liked those songs 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.210
 until then skin in
