so<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.060> why<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.300> a<00:01:06.660> collapsible<00:01:07.500> design

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
so that's why it's a collapsible design

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.510 
so that's why it's a collapsible design
so<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.120> backpack<00:01:09.420> and
