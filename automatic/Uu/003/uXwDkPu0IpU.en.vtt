what we don't want something like that
happening<00:02:33.690> again<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:34.470> you're<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.769> to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
happening again so if you're going to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
start getting us into those kinds of

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.619 
start getting us into those kinds of
commitments<00:02:37.879> you've<00:02:38.879> got<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.180> consult<00:02:39.510> with

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629

Congress<00:02:39.780> beforehand<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.450> think<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
Congress beforehand and I think that

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.770 
Congress beforehand and I think that
such<00:02:44.069> consultation<00:02:44.849> is<00:02:45.060> entirely

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
such consultation is entirely

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.900 
such consultation is entirely
appropriate<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:48.450> do<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.410> think<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.910> our

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
appropriate but do I think that our

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.839 
appropriate but do I think that our
actions<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.660> any<00:02:51.870> way<00:02:52.079> violate<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.670> War

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
actions in any way violate the War

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.830 
actions in any way violate the War
Powers<00:02:53.879> Resolution<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:55.500> answer<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.829> no<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.810> I

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
