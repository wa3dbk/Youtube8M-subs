00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.030
 we live now 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.990
 bissau the dfs event 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.179
 the ads system 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.359
 in assumption 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.359
 and that this book i shared folders 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.560
 these file servers 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.990
 for users 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.659
 centrally 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:21.880
 for this 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.409
 it is necessary that you have already had a dfs root 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.409
 then we will go to the administrative tools 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.140
 and we will open the distributed file system 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 we get into our distributed system 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.840
 we will create 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 the arrais 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 this root will be the root of our domain 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.400
 the domain pontonet classroom 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 and here it will meet with the server 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.530
 the tree 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.350
 that will postpone 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.100
 this root 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 I noticed that we have Doris 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.480
 computers 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 such as workstations 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.810
 and a domain controller 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.039
 this is the 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.909
 computer that will store these ess 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.220
 shortly thereafter 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.370
 he needs a name 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.580
 I'm called ipss. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910
 No comments on this comment 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.910
 is with optional 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.160
 advance 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.170
 shortly thereafter it needs a local folder 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.360
 to do 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.520
 the distribution of donoso pasta 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.680
 reservation server 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 from what i saw is a folder here 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 called in network 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.610
 we wanted to st 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.369
 the address of nasa dvds s 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.839
 It's my server. 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.539
 reservation bar 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.539
 can very well be viewed 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:17.600
 shortly thereafter 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.429
 I'll now create the links 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429
 to the other servers in the network 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.339
 then the new link 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.009
 if you create here 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.309
 the bond called binge 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.309
 What exactly is going to be? 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.119
 pointing out that she may be 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.799
 where we have 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.989
 our being kivu 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.039
 any comments 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:14.400
 I'll create too 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.589
 the other 5 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:17.909
 counting on the folder 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.909
 public 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.239
 which is on the same server and files on our network 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.509
 classroom domain 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.439
 which is certain other 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.429
 archive 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:40.839
 public 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.999
 OK 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.549
 always mean 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.549
 that when you access the root of iss 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.019
 you are accessing 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.829
 the two units 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.439
 from the other server 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.379
 in our network 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.799
 I'm going to take a test here manually. 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.799
 my new password is the password is one of three 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.829
 I'll try to access the menu served from now on. 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.259
 to know if they 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.099
 I'm going to start button 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.199
 selected pisão execute 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.360
 run run 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.599
 I can use the name oui semedo bidó 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.999
 subway point 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.999
 of reservations 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.550
 when greece opens 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.919
 you should devalue the two links that were created 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.809
 the public folder 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.610
 and the folder fails 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.400
 which contains all our files that will be hosted there and our server 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.750
 it may be that the file server path is not disclosed and is not 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.629
 revealed 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.580
 we can do the same thing 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.129
 using 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.050
 the user profile 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.949
 within the dfs 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.870
 for this, it would only be necessary to create a bond 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.279
 pointing out that the other server 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.120
 this would leave the server 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.539
 and files in the background 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.539
 not being disclosed on the network 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.249
 but our goal from now on 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:35.430
 will be 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.430
 wanted to give 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.689
 the spirit has 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.199
 where he can 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.680
 map two network drives 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.289
 the network drive stops at root dfs 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.830
 it's a year 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.880
 network drive pointing to the
