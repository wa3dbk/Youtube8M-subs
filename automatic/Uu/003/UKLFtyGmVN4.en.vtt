00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.550 

so<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.469> woke<00:00:13.799> up<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.099> morning<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.610> find<00:00:14.969> that

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
so I woke up this morning to find that

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.040 
so I woke up this morning to find that
the<00:00:16.880> batteries<00:00:18.320> had<00:00:19.320> run<00:00:19.529> down<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:21.050> basically

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the batteries had run down to basically

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.790 
the batteries had run down to basically
empty<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.970> fridge<00:00:24.109> had<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.289> been<00:00:25.500> switched

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
empty the fridge had not been switched

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.710 
empty the fridge had not been switched
to<00:00:26.070> propane<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:26.820> been<00:00:26.939> left<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.330> battery

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to propane and have been left on battery

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689 
to propane and have been left on battery
mode<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.890> uses<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.220> lot<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.429> battery

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
mode and it uses a lot of battery

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.540 
mode and it uses a lot of battery
Valerie<00:00:30.240> will<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.570> keep<00:00:30.720> training<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.830> none

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
Valerie will just keep training so none

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.970 
Valerie will just keep training so none
of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> electronics<00:00:33.360> would<00:00:33.570> work<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.649> TV

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
of the electronics would work the TV

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
of the electronics would work the TV
wouldn't<00:00:35.340> work<00:00:35.550> water<00:00:36.329> pump<00:00:36.660> wouldn't<00:00:36.989> work

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
wouldn't work water pump wouldn't work

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.479 
wouldn't work water pump wouldn't work
yeah<00:00:37.530> i<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> light<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.489> work<00:00:40.489> nothing

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
yeah i think the light to work nothing

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.650 
yeah i think the light to work nothing
so<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> stuck<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> volt<00:00:43.260> meter<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.660> house

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
so I stuck a volt meter on the house

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
so I stuck a volt meter on the house
battery<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:47.190> realized<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:48.000> at

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
battery and I realized it was down at

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.990 
battery and I realized it was down at
one<00:00:48.270> point<00:00:48.570> three<00:00:49.460> bolts<00:00:50.460> coming<00:00:50.670> off<00:00:50.850> with

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
one point three bolts coming off with

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.930 
one point three bolts coming off with
battery<00:00:51.390> should<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> 12<00:00:52.199> volts<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
battery should be up to 12 volts so this

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
battery should be up to 12 volts so this
is<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.480> good<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> battery<00:00:55.739> I'm

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
is really not good for the battery I'm

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.619 
is really not good for the battery I'm
not<00:00:56.399> sure<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.449> not

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
not sure if it's just that it's not

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.720 
not sure if it's just that it's not
sunny<00:00:58.109> enough<00:00:58.260> yet<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:59.039> recharge<00:00:59.520> them

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
sunny enough yet to really recharge them

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
sunny enough yet to really recharge them
or<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.180> need<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> jumpstart<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.680> high

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
or if they need like a jumpstart a high

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.009 
or if they need like a jumpstart a high
voltage<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.879> started<00:01:03.329> another<00:01:03.690> thing<00:01:03.930> i'm

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
voltage to get started another thing i'm

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.719 
voltage to get started another thing i'm
not<00:01:04.170> sure<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.949> charge<00:01:05.309> controller

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
not sure is if the charge controller

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.480 
not sure is if the charge controller
needs<00:01:06.030> some<00:01:06.720> power<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.200> charge<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:08.250> when

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
needs some power to charge because when

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.070 
needs some power to charge because when
i<00:01:08.520> look<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> lights<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.750> has<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
i look at the lights on it it has a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
i look at the lights on it it has a
light<00:01:10.560> next<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> target<00:01:11.430> which<00:01:11.820> means

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
light next to the target which means

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700 
light next to the target which means
that<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.420> getting<00:01:12.659> sunlight<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.500> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that it's getting sunlight but it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
that it's getting sunlight but it
doesn't<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> light<00:01:14.340> next<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> charge

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
doesn't have a light next to the charge

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260 
doesn't have a light next to the charge
indicator<00:01:15.630> i'm<00:01:16.380> concerned<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.340> needs

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
indicator i'm concerned that it's needs

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
indicator i'm concerned that it's needs
a<00:01:18.390> certain<00:01:18.630> amount<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> power<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
a certain amount of power from the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.850 
a certain amount of power from the
batteries<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> charge

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.130 

okay<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.190> battery<00:01:29.550> is<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.870> point

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
okay so the battery is down at one point

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.500 
okay so the battery is down at one point
one<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.430> freaking<00:01:32.850> me<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.000> i

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
one and that's really freaking me out i

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.090 
one and that's really freaking me out i
think<00:01:33.930> i'm<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> try<00:01:34.290> running<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.830> car

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
think i'm going to try running a car

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.040 
think i'm going to try running a car
engine<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> i'm<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> try<00:01:36.480> connecting

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
engine and i'm going to try connecting

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.150 
engine and i'm going to try connecting
the<00:01:37.350> solenoid<00:01:37.830> between<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> house<00:01:39.420> battery

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
the solenoid between the house battery

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.830 
the solenoid between the house battery
car<00:01:41.160> battery<00:01:41.370> hoping<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.420> alternator

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
car battery hoping that the alternator

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:58.220 
car battery hoping that the alternator
discharges<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.620> both<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.630> volt<00:01:57.840> meter<00:01:57.900> is

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
discharges them both the volt meter is

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.250 
discharges them both the volt meter is
reading<00:01:58.550> 1.15<00:01:59.550> ate<00:01:59.850> at<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.150> point<00:02:00.450> giving<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
reading 1.15 ate at this point giving it

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.200 
reading 1.15 ate at this point giving it
gas<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:02.010> i'm<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.490> sure<00:02:02.700> why<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.910> would

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
gas and i'm not sure why this would

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
gas and i'm not sure why this would
happen<00:02:06.590> alright<00:02:07.590> i'm<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:07.860> give<00:02:07.980> up<00:02:08.100> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
happen alright i'm going to give up and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.720 
happen alright i'm going to give up and
turn<00:02:08.369> off<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.730> car

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.670 

well<00:02:14.730> I'm<00:02:15.239> concerned<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.170> means<00:02:16.500> that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
well I'm concerned that this means that

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.330 
well I'm concerned that this means that
the<00:02:16.830> coach<00:02:17.519> battery<00:02:18.030> might<00:02:18.299> be<00:02:18.450> dead<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.110> good

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
the coach battery might be dead for good

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.559 
the coach battery might be dead for good
the<00:02:20.340> only<00:02:20.519> other<00:02:20.549> thing<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.269> is

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
the only other thing that we can do is

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.039 
the only other thing that we can do is
plug<00:02:22.439> it<00:02:22.590> into<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.920> house<00:02:23.489> or<00:02:24.239> plug<00:02:24.689> it<00:02:24.780> into<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
plug it into a house or plug it into a

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.819 
plug it into a house or plug it into a
shoreline<00:02:25.379> power<00:02:25.799> system<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:27.620> can't<00:02:28.620> think

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
shoreline power system and I can't think

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.319 
shoreline power system and I can't think
of<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.129> other<00:02:29.250> than<00:02:29.340> Ali's<00:02:29.730> mother's<00:02:30.150> house

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
of one other than Ali's mother's house

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.930 
of one other than Ali's mother's house
so<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:32.040> may<00:02:32.159> have<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.340> drive<00:02:32.549> over<00:02:32.579> there<00:02:32.909> and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
so we may have to drive over there and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.190 
so we may have to drive over there and
check<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.239> out<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.510> don't<00:02:33.659> want<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> waste<00:02:33.930> any

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
check that out I don't want to waste any

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.720 
check that out I don't want to waste any

more gas turn a charger from the
alternator<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.099> one<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.250> those<00:02:41.370> moments

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
alternator this is one of those moments

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.220 
alternator this is one of those moments
where<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.030> say<00:02:43.879> this<00:02:44.879> would<00:02:45.030> not<00:02:45.180> happen

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
where you just say this would not happen

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.200 
where you just say this would not happen
regular

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
regular

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.550 
regular
would<00:02:50.420> not<00:02:50.600> be<00:02:50.660> trying

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.140 

use<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.220> power<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.760> Sun<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.860> our<00:02:57.860> water<00:02:58.220> so

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
use the power of the Sun to our water so

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.040 
use the power of the Sun to our water so
we<00:02:59.300> can<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.599> a<00:02:59.630> morning<00:03:00.200> cup<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.470> coffee<00:03:02.050> then

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
we can have a morning cup of coffee then

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.780 
we can have a morning cup of coffee then
are<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.319> moments<00:03:03.680> where<00:03:03.830> you're<00:03:03.980> sitting<00:03:04.610> on

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
are the moments where you're sitting on

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.700 
are the moments where you're sitting on
the<00:03:04.910> street<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.450> you

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
the street and you

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.690 
the street and you
realize<00:03:08.490> that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
realize that

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.750 
realize that
you're<00:03:11.209> not<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.620> house<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:13.160> you're<00:03:13.370> on<00:03:13.550> the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
you're not in a house and you're on the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.490 
you're not in a house and you're on the
street

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
street

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.540 
street
the<00:03:15.560> middle<00:03:15.800> of<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.950> neighborhood<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.400> you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
the middle of a neighborhood that you

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.070 
the middle of a neighborhood that you
don't

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.520 

but<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:21.670> still<00:03:21.940> feel<00:03:22.120> hot

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
but you still feel hot

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.180 
but you still feel hot
and<00:03:23.920> that's<00:03:24.130> really<00:03:24.280> cool

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
and that's really cool

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:45.590 
and that's really cool
so<00:03:26.910> these<00:03:27.060> moments<00:03:27.300> are<00:03:27.480> worth<00:03:27.690> them

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.300 

so<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.720> looks<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:46.930> we're<00:03:47.140> home<00:03:47.290> free<00:03:47.530> but<00:03:48.190> not

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
so it looks like we're home free but not

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.100 
so it looks like we're home free but not
without<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.700> help<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.480> shoreline

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
without the help of a shoreline

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.400 
without the help of a shoreline
electrical<00:03:50.890> system<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.490> get<00:03:52.000> our<00:03:52.120> power

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
electrical system to get our power

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.440 
electrical system to get our power
started<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.590> get<00:03:53.800> moving<00:03:54.430> again<00:03:54.640> we<00:03:55.330> were

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
started and get moving again we were

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.820 
started and get moving again we were
able<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.750> get<00:03:55.870> this<00:03:56.020> going<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.500> now<00:03:56.680> our

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
able to get this going and now our

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.560 
able to get this going and now our
system<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.250> charging<00:03:57.580> at<00:03:57.670> optimal<00:03:58.180> rates<00:03:58.360> and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
system is charging at optimal rates and

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.600 
system is charging at optimal rates and
it<00:03:58.780> was<00:03:58.900> only<00:03:59.050> plugged<00:03:59.410> in<00:03:59.530> for<00:03:59.740> a<00:03:59.800> second<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
it was only plugged in for a second the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.730 
it was only plugged in for a second the
solar<00:04:00.850> system<00:04:00.940> is<00:04:01.420> charging<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.380> batteries

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
solar system is charging the batteries

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.860 
solar system is charging the batteries
and<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.160> needed<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.540> jumpstart<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:04.750> that

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
and it just needed a jumpstart so that

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.020 
and it just needed a jumpstart so that
the<00:04:04.990> solar<00:04:05.320> charge<00:04:05.620> controller<00:04:05.680> could<00:04:06.670> begin

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the solar charge controller could begin

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.910 
the solar charge controller could begin
to<00:04:07.180> charge<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.720> batteries<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.530> can't<00:04:08.800> work

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
to charge the batteries it can't work

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.680 
to charge the batteries it can't work
without<00:04:09.160> power<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:10.000> that's<00:04:10.180> something<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.510> be

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
without power so that's something to be

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.630 
without power so that's something to be
said<00:04:10.900> for<00:04:10.930> making<00:04:11.410> absolutely<00:04:11.860> certain<00:04:12.460> that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
said for making absolutely certain that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.000 
said for making absolutely certain that
you<00:04:13.000> don't<00:04:13.210> let<00:04:13.390> your<00:04:13.840> system<00:04:14.530> go<00:04:14.680> below<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
you don't let your system go below the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.590 
you don't let your system go below the
level<00:04:15.520> that<00:04:15.610> your<00:04:15.760> charge<00:04:16.000> controller<00:04:16.420> needs

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
level that your charge controller needs

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.850 
level that your charge controller needs
to<00:04:16.780> work<00:04:16.959> don't<00:04:17.620> be<00:04:17.769> like<00:04:17.950> me

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.839 

you

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.909 

you
