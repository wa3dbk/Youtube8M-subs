what's up guys is Johnny Candida of

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.070 
what's up guys is Johnny Candida of
Candida<00:00:02.220> training<00:00:02.669> HQ<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.510> today<00:00:03.870> we're

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
Candida training HQ and today we're

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.019 
Candida training HQ and today we're
going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.259> learn<00:00:04.380> how<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.680> deadlift<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.730> see

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
going to learn how to deadlift you see

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.970 
going to learn how to deadlift you see
here<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.690> three<00:00:07.049> steps<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.830> follow

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
here I got three steps for you to follow

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.339 
here I got three steps for you to follow
and<00:00:08.370> deadlifting<00:00:09.330> really<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.840> not<00:00:10.080> that

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and deadlifting really is not that

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.080 
and deadlifting really is not that
complex<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.340> require<00:00:11.700> some<00:00:11.969> attention

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
complex but just require some attention

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
complex but just require some attention
to<00:00:12.599> detail<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.009> are<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> two<00:00:14.370> most

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
to detail so here are the two most

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.550 
to detail so here are the two most
common<00:00:14.639> mistakes<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.570> first<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.230> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
common mistakes the first one is just a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.220 
common mistakes the first one is just a
lack<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> upper<00:00:17.400> back<00:00:17.609> tightness<00:00:18.270> which<00:00:18.990> then

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
lack of upper back tightness which then

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.470 
lack of upper back tightness which then
causes<00:00:19.500> rounding<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.369> then<00:00:21.000> here's<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
causes rounding and then here's the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480 
causes rounding and then here's the
second<00:00:21.900> mistake<00:00:22.230> where<00:00:22.560> people<00:00:22.859> often<00:00:23.220> try<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
second mistake where people often try to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.970 
second mistake where people often try to
make<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.150> by<00:00:24.779> squatting<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.800> weight

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
make up for this by squatting the weight

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.849 
make up for this by squatting the weight
up<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.060> usually<00:00:27.689> causes<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
up and what this usually causes is that

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
up and what this usually causes is that
the<00:00:29.010> butt<00:00:29.220> shoots<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.849> by<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> time<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> slack

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the butt shoots up by the time the slack

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.720 
the butt shoots up by the time the slack
is<00:00:31.410> actually<00:00:31.740> pulled<00:00:31.949> out<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> bar<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is actually pulled out of the bar and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.910 
is actually pulled out of the bar and
then<00:00:33.329> you're<00:00:33.570> back<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.350> problem

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
then you're back with the same problem

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
then you're back with the same problem
of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> upper<00:00:35.520> back<00:00:35.730> being<00:00:36.120> rounded<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
of the upper back being rounded and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
of the upper back being rounded and
having<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> pull<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> weight<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.250> rather<00:00:38.579> than

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
having to pull the weight up rather than

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
having to pull the weight up rather than
back<00:00:39.120> okay<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.379> step<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
back okay now the first step is to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
back okay now the first step is to
establish<00:00:41.370> upper<00:00:42.210> back<00:00:42.390> tightness<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.140> simple

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
establish upper back tightness a simple

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.639 
establish upper back tightness a simple
way<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.570> simply<00:00:45.930> take<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> very

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
way to do this is to simply take a very

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.100 
way to do this is to simply take a very
wide<00:00:47.039> grip<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> bar<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.780> called

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
wide grip on the bar and this is called

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.650 
wide grip on the bar and this is called
the<00:00:49.260> snatch<00:00:49.590> grip<00:00:49.860> deadlift<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.480> end

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the snatch grip deadlift now we will end

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
the snatch grip deadlift now we will end
up<00:00:51.840> moving<00:00:51.989> back<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> normal<00:00:52.920> deadlift

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
up moving back to the normal deadlift

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
up moving back to the normal deadlift
but<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> great<00:00:54.570> way<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:54.780> beginners<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
but this is a great way for beginners to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.130 
but this is a great way for beginners to
learn<00:00:56.010> how<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> keep<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.120> proper<00:00:57.629> posture

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
learn how to keep that proper posture

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
learn how to keep that proper posture
that<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> need<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.460> keep<00:00:59.699> your<00:00:59.820> upper

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that you need to then keep your upper

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.660 
that you need to then keep your upper
back<00:01:00.239> tight<00:01:00.539> which<00:01:01.050> also<00:01:01.469> avoids<00:01:02.010> lower<00:01:02.370> back

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
back tight which also avoids lower back

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.509 
back tight which also avoids lower back
rounding<00:01:03.290> now<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> nearly

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
rounding now you see here it is nearly

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
rounding now you see here it is nearly
impossible<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.390> round<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.080> lower<00:01:07.260> back

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
impossible to round your lower back

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
impossible to round your lower back
while<00:01:07.799> performing<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.549> movement<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.210> then

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
while performing this movement and then

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
while performing this movement and then
as<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.470> said<00:01:10.530> once<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.189> learn<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.729> movement

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
as I said once you learn this movement

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
as I said once you learn this movement
pattern<00:01:12.570> once<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.229> engrained<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
pattern once you get it engrained in you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.499 
pattern once you get it engrained in you
then<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.549> switch<00:01:14.820> back<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.360> standard

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
then you can switch back to the standard

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.920 
then you can switch back to the standard
deadlift<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.340> second<00:01:17.790> step<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.180> possibly<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
deadlift the second step in possibly the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.810 
deadlift the second step in possibly the
most<00:01:19.110> important<00:01:19.710> step<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> bring<00:01:20.670> your

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
most important step is to bring your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.030 
most important step is to bring your
butt<00:01:21.000> back<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.860> will

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
butt back what this will do is this will

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
butt back what this will do is this will
put<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> position<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.750> use<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:25.320> glutes

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
put you in a position to use your glutes

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740 
put you in a position to use your glutes
rather<00:01:26.340> than<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.790> relying<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.509> lower

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
rather than just relying on your lower

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.960 
rather than just relying on your lower
back<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> quads<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.979> pull<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
back and quads to pull up because you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
back and quads to pull up because you
want<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> pull<00:01:30.360> back<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.020> weight<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.770> see

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
want to pull back the weight and you see

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.010 
want to pull back the weight and you see
here<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> third<00:01:32.579> step<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.869> actually

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
here the third step now is to actually

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
here the third step now is to actually
focus<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.979> activating<00:01:35.790> your<00:01:35.880> glutes<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
focus on activating your glutes to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
focus on activating your glutes to
thrust<00:01:37.290> forward<00:01:37.920> while<00:01:38.189> you're<00:01:38.430> pulling<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
thrust forward while you're pulling the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.539 
thrust forward while you're pulling the

keep the glutes contracted the entire

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.170 
keep the glutes contracted the entire
time<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> make<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.399> smooth<00:01:47.820> movement

that<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.310> glutes

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that my glutes

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
that my glutes
stay<00:01:54.420> active<00:01:54.750> throughout<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.530> entire

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
stay active throughout the entire

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.060 
stay active throughout the entire
movement<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> whole<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.110> my<00:01:58.350> butt<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.710> back

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
movement the whole time my butt is back

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
movement the whole time my butt is back
and<00:01:59.399> Cooling<00:01:59.939> forward<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.719> wider<00:02:00.990> your

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and Cooling forward the wider your

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.690 
and Cooling forward the wider your
stance<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.890> greater<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.310> glute<00:02:02.520> activation

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
stance the greater the glute activation

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330 
stance the greater the glute activation
and<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.899> also<00:02:04.049> able<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.619> keep<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:04.950> center

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and you're also able to keep your center

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.910 
and you're also able to keep your center
of<00:02:05.369> gravity<00:02:05.460> back<00:02:06.210> more<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.290> bar<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.770> be

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
of gravity back more so the bar can be

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
of gravity back more so the bar can be
closer<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.000> however<00:02:09.599> some<00:02:09.929> people<00:02:10.140> find

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
closer to you however some people find

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.229 
closer to you however some people find
that<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:11.220> explosive<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
that they are more explosive with the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.730 
that they are more explosive with the
narrow<00:02:12.510> stance<00:02:12.989> so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
narrow stance so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
narrow stance so
it's<00:02:13.830> really<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.940> depends<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.450> your

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it's really up to you it depends on your

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.270 
it's really up to you it depends on your
limb<00:02:15.870> lengths<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.470> strengths<00:02:17.100> and
