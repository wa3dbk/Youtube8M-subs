syndrome I know I know that is happened

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.609 
syndrome I know I know that is happened
since<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:30.960> kid<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> haven't

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
since I was like a little kid I haven't

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.840 
since I was like a little kid I haven't
gone<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.070> family<00:01:32.369> boys<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
gone and my family boys are like you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.010 
gone and my family boys are like you
know<00:01:32.909> he's<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> growing<00:01:33.240> boy<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.689> makes<00:01:33.780> sense

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
know he's a growing boy it makes sense

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.480 
know he's a growing boy it makes sense
for<00:01:34.110> him<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> eat<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.250> guess

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
for him to eat that much and I guess

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.859 
for him to eat that much and I guess
that<00:01:35.700> makes<00:01:35.880> sense<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.150> an<00:01:36.240> extent<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.720> like

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that makes sense to an extent so like

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.420 
that makes sense to an extent so like
everybody<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> house<00:01:37.619> has<00:01:37.650> been<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.159> not

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
everybody in the house has been like not

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
everybody in the house has been like not
even<00:01:38.579> making<00:01:38.909> jokes<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.360> been<00:01:39.750> being<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
even making jokes or been being kind of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.569 
even making jokes or been being kind of
serious<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.040> all<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.460> have

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
serious and they all think I have

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.550 
serious and they all think I have
tapeworm<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> makes<00:01:43.079> sense<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
tapeworm and that kind of makes sense I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.929 
tapeworm and that kind of makes sense I
mean<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.740> wouldn't<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.070> surprised<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.850> they

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
mean I wouldn't be surprised so they

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.190 
mean I wouldn't be surprised so they
don't<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.450> tapeworms<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> guys

don't think I have tapeworms if you guys
what<00:01:46.500> tapeworms<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.390> know

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
what tapeworms are I don't really know

what tapeworms are I don't really know
the<00:01:48.659> scientific<00:01:49.170> explanation<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.890> know<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the scientific explanation all I know is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.740 
the scientific explanation all I know is
they're<00:01:50.340> basically<00:01:50.460> worms<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.210> stomach

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

that whatever the fuck you eat so you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060 
that whatever the fuck you eat so you
could<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.360> eat<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.110> apparently<00:01:55.950> it's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
could like eat more and apparently it's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.770 
could like eat more and apparently it's
not<00:01:56.100> good<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.299> literally<00:01:57.570> have

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
not good for you like you literally have

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
not good for you like you literally have
worms<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.469> your<00:01:58.500> stomach<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.159> mean

that<00:02:01.049> makes<00:02:01.290> sense<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.560> me<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:01.680> I'm<00:02:01.829> gonna

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that makes sense to me because I'm gonna

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.289
