00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
water vapor evaporating and moving out

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
water vapor evaporating and moving out
and<00:01:50.340> there's<00:01:50.490> 20<00:01:50.790> 20<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.360> pant<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> that's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.569 
and there's 20 20 on that pant so that's
pretty<00:01:52.200> much<00:01:52.399> industry<00:01:53.399> gold<00:01:53.729> standard<00:01:55.579> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
pretty much industry gold standard and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
seams that go over the place there's no

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.630 
seams that go over the place there's no
