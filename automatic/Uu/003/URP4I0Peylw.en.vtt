00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.379
 the transmitter for arthouse films and 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.010
 medium-sized films this time not yet 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.470
 my sister 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.220
 that comes the next work today 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.470
 I talk to you about the movie about 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.879
 time or this is called in German 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.979
 Everything a question of time 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.519
 That's a British comedy though 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.739
 now first stop in the film of 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.869
 richard curtis it comes to the tim 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.010
 father him into an ancient family 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.750
 inaugurates secret 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.790
 It is a men of his family 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.229
 possible to travel through time for 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.659
 he only has to be in a dark place 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.549
 go and make a special one 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.210
 Immediately think in which he returns 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.680
 wants to travel 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.810
 Tim, of course, immediately takes the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.920
 opportunity and ends embarrassing moments 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.810
 in its past 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.240
 after going to chaotic london 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.850
 he is one day he learns the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.130
 extremely attractive american in itself 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.929
 instantly in love with immortal he wants 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.270
 Do everything right and start with it 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.429
 the misadventures to defend the dating 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.179
 phase happen by time travel 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.189
 conceal 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.140
 but finally realized that too 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.810
 mistakes can have their good sides 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.799
 and to live just belong to the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.270
 playing main roles 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.749
 Rachel McAdams and B are watching the movie 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.939
 lasts about two hours and only from 0 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.700
 which actually released 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.579
 all about the potential for violence of this 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.310
 films says this movie is like said 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.549
 a british comedy not a bit 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.009
 Violence is super good for children 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:14.090
 but also for teenagers and even 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.650
 middle aged people say 30 is orie 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.510
 in itself is quite predictable and 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.130
 the time travel go strong in the pants 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.240
 This is one of the latest since 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.010
 back to the Future 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.900
 But that's what this film is about 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.900
 less is the focus 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.660
 just do not pay attention 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.250
 reject the focus is rather 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.750
 the relationship between the Englishman and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.630
 the young american woman getting through 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.730
 get to know each other by chance and the film shows 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.650
 on a wonderfully beautiful cover 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.730
 rich and humorous way 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.489
 British humor as our future and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.340
 our life through the little things in the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.910
 Living through the small things in everyday life 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.769
 definitely wants for example can just in 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.360
 that moment on the opposite 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.830
 street side my dream woman 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.900
 I could pass her by now 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.239
 actually meet but no I do 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.299
 yes, just this video and that's why 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.260
 I will never be this wonderful woman 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.019
 to get to know 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.410
 which happens to be 1000 times better 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.650
 looks like sacred so about 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.030
 like bar rafaeli and still there 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.430
 unbelievably intelligent is like in the mini 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.299
 granger and because i like this youtube 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.970
 video never turned it into something 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:35.900
 this is called fate and that 's the point 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:39.769
 in this movie and I have to take a quick look 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.180
 The street of the film is not only 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.799
 funny but also play some 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.930
 more serious moments in life 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.459
 who likes the trailer will be on everyone 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.440
 fall also like the movie because of the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.030
 Trailer I think is a very very 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.280
 good average over this 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.840
 all over the movie and contains too 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.459
 not just the best scenes like that 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.739
 Sometimes I have to admit that too 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.600
 that rachel mcadams here absolutely 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.519
 is worth seeing and alone through her 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.799
 smile so many boys to melt 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.870
 The combination could bring them 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.760
 along with the clumsy 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.160
 Englishman is just wonderfully funny 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.040
 and provides a good basis for one 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.889
 very romantic movie though and 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.919
 I think the movie is very beneficial 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:22.100
 the film in no moment corny and 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:26.030
 on the contrary actually very classic 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.190
 good comedic and never will 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.850
 really never embarrassing like that in some 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.139
 film 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.020
 I do not want to name names now but 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:39.830
 twilight can be so 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.140
 So that's good, it's not good 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.660
 Embarrassing romantic comedy in the cinema 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.100
 was a whole 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.570
 year of overweight and I have to 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.400
 then I admit between all those 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.990
 women sat together with miners nickname 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.220
 mask there was a bit embarrassed 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.500
 but as we said, not an extreme 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.690
 someone expects sophisticated comedy 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.060
 See the beautiful British humor 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.190
 would like to do a comedy bit of time travel 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.390
 game of confusion and allusion what 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.880
 then everything can happen 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.890
 we just as expected what forms the who 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.840
 trailer likes that will be absolutely on his 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.650
 Costs come to all boys I see the 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.890
 watch the movie 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.420
 take care that you do not melt away 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.910
 absolute danger here at rachel mcadams 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.990
 at least I felt so perhaps is 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.940
 you fare differently 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.930
 but these rachel mcadams can too 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.790
 emphasize like to okay with me 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.410
 I recommend this movie as a couple 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.450
 or together in a big one 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.390
 media group to look at the cinema 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.280
 otherwise on dvd that was film criticism 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.720
 soon again together with 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:48.890
 my sister and enjoy the movie 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.890
 customers 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.759
 oh and I have one thing left 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.439
 Forget me or mine 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.819
 sister often want to see then 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.919
 Just click ours 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.990
 private channels my sister means sense 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.969
 leon block and she reports more frequently 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.860
 sometimes from postal or other countries 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.460
 or mainly actually out 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.309
 Germany recently and her 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.889

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.689
 channel mai retro future look and 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.219
 then you see me more often if 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:25.219
 interest is not okay
