00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
that little insertion and then you just

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.809 
that little insertion and then you just
pull<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.810> lever<00:02:06.069> you<00:02:07.069> partially<00:02:07.520> pulled<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
pull the lever you partially pulled the

pull the lever you partially pulled the
lever<00:02:07.970> until<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.539> see<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:09.019> startup<00:02:09.590> arrow

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
lever until you see this startup arrow

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.920 
lever until you see this startup arrow
line<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.720> your<00:02:11.930> red<00:02:12.500> dot<00:02:12.799> right<00:02:13.100> there<00:02:16.930> and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
line up to your red dot right there and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.780 
line up to your red dot right there and
that's<00:02:18.769> right<00:02:19.160> stop<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.920> close<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:23.709> and

that's right stop it and I close it and

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.220 
that's right stop it and I close it and
I<00:02:25.790> won't<00:02:25.910> do<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.209> right<00:02:26.390> now<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:26.810> there's<00:02:27.170> a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
I won't do this right now but there's a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.030 
I won't do this right now but there's a
s<00:02:27.410> right<00:02:27.650> here<00:02:27.859> you<00:02:28.459> keep<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:29.739> advancing<00:02:30.739> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
s right here you keep on advancing the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.550 
s right here you keep on advancing the
film<00:02:31.220> until<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.640> see<00:02:31.820> number<00:02:32.090> 1<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:33.410> reason

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
film until you see number 1 the reason

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.020 
film until you see number 1 the reason
why<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.799> don't<00:02:34.100> I'm<00:02:34.370> going<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.579> bouncing<00:02:34.940> it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
why I don't I'm going to bouncing it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.780 
why I don't I'm going to bouncing it
right<00:02:35.180> now<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.359> because<00:02:35.570> when<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.560> do<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.920> you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
right now is because when I do that you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.490 
right now is because when I do that you
know<00:02:37.910> when<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.780> gets<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.079> 1

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
know when it gets to 1

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.090 
know when it gets to 1
I<00:02:39.530> actually<00:02:40.220> push<00:02:40.700> she<00:02:40.880> accidentally<00:02:41.660> pushed

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
I actually push she accidentally pushed

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.800 
I actually push she accidentally pushed
the<00:02:43.100> shutter<00:02:43.370> button<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.910> there<00:02:44.570> goes<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the shutter button and there goes the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.390 
the shutter button and there goes the
waste<00:02:44.989> of<00:02:45.140> film<00:02:45.260> right<00:02:45.530> there<00:02:45.739> well<00:02:46.130> at<00:02:46.250> least

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
waste of film right there well at least

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.390 
waste of film right there well at least
one<00:02:46.549> frame<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:48.230> that's<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.799> is<00:02:48.859> pretty<00:02:49.340> much

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
one frame but that's this is pretty much

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.690 
one frame but that's this is pretty much
it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.050

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
how do you load a film in this camera

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.819 
how do you load a film in this camera
it's<00:02:53.570> an<00:02:53.630> awesome<00:02:53.750> camera<00:02:54.109> it's<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.410> six<00:02:54.650> by

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
nine camera a lot of detail a lot of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.800 
nine camera a lot of detail a lot of
contrast<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.549> limbs<00:02:58.730> slit<00:02:58.940> very<00:02:59.150> contrasty

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
contrast the limbs slit very contrasty

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.910 
contrast the limbs slit very contrasty
but<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.590> results<00:03:00.980> are<00:03:01.069> awesome<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.920> they

but the results are awesome and they

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.449 
but the results are awesome and they
call<00:03:04.220> is<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.489> Texas<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:06.100> it's<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.190> rangefinder

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
call is a Texas like it's a rangefinder

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.620 
call is a Texas like it's a rangefinder
see<00:03:08.359> why<00:03:08.510> -<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.950> huge<00:03:10.640> rangefinder<00:03:11.239> that's

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
see why - it's a huge rangefinder that's

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.289 
see why - it's a huge rangefinder that's
what<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.829> have<00:03:12.950> two<00:03:13.280> shutter<00:03:14.000> releases

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
what it is you have two shutter releases
