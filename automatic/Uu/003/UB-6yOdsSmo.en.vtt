00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.160
 hello and all 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.950
 again it goes about nail sausages from 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.190
 polymer clay and today I will show you 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.220
 how to make citrus sausage in this 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.130
 the case is lemon but why i called 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.060
 citrus fruits because in this way 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:29.050
 can be made by taking any absolutely color 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.739
 orange green reddish can 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.559
 make and orange and grapefruit and lime then 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.130
 there is any citrus which we have slices 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 done like this well there 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.200
 In principle, there are many different ways 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.810
 more believable way with love 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.260
 We are points with such rounded and there are 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.190
 triangular lobule way matter 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.239
 citrus but here i like to do more 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:03.489
 rounded off such petals and today 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:06.810
 i make lemon to make us 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:11.310
 and lemon sausage we take 3 colors 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.250
 this is normal white color 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.710
 translucent yellow color and 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.229
 dark yellow color opaque I'll take 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.020
 I just have different manufacturers 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.890
 coincided that there are colors that are different 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.690
 manufacturers 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.380
 white and yellow we can prepare already 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.790
 stretch the balls 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.090
 light yellow let translucent 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.280
 yellow if we have it in the bar can 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.549
 divide it immediately into 8 slices 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.390
 8 identical parts just every 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.790
 the knead part is much more convenient than 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.700
 a big piece here on such small 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.420
 parts can be divided and each such 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.720
 slice 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.049
 one of the eight we knead the ball well 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.909
 plus or minus size should be the same 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.920
 but this is not a matter of principle 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.740
 next we have to do these 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.759
 slices them and do not quite 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.500
 complex and the ball is a little bit when we squeeze but 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.139
 not much to still height 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.310
 preserved and doing here such 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:20.760
 corner pinch all 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.099
 here are all the actions that need to be done 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.440
 to make such a slice so we and 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.349
 do with all v8 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.720
 with all eight pieces with all 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.330
 we should have slices here 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 such a yellow light yellow flower 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.720
 of eight petals and further we now 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.940
 take the white color we need it in order 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.280
 to make the veins between these 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.480
 we roll out the slices into a thin layer 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:54.000
 somewhere about two millimeters thick 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.790
 and put the side of the dollars 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.360
 slices to 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.590
 mark the height doing a few such 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 notches just for convenience 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.390
 once we measure one slice and understand 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.220
 we will cut further on ready 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.340
 make the markup a little bit longer than 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.739
 our slice is such a plate 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.320
 on one side of each lobule 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:27.329
 we put a slice on one plate 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.959
 and so we make 8 cloves of each slice 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:34.350
 attached white plate and glue them 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.780
 we get the exact same circle 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.390
 flower 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.700
 only eight petals with white 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.370
 already streaked as you see in the center 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.620
 left a hole he they need to fill 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:56.250
 make such a small white top hat and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.870
 we fill them our gap further from 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.350
 white sausages make here so long 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.120
 the ribbon and our little flower we just 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.910
 wrapped around this white ribbon 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.359
 we keep our petals do not press down 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.880
 their they should be exactly semicircular 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:20.130
 so here around 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.870
 8 petals wrapping tape too much 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.110
 cut off 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.280
 and in order to keep the shape 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.820
 semicircular petals need to fill 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.580
 white space 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.560
 cut the sausage into 8 pieces 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.620
 with our little flower and apply to those 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.070
 dents to which we have left between 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.120
 petals here it turns out such a wheel with 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.310
 You can shrink it further with a flower 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.660
 that is, we will not be able to align 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.880
 hang around our every detail so here 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.840
 such a round puck it becomes already 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.080
 taller and a couple of days and now should be 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.340
 final last yellow dark yellow 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:15.000
 layer is imitation of lemon peel we have it 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.210
 roll out into a plate about thickness 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.880
 3 millimeters 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.539
 we cut off even the edge and we wind it 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.000
 already the last last layer is wrapped 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.419
 around 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.570
 we cut our lemon level 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.160
 and smooth our edges so that we have 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:41.090
 Sausage looked beautiful without joints 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:45.060
 now it's time to squeeze the sausage 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:50.250
 sausage starts at sausage compression 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:54.090
 starts with the case does not waist do waist 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.400
 It looks like a stub and it turns out further 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.360
 you can roll if we have a round 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.840
 sausage lemon watermelon can be it all 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.289
 roll the main thing not to twist like 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.580
 k over the coil don't twist ok 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.949
 scrolling smoothly 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.039
 roll out on table and stretch 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:16.949
 width if on the table starts to not fit 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:19.650
 our sausage we divide it in half now 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:23.250
 you can see the result of our 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.880
 works in large diameter and beyond 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.669
 continue to work until we 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.400
 arrange the diameter of the sausage can be made 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.310
 perfectly 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.410
 different diameter for all occasions from 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:40.240
 thick house very very thin and 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.870
 bake for example half to 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.539
 then cut and decorate a half for 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.759
 in order to do for example pour 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.750
 beads can be left raw 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:54.520
 and somewhere to store the whole thing 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.800
 be sure to level the sausage to 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.410
 it was perfectly round but because 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.840
 after baking you already fix it not 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.830
 Can I have made myself different 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.860
 diameters from here so thick 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.660
 beautiful big lemon yes 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:15.220
 totally thin which i will 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:18.160
 decorate cakes and culinary pastries from 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.910
 polymer clay and bake everything in 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.030
 duhovochke and here our actual results 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:30.009
 a bunch of sausages still half in my cheese 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:33.280
 form as is usually done doing citrus 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:36.940
 most simply of all types of sausages 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.750
 citrus sausages are very very simple 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.820
 made with a flower like this 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.610
 I also have several options 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.260
 manufacturing 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:50.260
 let's not argue which one 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.800
 better this is my option so i'm doing 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.620
 so there are triangular forms they are more 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.229
 even easier to manufacture hope 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.500
 you liked the master class and all for now 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.500
 until
