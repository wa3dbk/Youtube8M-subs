it so I've just distract it done this
pack<00:01:49.860> opening<00:01:50.310> instead<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.740> my<00:01:52.740> next

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
pack opening instead and then my next

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.499 
pack opening instead and then my next
episode<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.579> roast<00:01:53.909> million<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.360> I'll

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
episode will be roast million where I'll

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
episode will be roast million where I'll
probably<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> players<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.640> find

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
probably go back to players or if I find

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
probably go back to players or if I find
another<00:01:57.149> method<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> consumables<00:01:58.409> i'll

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
another method with the consumables i'll

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.249 
another method with the consumables i'll
use<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> these<00:02:00.630> packs<00:02:00.869> I'm<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.110> really

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
use that so these packs I'm not really

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.719 
use that so these packs I'm not really
getting<00:02:01.439> anything<00:02:01.710> particularly<00:02:02.460> fantastic

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
getting anything particularly fantastic

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.170 
getting anything particularly fantastic
and<00:02:03.450> why<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.619> phone<00:02:04.829> always<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.670> off<00:02:05.820> when

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
and why is my phone always go off when

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.460 
and why is my phone always go off when
i'm<00:02:06.360> recording<00:02:07.489> they've<00:02:08.489> been<00:02:09.060> answered

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
i'm recording they've been answered

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.490 
i'm recording they've been answered

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so we're on to the final I believe three

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.780 
so we're on to the final I believe three
packs<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.730> Jumbos<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> meal<00:02:16.200> now

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
very very good car that's worth 10,000

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.300 
very very good car that's worth 10,000

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
consumables don't go for nearly as much

this<00:02:41.760> paragon<00:02:42.210> Buffon<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.900> I've<00:02:43.530> got<00:02:43.709> this

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
this paragon Buffon and I've got this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.490 
this paragon Buffon and I've got this
Pacey<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.800> Syria<00:02:46.800> be<00:02:47.040> player<00:02:47.400> who<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.660> didn't<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
Pacey and Syria be player who I didn't I

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.960 
Pacey and Syria be player who I didn't I
didn't<00:02:49.680> know<00:02:49.770> what<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:49.980> lead<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.610> played<00:02:50.820> in

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
didn't know what a lead you played in

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.060 
didn't know what a lead you played in
which<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.209> why<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.360> checked<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:53.040> be

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
which is why I checked it it would be

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.170 
which is why I checked it it would be
nice<00:02:53.370> if<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.670> was<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:54.140> like<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> Brazil<00:02:55.740> league

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
nice if it was a like a Brazil league

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.860 
nice if it was a like a Brazil league
because<00:02:57.180> he<00:02:57.270> probably<00:02:57.420> would<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.780> worth

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
because he probably would it be worth

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.260 
because he probably would it be worth
about<00:02:58.230> another<00:02:58.500> two<00:02:58.950> thousand<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.610> this<00:03:00.150> is

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
about another two thousand and this is

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.970 
about another two thousand and this is
the<00:03:00.390> very<00:03:00.660> last<00:03:00.870> pack<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.410> hope<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:01.709> open

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
the very last pack we hope and we open

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.140 
the very last pack we hope and we open
up<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.190> believe<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.490> supposed<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.910> be<00:03:03.000> Jack

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
up I believe that supposed to be Jack

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.030 
up I believe that supposed to be Jack
Wilshere<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.810> could<00:03:04.380> be<00:03:04.500> wrong<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.860> but

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
Wilshere I could be wrong on that but

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.160 
Wilshere I could be wrong on that but
I'm<00:03:05.459> guessing<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.180> supposed<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.050> this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
I'm guessing that supposed to be in this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.460 
I'm guessing that supposed to be in this
pack<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.880> we<00:03:08.880> get<00:03:09.120> an<00:03:09.570> Adler<00:03:10.020> who's<00:03:10.260> not

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
pack and we get an Adler who's not

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.370 
pack and we get an Adler who's not
really<00:03:10.620> great<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.310> storage<00:03:11.880> who<00:03:12.260> would<00:03:13.260> be

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
really great and a storage who would be

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.020 
really great and a storage who would be
so<00:03:13.590> much<00:03:13.770> better<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.250> silver<00:03:14.550> player<00:03:14.760> I

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
so much better as a silver player I

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.970 
so much better as a silver player I
agree<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.510> he<00:03:15.750> should<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.140> gold<00:03:16.380> but

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
agree that he should be a gold but

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.380 
agree that he should be a gold but
there's<00:03:17.310> just<00:03:17.519> certain<00:03:17.670> cards<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.239> just

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
there's just certain cards that you just

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.690 
there's just certain cards that you just
want<00:03:18.660> them<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> be<00:03:19.140> silver<00:03:19.560> instead<00:03:19.800> I<00:03:20.160> guess

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
want them to be silver instead I guess

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.449 
want them to be silver instead I guess
what<00:03:20.880> fitness<00:03:21.239> which<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.630> obviously<00:03:22.459> really

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
what fitness which is obviously really

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.759 
what fitness which is obviously really
good<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> 4411<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.959> wasn't<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.350> too<00:03:25.530> bad<00:03:25.739> of

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
good a 4411 so that wasn't a too bad of

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.500 
good a 4411 so that wasn't a too bad of
packing<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:26.370> when<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.610> wasn't<00:03:26.850> recording<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
packing then when I wasn't recording I

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.780
