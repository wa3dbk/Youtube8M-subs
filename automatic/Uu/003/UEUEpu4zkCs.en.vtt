00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hi everyone, today I am 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.450
 prepared for you a review of three 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.460
 product site fashional if you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.950
 interesting then be sure to stay with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.780
 me and keep watching this video 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.910
 when I was offered to choose a few 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.820
 things I decided that I want to compare 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.470
 necessarily original with a fake and my 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.720
 the choice was nike of ski 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.359
 sneakers that I love more 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.580
 years and very kind to them and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.130
 so therefore I want to share with you 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.470
 your impressions let's start 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 I'll probably start with the fact that nike free 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.780
 these are extremely lightweight sneakers that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.640
 made by seamless technology believe 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.500
 the sneaker is decorated with perforated 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 patterns that not only decorate 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.110
 shoes but also gives your feet breathe and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.870
 it is actually very important 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.989
 sneaker is very flexible sole of sneaker 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.629
 literally can be bent together and this is me 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.850
 It seems very cool depreciation also 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.489
 provides elasticity elka and very 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 soft lining sneakers does not have 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 language that is, they are absolutely solid and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.979
 it keeps them tightly 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 to be fixed on the leg 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.470
 nike free sneakers are also called running 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 barefoot, so they are so light 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.119
 so comfortable and superb 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 foot feel you even them 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.009
 absolutely not feel and so now 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.680
 understanding that they represent themselves 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.170
 let me compare the original with the fake on 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.270
 in fact, if you have no idea how 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 looks like the original and generally not in principle 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.740
 understand this topic is likely 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.060
 all these differences for you will be quite 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.130
 insignificant 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.680
 but since I had the original compare 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.720
 I was very easy and let's get started 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.299
 I'll probably start with the fact that the insoles 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.869
 the original more porous softer 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.420
 whether 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.399
 the material from which the top is also made 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.149
 softer is much more flexible than 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.820
 For example, the Chinese version of the foot length 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.210
 25 centimeters usually that nike that 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.439
 adidas assign eight that is 39 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.829
 European size 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.750
 the Chinese sample costs 40 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.520
 which once again proves that 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.990
 First of all 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.670
 sizes do not match and secondly 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.480
 if you order 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.390
 shoes are just the same from China 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.730
 take on size more as for 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.860
 perforation then chinese sneakers it 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.739
 smaller in size but hers 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.519
 times 2 probably more and and and she 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.400
 much more often than the original 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.980
 and the original nike free is written on 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.930
 a white background from the Chinese on gray but on 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.790
 in fact this difference is absolutely not 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.799
 will be noticeable because when you 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.720
 tie your shoelaces 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.130
 they actually block this 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.280
 logo I will redo this 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.950
 this label and now the most important thing is that 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.170
 distinguishes the original from a fake just 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.600
 the very important question of why 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.090
 Strictly speaking, buy similar 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.480
 sneakers is a sole because sole 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.890
 sneakers decides absolutely everything 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.500
 The Chinese version of the sole is also covered in 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.230
 slotted many brass knuckles she is absolutely not 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.440
 it adds in comparison with the original 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.209
 almost like wood it's true i 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.459
 I am sure that in such sneakers leg 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.500
 will feel let go a little but 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.220
 still less comfortable than in 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.069
 the original 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.170
 because the depreciation will be all the same 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.510
 much weaker than the original 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.730
 sneaker but finally it is very high 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.609
 the likelihood that the sole is fast 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 it will wear out it will crack in 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.950
 that it is generally a problem of all 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.750
 fakes of all fakes of shoes because 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.220
 their sole is more like 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.370
 plastic rather than 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.560
 I recommend high-quality rubber 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.650
 sneakers only if u 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.599
 you have no funds to purchase 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.220
 the original also I would probably 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.349
 advised to purchase 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.540
 if you just want in these sneakers 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.010
 walk up that is you are not going 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.830
 engage in intense 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.750
 some workouts well and for example you 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.120
 just want to work out at the gym 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.549
 the hall there in principle also does not need to have 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.470
 wear resistant sneakers and so on 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.870
 sneakers is everything and we turn to 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.159
 men's watch with a black strap which 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.280
 called ivy 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:13.040
 with surely choosing them not I choosing them 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.579
 words and chose them to your own taste and 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.310
 Colour 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.159
 By the way, I was very pleased with my choice 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.650
 I was very pleased and so the clock is big 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:25.039
 they have a large dial of Arabic numerals 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.409
 it is convenient to all of this is perfectly clear 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.660
 definitely a big plus for second 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:32.150
 hands separate dial 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.640
 it is just below the second small dial 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.010
 and enough for a stopwatch diss on 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.290
 my opinion is very conservative black 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.140
 silver metal background and strap which 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.840
 imitates reptile skin agree 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.400
 very very restrained around the edges of the strap 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.070
 stitched and how you see the lines are even 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.530
 nowhere sticking out of thread and sticking out of 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.230
 I didnâ€™t cut anything off 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.780
 edited inside engraving like on 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.780
 the strap and on the watch themselves watches by the way 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.190
 very heavy strangely now what 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.960
 I did not like it, I hope that you 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.270
 Now clearly visible but on the side 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.760
 blue spraying deposited 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.790
 which originally actually was 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.790
 caused very unevenly and therefore with 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.100
 one mechanism we have this spraying 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.810
 worn out and we wait when erased from 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.660
 other mechanisms because it 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.890
 dusting but only the port picture itself 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.320
 furniture fittings 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.240
 watches themselves are very high quality 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.610
 very heavy as i said metal 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.700
 really nice watch came here in 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.820
 This case is the usual prisoner frames 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.980
 leather imitation paper also logo 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.220
 brand gold plating in principle 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.020
 looks good from the top but inside here 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.980
 again the same gold plating 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.930
 very poorly performed 10 on the light and here 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.200
 such a pillow from which sticks out 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.200
 sintepone if you see, and generally cloth 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.720
 so no white or beige and icteric I 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.780
 I would say so, therefore, the principle is not 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.880
 Looks expensive Yes and also the case was 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.460
 placed in a carton box most 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.910
 ordinary she performs more precisely 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.010
 protective function 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.920
 and the last for today is a clutch wallet 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.410
 from hermes allegedly kilmes bright yellow 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.620
 the colors that came in the case in the box 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.960
 very cool everything looked executed on 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.970
 with the perimeter texture material as 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.310
 you will see all white stitched 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.910
 Again, the lines are not straight. 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.760
 stick out 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.620
 everything is perfect enough clasp 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.740
 is a metal element 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.260
 brand logo and the strap from 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.810
 wallet two large internal departments 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.730
 which never closes first 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.830
 department enough masks there you can 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.470
 put banknotes in fact what 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.810
 she make a wide department inserted mini 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.030
 wallet he has enough masks he has 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.550
 the department can become a zipper, that is, you can 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.920
 put there too little things can 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.620
 By the way, put the same banknotes if 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.840
 you are afraid i like to drop though me 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.540
 nothing never say face does not fall out 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.580
 also this mini wallet has 8 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.860
 plastic card slots with 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.900
 the back of the two small pocket 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.060
 wide section I also sometimes our 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.889
 phone because when i go to 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.620
 I am too lazy to carry a shop 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.719
 bag and in this wallets savers i 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.330
 I call it fit absolutely everything to me 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:21.120
 need a wide department too 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.590
 plastic card compartment and also 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.169
 outside office decorated with the logo 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.960
 again the same brand and two 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.999
 miniature pockets want to say that 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.219
 the wallet we liked him very much and 

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:35.159
 bright years really do not attract 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:37.710
 attention does not fit all necessary 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:40.050
 and so I became very unconditional 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.569
 happy with it all i hope the video 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.909
