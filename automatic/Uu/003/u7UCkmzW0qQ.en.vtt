 Hello everyone, I am Evgeny black 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.230
 and recently I called the site came across 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.330
 question what kind of person asked 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.730
 communication did not even ask expressed his 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.619
 the opinion that books are no longer needed and that 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.400
 why read books if you can now 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.770
 watch films 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.579
 And in hd quality and it is a little 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.840
 strained 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.090
 and in this video I want to tell 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.689
 several reasons why it is worth reading 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.000
 books let's start when you read 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.370
 return good authors who are good and 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.470
 write beautifully you yourself start beautifully 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.540
 speak and express better 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.740
 after all agree much more interesting 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.780
 talk to a man who 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.150
 competently and beautifully expresses his thoughts 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.220
 people who read a lot will always 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.620
 lead people who prefer 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.350
 reading some interesting book 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.840
 views of a movie the same 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.880
 the most with television tv never 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.850
 develops your mental ability 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.960
 TV tupit and zombies read 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.360
 the book is always much better 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.460
 watched movie why you ask 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.409
 because your fantasies are not 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.030
 restrictions on special effects you can 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.219
 create your own heroes yourself 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.990
 which characters you like and on which 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.600
 you will be pleased to watch you do not me 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.789
 believe try to read any 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.280
 book and then look at the film version 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.990
 this book and you will be disappointed 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.149
 because there is no better director than 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.210
 your imagination the more you read 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.179
 the less you look like other people 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 less you imitate other people can 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.009
 divide people into two types of those who 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 reads books and those who listen to those who 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.069
 reading books 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.229
 the more you read the more you 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.630
 gaining knowledge speak in order to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.079
 become smart you need to read 10 15 books 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.429
 but to find those 10 or 15 books 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.219
 for this you need to read thousands 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.350
 books books inspires and motivates on 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.450
 improving in yourself and creating the best 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.880
 results book helps to find a way out 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.709
 from any situation reading books you can 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.600
 find the perfect self image in 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.850
 any 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.220
 and subsequently embody this image in 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.590
 books form a worldview by reading 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.140
 the right book man forms himself 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.510
 so I hope I made you believe in 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.650
 what books need to be read and useful, and I 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.330

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.130

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.720
 books from crime but there is 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.390
