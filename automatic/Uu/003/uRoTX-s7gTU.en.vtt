00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
you know i love the study of archaeology

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.020 
you know i love the study of archaeology
you<00:00:11.559> know<00:00:11.650> archaeology<00:00:12.280> wasn't<00:00:12.520> even<00:00:12.700> a<00:00:12.760> soft

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
you know archaeology wasn't even a soft

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.930 
you know archaeology wasn't even a soft
science<00:00:13.480> until<00:00:13.660> about<00:00:14.260> 150<00:00:14.950> years<00:00:15.160> ago<00:00:15.220> and

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
science until about 150 years ago and

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.609 
science until about 150 years ago and
what<00:00:16.090> i<00:00:16.119> mean<00:00:16.180> by<00:00:16.330> that<00:00:16.450> before<00:00:16.810> 150<00:00:17.410> years<00:00:17.560> ago

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
what i mean by that before 150 years ago

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.890 
what i mean by that before 150 years ago
it<00:00:18.160> was<00:00:18.279> just<00:00:18.430> treasure<00:00:18.760> hunting<00:00:19.210> it<00:00:19.480> was<00:00:19.689> just

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
it was just treasure hunting it was just

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.160 
it was just treasure hunting it was just
opportunists<00:00:20.619> going<00:00:21.010> in<00:00:21.160> and<00:00:21.510> robbing<00:00:22.510> graves

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
opportunists going in and robbing graves

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.439 
opportunists going in and robbing graves
and<00:00:23.590> stealing<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.340> gold<00:00:24.520> and<00:00:24.850> hauling<00:00:25.210> it<00:00:25.330> off

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
and stealing the gold and hauling it off

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.150 
and stealing the gold and hauling it off
somewhere<00:00:25.900> but<00:00:26.470> within<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.800> last<00:00:26.980> hundred

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
somewhere but within the last hundred

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.740 
somewhere but within the last hundred
and<00:00:27.369> fifty<00:00:27.610> years<00:00:27.850> we've<00:00:28.029> really<00:00:28.300> started<00:00:28.480> to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
and fifty years we've really started to

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.280 
and fifty years we've really started to
apply<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:30.010> least<00:00:30.250> a<00:00:30.369> soft<00:00:30.640> science<00:00:31.090> a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
fifty years I mean not only are we

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.810 
fifty years I mean not only are we
falling<00:00:44.230> into<00:00:44.469> ancient<00:00:44.620> civilizations<00:00:45.579> that

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
hundreds of years the Hittites and we've

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.160 
hundreds of years the Hittites and we've
fallen<00:00:51.760> into<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.149> city<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.480> Nineveh<00:00:52.960> and

we've started excavating Babylon in all
these<00:00:55.540> different<00:00:55.750> places<00:00:56.050> but<00:00:56.980> we<00:00:57.190> also<00:00:57.340> broke

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
these different places but we also broke

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.410 
these different places but we also broke
the<00:00:58.090> code<00:00:58.360> on<00:00:58.750> certain<00:00:59.170> dead<00:00:59.530> languages

the<00:01:16.450> last<00:01:16.630> 2,000<00:01:17.289> years<00:01:17.319> and<00:01:17.740> now<00:01:18.190> we've

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
the last 2,000 years and now we've

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.340 
the last 2,000 years and now we've
broken<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.000> code<00:01:19.209> so<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.569> we<00:01:19.780> can<00:01:19.959> read<00:01:20.170> all

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
broken the code so that we can read all

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.930 
broken the code so that we can read all

in in basements of museums for for so

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.460 
in in basements of museums for for so
long<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:25.000> then<00:01:25.360> we<00:01:25.479> also<00:01:25.630> broke<00:01:25.959> the<00:01:26.110> code<00:01:26.259> on

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
long and then we also broke the code on

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.800 
long and then we also broke the code on
Egyptian<00:01:27.009> hieroglyphics<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.910> mean<00:01:28.300> yes<00:01:28.539> did
