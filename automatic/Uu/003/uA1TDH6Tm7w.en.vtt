00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
 look at cover that barrier that gets prizes from think first 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.490
 and ronald koeman being a player of the year of the first and second day 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.559
 and the top scorer at the ds 79 that his elections are the player of the year 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 organized by the voter portus association 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.110
 then they had the viewer after that match 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.710
 and then we see a building full of beers 79 in the first half 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.470
 could come a week with a game of psv 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.659
 Herein crosses of bogers 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.809
 and then it is real of the wheel that was going to be called with that ball 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:32.850
 well shielded by coach 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.620
 simply be executed by 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.820
 ans of fractures 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 then psv that was what the team with the more qualities was so nice here 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.280
 vanenburg what see how simple lie where you can go at barclays 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.899
 and then there comes the cross that does not get this under control 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.329
 and then the cell Hans Gilhaus too late to hit the road with that ball 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.670
 he can do this with similar resemblance and so it stays that moment it is still 0 0 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.610
 PSV previously did not get the most out of their jugs so that they could fit badly on this 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.710
 yellow vanenburg 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.820
 intercepted by the cultivation image of that of sitting on the outside and marco 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.909
 borsato penalty area and and then eins him closely 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.329
 who brings one all the way out so that his not beloved way 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.420
 the goal could follow also feeds you now so no penalty and stays that way 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.850
 of course still 0 0 of a time for ds 79 iran is jan van de 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.840
 hearing the wheel may continue after all the coach chokes on that ball and then 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.799
 he is only going to use it or finish on the ball trees a nice curve 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.090
 but next to goal 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.710
 now here in action from bogeys that you played a lot for themselves 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.450
 this afternoon 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.190
 because that boy who wants to go higher and away but he plays the ball and kuman 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.190
 if that attack starts via lerby then becomes a citizen along the line 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.770
 sent 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.450
 and who then goes to see what's going on with an unusual bar behind an ass 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.080
 and very simple is the acv hans gilhaus that can buy 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.009
 romano fully watches 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.170
 and that means the first goal for PSV 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.790
 and a no way position 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.700
 ws 79 noon everything was well under care that psv no further as 3 0 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.590
 would come because at least the number of goals scored will remain the premier division 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.840
 year under one hundred 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.600
 Leers is trying to attack the CEO of wares here an action from your Jan van 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.200
 the wheel pot of fracture intercepts well and then separates barrier nets too 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.909
 let's come to a striking one 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:08.889
 may fall out 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.729
 and thus it stays 0 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.409
 PSV continues to attack Hierden Jermaine who brings the ball 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.570
 the frank arnesians 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.810
 and they do something very strange and you stumble and fall in pain 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 to the ground 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.440
 however, behind the goal line, then care will take place 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 and the competition that just continues 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.639
 these people in obdam of state the ball thereby honoring marco boogers 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.969
 again on the right side of the field what can do with that ball 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.299
 he goes on to the back lines costs before they do comes here 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.669
 cross and then he failed to hit the ball 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.259
 he was very unhappy this afternoon we are not at the bottom of the curve 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.600
 control who is removed where and then most 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.500
 and then brought to the hospital and that probably will 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.459
 be converted to be torn at the ankle straps 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.969
 but life goes on by nds on football too 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.209
 at bart swings earlier maybe 9 he is too late to break up is not too fast 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.209
 off 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.420
 then it is again the psv you what then the attacks start thinking 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.279
 who kieft in the person of the willem 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.279
 who seek that why space is 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.869
 look a little what the upcoming man sat there himself other for the nedap torture 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.559
 sit in between they still have a notorious possession of the ball 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.119
 At the ball then on the outsides German first mail came and went 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.089
 inventory cross refused to be harmless for 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:33.469
 is made a corner of is around a series 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.680
 then the ball loss on the left side of the field crosses 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.309
 vanenburg only kieft for 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.159
 kees cold steel tries or got over it by making a failure 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.779
 but the advantage rule is applied and will come to be very simple 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.289
 scoring the first goal this afternoon 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:50.969
 m that means that the position so just before the rest because there have arrived on well 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.819
 two ended up 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.569
 then not yet passed psv trying got even more again 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.799
 so comes from a bridge 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.679
 a top bumpy field a robot that luckily ball for the train too far 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.679
 besides on purpose but for it so tells that there is a shortage it is possible to 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.179
 lots of work 0 2 was between bridge position 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.339
 Then start the second half with the palm actions and the waste for you from 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.990
 wants with this 79 but by psv what initially attacks 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.010
 You then lead offers with his pass to Willem Kieft that a meter or two 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.890
 offside 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.049
 but may continue 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.000
 And then score it the second half takes two minutes already played Willem 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.460
 please 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.460
 his second goal in this match 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:33.719
 final score between at 3 0 and then the maximum reached what we are today against 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.189
 wanted to have here here in the air but keep out the stick from a bridge across 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:39.350
 that bart left 3 4 scissor movements 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.490
 then the ball the lenskens where can I think your old kieft as free as a bird 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.699
 you choose from the duty to make your way through the second and third goal of wim 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:47.110
 please 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.139
 m 0 4 stood yesterday 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.080
 and those were actually the most important achievements in the second half 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.280
 that is why we saw a doorman from bbs 79 take the mountains out first 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.410
 division can no longer 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.720
 now another action from arie of the results 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.040
 on the other hand, Willem Kieft is completely free, but that is interest from the van 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.410
 psv does not turn to the horrible balcony of the kees cold steel in the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.819
 feet 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.900
 as I said, the second half doesn't see the depth too much anymore 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.839
 herein has a chance for gilhaus 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.889
 does not get the ball on a corner on his slipper but the judge can also get the ball 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:19.639
 not a good example 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.639
 and that is the cold steel that cleans up 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:27.229
 Perhaps these reasons are to send the monk into a very nice action of steel 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.819
 the masts from 30 to the rear line 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.770
 He had a great proposal so that it would be German professional football 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.430
 and the hands of hans van broken ears makes him the last one there 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.060
 last night the beam was another corner of this 79 and the see again a movement of 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.789
 this paul potts is 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.560
 it is a very nice thing here all just too high reporting about it 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:47.559
 that goal 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.430
 to the kidneys the last action of the competition against a barrier that still 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:53.689
 let's see why he leaves for VVV 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.590
 bolt earring 2 three people 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.129
 then on to that back line 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.759
 leave another man for losers, but nobody was there anymore 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.939
 means a final score of no 4 at the end of the premier league for ds 9 7
