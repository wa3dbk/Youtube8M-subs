00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
thoughts a little review of the trailer

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.669 
thoughts a little review of the trailer
I<00:00:09.120> think<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.599> was<00:00:09.750> much<00:00:09.990> better<00:00:10.410> than<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
I think this was much better than the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.410 
I think this was much better than the
first<00:00:10.980> one<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.639> first<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:12.000> don't<00:00:12.150> get<00:00:12.269> me

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
first one the first one don't get me

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.970 
first one the first one don't get me
wrong<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:12.900> pretty<00:00:13.320> cool<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.950> think

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
wrong it was so pretty cool but I think

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.099 
wrong it was so pretty cool but I think
mainly<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.030> was<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> Lego<00:00:15.420> thews<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.020> was

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
mainly because I was a Lego thews it was

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.260 
mainly because I was a Lego thews it was
really<00:00:16.289> cool<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.910> even

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
really cool but this one it's even

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.880 
really cool but this one it's even
better<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.690> Lego<00:00:18.930> enthusiasts<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.560> it's

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
better for Lego enthusiasts and it's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800 
better for Lego enthusiasts and it's
better<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.640> people<00:00:20.850> who<00:00:21.480> aren't

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
better for just like people who aren't

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.450 
better for just like people who aren't
really<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.350> even<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.710> much<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.189> Taleo

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
really that even that much in Taleo

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
really that even that much in Taleo
because<00:00:23.820> they<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.269> Batman<00:00:24.869> Batman

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
because they have more Batman Batman

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.929

spurts<00:00:25.500> were<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.920> funny<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
spurts were really funny because the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.820 
spurts were really funny because the
whole<00:00:27.210> joke<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.599> he's<00:00:27.869> Batman<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.650> he's

whole joke is that he's Batman and he's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.330 
whole joke is that he's Batman and he's
really<00:00:29.099> into<00:00:29.820> being<00:00:30.210> Batman<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.830> also<00:00:32.070> got

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
like the jokes when they're at the the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.120 
like the jokes when they're at the the
coffee<00:03:24.780> shop<00:03:25.139> where<00:03:25.440> he<00:03:25.500> says<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:25.889> over

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
coffee shop where he says it's a over

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.520 
coffee shop where he says it's a over
price<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.609> coffee<00:03:27.359> because<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.319> know<00:03:28.410> they

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
price of coffee because you know they

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.050 
price of coffee because you know they
only<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:29.040> hundred<00:03:29.250> dollar<00:03:29.549> bills<00:03:29.850> that's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
only have a hundred dollar bills that's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.819 
only have a hundred dollar bills that's
really<00:03:30.299> clever<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:31.139> very<00:03:31.350> subtle<00:03:31.799> but

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
really clever and a very subtle but

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.949 
really clever and a very subtle but
clever<00:03:32.220> joke<00:03:32.579> was<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.690> all

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
clever joke was and this is all

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.539 
clever joke was and this is all
throughout<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.319> film<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.709> how<00:03:34.889> all<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.130> shops

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
throughout the film is how all the shops

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.729 
throughout the film is how all the shops
are<00:03:35.700> cold<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.120> generic<00:03:37.079> shops<00:03:37.290> are<00:03:37.470> like<00:03:37.560> one

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
are cold like generic shops are like one

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.830 
are cold like generic shops are like one
of<00:03:37.769> them<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.040> cold<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.519> think<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.359> coffee<00:03:39.569> shop

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
of them is cold I think the coffee shop

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.930 
of them is cold I think the coffee shop
is<00:03:39.959> called<00:03:40.109> something<00:03:41.040> coffee<00:03:41.310> shop<00:03:41.670> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
is called something coffee shop and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.420 
is called something coffee shop and
that's<00:03:42.540> kind<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.780> because<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.500> know<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.829> LEGO

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
that's kind of because you know in LEGO

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.059 
that's kind of because you know in LEGO
sets<00:03:45.000> all<00:03:45.329> those<00:03:45.660> little<00:03:45.959> shops<00:03:46.680> are<00:03:46.859> called

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
sets all those little shops are called

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.890 
sets all those little shops are called
like<00:03:47.190> pizza<00:03:47.549> shop<00:03:47.790> or<00:03:48.060> shop<00:03:48.359> or<00:03:48.630> stuff<00:03:48.840> like

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
like pizza shop or shop or stuff like

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.479 
like pizza shop or shop or stuff like
that<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.380> think<00:03:49.560> that's<00:03:49.799> really<00:03:49.950> subtle<00:03:50.310> but

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
that so I think that's really subtle but

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.300 
that so I think that's really subtle but
really<00:03:51.239> really<00:03:51.450> clever<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:53.010> kind<00:03:53.280> of

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
really really clever so that kind of

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.099 
really really clever so that kind of
made<00:03:53.459> me<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:54.120> like<00:03:54.389> it's<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.930> got<00:03:55.079> a

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
made me really like it's that got a

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.569 
made me really like it's that got a
laugh<00:03:55.319> out<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.590> me<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.160> think<00:03:56.220> that's<00:03:56.430> just

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
laugh out of me and I think that's just

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.340 
laugh out of me and I think that's just
really<00:03:56.700> clever<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.750> already<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:58.049> really

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
really clever so I already have really

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.710 
really clever so I already have really
high

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
high

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.630 
high
