voicings I was mentioning and some of
the<00:00:26.310> neodymium<00:00:26.580> speakers<00:00:27.359> will<00:00:28.140> come<00:00:28.439> like

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the neodymium speakers will come like

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.640 
the neodymium speakers will come like
this<00:00:29.000> brush<00:00:30.000> heel<00:00:30.240> pad<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.199> markers<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
this brush heel pad of markers to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.819 
this brush heel pad of markers to
drivers<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.279> quite<00:00:32.399> light<00:00:32.610> anyway

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
drivers which are quite light anyway

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.410 
drivers which are quite light anyway
yeah<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.370> resist<00:00:35.670> me<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:35.910> all<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> boxes

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
yeah so we resist me for all the boxes

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
yeah so we resist me for all the boxes
that<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.630> finally<00:00:37.079> got<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that we finally got to the one that I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
that we finally got to the one that I
think<00:00:38.370> I'm<00:00:38.640> most<00:00:38.910> excited<00:00:39.120> about<00:00:39.420> another

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
think I'm most excited about another

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.319 
think I'm most excited about another
thing<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.079> guys<00:00:40.230> should<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.530> excited<00:00:41.329> which

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
thing you guys should be excited which

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
is here and we knew that it was going to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
is here and we knew that it was going to
be<00:00:44.550> good<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.450> said<00:00:45.660> Shaymin<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
be good because it said Shaymin on the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.830 
first incision key knife my girlfriend's
brother<00:01:24.390> bought<00:01:24.689> me<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.930> Christmas

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.069 

that's<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.560> above

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.499 

this<00:01:36.079> is<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.320> spray<00:01:36.649> from<00:01:36.950> they<00:01:37.729> happy<00:01:37.970> little

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
this is the spray from they happy little

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:52.980 
this is the spray from they happy little
with<00:01:39.820> sweet<00:01:40.820> okay<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.750> as<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.740> tell<00:01:51.549> it's

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
with sweet okay so as you can tell it's

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.569 
with sweet okay so as you can tell it's
quite<00:01:53.990> small<00:01:54.380> amplifier<00:01:54.799> but<00:01:55.250> that's<00:01:55.429> the

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
quite small amplifier but that's the

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.130 
quite small amplifier but that's the
idea<00:01:55.850> behind<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.210> Shaymin<00:01:56.600> it's<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.869> small

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
idea behind the Shaymin it's a small

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.850 
idea behind the Shaymin it's a small
wattage<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.340> very<00:01:58.579> powerful<00:01:59.710> sound<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
wattage but very powerful sound the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.969 
wattage but very powerful sound the
amplifier<00:02:01.929> but<00:02:02.929> I've<00:02:03.079> never<00:02:03.259> heard<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.770> I've

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
amplifier but I've never heard you I've

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.249 
amplifier but I've never heard you I've
never<00:02:04.250> heard<00:02:04.429> them<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.630> be<00:02:05.720> fair<00:02:05.929> we<00:02:06.110> did

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
never heard them I to be fair we did

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.169 
never heard them I to be fair we did
some<00:02:06.470> back<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.369> forth<00:02:07.580> with<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.880> design

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
some back and forth with the design

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.789 
some back and forth with the design
aspects<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> tone<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.500> kind<00:02:09.769> of

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
aspects of the tone and that kind of

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.309 
aspects of the tone and that kind of
feature<00:02:10.220> set<00:02:10.549> and<00:02:10.580> stuff<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:11.030> having<00:02:11.660> not<00:02:11.780> you

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
feature set and stuff but having not you

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.710 
feature set and stuff but having not you
know<00:02:12.440> her<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.739> more<00:02:12.769> seen<00:02:13.069> about<00:02:13.310> no<00:02:13.519> ideas

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:43.550 

that<00:02:20.720> we<00:02:20.930> knew<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.260> gonna<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.680> red

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.620 

their<00:02:48.090> blood<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.270> front<00:02:49.690> ask<00:02:50.410> colleges

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
their blood would front ask colleges

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.060 
their blood would front ask colleges
it's<00:02:52.630> kind<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.840> modern<00:02:53.200> looking<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:53.560> it's<00:02:53.890> got

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
it's kind of modern looking but it's got

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.520 
it's kind of modern looking but it's got
that<00:02:54.100> penalty<00:02:55.590> boutique<00:02:57.090> feel<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.450> too<00:02:58.660> so

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
that penalty boutique feel to it too so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.980 
that penalty boutique feel to it too so
it's<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> blueprint<00:03:00.010> front<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.720> we've

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
it's a blueprint front and then we've

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.680 
it's a blueprint front and then we've
got<00:03:02.340> what<00:03:03.340> look<00:03:03.520> like<00:03:03.550> I've<00:03:04.090> started<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.570> get

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
got what look like I've started to get

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.970 
got what look like I've started to get
to<00:03:04.840> come<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.080> say<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.440> because<00:03:05.680> it's<00:03:05.710> been

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
to come and say it because it's been

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.220 
to come and say it because it's been
storage<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:06.910> well<00:03:07.780> basically<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.010> symbols

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
storage but well basically the symbols

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.770 
storage but well basically the symbols
depict<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.410> different<00:03:11.740> controls<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
depict the different controls of the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.800 
depict the different controls of the
amplifier<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:15.820> yet<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.210> sort<00:03:16.780> of

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
amplifier and I'm yet to sort of

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.450 
amplifier and I'm yet to sort of
discover<00:03:17.140> what<00:03:17.380> they<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:17.890> what's<00:03:18.070> nice<00:03:18.220> is

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
discover what they do but what's nice is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.900 
discover what they do but what's nice is
you<00:03:18.490> can<00:03:18.610> kind<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:18.940> work<00:03:19.060> out<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.360> few<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.660> them

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
you can kind of work out a few of them

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.290 
you can kind of work out a few of them
so<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.060> looks<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.420> me<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.540> treble<00:03:23.080> bass<00:03:24.300> as

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
so that looks to me like treble bass as

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.810 
so that looks to me like treble bass as
I<00:03:25.570> said<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.900> was<00:03:25.990> probably<00:03:26.200> mid<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.280> yeah<00:03:27.490> the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
I said that was probably mid so yeah the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.570 
I said that was probably mid so yeah the
Panama<00:03:28.300> Shaymin<00:03:28.960> I<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:30.040> think<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.280> looks<00:03:30.310> at

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
Panama Shaymin I just think it looks at

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.270 
Panama Shaymin I just think it looks at
man's<00:03:30.790> blood<00:03:31.510> would<00:03:31.750> threaten<00:03:32.020> obviously<00:03:32.800> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
man's blood would threaten obviously the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.320 
man's blood would threaten obviously the
feature<00:03:33.520> set<00:03:33.880> looks<00:03:34.180> quite<00:03:34.590> extensive<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:35.830> I

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
feature set looks quite extensive so I

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.630 
feature set looks quite extensive so I
cannot<00:03:37.330> wait<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.660> plug<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:37.990> in<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.520> know

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
cannot wait to plug this in but you know

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.370 
cannot wait to plug this in but you know
I<00:03:39.850> hope<00:03:40.060> you've<00:03:40.240> enjoyed<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.690> unboxing<00:03:41.170> video
