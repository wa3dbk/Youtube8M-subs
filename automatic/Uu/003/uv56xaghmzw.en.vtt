00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
multi-touch if you use two fingers and

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.439 
multi-touch if you use two fingers and
drag<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:40.180> will<00:03:40.480> actually<00:03:40.810> go<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:42.449> launch

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
pad which is pretty interesting and then

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.089 
pad which is pretty interesting and then
you<00:03:48.400> have<00:03:48.579> your<00:03:49.169> Mission<00:03:50.169> Control<00:03:50.470> which<00:03:50.889> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
can also access by swiping two fingers

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.159 
can also access by swiping two fingers
but<00:03:55.840> if<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.260> use<00:03:56.470> four<00:03:56.829> fingers<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.519> go<00:03:57.669> up

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
but if you use four fingers and go up

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.250 
but if you use four fingers and go up
you<00:03:59.169> will<00:03:59.290> see<00:03:59.500> what<00:03:59.650> happens<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.870> goes<00:04:02.079> right

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260

into that so that's just a neat shortcut
now<00:04:05.560> let's<00:04:05.829> test<00:04:06.129> some<00:04:06.310> opening<00:04:06.970> times<00:04:07.209> for

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
now let's test some opening times for

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.849 
now let's test some opening times for
apps<00:04:08.669> for<00:04:09.669> example<00:04:10.150> let's<00:04:10.419> do<00:04:10.859> graphic

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
apps for example let's do graphic

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.379 
apps for example let's do graphic
intense<00:04:12.310> things<00:04:12.729> such<00:04:13.209> as<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.540> game<00:04:15.150> let's<00:04:16.150> just

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
intense things such as a game let's just

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.819 
intense things such as a game let's just
get<00:04:16.539> a<00:04:16.570> game<00:04:16.810> open<00:04:16.989> here<00:04:17.409> in<00:04:17.560> launchpad<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:19.829> we

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
get a game open here in launchpad and we

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.800 
get a game open here in launchpad and we
will<00:04:21.039> use<00:04:22.860> roblox

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.510
