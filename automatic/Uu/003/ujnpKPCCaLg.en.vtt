00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.160 
stuff so the diamond con looks
with<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.490> thought<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.180> maybe<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.660> lapis

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
with I thought that maybe the lapis

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.500 
with I thought that maybe the lapis
should<00:02:24.650> change<00:02:25.130> with<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.790> diamond<00:02:26.210> because

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
should change with the diamond because

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.390 
should change with the diamond because
that<00:02:26.780> kind<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.020> looks<00:02:27.230> more<00:02:27.290> diamond<00:02:27.950> ish<00:02:28.100> but

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
that kind of looks more diamond ish but

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.220 
that kind of looks more diamond ish but
that<00:02:28.550> kind<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.820> looks<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.390> didn't<00:02:30.020> know<00:02:30.080> what
