batteries my Galaxy s3 I have t right
here<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.600> hand<00:00:19.130> by<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.699> can't<00:00:21.060> find

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
right now and my ones in my phone and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.390 
right now and my ones in my phone and
obviously<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> lot<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> time<00:00:27.029> or<00:00:27.539> patience<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
obviously a lot of time or patience to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.859 
obviously a lot of time or patience to
wait<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.849> charge<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> woman<00:00:30.599> charging

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
wait with one charge and woman charging

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.359 
wait with one charge and woman charging
on<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.199> charge<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.769> don't<00:00:31.800> want<00:00:32.009> charged

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
on one charge and I don't want charged

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000 
on one charge and I don't want charged
so<00:00:32.759> I'm<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.090> gonna<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.649> all<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> same

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
so I'm just gonna do it all at the same

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
so I'm just gonna do it all at the same
time<00:00:35.250> basically<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.780> found<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
time basically so I found some that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.190 
time basically so I found some that
works<00:00:39.350> with<00:00:41.210> battery<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> Verizon<00:00:42.930> one

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
works with battery for the Verizon one

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
works with battery for the Verizon one
and<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:43.980> works<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.250> every<00:00:44.579> single

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and it actually works for every single

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.900 
and it actually works for every single
one<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.190> research<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
one and a little more research and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.990 
one and a little more research and
basically<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.160> think<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> batteries<00:00:50.879> are

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
basically I think all the batteries are

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
basically I think all the batteries are
exactly<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.660> same<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.390> or<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.570> least<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
exactly the same so or at least in this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.290 
exactly the same so or at least in this
case<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:56.070> fits<00:00:56.430> every<00:00:56.699> single<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> them

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
case this fits every single one of them

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.740 
case this fits every single one of them
so<00:01:00.590> here's<00:01:01.590> three<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:05.450> forgot<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.600> much

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so here's three of them forgot how much

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.090 
so here's three of them forgot how much
they<00:01:07.020> charge<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:09.229> Amazon<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.680> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
they charge me was on Amazon but it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.350 
they charge me was on Amazon but it
looks<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:11.790> there<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.119> five

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
looks like I think there are five

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.590 
looks like I think there are five
dollars<00:01:12.540> each<00:01:13.939> which<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
dollars each which I don't think it's a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.380 
dollars each which I don't think it's a
bad<00:01:15.810> charge<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.759> got<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
bad charge but when I got this for the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.039 
bad charge but when I got this for the
Thunderbolt<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.299> two

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
Thunderbolt it was like it was like two

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.980 
Thunderbolt it was like it was like two
bucks<00:01:25.290> each<00:01:27.829> these<00:01:28.829> break<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.579> easily<00:01:30.950> but

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
bucks each these break very easily but

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.940 
bucks each these break very easily but
it's<00:01:33.990> worth<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.560> money

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it's worth the money

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
it's worth the money
there<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.159> fit<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
there you go it does fit and I'm what to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.850 
there you go it does fit and I'm what to
see<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.350> charges<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> let's<00:01:43.500> give<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
see if it charges so let's give it a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.090 
see if it charges so let's give it a
shot<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.170> tested<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.040> do

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
shot and I just tested it and they do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.569 
shot and I just tested it and they do
work<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.600> blue<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.680> blue<00:01:49.979> when<00:01:50.280> they

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
international galaxy which is the eye

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
international galaxy which is the eye
9300<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:06.719> works<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.469> every

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
9300 but it actually works for every

one and it will be any other video so

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.590 
one and it will be any other video so
just<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.400> pick<00:02:18.580> one<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.880> these<00:02:18.970> up<00:02:19.030> if<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.450> have

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
just to pick one of these up if you have

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.540 
just to pick one of these up if you have
multiple<00:02:20.020> batteries<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:21.340> takes

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
multiple batteries this takes

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.300 
multiple batteries this takes
forever<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.000> charge<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.540> batteries<00:02:23.130> not<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
forever to charge the batteries not the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.720 
forever to charge the batteries not the
patience<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.760> do<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.190> about<00:02:27.190> three<00:02:27.550> these

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
patience to do it so about three these

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.870 
patience to do it so about three these
things<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.470> each<00:02:29.470> one's<00:02:29.680> about<00:02:29.860> $5<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.700> put

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
things and each one's about $5 to put

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.300
