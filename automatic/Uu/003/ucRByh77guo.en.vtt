the whole season really really excited I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
the whole season really really excited I
think<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> young<00:00:24.660> team<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:25.080> had<00:00:25.170> two

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
think with a young team we had two

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.810 
think with a young team we had two
seniors<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.039> mean<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.310> think<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.609> fared

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
seniors so I mean I think we fared

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.339 
seniors so I mean I think we fared
pretty<00:00:26.939> well<00:00:27.090> they're<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.930> good<00:00:28.140> took

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
pretty well they're pretty good took

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
pretty well they're pretty good took
third<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.740> iw<00:00:29.189> age<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.460> isn't<00:00:29.760> bad<00:00:29.789> we

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
third at the iw age which isn't bad we

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
third at the iw age which isn't bad we
haven't<00:00:30.330> gotten<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> trophy<00:00:31.019> four<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.650> five
