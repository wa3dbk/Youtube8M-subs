a<00:01:02.360> therapist

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
a therapist

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.990 
a therapist
look<00:01:03.769> I<00:01:03.920> definitely<00:01:04.430> don't<00:01:04.550> know<00:01:04.670> anything

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
look I definitely don't know anything

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.600 
look I definitely don't know anything
about<00:01:05.089> these<00:01:05.690> occurrences<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.250> can't<00:01:07.490> speak

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
about these occurrences so I can't speak

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.830 
about these occurrences so I can't speak
with<00:01:07.850> too<00:01:07.970> much<00:01:08.119> surety

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
with too much surety

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.080 
with too much surety
but<00:01:09.289> I<00:01:09.410> will<00:01:09.890> say<00:01:10.100> down<00:01:10.280> 100%<00:01:10.700> sure<00:01:11.060> that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
but I will say down 100% sure that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.219 
but I will say down 100% sure that
you're<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.509> serious<00:01:11.899> drug<00:01:12.080> addict<00:01:12.410> I<00:01:12.940> mean<00:01:14.229> that

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
you're a serious drug addict I mean that

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.210 
you're a serious drug addict I mean that
does<00:01:15.380> seem<00:01:15.530> like<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.800> most<00:01:15.890> plausible

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
does seem like the most plausible

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.240 
does seem like the most plausible
explanation<00:01:16.460> yeah<00:01:17.330> I<00:01:17.360> mean<00:01:17.479> you're<00:01:17.660> gonna<00:01:17.869> say

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
explanation yeah I mean you're gonna say

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.590 
explanation yeah I mean you're gonna say
I've<00:01:19.250> never<00:01:19.460> taken<00:01:19.640> any<00:01:19.850> drugs<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.360> don't

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
I've never taken any drugs and I don't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.029 
I've never taken any drugs and I don't
think<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:21.020> like<00:01:21.200> Hartman<00:01:21.680> for<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.830> time

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
think I have like Hartman for a time

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.590 
think I have like Hartman for a time
when<00:01:22.190> I<00:01:22.250> take<00:01:22.369> any<00:01:22.580> drugs<00:01:22.880> whatsoever<00:01:23.149> at<00:01:23.420> all

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
when I take any drugs whatsoever at all

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.680 
when I take any drugs whatsoever at all
but<00:01:24.289> it<00:01:24.800> does<00:01:25.220> seem<00:01:25.490> like<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.820> only<00:01:25.970> plausible

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
but it does seem like the only plausible

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.450 
but it does seem like the only plausible
explanation<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:27.740> I'm<00:01:27.920> suggesting<00:01:28.130> is

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
explanation so what I'm suggesting is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.710 
explanation so what I'm suggesting is
although<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:29.210> say<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.630> never

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
although you you say you have never

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.900 
although you you say you have never
taken<00:01:29.930> any<00:01:30.020> drugs<00:01:30.200> actually<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:31.700> somewhat

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
taken any drugs actually just somewhat

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.940 
taken any drugs actually just somewhat
of<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.090> fiend<00:01:32.330> until<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.050> government<00:01:33.530> but<00:01:33.890> it

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
of a fiend until you government but it
