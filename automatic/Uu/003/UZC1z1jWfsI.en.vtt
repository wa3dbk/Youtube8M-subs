00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.760
 I could have turned it on again 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 as a photographer if so for years 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.109
 Photo bags started to share 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.850
 photo bag then with such a bag and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.070
 now is a huge bag 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
 I have to go now 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.539
 Just say it's just that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.980
 especially if you take a lot of pictures when 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.960
 I have to go on the ground 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 starts from unfavorable positions 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.700
 photographed then dangles 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 camera bag to the back and to the front 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 and that is really unfavorable and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.890
 That's why I have something completely 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.680
 come up with a new I can'm now 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.579
 say I have the tested 100 of it 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 really good as the bombproof 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.480
 on the back and he does not bother 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.010
 you do not have the feeling of it at all 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.469
 the back so you can get it right 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.239
 Nice to move freely and this product 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.320
 I do not want to deprive you now 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.320
 have fun watching video 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.009
 That's what he looks like. That's the man 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 He politesse 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.549
 photo effective and i could give you now 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.540
 test for about a month 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.040
 can me already clear 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.320
 make a purchase recommendation 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.330
 he is wonderfully processed he puts 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.610
 very well on the back and it fits 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.830
 very much to hear 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.179
 we come to the front on the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.130
 front you have the possibility 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.080
 Tripod to attach even larger 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.159
 tripods find their opportunities 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.229
 to be attached 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.850
 here is the seat belt and here 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.350
 Below is a small bag with it 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.679
 tripod does not slip down 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.319
 So there is no fear we can to 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.970
 first big bag when open 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.069
 it gives you the possibility on the whole 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.220
 access in the life of the backpack 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.909
 5 lenses find their place here and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 a camera 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.350
 who perform the manual with 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.810
 would like to place and cable 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.399
 the front of the wonderful place around the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.189
 Side pockets would have to open here 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.709
 release this safety belt 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.569
 I have mine on this page 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.459
 camera places this a little bigger 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.009
 is a 60d from canon 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.720
 Battery grip and larger lens and 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.190
 she has her own place 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 if expensive camera is a little bigger 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.060
 do not worry about that 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.060
 camera fits so pure definitely 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.739
 smaller cameras can also be up here 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 to be placed 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.010
 I have mine here, for example 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.290
 sd-cards reingetan my rechargeable batteries purely 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.950
 done and also my wallet and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.690
 my mobile phone 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.459
 like on the other side you have to 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.010
 again this safety belt 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.239
 to solve 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.489
 Here you have wonderful the possibility 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.260
 to remove the objectively because system 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.530
 lightning or maybe the charger around 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.150
 to charge the batteries 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.220
 also the back should be mentioned 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.200
 besides that the upholstery is very much 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.900
 You can also do the backpack very well 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.310
 use as link away that means you solve 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.140
 here this fast and dies 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.090
 the whole thing in here and therefore had the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.860
 Possibility that he will simply take the backpack 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.079
 to turn around to you 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.390
 and then you can go to the accessories too 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.950
 he can not handle that too quickly 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.590
 that the backpack will happen but down 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.530
 falls because of that I use all love 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.910
 two straps and thus have a clear 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.310
 higher security and a better one 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.720
 halt on the back of the other have 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.819
 Here's another bag here 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.290
 perhaps to place documents 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.120
 he also does not slip out 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.150
 No need to be afraid here 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.069
 down is sewn so that you me now 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.049
 sometimes you should see in the rainforest 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.389
 are traveling or amazonas or otherwise 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.190
 Wherever it should rain then you have 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.750
 Do not be scared on this day 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.400
 also a raincape the pieces 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.000
 just enjoy it and therefore so are there too 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.829
 protected 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.900
 For me, the backpack actually only 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.680
 a criticism and that is the number 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.359
 the bag 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.920
 it would have a two bags more 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.299
 can be and maybe filter or 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.530
 lens cover to accommodate 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.030

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.680

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.240
