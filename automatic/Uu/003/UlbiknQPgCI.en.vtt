00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
many principles that we can actually

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.549 
many principles that we can actually
have<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.239> Tisa<00:00:36.750> technique<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> will

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
have in Tisa technique that will

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920 
have in Tisa technique that will
actually<00:00:37.739> advance<00:00:38.699> you<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.239> cut<00:00:39.480> your<00:00:39.690> time

first ten yards and it starts with the
actual<00:00:51.330> start<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.930> stance<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.620> need<00:00:53.340> to

what I usually tell kids to do is is I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
what I usually tell kids to do is is I
tell<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:58.950> imagine<00:00:59.399> there's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.610> basketball

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
tell them imagine there's a basketball

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 
tell them imagine there's a basketball
hoop<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.899> you're<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.320> dunk<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
hoop there and you're going to dunk the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
hoop there and you're going to dunk the
ball<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.670> tell<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:02.969> dunk<00:01:03.239> off<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.780> foot

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
ball and I tell them dunk off one foot

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.160 
ball and I tell them dunk off one foot
the<00:01:04.860> foot<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.520> they<00:01:05.700> naturally<00:01:06.170> gravitate

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the foot that they naturally gravitate

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
the foot that they naturally gravitate
towards<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.160> be<00:01:08.280> their<00:01:08.490> power<00:01:08.820> leg

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
towards is going to be their power leg

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
towards is going to be their power leg
so<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.080> me<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.440> my<00:01:10.740> left<00:01:11.070> leg<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.550> you're

explode straight out you

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.170 
explode straight out you
want<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.050> cycle<00:02:33.710> that<00:02:34.070> back<00:02:34.400> leg<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.880> want<00:02:35.030> it

want to cycle that back leg you want it

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.480 
want to cycle that back leg you want it
to<00:02:35.330> shoot<00:02:35.630> straight<00:02:36.110> out<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:36.980> want<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.250> get

to shoot straight out so you want to get

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.790 
to shoot straight out so you want to get
basically<00:02:38.120> straight<00:02:38.450> into<00:02:38.720> your<00:02:38.810> stride<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
basically straight into your stride the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.610 
basically straight into your stride the
entire<00:02:40.220> purpose<00:02:40.670> here<00:02:41.210> is<00:02:41.410> everything<00:02:42.410> is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
entire purpose here is everything is

back hand is just firing straight up

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.120 
back hand is just firing straight up
explosively

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
explosively

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.960 
explosively
and<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.850> other<00:02:49.970> one<00:02:50.210> is<00:02:50.360> throwing<00:02:50.870> back<00:02:51.970> now

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
and the other one is throwing back now

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.050 
and the other one is throwing back now
the<00:02:53.030> first<00:02:53.450> 10<00:02:53.900> -<00:02:54.320> maybe<00:02:54.530> 15<00:02:55.070> 20<00:02:55.370> yards<00:02:55.910> it's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
the first 10 - maybe 15 20 yards it's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.270 
the first 10 - maybe 15 20 yards it's
going<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.240> be<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.540> acceleration<00:02:57.350> phase<00:02:57.560> this

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
going to be your acceleration phase this

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.490 
going to be your acceleration phase this
is<00:02:58.460> where<00:02:58.610> we're<00:02:58.790> still<00:02:59.060> firing<00:02:59.360> off<00:02:59.690> our<00:02:59.960> eyes

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
is where we're still firing off our eyes

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.010 
is where we're still firing off our eyes
are<00:03:00.800> still<00:03:01.040> focused<00:03:01.580> straight<00:03:02.150> down<00:03:02.450> or<00:03:02.750> right

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
are still focused straight down or right

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.110 
are still focused straight down or right
in<00:03:03.200> front<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.500> us<00:03:03.650> they're<00:03:03.920> not<00:03:03.950> popping<00:03:04.430> up<00:03:04.850> a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
in front of us they're not popping up a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.720 
in front of us they're not popping up a
lot<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.440> times<00:03:06.680> what<00:03:06.890> happens<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.520> eye<00:03:07.550> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
lot of times what happens is the eye the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.910 
lot of times what happens is the eye the
body<00:03:08.030> will<00:03:08.300> follow<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.840> eyes<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:09.680> if<00:03:09.800> your

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
body will follow the eyes so if your

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.650 
body will follow the eyes so if your
eyes<00:03:10.100> come<00:03:10.490> straight<00:03:10.850> up<00:03:10.880> you're<00:03:11.450> going<00:03:11.600> to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
eyes come straight up you're going to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.320 
eyes come straight up you're going to
basically<00:03:12.320> pop<00:03:12.710> your<00:03:12.920> body<00:03:13.190> up<00:03:13.460> after<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
basically pop your body up after the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.360 
basically pop your body up after the
acceleration<00:03:15.050> phase<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.500> take<00:03:15.740> one<00:03:16.070> quick

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
acceleration phase we take one quick

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.460 
acceleration phase we take one quick
breath<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.000> then<00:03:17.390> we<00:03:17.510> hold<00:03:17.750> our<00:03:17.930> breath<00:03:17.960> again

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
breath and then we hold our breath again

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.040 
breath and then we hold our breath again
for<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.830> last<00:03:19.070> 40<00:03:19.490> yards<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.090> honestly<00:03:20.870> if

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
for the last 40 yards and honestly if

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.830 
for the last 40 yards and honestly if
you<00:03:21.290> get<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> stance<00:03:22.100> correct<00:03:22.840> everything

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
you get the stance correct everything

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.440 
you get the stance correct everything
else<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.410> just<00:03:24.440> reaction<00:03:25.340> natural<00:03:25.760> reaction<00:03:26.270> I

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
else is just reaction natural reaction I

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.910 
else is just reaction natural reaction I
think<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.050> too<00:03:27.200> many<00:03:27.350> people<00:03:27.440> try<00:03:27.860> to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
think that too many people try to

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.830 
think that too many people try to
correct<00:03:28.160> people's<00:03:28.520> running<00:03:28.910> form<00:03:29.210> and<00:03:29.510> what

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
correct people's running form and what

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.330 
correct people's running form and what
that<00:03:29.990> does<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.320> take<00:03:30.500> away<00:03:30.770> from<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.070> actual

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
that does is take away from the actual

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.880 
that does is take away from the actual
athlete<00:03:31.880> if<00:03:32.000> we<00:03:32.480> can<00:03:32.690> correct<00:03:32.990> them<00:03:33.230> put<00:03:33.740> them

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
athlete if we can correct them put them

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.250 
athlete if we can correct them put them
in<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.100> proper<00:03:34.490> stance<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.180> proper<00:03:35.930> start

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
in the proper stance and proper start

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.410 
in the proper stance and proper start
the<00:03:36.800> rest<00:03:37.130> will<00:03:37.340> follow<00:03:37.370> itself<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.330> then

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
the rest will follow itself and then

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.170 
the rest will follow itself and then
that<00:03:38.780> they<00:03:39.350> will<00:03:39.500> naturally<00:03:39.650> run<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.370> couple

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
that they will naturally run a couple

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.310 
that they will naturally run a couple
things<00:03:41.300> that<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.540> do<00:03:41.660> like<00:03:41.990> to<00:03:42.110> work<00:03:42.260> with

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
that air sucked in tight almost like the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.580 
that air sucked in tight almost like the
valsalva<00:04:15.950> movement<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.700> want<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.810> be<00:04:18.470> able
