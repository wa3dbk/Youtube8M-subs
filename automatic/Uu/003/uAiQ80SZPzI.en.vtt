hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.190
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.  In India

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.380
you know when we eat Indian food

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
we always love to eat chilies and there are various kinds of chilies that we

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.470
make, some of them stuffed and some of
them not, but today i'm going to show you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
the Maharashtrian way of making chilli called Fodni

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.119
Mirchi. Kisi ka fodna hai, use this chilli,

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.980
I'm just kidding, Fodni ka matlab tempering. So today we're going to make tempered

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.410
chillies. This fodni mirchi you can eat it with any kind of Bhakri, rice or any

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.370
preparation

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.910
So first we're going to make a tempering;  for this add some oil

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.539
first let the oil get hot, in that add the mustard seeds, when the mustard seeds

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.280
crackle add turmeric and hing this one gets a little bit color so you can add

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.449
little extra turmeric

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.180
no problem; We're going to add two kinds
of salt.  Salt and black salt, broken

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.930
mustard

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.159
what we use in making lot of pickles, now I've also reduced the flame

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.210
you know let this spices cook little bit and then add the green

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.990
chillies;  you know once you saute them little bit just put the lid on and let

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.360
it cook on a very slow flame you want these green chillies to become slightly

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.630
soft;  you know once in a while just open
the lid and turn these chilies so that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.610
they get called on all sides

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.820
the chilies are really nicely cooked and you can also see a very thin coating of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.990
this masala

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.680
that is enough don't try to make it masaledar anything

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.479
these chilies are done and we're going to finish it off adding little bit of

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.409
lime juice just a squeeze little bit of lime juice and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:13.460
