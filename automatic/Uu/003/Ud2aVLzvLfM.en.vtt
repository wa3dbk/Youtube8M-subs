 I expected it to be doing pieces of 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.620
 surprise and it's super nice to see what 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.740

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.090
 perfection is wonderful, I'm very 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.350

 I'm in shock now let's open this 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.950
 Amazon package that made an order 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 I think it comes in the two books that I've 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.130
 asked supposedly I had to 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.530
 arrived within two days and has 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.980
 come today the amazon theme is a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.980
 wonder 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.130
 these easy envelopes are harder than 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.340
 it's worth it and I'll show you one in 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.350
 a 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.090
 this is the first one that is ephemeral is the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.940
 first part of the garden trilogy 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.680
 chemist written by lawrence di stÃ©fano 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.840
 I have many new to read this 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.400
 trilogy and the book the two books that 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.190
 I bought they were on offer me 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.570
 I bought for that and I 'm not going to 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.750
 find cheaper because normally 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.600
 It's worth 17 if I 'm not wrong and the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.880
 another one too and they were books that 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.920
 I wanted to have but not so expensive so 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.510
 well I have the first one and if I like it 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.280
 I will buy the other two and if not then 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.630
 nothing but everything does not have to 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.060
 buy the trilogy at the same time with the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.980
 exchanges and all that I and if I do not 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.680
 like it because it also gives me a face I 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.230
 whole not so I bought first and if 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.140
 I like it well and if not then nothing is for 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.850
 true I love the cover is super 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.850
 pretty and the second 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.600
 is this book so beautiful and with a name 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.510
 so long that is the probability 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.940
 Statistical love at first sight 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.920
 Jennifer Smith from the editorial sum of 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.220
 letters 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.500
 I thought it was more chubby it is very very 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.600
 short but I really want to read it 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.700
 and from what I see it's going to be a reading 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.610
 very fast because I did not expect that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.930
 It was so short but it looks like 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.480
 be very beautiful and very adorable and that's why 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.790
 complete me I liked 565 follow 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.090
 being the 2 565 in amazon in case 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.830
 interesting is also 565 the club of the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.470
 lonely hearts and the song number 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.290
 7 in case you are also interested in those books 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.870
 amazon and ccoo pray for them before 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.610
 that they are finished because those reductions there are 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.840
 that take them do not have to leave them 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.120
 escape especially if you are times of 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.620
 I lay the book and this stick I do not have 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.510
 no idea what it is to see is that 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.740
 during the month of March I have had a 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.870
 lots of raffle 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.090
 and I have to get enough books 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.160
 of raffles because I'm one of those that the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.449
 I've done raffles on facebook raffles 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.280

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.220
 raffle never played post they also play 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.470
 and then I say I do not know what that is 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.389
 one of them so let's see what 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.389

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.430
 I had another package inside the package 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.110

 ten fastest are taken to exemplary and 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.500

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:02.379
 trying to improve my point towards me 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.539

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:10.710
