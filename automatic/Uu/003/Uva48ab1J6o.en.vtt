maintain a distance from your artwork so
for<00:02:05.280> example<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:05.939> right-handed<00:02:06.240> I'll<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:07.079> my

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
for example I'm right-handed I'll use my

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.529 
for example I'm right-handed I'll use my
left<00:02:07.530> hand<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:08.039> distancing<00:02:08.729> holding<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
left hand for distancing holding the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.080 
left hand for distancing holding the
airbrush<00:02:09.929> maintain<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> distance<00:02:11.190> from<00:02:11.940> the

the<00:02:13.240> reason<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.620> we<00:02:14.830> get<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the reason for this is so that we get a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.770 
the reason for this is so that we get a
nice<00:02:15.250> uniform<00:02:15.850> line<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:17.170> doesn't<00:02:17.410> go<00:02:17.680> small<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
nice uniform line it doesn't go small to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.710 
nice uniform line it doesn't go small to
be<00:02:20.070> small<00:02:21.070> that's<00:02:21.580> not<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.850> very<00:02:22.120> straight<00:02:22.480> line

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
be small that's not a very straight line

be small that's not a very straight line
a<00:02:22.960> 10<00:02:23.350> centimeter<00:02:23.680> line<00:02:24.070> or<00:02:24.850> distance<00:02:25.360> with<00:02:25.600> my

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
a 10 centimeter line or distance with my

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.310 
a 10 centimeter line or distance with my
left<00:02:25.990> hand

start moving pull back the paint paint

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.100 
start moving pull back the paint paint
stop<00:02:31.120> moving<00:02:31.720> stop<00:02:32.230> moving<00:02:32.880> hair<00:02:33.880> off<00:02:34.210> let's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
stop moving stop moving hair off let's

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.570 
stop moving stop moving hair off let's
do<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.440> again<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.800> see<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.340> create

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
do it again and see if we can create

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.670 
do it again and see if we can create
exactly<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.360> same<00:02:37.540> line<00:02:40.260> let's<00:02:41.260> go<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.590> a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
exactly the same line let's go in a

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.170 
exactly the same line let's go in a
little<00:02:41.710> bit<00:02:41.950> closer<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.520> see<00:02:42.670> what<00:02:42.850> happens

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
little bit closer and see what happens

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.940 
little bit closer and see what happens
when<00:02:43.420> we're<00:02:43.570> about<00:02:43.720> 5<00:02:44.050> centimeters<00:02:44.710> from<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
when we're about 5 centimeters from the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.350 
when we're about 5 centimeters from the
paper

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.690 

the<00:02:49.360> line<00:02:49.570> gets<00:02:49.750> smaller<00:02:50.340> let's<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.550> what

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
the line gets smaller let's see what

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.570 
the line gets smaller let's see what
happens<00:02:52.060> when<00:02:52.420> we<00:02:52.540> go<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.810> at<00:02:52.959> 2<00:02:53.200> centimeters

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.340 

the<00:02:57.580> lines<00:02:57.820> are<00:02:58.030> getting<00:02:58.150> smaller<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.170> why

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
the lines are getting smaller so why

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.500 
the lines are getting smaller so why
don't<00:02:59.560> we<00:02:59.620> try<00:02:59.830> pulling<00:03:00.430> back<00:03:00.670> less<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
don't we try pulling back less on the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.110 
don't we try pulling back less on the
pain

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.930 

and<00:03:09.780> lines<00:03:10.110> are<00:03:10.349> getting<00:03:10.590> smaller<00:03:10.980> again<00:03:11.099> but

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
and lines are getting smaller again but

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.420 
and lines are getting smaller again but
why<00:03:12.120> are<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.330> teaching<00:03:12.569> me<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.980> draw

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
why are you teaching me this just draw

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.059 
why are you teaching me this just draw
something<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.450> detailed<00:03:16.050> areas<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.920> your

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
something the detailed areas of your

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.940 
something the detailed areas of your
artworks<00:03:17.489> such<00:03:18.180> as<00:03:18.390> here<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.959> mean<00:03:19.410> that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
artworks such as here in the I mean that

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.830 
artworks such as here in the I mean that
you<00:03:20.069> have<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.400> move<00:03:20.580> extremely<00:03:20.879> close<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
you have to move extremely close to the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.830 
you have to move extremely close to the
artwork<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:23.370> also<00:03:23.550> means<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.810> have

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
artwork and it also means that you have

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.830 
artwork and it also means that you have
to<00:03:25.170> pull<00:03:25.440> back<00:03:25.470> very<00:03:26.040> little<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.580> paint<00:03:26.840> let's

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
to pull back very little for paint let's

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.930 
to pull back very little for paint let's
see<00:03:28.080> what<00:03:28.260> happens<00:03:28.590> when<00:03:28.799> we<00:03:28.860> distance<00:03:29.400> 20

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
see what happens when we distance 20

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.770 
see what happens when we distance 20
centimeters<00:03:30.629> from<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> paper<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
centimeters from the paper so that the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
centimeters from the paper so that the
lines<00:03:33.989> bigger<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.890> further<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.519> are<00:03:35.549> away

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
lines bigger the further you are away

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.449 
lines bigger the further you are away
from<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.420> artwork<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.590> thicker<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.220> lines

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
from the artwork the thicker your lines

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.520 
from the artwork the thicker your lines
are<00:03:38.670> going<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:39.000> be<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.569> more<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.019> pull<00:03:40.290> back

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
are going to be the more you pull back

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.920 
are going to be the more you pull back
the<00:03:41.310> thicker<00:03:41.670> your<00:03:41.970> lines<00:03:42.209> are<00:03:42.420> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.780> be

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the thicker your lines are going to be

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.339 
the thicker your lines are going to be
applying<00:03:43.769> less<00:03:44.190> paint<00:03:44.519> at<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:45.390> closer<00:03:45.750> distance

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
applying less paint at a closer distance

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.949 
applying less paint at a closer distance
will<00:03:47.190> mean<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.670> get<00:03:47.880> finer<00:03:48.299> detailed

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
will mean that you get finer detailed

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.140 
will mean that you get finer detailed
lines

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.780 

I<00:03:55.180> want<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:56.319> better<00:03:56.530> how<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.549> get

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790

before<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.259> start<00:04:55.620> moving<00:04:56.060> watch<00:04:57.060> what<00:04:57.300> happens

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
before I start moving watch what happens

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.450 
before I start moving watch what happens
blob<00:05:00.720> it<00:05:00.870> looks<00:05:01.080> crap<00:05:01.500> make<00:05:02.039> sure<00:05:02.280> you're
