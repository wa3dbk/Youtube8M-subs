00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
many flips can you do with your mqx and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.610 
many flips can you do with your mqx and
how<00:00:11.099> low<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.120> flip<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.809> attempt<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.320> do

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
how low of a flip can you attempt to do

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.880 
how low of a flip can you attempt to do
with<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.070> mqx<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:16.289> thing<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> found

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
with this mqx so one thing that I found

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.480 
with this mqx so one thing that I found
out<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.580> mqx<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.500> do<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> flat<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.400> do

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
out with this mqx is to do a flat to do

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
out with this mqx is to do a flat to do
a<00:00:20.520> fast<00:00:20.939> flip<00:00:21.359> or<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> loop<00:00:21.810> whatever<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.439> guys

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a fast flip or a loop whatever you guys

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
a fast flip or a loop whatever you guys
want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> call<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.699> pretty<00:00:23.910> much<00:00:24.090> just

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
want to call it is to pretty much just

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.259 
want to call it is to pretty much just
go<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.289> jana<00:00:25.859> sticks<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> side<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.910> corner

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
go up jana sticks to the side one corner

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
go up jana sticks to the side one corner
and<00:00:27.449> that's<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.080> need<00:00:28.289> because<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> flips

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and that's all you need because it flips

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
and that's all you need because it flips
on<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.369> cross<00:00:29.910> mode<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.900> flip<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
on a cross mode so it's going to flip a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
on a cross mode so it's going to flip a
lot<00:00:31.439> faster<00:00:31.679> than<00:00:32.550> comparing<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> front

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
lot faster than comparing to do a front

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.410 
lot faster than comparing to do a front
flip<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.829> jam<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> side<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:35.910> if

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
flip so just jam it to the side now if

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
flip so just jam it to the side now if
you<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> helicopter<00:00:37.110> pilots<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
you has a helicopter pilots the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
you has a helicopter pilots the
something<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.670> learned<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> never

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
something that you learned is to never

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.479 
something that you learned is to never
jan<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> sticks<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.680> corner<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.280> for

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
jan the sticks to one corner but for

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.610 
jan the sticks to one corner but for
this<00:00:41.579> quad<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.030> some<00:00:42.180> reason<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.660> jam<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.320> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
this quad for some reason you jam it it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.330 
this quad for some reason you jam it it
goes<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.640> go<00:00:44.670> guys<00:00:46.129> alright<00:00:47.129> almost

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
imma go from my record right here so

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.330 
imma go from my record right here so
that's<00:01:18.820> one<00:01:20.040> two<00:01:21.630> three<00:01:23.340> four<00:01:24.660> that's<00:01:25.660> four

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that's one two three four that's four

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.370 
that's one two three four that's four
consecutive<00:01:27.420> slips<00:01:28.420> or<00:01:28.540> loops<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.990> row<00:01:29.140> so

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
consecutive slips or loops in a row so

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.280 
consecutive slips or loops in a row so
how<00:01:29.530> many<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:29.830> guys<00:01:30.010> do<00:01:30.220> look<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.300> tad<00:01:31.450> the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
how many can you guys do look a tad the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.620 
how many can you guys do look a tad the
sideways<00:01:32.830> diagonal<00:01:33.370> flip<00:01:33.700> is<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> lot<00:01:34.090> faster

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
sideways diagonal flip is a lot faster

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.870 
sideways diagonal flip is a lot faster
than<00:01:35.140> doing<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.650> rush<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.190> look<00:01:36.340> because<00:01:36.700> you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
than doing a rush to look because you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.460 
than doing a rush to look because you
only<00:01:37.000> have<00:01:37.210> one<00:01:37.540> go<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.780> working<00:01:38.229> more<00:01:38.440> than

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
only have one go to working more than

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
only have one go to working more than
others<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.690> this<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.869> pretty<00:01:41.140> point<00:01:41.380> contest

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
others so this is a pretty point contest

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.040 
others so this is a pretty point contest
so<00:01:43.060> let's<00:01:43.240> see<00:01:43.330> what<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.509> guys<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:43.750> come<00:01:43.869> up

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
so let's see what you guys can come up

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.760 
so let's see what you guys can come up
with<00:01:44.229> look<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:45.880> lot<00:01:46.570> faster<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:49.770> little

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
with look at that lot faster a little

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.960 
with look at that lot faster a little
low<00:01:50.920> there<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.920> see<00:01:54.160> I'm<00:01:54.670> gonna<00:01:54.850> go

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
low there that's to see I'm gonna go

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.060 
low there that's to see I'm gonna go
right<00:01:55.149> out<00:01:55.180> here<00:01:55.300> just<00:01:56.140> giving<00:01:56.470> got<00:01:56.649> an<00:01:56.770> idea
