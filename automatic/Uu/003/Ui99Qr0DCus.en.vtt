we're going to remove some of the lead
wire<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.509> is<00:00:18.660> inside<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.560> material<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
wire that is inside this material so a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.710 
wire that is inside this material so a
way<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.169> is<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.710> pull<00:00:23.419> try<00:00:24.419> not<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
way to do that is to pull try not to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.839 
way to do that is to pull try not to
pull<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.199> lead<00:00:25.380> out<00:00:25.679> of<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.699> we're

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
pull the lead out of it with what we're

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.579 
pull the lead out of it with what we're
actually<00:00:26.970> doing<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.019> hand<00:00:28.259> staying

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
actually doing is this hand staying

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.060 
actually doing is this hand staying
still<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.189> pulling<00:00:29.579> the<00:00:30.179> braid<00:00:30.570> back

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
still and I'm pulling the braid back

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.320 
still and I'm pulling the braid back
okay<00:00:32.070> we're<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> pull<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.880> three<00:00:33.240> or

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
okay we're going to pull out three or

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.620 
okay we're going to pull out three or
four<00:00:33.480> inches<00:00:34.400> lid<00:00:35.400> wise<00:00:35.580> nice<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.090> soft<00:00:36.360> and

four inches lid wise nice and soft and
pull<00:00:36.990> that<00:00:37.110> off<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.440> actually<00:00:37.680> use<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.130> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
pull that off I actually use that to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.420 
pull that off I actually use that to
wrap<00:00:39.030> around<00:00:39.060> hook<00:00:39.480> link<00:00:39.660> materials<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
wrap around hook link materials to to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.730 
wrap around hook link materials to to
pin<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.470> don't

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
pin them down and so on so you don't

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.190 
pin them down and so on so you don't
always<00:00:43.950> need<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> throw<00:00:44.490> that<00:00:44.670> away<00:00:45.200> alright

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
always need to throw that away alright

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.310 
always need to throw that away alright
then<00:00:46.620> let<00:00:46.830> go<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.600> leg<00:00:48.780> core<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> what

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
then let go of the leg core and what

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.800 
then let go of the leg core and what
you'll<00:00:49.530> find<00:00:49.830> is<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:51.210> material<00:00:51.660> will<00:00:51.720> be

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
you'll find is that the material will be

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.090 
you'll find is that the material will be
nice<00:00:51.990> and<00:00:52.230> thick<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.740> run<00:00:52.890> your

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
nice and thick you can run your

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.200 
nice and thick you can run your
fingernails<00:00:54.060> along<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.950> you'll<00:00:55.950> feel<00:00:56.430> where

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
fingernails along and you'll feel where

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
fingernails along and you'll feel where
the<00:00:57.780> wire<00:00:58.410> runs<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.310> can<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.630> can

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the wire runs out and you can you can

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.530 
the wire runs out and you can you can
see<00:01:01.080> there<00:01:01.350> how<00:01:01.670> where<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.940> where<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
see there how where there where there is

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.239 
see there how where there where there is
no<00:01:03.720> lead<00:01:03.930> wire<00:01:04.140> inside<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.769> quite<00:01:04.979> supple

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:05.249 
no lead wire inside it's quite supple

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:07.819 
no lead wire inside it's quite supple
and<00:01:05.609> then<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:06.179> fingers<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.869> touching<00:01:07.350> there

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
and then my fingers just touching there

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.889 
and then my fingers just touching there
where<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> lead<00:01:08.369> finishes<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.630> I'm<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
where the lead finishes so I'm going to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.830 
where the lead finishes so I'm going to
mark<00:01:10.079> that<00:01:10.109> with<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.530> thumb<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.740> forefinger

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
mark that with my thumb and forefinger

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
mark that with my thumb and forefinger
okay<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> nice<00:01:14.009> small<00:01:14.280> splicing<00:01:14.850> needle

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
okay take a nice small splicing needle

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
okay take a nice small splicing needle
this<00:01:16.109> one<00:01:16.319> here<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.619> about<00:01:16.649> as<00:01:16.979> thin<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.429> can

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
this one here is about as thin as I can

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.489 
this one here is about as thin as I can
find<00:01:17.939> they're<00:01:18.390> quite<00:01:18.569> delicate<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.289> will

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
find they're quite delicate and you will

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.919 
find they're quite delicate and you will
break<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.740> old<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.069> or<00:01:20.189> two<00:01:20.399> but<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.479> find<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
break the old one or two but I find the

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.499 
break the old one or two but I find the
smaller<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> better<00:01:23.390> take<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
smaller they are the better take the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.399 
smaller they are the better take the
little<00:01:24.749> hook<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.469> in<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.799> end<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:27.409> hook

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
little hook that's in the end and hook

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.309 
little hook that's in the end and hook
that<00:01:28.560> into<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.579> material<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.719> and<00:01:31.079> this

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
that into the material and this and this

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.749 
that into the material and this and this
braided<00:01:31.710> material<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.429> hollow<00:01:32.670> inside

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
braided material is hollow inside

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.550 
braided material is hollow inside
obviously<00:01:33.509> because<00:01:33.780> we've<00:01:33.899> taken<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> lead

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
obviously because we've taken the lead

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.639 
obviously because we've taken the lead
wire<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:35.060> leaving<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.210> gap<00:01:36.960> down<00:01:37.229> through<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
wire out leaving a gap down through the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.950 
wire out leaving a gap down through the
middle<00:01:37.859> and<00:01:38.039> so<00:01:38.429> we're<00:01:38.609> now<00:01:38.789> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.240> try<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
middle and so we're now going to try and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.069 
middle and so we're now going to try and
push<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.490> needle<00:01:41.749> up<00:01:42.749> inside<00:01:44.299> okay<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.869> as

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
push this needle up inside okay now as

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.370 
push this needle up inside okay now as
you<00:01:46.679> push<00:01:47.609> it<00:01:47.850> down<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.569> way<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.170> actually

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
you push it down this way it's actually

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190 
you push it down this way it's actually
containing<00:01:50.219> and<00:01:50.700> opening<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.020> more

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
containing and opening up and the more

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
containing and opening up and the more
that<00:01:52.439> opens<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.159> easier<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:53.850> push<00:01:54.270> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that opens the easier it is to push this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.109 
that opens the easier it is to push this
needle<00:01:55.289> down<00:01:55.469> inside<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.819> we're<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.029> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
needle down inside so we're going to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.069 
needle down inside so we're going to
push<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> down<00:01:57.770> an<00:01:58.770> inch<00:01:59.279> or<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.929> alright<00:02:00.929> in

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
push it down an inch or so alright in

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.590 
push it down an inch or so alright in
this<00:02:01.350> instance<00:02:01.829> we're<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.759> put<00:02:03.569> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
this instance we're going to put a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.779 
this instance we're going to put a
swivel<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.529> loop<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.520> don't

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
swivel on to this loop but if you don't

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.340 
swivel on to this loop but if you don't
want<00:02:06.179> to<00:02:06.299> have<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> swivel<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.899> there<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.139> can

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
want to have a swivel on there you can

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.619 
want to have a swivel on there you can
just<00:02:07.590> create<00:02:07.859> a<00:02:07.979> loop<00:02:08.280> itself<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
just create a loop itself I'm going to

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.650 
just create a loop itself I'm going to
take<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> swivel

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
take a swivel

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.450 
take a swivel
and<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:12.380> thread<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:14.990> stage

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.610 

all<00:02:19.460> right<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:21.610> I'm<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.000> poke<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
all right and I'm just going to poke the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.880 
all right and I'm just going to poke the
needle<00:02:24.980> back<00:02:25.250> out<00:02:25.490> through<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.000> leg<00:02:26.810> core<00:02:27.080> you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
needle back out through the leg core you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.830 
needle back out through the leg core you
see<00:02:28.100> that's<00:02:28.340> quite<00:02:28.700> simple<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:29.180> poke<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.690> out

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
see that's quite simple just poke it out

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.510 
see that's quite simple just poke it out
and<00:02:30.880> this<00:02:31.880> left<00:02:32.120> gate<00:02:32.390> needle<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:34.310> gets

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
and this left gate needle then gets

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.970 
and this left gate needle then gets
turned<00:02:34.730> around<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.720> place<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.770> leg

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
turned around and I just place the leg

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.020 
turned around and I just place the leg
core<00:02:38.890> material<00:02:39.890> into<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:40.880> don't

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
core material into it like so I don't

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.910 
core material into it like so I don't
hook<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.750> or<00:02:41.960> anything<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:42.560> push<00:02:42.770> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
hook it in or anything I just push it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.040 
hook it in or anything I just push it
through<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.700> two<00:02:44.030> or<00:02:44.120> three<00:02:44.150> mil<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.660> then

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
through just two or three mil and then

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.840 
through just two or three mil and then
close<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.560> latch<00:02:45.740> gate<00:02:46.010> if<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.490> have<00:02:46.640> too

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
close the latch gate if you have too

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.370 
close the latch gate if you have too
much<00:02:47.030> poking<00:02:47.480> through<00:02:47.630> you'll<00:02:47.870> find<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.230> quite

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
much poking through you'll find it quite

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.200 
much poking through you'll find it quite
difficult<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.950> pull<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.250> back<00:02:49.430> down<00:02:49.670> inside

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
difficult to pull it back down inside

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.840 
difficult to pull it back down inside
this<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.620> section<00:02:52.130> here<00:02:52.370> which<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.670> what

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
this this section here which is what

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.050 
this this section here which is what
we're<00:02:53.000> aiming<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.330> do<00:02:53.600> now<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.640> weight<00:02:55.820> leg

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
we're aiming to do now the weight leg

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.050 
we're aiming to do now the weight leg
core<00:02:56.300> works<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.230> more<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.530> opened<00:02:57.980> up<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
core works is the more is opened up the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.440 
core works is the more is opened up the
less<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.510> grips<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.160> tighter<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
less it grips and the tighter it is the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.080 
less it grips and the tighter it is the
smaller<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.110> hole<00:03:03.470> inside<00:03:04.040> actually<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.850> so

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
smaller that hole inside actually is so

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.670 
smaller that hole inside actually is so

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
down the side we're actually going to

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.020 
down the side we're actually going to
try<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.870> pull<00:03:24.080> it<00:03:24.230> back<00:03:25.160> out<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:25.880> see

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
now if we wanted just a loop there

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.740 
now if we wanted just a loop there
that's<00:03:33.740> fine<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.610> instance<00:03:35.090> with<00:03:35.360> we're

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
that's fine this instance with we're

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.120 
that's fine this instance with we're
having<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.080> swivel<00:03:36.410> on<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> end<00:03:36.770> so<00:03:36.980> we're

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
having the swivel on the end so we're

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.950 
having the swivel on the end so we're
going<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.280> pull<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:38.180> loop<00:03:38.450> down<00:03:38.690> nice<00:03:38.930> and

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
going to pull that loop down nice and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.590 
going to pull that loop down nice and
tight<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.620> by<00:03:40.400> pulling<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.880> this<00:03:41.060> tag<00:03:41.360> ends

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
tight so by pulling on this tag ends

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.360 
tight so by pulling on this tag ends
we're<00:03:41.900> going<00:03:42.050> to<00:03:42.200> make<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.560> loop<00:03:42.800> really

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
we're going to make that loop really

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.400 
we're going to make that loop really
small<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.120> now<00:03:47.720> by<00:03:47.959> pulling<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.350> the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
small like so and now by pulling on the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.840 
small like so and now by pulling on the
swivel<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.280> standing<00:03:49.730> line<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:51.850> the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
swivel and this standing line and the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.090 
swivel and this standing line and the
tighter<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.420> pull<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.500> tighter<00:03:54.800> it's

you might now we've got this tag in

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.199 
you might now we've got this tag in
hanging<00:04:06.920> out<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.160> that's<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.550> that's<00:04:07.790> not

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
hanging out and that's that that's not

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.949 
hanging out and that's that that's not
what<00:04:08.420> we<00:04:08.540> want<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:11.090> make<00:04:11.270> that<00:04:11.450> really<00:04:11.660> nice

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
what we want so to make that really nice

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.520 
what we want so to make that really nice
and<00:04:12.170> tidy<00:04:13.090> what<00:04:14.090> I'm<00:04:14.240> going<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.540> do<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:14.959> just

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
and tidy what I'm going to do is just

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.409 
and tidy what I'm going to do is just
pull<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.750> section<00:04:18.020> back<00:04:18.650> slightly<00:04:19.330> trim<00:04:20.330> it

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
pull this section back slightly trim it

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.390 
pull this section back slightly trim it
off<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.600> then<00:04:20.870> pull<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.350> back<00:04:21.530> over<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.100> this

off and then pull it back over and this
tag<00:04:22.669> end<00:04:22.880> will<00:04:23.419> be<00:04:23.570> shorter<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.020> disappear<00:04:24.890> up

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
tag end will be shorter and disappear up

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.530 
tag end will be shorter and disappear up
inside<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.400> I'm<00:04:26.610> just<00:04:26.760> going<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.030> pull<00:04:27.270> that

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
inside so I'm just going to pull that

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.680 
inside so I'm just going to pull that
back<00:04:27.930> slightly<00:04:28.790> trim<00:04:29.790> it<00:04:29.910> off<00:04:30.030> nice<00:04:30.420> and

pull as hard as I like on that this is

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.810 
pull as hard as I like on that this is
35<00:04:41.970> pound<00:04:42.690> blade<00:04:43.470> core<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.250> can<00:04:44.490> pull<00:04:44.670> at

35 pound blade core and I can pull at

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.790 
35 pound blade core and I can pull at
least<00:04:44.850> 35<00:04:45.510> pounds<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.050> there<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.560> won't

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
least 35 pounds on there and that won't

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.430 
least 35 pounds on there and that won't
break<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.480> only<00:04:48.480> way<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.840> leg<00:04:49.200> core

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
break the only way that that leg core

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.770 
break the only way that that leg core
will<00:04:49.620> splice<00:04:50.250> will<00:04:50.490> come<00:04:50.700> undone<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.510> by

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
will splice will come undone is by

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.840 
will splice will come undone is by
actually<00:04:52.230> making<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.860> slack<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.550> then

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
actually making it slack and then

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.150 
actually making it slack and then
pulling<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:55.140> piece<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:55.440> we've<00:04:55.710> inserted

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
pulling that piece that we've inserted

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.520 
pulling that piece that we've inserted
inside<00:04:56.520> pulling<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.330> back<00:04:57.480> out<00:04:57.720> for<00:04:58.230> a<00:04:58.290> bit

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
inside pulling that back out for a bit

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.860 
inside pulling that back out for a bit
of<00:04:58.560> extra<00:04:58.770> security<00:04:59.430> you<00:05:00.120> can<00:05:00.390> if<00:05:00.540> you<00:05:00.690> wish

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
of extra security you can if you wish

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.830 
of extra security you can if you wish
add<00:05:01.260> some<00:05:01.980> super<00:05:02.370> glue<00:05:02.400> there<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:02.910> sometimes

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
add some super glue there and sometimes

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.480 
add some super glue there and sometimes
there<00:05:04.470> but<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:06.410> is<00:05:07.410> some<00:05:07.620> splice<00:05:07.950> leg<00:05:08.220> core

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
there but that is some splice leg core

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.640 
there but that is some splice leg core
this<00:05:08.820> time<00:05:09.030> with<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.240> swivel<00:05:09.510> on<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.380> could

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
this time with a swivel on but you could

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.610 
this time with a swivel on but you could
create<00:05:10.920> just<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.850> simple<00:05:12.240> loop<00:05:12.450> there<00:05:12.720> for<00:05:13.500> any

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
create just a simple loop there for any

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.110 
create just a simple loop there for any
other<00:05:13.860> rig<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.510> might<00:05:15.720> be<00:05:15.870> time
