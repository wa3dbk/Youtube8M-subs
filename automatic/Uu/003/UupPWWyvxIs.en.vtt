00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.340
 vegetable milk or some water can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610
 shortcrust pastry 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 then the oatmeal and the milk are added 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.560
 and we knead on the smooth dough ball 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560
