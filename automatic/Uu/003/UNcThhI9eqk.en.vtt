even<00:05:02.420> though<00:05:02.510> there's<00:05:02.720> it's<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.020> little<00:05:03.260> laggy

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
even though there's it's a little laggy

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.560 
even though there's it's a little laggy
nowadays<00:05:03.890> because<00:05:04.490> it's<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.120> bigger<00:05:05.300> game

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
nowadays because it's a bigger game

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.970 
nowadays because it's a bigger game
modes<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.200> one<00:05:06.350> is<00:05:06.440> going<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.620> have<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.770> most

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
modes the one is going to have the most

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.650 
modes the one is going to have the most
problems<00:05:07.190> but<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:07.970> mean<00:05:08.150> it's<00:05:08.270> still<00:05:08.360> very

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
problems but I mean it's still very

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.640 
problems but I mean it's still very
playable<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:10.720> place<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.870> acquisition<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.500> don't

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
playable a place of acquisition I don't

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.650 
playable a place of acquisition I don't
know<00:05:12.740> why<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:12.950> acquisition<00:05:13.610> numbers<00:05:14.090> dropped

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
know why the acquisition numbers dropped

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.360 
know why the acquisition numbers dropped
I<00:05:14.750> think<00:05:14.990> it's<00:05:15.110> because<00:05:15.200> it<00:05:15.980> doesn't<00:05:16.190> have<00:05:16.220> the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
I think it's because it doesn't have the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.250 
I think it's because it doesn't have the
experience<00:05:16.460> bonus<00:05:17.180> bed<00:05:17.390> that's<00:05:18.050> just
