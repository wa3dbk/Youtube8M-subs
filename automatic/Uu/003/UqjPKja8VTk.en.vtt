00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
microwave for like two minutes then

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.619 
microwave for like two minutes then
you're<00:01:00.100> going<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.280> completely<00:01:00.730> submerge<00:01:01.030> this

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
you're going to completely submerge this

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.200 
you're going to completely submerge this
under<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.739> water<00:01:02.920> just<00:01:03.370> for<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.579> few<00:01:03.760> seconds

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
under the water just for a few seconds

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.070 
under the water just for a few seconds
because<00:01:04.269> it's<00:01:04.480> going<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:04.659> get<00:01:04.750> really

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
because it's going to get really

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.260 
because it's going to get really
malleable<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.800> pliable<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.370> bindhi<00:01:06.700> you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
malleable and pliable and bindhi you

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
malleable and pliable and bindhi you
don't<00:01:07.450> want<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.630> leave<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:07.870> in<00:01:07.960> too<00:01:08.140> long

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
don't want to leave it in too long

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.770 
don't want to leave it in too long
because<00:01:08.470> then<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:09.210> plastic<00:01:10.210> starts<00:01:10.659> to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
because then the plastic starts to

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.180 
because then the plastic starts to
shrink<00:01:11.050> up<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:11.770> want<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.950> hold<00:01:12.070> to

shrink up so you just want to hold to
you<00:01:12.700> feel<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.030> starting<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.330> get<00:01:13.420> flimsy<00:01:13.780> in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
you feel it starting to get flimsy in

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.360 
you feel it starting to get flimsy in
the<00:01:13.930> water<00:01:14.110> then<00:01:14.740> you're<00:01:14.860> going<00:01:14.980> to<00:01:15.070> take<00:01:15.220> it
