00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:14.570
 on how to go from a usb device 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.460

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:28.219
 Estevez play comes out as a device of 6 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.189
 Triple of the neighborhood can be portable or 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:33.290
 camera is not remarkable depends on what 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.699
 you are going to connect to companies that 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.149
 like the planets here here on the play 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.630
 has has some tickets where his 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.950
 put the usb cable inta 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:52.480
 well let's continue like this is the question of 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.060
 how to pass videos or videos 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.730
 cell music to play 3 that come 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.790
 here to look for air as you walk 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.870
 you put this angle 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.160
 this angle 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.160
 show all 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 from mine they are over 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.940
 these music sounds open the folders 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.770
 and there you get the music depends on the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.370
 turns 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.260
 if you want then you put bags 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.870
 play if you want him to say play 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.390
 copy to delete from what is necessary 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.720
 you get copied when the one who is 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.340
 copying good I already have it I do not 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.799
 appears twice 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.280
 if you ask where will appear 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.939
 then you go back to music and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.149
 come down 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.480
 this apparent here because it serves 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.300
 so 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.760
 here they go and there is their music that they have 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.250
 copied from here of the device and you see 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.200
 to play 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.200
 as reproducible setting angle 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.470
 yes 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.790
 say this 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.510
 the cities of the ebro 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:51.050
 if you want to keep listening but 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.960
 they want to get you out of there from the panel 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.710
 control you put the button in the middle of 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.430
 control you put it and it comes out but 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.430
 it sounds 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.640
 now with the images with the same 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.610
 the images the images the images and 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.430
 let's find the device 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:22.270
 mothers appear and we look for 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.270
 angle shows everything and I do not have time 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.940
 is that they do not accept English but here I 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.940
 I have millionaires 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.970
 we have visualization this is an image 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.450
 in the stadium of the millionaires 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.790
 then you want to pass an image 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.060
 so 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.680
 the vijanera boxer are babies and 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.420
 let's use then what 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.390
 we visualize we throw back triangle 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.330
 we can copy 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.380
 well or these valleys are also very 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.330
 beautiful those of Christmas 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.400
 then you put him copy 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.610
 obviously here is the music because there 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.190
 can all at the same time and they already 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.110
 they take what happens where they arrive 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.049
 images is good you have to analyze here 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.950
 Here you come, look, there are times 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.370

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.860
 December 21 December the apple that 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.890
 now there you can see him with x 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.780
 you enter the folder they look at the image but 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.500
 if you want to put it in the background image 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.340
 Well, then you just have to do that 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.249
 you look for her 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.879
 let's say how are you then 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:47.639

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:52.939
 middle or control panel any of 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.939
 You put him there and they leave you there 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.520

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.030
