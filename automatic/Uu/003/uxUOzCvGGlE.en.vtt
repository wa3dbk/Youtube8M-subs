00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.020 
be passed here in Atlanta I think it
will<00:01:37.539> especially<00:01:38.110> if<00:01:38.500> people<00:01:38.560> aren't<00:01:39.549> upset

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
will especially if people aren't upset

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.179 
will especially if people aren't upset
about<00:01:40.179> it<00:01:40.509> like<00:01:41.020> if<00:01:41.289> people<00:01:41.590> aren't<00:01:41.860> gonna<00:01:41.950> do

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
about it like if people aren't gonna do

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.559 
about it like if people aren't gonna do
anything<00:01:42.340> about<00:01:42.579> it<00:01:42.729> then<00:01:43.090> it's<00:01:43.240> just<00:01:43.360> going

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
anything about it then it's just going

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.309 
anything about it then it's just going
to<00:01:43.689> be<00:01:43.780> passed<00:01:44.049> no<00:01:44.770> problem<00:01:45.569> I<00:01:46.569> think<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.229> would

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
to be passed no problem I think it would

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.949 
to be passed no problem I think it would
definitely<00:01:47.469> be<00:01:47.709> passed<00:01:48.009> in<00:01:48.219> Atlanta<00:01:48.670> because

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
definitely be passed in Atlanta because

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.749 
definitely be passed in Atlanta because

majority population is African Americans

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.109

from New York do the men up there when a

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.529 
from New York do the men up there when a
pants<00:02:02.679> down<00:02:02.829> that's<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.939> norm<00:02:04.479> well<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.619> was

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
pants down that's the norm well it was

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.690

era<00:02:10.690> pasta<00:02:11.640> type<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.849> look<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> think

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
era pasta type of look and so I think

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.680 
era pasta type of look and so I think
it's<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.769> brings<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.670> trend<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's it just brings it's just a trend it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.319 
it's it just brings it's just a trend it
goes<00:02:16.930> back<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.620> forth<00:02:17.650> things<00:02:18.160> change<00:02:18.549> I<00:02:18.819> feel

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
goes back and forth things change I feel

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.210 
goes back and forth things change I feel
like<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.049> don't<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.709> how<00:02:20.799> they<00:02:20.920> could<00:02:21.069> think

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
like if I don't see how they could think

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.370 
like if I don't see how they could think
about<00:02:21.340> passing<00:02:21.910> legislation<00:02:22.060> for<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.780> there
