00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
you get a really good idea of how they

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:49.389 
you get a really good idea of how they
sound<00:01:33.530> masterly

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.029 

all<00:01:50.399> right<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:50.820> we're<00:01:50.969> switching<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
all right so now we're switching to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.069 
all right so now we're switching to
configuration<00:01:53.039> number<00:01:53.759> two<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.270> five<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
configuration number two of five and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.539 
configuration number two of five and
what<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.350> does<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.009> splits<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
what this does is it splits the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
what this does is it splits the
humbuckers<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.149> takes<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> inside<00:01:58.079> coils<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
humbuckers and takes the inside coils of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:16.670 
humbuckers and takes the inside coils of
both<00:01:59.340> pickups<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.049> parallel<00:02:01.049> there<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.710> is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.770 

now<00:02:17.680> we<00:02:17.740> are<00:02:17.890> switching<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.400> into<00:02:18.760> position<00:02:19.420> 3

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
now we are switching it into position 3

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.080 
now we are switching it into position 3
which<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.770> full<00:02:21.040> neck<00:02:21.280> pickup<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
which is the full neck pickup and the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:43.270 
which is the full neck pickup and the
inside<00:02:22.510> coil<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.380> bridge<00:02:23.620> check<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.100> out

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.820 

now<00:02:44.180> we're<00:02:44.330> moving<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.720> position<00:02:45.410> four

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
now we're moving on to position four

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.510 
now we're moving on to position four
which<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.780> actually<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:48.230> lot<00:02:49.010> similar<00:02:49.340> to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
which is actually a lot similar to
