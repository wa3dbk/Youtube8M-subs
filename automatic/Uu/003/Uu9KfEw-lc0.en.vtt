00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 with superfoods and I'm going today 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.910

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.530
 are going to make a good superfoods salad 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 yeah well okay i have a hand 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.550
 because I had a while 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.350
 ago 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.350
 dina south evening a flower for you 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.670
 and broccoli the appie bone hey i was in 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.619
 south africa vacation when i had one 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 once I have eaten something very delicious 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.049
 Write down what all in show that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.549
 so broccoli spinach was like a salad 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.270
 from quinoa 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.210
 or kilo hawking quinoa yes I am kakula 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 wind goes well and you ask for quinoa 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.150
 then you get it sooner than she likes 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.130
 I think my clean water is 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.369
 just the official pronunciation once 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 Prima Klima harbor are very different yes from 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.119
 I am 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.049
 the way the real super feels that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.110
 are spinach broccoli and avocado 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.360
 well fine is of course also very healthy 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 celery is not official 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.290
 examine foot but is very healthy 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.909
 because it's really the detox it works 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 And yes I just want a nice meal 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.130
 make a lot of energy out of that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.869
 get so much compensation 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.630
 well then i thought something with goat cheese 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.219
 or if so nice and good everyone like me 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.689
 so you see, these are also those 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.340
 pepper yes I thought maybe for sissies 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.570
 genius they don't do too much of that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.420
 they soon dominate 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.979
 of couple or just look at taste and 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.899
 of course something like a dressing or something 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.630
 maybe that is something i have something 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.769
 can add that would look from well what would 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.900
 being nice to you 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.900
 yes let's go sailing 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.480
 those that you can simply use come 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.329
 makes broccoli then you will have the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.769
 outside and then cut into cubes 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.879
 then you can just use a piece 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.280
 does not have to throw away and speed is up 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.939
 really not good at it is that they are from 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.680
 degrees 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.849
 oh I am yes yes I suspected that 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.890
 does create a bit of a mess 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.629
 well what I can do that anyway 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.530
 small knife I use this also larger 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.530
 first afternoon 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.519
 all the way around 2 and then turn and open 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.079
 say with two heroes and then put that cap 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.629
 indeed their midst we will go later 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.700
 and so that is most convenient to use here 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.459
 large knife is used then I go with 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.290
 the knife in that time well and then you dip 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 turn it off like that and then you have to 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.680
 watch out for fingers well do that 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.840
 soon sharp knife so that's it 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.970
 Handiest is a small lesson and used 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.709
 then I just make notches 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.609
 to her skin and you can feel it 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.609
 computers please 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.760
 and if you dirkje ready for it 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.330
 well then you can make it look so big 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.330
 difference 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:42.840
 seas of chance small also briefly 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.840
 cooling down 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.850
 how many tons of dike 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.930
 and good food 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.890
 it's okay ladies and gentlemen it is 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.250
 to your home 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:05.120
 broccoli until broccoli sets and 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.120
 humbert saves you 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.680
 I start the waste here for the dressing 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.680
 think of a line people atmosphere 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.319
 soy sauce with some olive oil 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.800
 yes oh yes you see see it throw over it 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.540
 because you can't actually do this and it is 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.400
 super healthy so also a kind of project 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.919
 that on but this is very full of 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.180
 minerals and antioxidants and that thought 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.270
 and just throw over salad 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.500
 yes you can also kind of 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.600
 experience half of pudding 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.430
 chocolate mousse because if that's chia seed 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.340
 touch him to the water then turn it off 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.680
 and then it becomes a kind of blubberige 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.419
 yes substance and that it is also whole 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.479
 well she can really make up for pudding 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.810
 so that we do world to roads 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.820
 governments reduce books in japan 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.260
