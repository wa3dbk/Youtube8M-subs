the two shades with a fluffy brush and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
the two shades with a fluffy brush and
you're<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.310> place<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.790> into<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you're just going to place this into the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
you're just going to place this into the
crease<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.820> warm<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.270> up

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
crease this is just going to warm it up

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.420 
crease this is just going to warm it up
because<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.229> put<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> darker<00:01:34.890> shades<00:01:35.189> on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
because as we put the darker shades on

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.789 
because as we put the darker shades on
the<00:01:35.520> actual<00:01:35.850> eyelid<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.900> rest<00:01:37.229> solid<00:01:37.560> can

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the actual eyelid the rest solid can

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
the actual eyelid the rest solid can
look<00:01:37.950> kind<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> washed<00:01:38.460> out<00:01:38.700> almost<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.509> this

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
look kind of washed out almost so this

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
look kind of washed out almost so this
just<00:01:39.930> warms<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.829> it'll<00:01:40.950> give<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
just warms it up and it'll give it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.969 
just warms it up and it'll give it
something<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.640> blend<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:42.950> then<00:01:43.950> i

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

lifting<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.310> don't<00:02:53.880> worry<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.240> get

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
lifting it up don't worry if you get

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.480 
lifting it up don't worry if you get
some<00:02:54.660> underneath<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.350> eyes<00:02:55.500> because<00:02:56.070> we<00:02:56.220> will

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
some underneath the eyes because we will

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.100 
some underneath the eyes because we will
be<00:02:56.730> putting<00:02:56.940> some<00:02:57.240> underneath<00:02:57.570> there<00:02:57.750> anyway

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
be putting some underneath there anyway

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.770 
be putting some underneath there anyway
but<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.130> why<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> did<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.880> eyes<00:03:00.420> first

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
but this is why I did the eyes first

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.270 
but this is why I did the eyes first
because<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.350> will<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> lot<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> fallout

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
because we will get a lot of fallout

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.950 
because we will get a lot of fallout
with<00:03:02.580> these<00:03:02.730> dark<00:03:03.000> shades<00:03:03.300> then<00:03:03.690> you're<00:03:03.870> going

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
with these dark shades then you're going

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.990 
with these dark shades then you're going
to<00:03:04.020> do<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> same<00:03:04.530> thing<00:03:04.830> with<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.160> dark<00:03:05.640> brown

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
to do the same thing with the dark brown

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.390 
to do the same thing with the dark brown
and<00:03:06.180> then<00:03:06.540> start<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.290> little<00:03:07.590> bit<00:03:07.830> higher<00:03:08.070> this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
and then start a little bit higher this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.250 
and then start a little bit higher this
time<00:03:08.460> so<00:03:08.790> you're<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.030> starting<00:03:09.420> right<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
time so you're not starting right on the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.840 
time so you're not starting right on the
lashes<00:03:10.500> you're<00:03:10.980> starting<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.430> little<00:03:11.580> bit

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
lashes you're starting a little bit

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.970
