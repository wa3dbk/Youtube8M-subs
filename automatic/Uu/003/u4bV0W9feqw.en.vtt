00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
all these crowd noise are activated when

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
all these crowd noise are activated when
they're<00:01:06.210> heated<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.049> two<00:01:07.350> red<00:01:07.680> bell

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.289 
they're heated and I have two red bell
peppers<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.460> interesting<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.060> we

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
peppers you know it's interesting is we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.730 
peppers you know it's interesting is we
think<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.600> tomatoes<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.140> bell<00:01:10.229> peppers<00:01:10.560> as

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
think of tomatoes and bell peppers as

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410 
think of tomatoes and bell peppers as
savory<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.729> they're<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.030> proof

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
savory but they're actually proof

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
savory but they're actually proof
because<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.350> seeds<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.490> so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
because they have seeds right right so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.219 
because they have seeds right right so
what<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> don't<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.240> limes<00:01:15.659> don't<00:01:16.049> have

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
what I don't get is limes don't have

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
what I don't get is limes don't have
seeds<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.890> they're<00:01:17.070> still<00:01:17.280> true<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
seeds but they're still true that's a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
seeds but they're still true that's a
good<00:01:18.180> question<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.900> don't<00:01:19.229> think<00:01:19.470> good

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
good question and I don't think good

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.289 
good question and I don't think good
