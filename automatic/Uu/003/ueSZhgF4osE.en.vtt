way to do that properly I crack the code

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.680 
way to do that properly I crack the code
if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.640> at<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> moment<00:00:45.390> i'm

now and i want to show you exactly how

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
now and i want to show you exactly how
much<00:01:13.590> money<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> writing<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> daily

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
much money I'm the writing on a daily

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
much money I'm the writing on a daily
basis<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.290> copy<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
basis so we can copy me and have the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270 
basis so we can copy me and have the
same<00:01:17.790> results<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.950> want<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> show<00:01:20.100> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
same results for you I want to show you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
same results for you I want to show you
the<00:01:20.460> real<00:01:20.580> proof<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:22.229> how<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.189> system<00:01:23.960> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the real proof of how this system is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
the real proof of how this system is
generating<00:01:25.560> money<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.070> me<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> daily<00:01:26.580> basis

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
generating money for me on a daily basis

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.109 
generating money for me on a daily basis
because<00:01:27.860> this<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.040> help<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> understand

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
because this can help you to understand

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.440 
because this can help you to understand
that<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:31.320> real<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:32.909> powerful

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that it's real and it's really powerful

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.499 
that it's real and it's really powerful
and<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.290> works<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.640> I'm<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:36.360> now

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and it works so what I'm going to do now

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.980 
and it works so what I'm going to do now
is<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.930> log<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.909> GV<00:01:38.909> zoo<00:01:39.060> account<00:01:39.479> which

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
is to log into my GV zoo account which

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
is to log into my GV zoo account which
is<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> account<00:01:40.920> where<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.850> make<00:01:42.180> money

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
is the account where you can make money

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.740 
is the account where you can make money
using<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.950> system<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.729> i'm<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
using this the system and i'm going to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
using this the system and i'm going to
show<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:45.990> exactly<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:46.560> much<00:01:46.829> money<00:01:47.100> i

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
show you exactly how much money i
