00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.639 
restore color to your image will vary
based<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> conversion<00:01:43.110> technique<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
based on the conversion technique that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.560 
based on the conversion technique that
you<00:01:43.770> used<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.640> essentially<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> want

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you used but essentially what you want

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
you used but essentially what you want
to<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> erase<00:01:46.439> or<00:01:46.799> mask<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to do is you want to erase or mask out a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.190 
to do is you want to erase or mask out a
black<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> white<00:01:48.390> version<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:48.930> image

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
black and white version of your image

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160 
black and white version of your image
allowing<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.280> color<00:01:50.700> version<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.570> show<00:01:51.810> through

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
allowing a color version to show through

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.490 
allowing a color version to show through
so<00:01:52.380> here's<00:01:53.070> how<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.280> works<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:55.049> convert<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so here's how that works to convert this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
so here's how that works to convert this
color<00:01:55.710> image<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.159> black<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> white<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.850> chose

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
color image to black and white I chose

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
color image to black and white I chose
to<00:01:57.329> use<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.479> black<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> white<00:01:58.290> adjustment

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
to use a black and white adjustment

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.340 
to use a black and white adjustment
layer<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.340> like<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.299> option<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.869> particular

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
layer I like this option in particular

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.840 
layer I like this option in particular
because<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.890> allows<00:02:02.130> me<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> make<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> quick

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
because it allows me to make a quick

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.130 
because it allows me to make a quick
adjustment<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> black<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> white

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
adjustment to the black and white

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740 
adjustment to the black and white
conversion<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:05.009> well<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.090> gives<00:02:06.390> me<00:02:06.540> this

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
conversion as well as gives me this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.570 
conversion as well as gives me this

on<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.310> white<00:02:17.700> thumbnail<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.900> would<00:02:19.020> do

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
on this white thumbnail what it would do

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.720 
on this white thumbnail what it would do
is<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.320> would<00:02:19.500> mask<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.250> black<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.640> white

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
is it would mask out the black and white

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.640 
is it would mask out the black and white
version<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.360> adjustment<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.050> allow<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
version the adjustment and allow the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.310 
version the adjustment and allow the
color<00:02:23.220> version<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.970> show<00:02:24.180> through<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.720> that's

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
color version to show through and that's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.480 
color version to show through and that's
what<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> want<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.710> do<00:02:25.830> here<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.100> I'm<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
what I want to do here so I'm going to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.580 
what I want to do here so I'm going to
select<00:02:26.730> my<00:02:26.820> paintbrush<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.660> make<00:02:28.320> sure<00:02:28.470> that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
select my paintbrush and make sure that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.290 
select my paintbrush and make sure that
I've<00:02:28.680> got<00:02:28.710> black<00:02:29.130> selected<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
I've got black selected as the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.250 
I've got black selected as the
foreground<00:02:30.780> color

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
foreground color

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.280 
foreground color
now<00:02:32.100> as<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.580> paint<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.300> individual<00:02:33.900> berries

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
now as I paint on the individual berries

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.840 
now as I paint on the individual berries
and<00:02:34.500> I'm<00:02:34.800> doing<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.100> very<00:02:35.250> rough<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and I'm doing this very rough for the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.480 
and I'm doing this very rough for the
moment<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.960> can<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:37.740> masking

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
moment you can see that it is masking

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.880 
moment you can see that it is masking
out<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.150> black<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.810> white<00:02:39.930> version<00:02:40.080> allowing

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
out the black and white version allowing

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.670 
out the black and white version allowing
the<00:02:41.040> color<00:02:41.370> version<00:02:42.270> underneath<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.500> show

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
the color version underneath to show

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.210 
the color version underneath to show
through

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
through

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.030 
through
now<00:02:45.150> again<00:02:45.390> obviously<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.990> is<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> quick<00:02:46.890> way

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
now again obviously this is a quick way

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.290 
now again obviously this is a quick way
to<00:02:47.070> do<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.730> doesn't<00:02:47.880> look<00:02:48.060> very<00:02:48.090> good

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
to do this and it doesn't look very good

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.500 
to do this and it doesn't look very good
a<00:02:48.690> better<00:02:49.410> option<00:02:49.920> would<00:02:50.070> be<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.550> first<00:02:51.060> go<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
a better option would be to first go to

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.240 
a better option would be to first go to
your<00:02:51.750> brushes<00:02:52.170> panel<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.590> select<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.070> more

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
your brushes panel and select a more

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.340 
your brushes panel and select a more
appropriate<00:02:53.580> brush<00:02:54.090> now<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.990> go<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.200> this

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
appropriate brush now to go to this

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.380 
appropriate brush now to go to this
brushes<00:02:55.710> panel<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.010> hit<00:02:56.130> f5<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.970> my<00:02:57.180> keyboard

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
brushes panel I hit f5 on my keyboard

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.200 
brushes panel I hit f5 on my keyboard
I'm<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> tap<00:02:58.710> on<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:59.040> brush<00:02:59.700> in<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
I'm going to tap on this brush in the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.730 
I'm going to tap on this brush in the
upper<00:03:00.540> right<00:03:00.750> hand<00:03:00.780> corner<00:03:01.170> now<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.710> a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
upper right hand corner now this is a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.730 
upper right hand corner now this is a
soft<00:03:02.160> round<00:03:02.520> brush<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:03.420> pressure<00:03:03.930> turned<00:03:04.530> on

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
soft round brush with pressure turned on

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.310 
soft round brush with pressure turned on
to<00:03:05.010> affect<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> opacity<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.240> brush<00:03:07.050> and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
to affect the opacity of that brush and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.100 
to affect the opacity of that brush and
this<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> really<00:03:08.610> nice<00:03:08.760> selection<00:03:09.110> because

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
this is a really nice selection because

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.420 
this is a really nice selection because
what<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.440> does<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.830> allows<00:03:11.040> me<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.340> get

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
what it does is it allows me to get

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.910 
what it does is it allows me to get
really<00:03:12.000> close<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.480> edges<00:03:12.840> without<00:03:13.380> having

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
really close to the edges without having

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.290 
really close to the edges without having
to<00:03:13.980> make<00:03:14.130> any<00:03:14.630> detailed<00:03:15.630> or<00:03:17.300> time-consuming

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
to make any detailed or time-consuming

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.010 
to make any detailed or time-consuming
masks

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
masks

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.110 
masks
I<00:03:19.050> simply<00:03:19.620> lighten<00:03:20.220> up<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> touch<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.760> my<00:03:20.880> pen

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
I simply lighten up the touch of my pen

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.450 
I simply lighten up the touch of my pen
as<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.450> get<00:03:21.600> closer<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> edges<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.800> the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
as I get closer to the edges and the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.160 
as I get closer to the edges and the
other<00:03:23.640> beauty<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.210> particular<00:03:24.840> type<00:03:25.110> of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
other beauty of this particular type of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.290 
other beauty of this particular type of
technique<00:03:25.710> is<00:03:25.860> because<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:26.340> I'm<00:03:26.910> using<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
technique is because as I'm using a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.780 
technique is because as I'm using a
layer<00:03:27.510> mask<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.590> happen<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.950> go<00:03:29.130> outside<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
layer mask if I happen to go outside the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.180 
layer mask if I happen to go outside the
lines<00:03:30.030> like<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.840> did<00:03:30.990> right<00:03:31.140> there<00:03:31.200> all<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.890> have

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
lines like I did right there all I have

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.280 
lines like I did right there all I have
to<00:03:32.340> do<00:03:32.490> is<00:03:32.700> flip<00:03:33.330> over<00:03:33.450> my<00:03:33.570> foreground<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
to do is flip over my foreground and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.020 
to do is flip over my foreground and
background<00:03:34.350> color<00:03:34.950> painting<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:36.000> black

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
background color painting with black

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.200 
background color painting with black
back<00:03:36.930> on<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.290> image<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.950> essentially<00:03:38.850> mask

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
back on the image to essentially mask

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.390 
back on the image to essentially mask
out<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.930> color<00:03:40.140> version<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.890> let<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.190> black

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
out the color version and let the black

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.210 
out the color version and let the black
and<00:03:41.610> white<00:03:41.760> show<00:03:41.970> through<00:03:42.290> all<00:03:43.290> right<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.680> I'm

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
and white show through all right so I'm

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.310 
and white show through all right so I'm
going<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.520> kind<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.030> zip<00:03:45.240> through<00:03:45.450> here<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.990> in

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
going to kind of zip through here and in

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.070 
going to kind of zip through here and in
the<00:03:46.440> interest<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:46.980> time<00:03:47.360> I've<00:03:48.360> got<00:03:48.660> kind<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.020> a

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the interest of time I've got kind of a

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.900 
the interest of time I've got kind of a
a<00:03:49.110> Julia<00:03:49.740> Child's<00:03:50.130> version<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:50.760> this

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
a Julia Child's version of this

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.840 
a Julia Child's version of this
particular<00:03:51.690> technique<00:03:52.460> queued<00:03:53.460> up<00:03:53.580> for<00:03:53.640> you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
particular technique queued up for you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.020 
particular technique queued up for you
guys

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
guys

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.540 
guys
so<00:03:54.630> I'll<00:03:55.500> talk<00:03:55.770> through<00:03:55.800> this<00:03:56.070> for<00:03:56.250> just<00:03:56.400> a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
so I'll talk through this for just a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.620 
so I'll talk through this for just a
moment<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:56.880> then<00:03:56.940> I'll<00:03:57.090> go<00:03:57.180> ahead<00:03:57.210> and<00:03:57.450> flip

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
moment and then I'll go ahead and flip

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.320 
moment and then I'll go ahead and flip
over<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.990> that<00:03:58.140> after<00:03:59.010> image<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.550> see<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.240> I've

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
over to that after image I see that I've

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.210 
over to that after image I see that I've
missed<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.290> little<00:04:01.380> spot<00:04:01.500> there<00:04:01.890> let's<00:04:02.130> go

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
missed a little spot there let's go

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.160 
missed a little spot there let's go
ahead<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.430> paint<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.820> back<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.390> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
ahead and paint that back in and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
ahead and paint that back in and
flipping<00:04:04.500> over<00:04:04.590> my<00:04:04.770> foreground<00:04:05.130> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
flipping over my foreground and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.430 
flipping over my foreground and
background<00:04:05.250> colors<00:04:05.850> but<00:04:06.600> again<00:04:06.960> what<00:04:07.320> I'm

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
background colors but again what I'm

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.840 
background colors but again what I'm
doing<00:04:07.710> here<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:07.920> I'm<00:04:07.980> basically<00:04:08.490> using

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
doing here is I'm basically using

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.360 
doing here is I'm basically using
pressure<00:04:09.510> sensitivity<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.410> get<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.100> lot<00:04:11.340> more

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
pressure sensitivity to get a lot more

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.670 
pressure sensitivity to get a lot more
control<00:04:11.850> over<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.630> mask<00:04:12.959> as<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.350> start<00:04:13.590> to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
control over this mask as I start to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.220 
control over this mask as I start to
paint<00:04:13.890> away<00:04:14.810> there<00:04:15.810> we<00:04:15.900> go

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
paint away there we go

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.229 
paint away there we go
so<00:04:16.410> what<00:04:16.799> I've<00:04:16.890> done<00:04:16.920> here<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.310> again<00:04:17.609> painted

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
so what I've done here is again painted

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.870 
so what I've done here is again painted
in<00:04:18.359> all<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.109> different<00:04:19.440> berries<00:04:19.920> with<00:04:20.489> my

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
in all of the different berries with my

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.150 
in all of the different berries with my
black<00:04:21.270> paintbrush<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.620> could<00:04:22.919> mask

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
black paintbrush so that I could mask

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.890 
black paintbrush so that I could mask
out<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.520> black<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:23.970> white<00:04:24.090> version<00:04:24.120> allowing

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
out the black and white version allowing

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900 
out the black and white version allowing
only<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.530> color<00:04:25.740> version<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.250> show<00:04:26.430> through

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
only the color version to show through

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.310 
only the color version to show through
I'm<00:04:27.420> going<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.660> show<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.900> mask<00:04:28.080> for<00:04:28.290> a

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
I'm going to show you the mask for a

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.140 
I'm going to show you the mask for a
moment<00:04:28.590> by<00:04:28.710> holding<00:04:29.160> down<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.340> option<00:04:29.520> or<00:04:30.120> Alt

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
moment by holding down the option or Alt

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.410 
moment by holding down the option or Alt
key<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.500> show<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.740> where<00:04:31.950> I've<00:04:32.130> painted

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
key and to show you where I've painted

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.910 
key and to show you where I've painted
again<00:04:33.420> using<00:04:33.780> pressure<00:04:34.050> sensitivity<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.770> can

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
again using pressure sensitivity you can

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.260 
again using pressure sensitivity you can
see<00:04:35.100> on<00:04:35.280> some<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.580> these<00:04:35.640> edges<00:04:35.820> they're<00:04:36.120> nice

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
see on some of these edges they're nice

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.750 
see on some of these edges they're nice
and<00:04:36.300> soft<00:04:36.660> that's<00:04:37.320> where<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.650> simply<00:04:38.220> lightened

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
and soft that's where I simply lightened

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.850 
and soft that's where I simply lightened
up<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:38.910> touch<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.360> my<00:04:39.480> pen<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.290> edge<00:04:40.440> so

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
up the touch of my pen on the edge so

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.920 
up the touch of my pen on the edge so
that<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.010> could<00:04:41.220> retain<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:42.210> really<00:04:42.780> nice

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
that I could retain that really nice

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.590 
that I could retain that really nice
crisp<00:04:43.320> sort<00:04:43.890> of<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.100> fact<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:45.000> having<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.360> color

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
crisp sort of a fact of having a color

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.290 
crisp sort of a fact of having a color
version<00:04:45.810> against<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.560> black<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.950> white<00:04:47.300> to

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
version against the black and white to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.700 
version against the black and white to
reiterate<00:04:48.810> one<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.290> reasons<00:04:49.560> why<00:04:49.680> I

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
reiterate one of the reasons why I

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.350 
reiterate one of the reasons why I
really<00:04:49.980> like<00:04:50.220> this<00:04:50.430> particular<00:04:50.970> black<00:04:51.180> and

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
really like this particular black and

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.910 
really like this particular black and
white<00:04:51.450> conversion<00:04:51.600> technique<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.470> because<00:04:52.890> I

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
white conversion technique is because I

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.010 
white conversion technique is because I
have<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.430> layer<00:04:53.640> mask<00:04:53.910> associated<00:04:54.750> with<00:04:54.900> it

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
have the layer mask associated with it

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.770 
have the layer mask associated with it
so<00:04:55.620> for<00:04:55.830> example<00:04:56.280> if<00:04:56.460> i<00:04:56.850> zoom<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.330> up<00:04:57.450> here<00:04:57.480> you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
so for example if i zoom in up here you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.000 
so for example if i zoom in up here you
can<00:04:57.930> see<00:04:58.140> where<00:04:58.320> I've<00:04:58.410> kind<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.680> painted

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
can see where I've kind of painted

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.370 
can see where I've kind of painted
outside<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.460> lines<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.850> bit<00:05:00.000> again<00:05:00.990> all<00:05:01.170> I<00:05:01.200> have

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
outside the lines a bit again all I have

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.630 
outside the lines a bit again all I have
to<00:05:01.470> do<00:05:01.560> is<00:05:01.680> flip<00:05:01.860> over<00:05:01.980> my<00:05:02.070> foreground<00:05:02.490> and

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
to do is flip over my foreground and

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.250 
to do is flip over my foreground and
background<00:05:02.700> color<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.510> then<00:05:03.720> paint<00:05:04.050> that

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
background color and then paint that

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.280 
background color and then paint that
back<00:05:04.590> in<00:05:04.890> with<00:05:05.670> black<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.050> really

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
back in with black so this is a really

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.320 
back in with black so this is a really
effective<00:05:07.800> way<00:05:07.920> to<00:05:07.980> do<00:05:08.160> this<00:05:08.340> as<00:05:08.520> opposed<00:05:09.210> to

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
effective way to do this as opposed to

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.160 
effective way to do this as opposed to
say<00:05:09.510> duplicating<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.170> layer<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.650> using<00:05:11.640> the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
say duplicating the layer and using the

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.420 
say duplicating the layer and using the
using<00:05:13.170> another<00:05:13.470> form<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.920> mask<00:05:14.160> or<00:05:14.400> a

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
using another form of mask or a

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.580 
using another form of mask or a
time-consuming<00:05:14.790> mask<00:05:15.300> or<00:05:15.510> or<00:05:15.720> worse<00:05:16.140> using

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
time-consuming mask or or worse using

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.560 
time-consuming mask or or worse using
the<00:05:16.740> eraser<00:05:17.370> tool<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.700> erase<00:05:17.970> through<00:05:18.540> a

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
the eraser tool to erase through a

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.380 
the eraser tool to erase through a
particular<00:05:19.110> image<00:05:19.610> adjustments<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.700> find<00:05:21.060> are

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
particular image adjustments I find are

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.380 
particular image adjustments I find are
far<00:05:21.870> more<00:05:22.130> suitable<00:05:23.130> because<00:05:23.970> they<00:05:24.270> are

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
far more suitable because they are

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.480 
far more suitable because they are
non-destructive<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.410> again<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:25.920> can<00:05:26.280> very

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
non-destructive and again I can very

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.250 
non-destructive and again I can very
easily<00:05:26.700> flip<00:05:27.120> over<00:05:27.300> back<00:05:27.540> black<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.080> white

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
easily flip over back black and white

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
easily flip over back black and white
and<00:05:28.850> fine-tune<00:05:29.850> this<00:05:30.120> particular<00:05:30.660> image<00:05:31.280> all

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
and fine-tune this particular image all

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.830 
and fine-tune this particular image all
right<00:05:32.340> so<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.060> think<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.390> kind<00:05:33.540> of<00:05:33.570> get<00:05:33.720> in<00:05:33.780> the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
right so I think you kind of get in the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.080 
right so I think you kind of get in the
picture<00:05:34.020> there<00:05:34.320> again<00:05:34.860> selective<00:05:35.670> color<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.060> a

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
picture there again selective color is a

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.290 
picture there again selective color is a
great<00:05:36.300> technique<00:05:36.840> it's<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.080> great<00:05:37.590> way<00:05:37.770> to

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
great technique it's a great way to

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.880 
great technique it's a great way to
effectively<00:05:39.300> narrow<00:05:39.750> your<00:05:39.960> viewers<00:05:40.350> focus<00:05:40.710> on

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
effectively narrow your viewers focus on

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.710 
effectively narrow your viewers focus on
a<00:05:40.950> particular<00:05:41.490> element<00:05:41.670> within<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.270> scene<00:05:42.510> and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
a particular element within a scene and

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.560 
a particular element within a scene and
when<00:05:43.410> used<00:05:43.590> appropriately<00:05:44.030> it<00:05:45.030> can<00:05:45.270> be<00:05:45.420> a

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
when used appropriately it can be a

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.280 
when used appropriately it can be a
really<00:05:45.900> attractive<00:05:46.110> piece<00:05:46.920> of<00:05:47.100> work
