00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.530
 we already walk enough 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.820
 camping we have here 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.760
 in case you forgot the world fools 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.660
 it is broken well broken 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.199
 the dead are loose and what is left 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.930
 of civilization depends on forces 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.910
 that we barely understand 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.550
 tell me what makes you think that in this 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.720
 place we will find something different I do not know 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:00.540
 what we will find but we will be safe 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.070
 and sure of what thing 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:09.900
 I do not know his memory loses his 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.990
 name is rosman grossman is my name or 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.540
 last name we do not know the least dry 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.970
 in the end the case is that you are a former agent 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 of broken arrow you have been wandering around 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.540
 there from 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.399
 yes 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.689
 I think I remember the town 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.689
 is where we contrast 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 dragging your puppy doggie 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.970
 faldero I'm the only one who knows what 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.390
 you have to do stop saying stupid things 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.030
 this you only know what the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.310
 German 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.170
 you are not in a position to ridicule the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.930
 sir is your linger especially having 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.210
 consider your inclinations shut up 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.700
 before you say something about what you 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.750
 Enough need to repent 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.750
 remember why we came 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.640
 juggling for reasons not 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.030
 we understand completely 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.460
 apologies completely is fine that no 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.610
 we are in a little 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.860
 the thing is to keep going and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.940
 keep fighting 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.940
 is what we do 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.240
 if you really need a reason I would 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.040
 I'm going to walk 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.400
 we do it because we do something 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.959
 whatever is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.959
 It is better than not doing anything 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.840
 the fissure is less than a day 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.870
 we will leave at dawn and if we do not find 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.530
 answers then we will have to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530
 ask
