such<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.269> high-end<00:00:47.600> helmet<00:00:48.109> but<00:00:48.440> it<00:00:48.559> actually

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
such a high-end helmet but it actually

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.139 
such a high-end helmet but it actually
allows<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.160> visor<00:00:49.339> to<00:00:49.579> break<00:00:49.789> away<00:00:50.000> in<00:00:50.089> a

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
allows the visor to break away in a

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.150 
allows the visor to break away in a
crash<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.989> even<00:00:51.410> comes<00:00:51.589> with<00:00:51.679> a<00:00:51.800> matte<00:00:51.980> black

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
crash it even comes with a matte black

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.250 
crash it even comes with a matte black
strip<00:00:52.519> to<00:00:52.699> cut<00:00:52.910> down<00:00:53.030> on<00:00:53.210> glare<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:53.780> think<00:00:54.199> of

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
strip to cut down on glare so think of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.810 
strip to cut down on glare so think of
it<00:00:54.410> like<00:00:54.499> a<00:00:54.559> baseball<00:00:54.980> or<00:00:55.160> football<00:00:55.190> player

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
it like a baseball or football player

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.729 
it like a baseball or football player
with<00:00:55.969> I<00:00:56.120> paint<00:00:56.449> on<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.629> cheeks<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.559> same

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
with I paint on the cheeks it's the same

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.189 
with I paint on the cheeks it's the same
concept<00:00:58.059> some<00:00:59.059> other<00:00:59.300> unique<00:00:59.600> features<00:00:59.989> of

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
concept some other unique features of

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.380 
concept some other unique features of
the<00:01:00.589> V<00:01:00.710> effects<00:01:01.070> are<00:01:01.309> these<00:01:01.579> ridges<00:01:02.059> on<00:01:02.210> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
the V effects are these ridges on the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.060 
the V effects are these ridges on the
back<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:02.809> helmet<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:03.620> is<00:01:03.679> so<00:01:03.949> the

back of the helmet this is so the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.280 
back of the helmet this is so the
goggles<00:01:04.430> don't<00:01:04.670> wander<00:01:04.910> around<00:01:05.060> or<00:01:05.540> slip<00:01:06.140> off
