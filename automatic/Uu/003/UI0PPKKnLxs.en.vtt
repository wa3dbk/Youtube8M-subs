00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.150

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.920
 d so we meet today for 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.970
 a new video and yes we are not 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.710
 on the console we are on my iphone 4s 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.059
 so the purpose of this video and you 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.739
 present the application i fruyt then 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.410
 I said it's to do this little 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.850
 video because I have not found my happiness 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.830
 on the internet and I discovered them 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.830
 alone so I think the share 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.480
 would be a plus for the community 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.739
 so we start with 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.160
 the app and fries you will have 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.059
 uploaded near to nab on the store one 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.880
 little one or when she will come out on the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.710
 store android 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.150
 so I'll put you the link in the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.799
 hall in the description of the video 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.740
 so here we start with 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.360
 the shop the dog app 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.610
 then there are several applications in 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.860
 the application in the application shop 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.260
 the dog it allows to learn from 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.150
 turns to your dog 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.730
 to change his collar to give him 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.010
 to eat etc etc 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.380
 so it's a little long change I 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.590
 wanted you but we will do that all of 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.690
 after 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.810
 on the other hand the quality the apa is very 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.760
 very clear because apparently he has to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.450
 shape fashion landscape but on my bed 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.300
 simon capture software excuse me 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.130
 iphone I could not put it 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.160
 in landscape and I have not found any other 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.540
 so the veil to start over for him 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.410
 give food so ordered to a 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.140
 chicken thigh 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:04.820
 so we take the crisis on the crisis and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:08.210
 where I think they will eat we are going to him 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.260
 put to the inscribed 1 for the fun I 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.940
 did not know we could give a 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.190
 sprite a dog but hey if we can 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.600
 do we will do it so I think it 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.750
 eat everything sending it to you have the bone 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:23.300
 of well-being when he moved my watch 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.650
 friend kg so he's going to drink so here 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.220
 then we will go walk in 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.280
 leash 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.410
 so we will start with the tree there is 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.940
 three walks 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.870
 it's pretty funny so this one he 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.860
 must defend his darling of other males 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.060
 and to be able to 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.710
 make her fall in love with you or 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.070
 so it's pretty simple you have to 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.320
 head on the screen to the dogs for 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.580
 keep them away 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.860
 as you can see it's not 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.210
 complicated you have so many bonuses so 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.210
 you want to last longer 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:08.030
 I think you're going 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.750
 you see you have time bonuses 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.900
 it's not easy to defend at all 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.900
 shots 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.660
 in my opinion must kruger be full 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.920
 I lost enough love so I 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.239
 lets you imagine what happens if 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.849
 you get to give it all the love 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.730
 she needs 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:41.600
 so here we go we'll be on the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.250
 second part you can send you 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.430
 have others I'm not showing you everything 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.810
 to leave you suspense but good 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:54.290
 after you can throw his ball yes we 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.840
 did not move then I had you 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.310
 soft toys change his necklace 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.739
 you will find it in the game a good 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.069
 obviously and you can teach him 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.400
 new tricks so the appearance and 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.350
 the turn so sees especially now 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.459
 sit in gran theft auto 5 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:20.780
 so that's so I can not take it a 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:22.040
 another round here is to do a lot 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.330
 many times so that they can 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:31.070
 to learn it I do not hide it from you I 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.650
 think we'll go back to acquire it I 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.300
 do not know here it is 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.479
 the first part was seen our 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.940
 then you have the parameters so 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.530
 given application settings you 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.930

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.440

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.060
 video so you can create an account 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.010
 then for the traded platform if 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.510
