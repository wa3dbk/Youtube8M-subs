 "Unlikely Scenes." The four of them stand, the four of them play! 

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:09.712
 How does "Unlikely Scenes" work? 

00:00:09.712 --> 00:00:13.681
 You wrote scene suggestions and put them in this red box 

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.914
 and I will read these suggestions to the players, 

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:22.054
 they take a step forward and do the first thing that comes to mind. 

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:24.393
 Let's start today with: 

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:29.805
 'Possible conversation between two married friends'. Valendo. 

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.586
 Gee, I can not take my wife any more, I'm in love with you. 

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:37.146
 [Bell] 

00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:41.000
 Gee, I can not take my wife any more. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.437
 Me neither. 

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:46.067
 [Bell] 

00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:49.870
 Look how subtle this, huh people? 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 There are some people who will be driving back ... 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 'Ah! I understand now!' 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.062
 'Possible conversation between the bowling pins' 

00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:08.373
 Oh, go, tell me! 

00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:11.093
 Tell me! 

00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:13.000
 Ah, give a clue! 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.633
 There, oh! 

00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:17.173
 [Bell] 

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:24.426
 'Worst ways to save a life' 

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:28.498
 [flustered] Hey, calm down, calm down! Hold it! 

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:30.527
 [Bell] 

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:39.140
 People almost died with the chulo there. It was going to have the opposite effect. 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.350
 'Innovative ways to use the microwave' 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.752
 Oh, look! 

00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:52.991

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.389
 - Pineapple! - Yes! 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.811
 [Gaucho accent] Here, take it! 

00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:24.371
 [Bell] 

00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:29.411
 - Bah! "No ... A-bah-crab!" 

00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:33.951
 Specifically this: 'What not to say to an ambulance nurse' 

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:40.746
 [crashing engine noise] 

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:44.827
 Ah, how good the ambulance nurse came, the ambulance does not!

 Fuck, potato, until finally you're here, huh? 

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.672
 Ah, mustard but it does not fail. 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.520
 [Bell] 

00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:32.117
 Wow, potato, how are you blushing today?

 'Quertechupe'? [Bell] 

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:48.263
 I really love it all. 

00:03:48.363 --> 00:03:50.283
 [Bell] 

00:03:56.714 --> 00:03:59.376
 Hey potato, do you know who's getting there? 

00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:01.726

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.857
 [Bell] 

00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:11.358
 Our ... 'Possible conversation between two legs of a fat man' 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.610

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.350
 [Bell] 

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:40.685

00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:45.707
 No, but I wanted to ... [voice volume decreases] 

00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.267
 [Bell] 

00:04:56.368 --> 00:04:59.060
 What part are we, the cinnamon or the thigh? 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:01.321
 [Bell] 

00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:09.302
 'Worst excuses when you're' matardo 'class' 

00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:16.675
 I'm not going to ask who wrote, because I think ... 

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:21.988
 'Worst excuses when you're' matardo 'class' 

00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:29.391
 Sorry, professor, we were reading dictionaries.

 [Bell] 

00:05:39.588 --> 00:05:44.337
 [nervous] Ah, you! Why did you kill class on Friday? 

00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:48.340
 It's that fifth was a holiday and the sixth I hung up. 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.120

00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:54.401
