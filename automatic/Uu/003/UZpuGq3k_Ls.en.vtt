can<00:01:39.650> use<00:01:39.770> these<00:01:39.920> e<00:01:39.979> draw<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.490> get<00:01:40.940> my<00:01:41.090> drawing

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
can use these e draw you get my drawing

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.180 
can use these e draw you get my drawing
good<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.260> what<00:01:42.380> are<00:01:42.410> some<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.830> tools<00:01:43.040> that

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
good so what are some of the tools that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.550 
good so what are some of the tools that
make<00:01:43.490> it's<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.060> easy<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.330> use<00:01:44.420> as<00:01:45.020> opposed<00:01:45.320> to

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
make it's so easy to use as opposed to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.730 
make it's so easy to use as opposed to
yeah<00:01:46.400> that<00:01:46.670> would<00:01:46.880> be<00:01:46.910> mainly<00:01:47.300> OS<00:01:48.050> 10<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.650> know

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
yeah that would be mainly OS 10 you know

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.620 
yeah that would be mainly OS 10 you know
we're<00:01:48.979> because<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.580> lot<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.000> apps<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.420> bump

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
we're because a lot of apps you bump

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.660 
we're because a lot of apps you bump
into<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.200> know<00:01:51.320> are<00:01:51.440> still<00:01:51.710> carving<00:01:52.130> apps<00:01:52.340> and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
into you know are still carving apps and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.359 
into you know are still carving apps and
there's<00:01:52.850> basically<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.869> user<00:01:54.680> interfaces

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
there's basically the user interfaces

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.310 
there's basically the user interfaces
from<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> 90s<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.330> it's<00:01:56.479> been<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:57.110> know<00:01:57.170> it's

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
from the 90s and it's been you know it's

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.410 
from the 90s and it's been you know it's
been<00:01:57.440> ported<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.010> brought<00:01:58.220> up<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:58.580> easy<00:01:59.119> draw

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
been ported and brought up but easy draw

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.210 
been ported and brought up but easy draw
started<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.500> first<00:02:00.740> line<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:00.950> code

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
started it's the first line of code

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.570 
started it's the first line of code
uneasy<00:02:01.580> draw<00:02:01.850> was<00:02:02.119> drawn<00:02:02.530> was<00:02:03.530> done<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:03.800> OS<00:02:04.310> 10

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
uneasy draw was drawn was done on OS 10

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.060 
uneasy draw was drawn was done on OS 10
and<00:02:04.820> that's<00:02:05.060> all<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.360> designed<00:02:05.720> for<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.320> see<00:02:06.979> if

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
and that's all we designed for so see if

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.949 
and that's all we designed for so see if
we<00:02:07.190> design<00:02:07.490> for<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.760> couple<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:08.240> platforms<00:02:08.810> we

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
we design for a couple of platforms we

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.620 
we design for a couple of platforms we
have<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.610> scale<00:02:10.610> back<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.150> lowest<00:02:11.300> common

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
have to scale back to the lowest common

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.960 
have to scale back to the lowest common
denominator<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.769> as<00:02:12.890> OS<00:02:13.220> 10<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.640> far<00:02:13.850> out

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
denominator but to as OS 10 so far out

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.699 
denominator but to as OS 10 so far out
in<00:02:14.060> front<00:02:14.090> then<00:02:14.480> well<00:02:14.660> that's<00:02:14.870> pretty<00:02:15.470> much

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
in front then well that's pretty much

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.560 
in front then well that's pretty much
its<00:02:15.890> key<00:02:16.040> feature<00:02:16.310> yeah<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:17.360> did<00:02:17.450> you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
its key feature yeah and when did you

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.320 
its key feature yeah and when did you
release<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.400> easy<00:02:19.400> draws<00:02:19.700> been<00:02:19.940> kicking

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
nice and simple might you showed us sure

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.660 
nice and simple might you showed us sure
this<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.290> doula<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.069> full<00:03:07.340> screen

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
this is doula it's a full screen

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.530 
this is doula it's a full screen
application<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.719> it<00:03:09.049> has<00:03:09.670> some<00:03:10.670> ways<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.299> get

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
application and it has some ways to get

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.449 
application and it has some ways to get
started<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.319> inspire<00:03:12.650> them<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.829> start<00:03:13.129> drawing

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
started to inspire them to start drawing

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.670 
started to inspire them to start drawing
so<00:03:13.879> for<00:03:14.030> example<00:03:14.090> they<00:03:14.900> can<00:03:15.049> start<00:03:15.230> coloring

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
so for example they can start coloring

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.649 
so for example they can start coloring
in<00:03:15.829> which<00:03:16.670> choose<00:03:16.879> a<00:03:16.909> cool<00:03:17.180> character<00:03:17.390> we've

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
in which choose a cool character we've

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.339 
in which choose a cool character we've
got<00:03:17.780> lots<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.079> included<00:03:18.560> artwork<00:03:20.230> lots<00:03:21.230> of

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
got lots of included artwork lots of
