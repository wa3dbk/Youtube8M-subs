00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
wait getting home to just take them off

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.350 
wait getting home to just take them off
because<00:05:59.349> they<00:05:59.500> were<00:06:00.159> so<00:06:00.550> uncomfortable<00:06:00.849> I

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
because they were so uncomfortable I

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.209
