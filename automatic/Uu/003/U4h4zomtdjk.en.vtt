00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
left off here I taught you how to play

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.570 
left off here I taught you how to play
this<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:10.460> the<00:00:11.460> course<00:00:11.940> here<00:00:13.309> I'll<00:00:14.309> play<00:00:14.549> for

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
this on the course here I'll play for

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:28.720 
this on the course here I'll play for
you

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:46.450 

you

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.150 

so<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.809> was<00:00:47.930> pretty<00:00:48.140> much<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.379> same<00:00:48.770> as<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
so that was pretty much the same as the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.759 
so that was pretty much the same as the
course<00:00:49.399> I<00:00:49.550> did<00:00:50.450> before<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.690> next<00:00:53.690> part<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.110> my

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
course I did before and next part is my

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.830 
course I did before and next part is my
favorite<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:58.390> believed<00:00:59.390> that<00:00:59.420> it's

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
favorite it is believed that it's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.130 
favorite it is believed that it's
probably<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.379> bridge<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.129> song<00:01:02.140> goes

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
probably the bridge of the song goes

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.290 
probably the bridge of the song goes
into<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:03.589> nice<00:01:03.829> melodic<00:01:04.369> on<00:01:04.790> part<00:01:05.089> on<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
into this nice melodic on part on the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.749 
into this nice melodic on part on the
left<00:01:05.509> hand<00:01:05.750> here<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.860> I'll<00:01:07.190> just<00:01:07.220> play<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
left hand here so I'll just play the

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:25.340 
left hand here so I'll just play the
left<00:01:07.970> hand

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.600 

so<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.360> playing<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.229> notes<00:01:28.740> but

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so what I'm playing is the notes but

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.570 
so what I'm playing is the notes but
yeah<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> notes<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.159> same<00:01:32.159> chord<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
yeah the notes from the same chord I

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.460 
yeah the notes from the same chord I
taught<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.570> you're<00:01:33.869> using<00:01:34.080> throughout

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
taught you that you're using throughout

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.889 
taught you that you're using throughout
the<00:01:34.619> piece<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> C<00:01:37.080> sharp<00:01:37.409> E<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.100> B

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
the piece so it's the C sharp E and B

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.190 
the piece so it's the C sharp E and B
except<00:01:39.899> I'm<00:01:40.080> going

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:59.450 

then<00:01:45.979> they<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.399> e<00:01:46.869> be

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.929 

so<00:02:00.930> there's<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.619> then<00:02:03.189> it's<00:02:03.670> kind<00:02:03.909> of

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
so there's that and then it's kind of

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.700 
so there's that and then it's kind of
hard<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.180> get<00:02:04.420> together<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.990> right<00:02:05.229> hand<00:02:05.500> and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
hard to get together the right hand and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.850 
hard to get together the right hand and
the<00:02:05.770> left<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.969> here's<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.299> left<00:02:07.630> sit<00:02:07.929> I'm

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
the left but here's the left sit I'm

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:33.509 
the left but here's the left sit I'm
sorry<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.250> right<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.720> same<00:02:10.929> melodies<00:02:11.349> before

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:51.750 

so<00:02:34.519> together

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.730 

you

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
you

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.840 
you
so<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:55.220> goes<00:02:55.430> into<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:57.530> part<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.400> it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
so it goes into this part here and it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.200 
so it goes into this part here and it
goes<00:02:58.880> into<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.390> eighth<00:02:59.780> notes<00:03:00.050> again<00:03:00.850> be<00:03:01.850> f

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
goes into the eighth notes again be f

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:18.070 
goes into the eighth notes again be f
sharp<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.750> be<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.500> cord<00:03:03.740> on<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.950> left<00:03:04.160> hand

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:42.520
