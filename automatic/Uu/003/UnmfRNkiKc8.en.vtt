going to be diagonally shape here and

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.800 
going to be diagonally shape here and
took<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.460> measurement<00:01:23.210> off<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.450> low<00:01:23.570> side

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
took the measurement off the low side

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.389 
took the measurement off the low side
and<00:01:24.049> I'm<00:01:24.110> transferring<00:01:24.649> that<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.159> piece

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
and I'm transferring that to the piece

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.060 
and I'm transferring that to the piece
that<00:01:25.640> I'm<00:01:25.759> cutting<00:01:26.119> into<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.619> half<00:01:27.829> for

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
that I'm cutting into the and a half for

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.370 
that I'm cutting into the and a half for
the<00:01:28.159> two<00:01:28.310> sides<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.000> draw<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> diagonal<00:01:30.200> line

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
the two sides and I draw a diagonal line

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.410 
the two sides and I draw a diagonal line
on<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.579> angle<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:33.880> just<00:01:34.880> cut<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.299> half

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
on the angle and I just cut that in half

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.749 
on the angle and I just cut that in half
with<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.810> jigsaw<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.500> then<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.490> will<00:01:37.610> give

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
with the jigsaw and then that will give

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:47.020 
with the jigsaw and then that will give
us<00:01:37.789> two<00:01:38.329> identical<00:01:38.840> pieces<00:01:39.020> for<00:01:39.679> the<00:01:39.799> ends<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
us two identical pieces for the ends the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.820 
us two identical pieces for the ends the
two<00:01:47.209> sides<00:01:47.509> of<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.810> cart<00:01:48.049> have<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.409> extend

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
two sides of the cart have to extend

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.620 
two sides of the cart have to extend
below<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.280> base<00:01:49.459> because<00:01:49.909> they're<00:01:50.090> also<00:01:50.240> used

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
below the base because they're also used

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.480 
below the base because they're also used
for<00:01:50.840> mounting<00:01:50.959> the<00:01:51.229> wheels<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.830> ends<00:01:52.189> I<00:01:52.280> just

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
for mounting the wheels the ends I just

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.789 
for mounting the wheels the ends I just
wrapped<00:01:52.729> around<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.720> same<00:01:53.929> way<00:01:53.959> for<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.500> snail

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
wrapped around the same way for a snail

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.169 
wrapped around the same way for a snail
look<00:01:59.709> the<00:02:00.709> front<00:02:00.920> which<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.429> tend<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.819> call<00:02:02.000> the

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
look the front which I tend to call the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.760 
look the front which I tend to call the
door<00:02:02.360> for<00:02:02.689> lack<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:03.049> better<00:02:03.080> term<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.740> a

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
door for lack of a better term is a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.010 
door for lack of a better term is a
triangular<00:02:04.520> shaped<00:02:04.789> to<00:02:05.630> fit<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.899> opening

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
triangular shaped to fit the opening

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.139 
triangular shaped to fit the opening
it's<00:02:06.560> cut<00:02:06.920> from<00:02:07.099> a<00:02:07.220> piece<00:02:07.399> of<00:02:07.579> 1/8<00:02:07.849> inch

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it's cut from a piece of 1/8 inch

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.330 
it's cut from a piece of 1/8 inch
plywood<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.079> sized<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:09.829> it<00:02:09.920> was<00:02:10.039> one

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
plywood and I sized it so it was one

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.309 
plywood and I sized it so it was one
inch<00:02:10.489> smaller<00:02:10.880> than<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.209> opening<00:02:11.599> in<00:02:12.170> all

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
inch smaller than the opening in all

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.809 
inch smaller than the opening in all
directions<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:13.010> gives<00:02:13.310> us<00:02:13.430> enough

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
directions that gives us enough

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.210 
directions that gives us enough
clearance<00:02:14.150> for<00:02:14.299> mounting<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.799> front<00:02:16.069> is

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
clearance for mounting now the front is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.420 
clearance for mounting now the front is
very<00:02:16.400> thin<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.120> needed<00:02:17.329> to<00:02:17.739> make<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.799> frame<00:02:19.190> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
very thin so I needed to make a frame to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
very thin so I needed to make a frame to
stiffen<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.880> up<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.329> had<00:02:20.600> some<00:02:20.810> wood<00:02:21.019> on<00:02:21.049> hand

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
stiffen it up so I had some wood on hand

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.550 
stiffen it up so I had some wood on hand
which<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.829> rethought<00:02:22.549> down<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.810> about<00:02:24.109> 1/2<00:02:24.350> inch

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
which I rethought down to about 1/2 inch

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.090 
which I rethought down to about 1/2 inch
in<00:02:24.709> thickness<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.340> planed<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.790> smooth<00:02:27.100> it's

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
in thickness and planed it smooth it's

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.099 
in thickness and planed it smooth it's
three<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.850> half<00:02:28.970> inches<00:02:29.269> wide<00:02:29.299> which<00:02:29.959> is

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
three and a half inches wide which is

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.809 
three and a half inches wide which is
kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.590> an<00:02:30.709> arbitrary<00:02:30.859> number<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.730> for

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
kind of an arbitrary number just for

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:32.830 
kind of an arbitrary number just for
what<00:02:32.239> looks<00:02:32.420> good

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
what looks good

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.129 
what looks good
I<00:02:33.730> traced<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.880> corners<00:02:35.359> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.630> door<00:02:35.840> onto

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
I traced the corners of the door onto

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.620 
I traced the corners of the door onto
these<00:02:36.530> trim<00:02:37.340> pieces<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:37.970> cut<00:02:38.209> them<00:02:38.329> out<00:02:38.420> on

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
these trim pieces and cut them out on

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.720 
these trim pieces and cut them out on
the<00:02:38.720> bandsaw<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:41.139> fitted<00:02:42.139> it<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.549> glued<00:02:43.549> it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the bandsaw and fitted it and glued it

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.199 
the bandsaw and fitted it and glued it
into<00:02:44.090> place<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:46.250> took<00:02:46.639> a<00:02:46.760> couple<00:02:46.970> of

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
into place this took a couple of

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.879 
into place this took a couple of
sessions<00:02:47.630> because<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:48.079> course<00:02:48.290> nobody<00:02:48.709> has

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
sessions because of course nobody has

00:02:48.889 --> 00:03:14.539 
sessions because of course nobody has
enough<00:02:49.040> clamps<00:02:49.549> in<00:02:49.670> their<00:02:49.819> shop

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.190 

once<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.790> glue<00:03:15.939> is<00:03:16.150> dry<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.450> could<00:03:16.599> remove<00:03:17.019> all

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
once the glue is dry I could remove all

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.300 
once the glue is dry I could remove all
the<00:03:17.349> clamps<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:19.379> here's<00:03:20.379> the<00:03:20.590> resulting<00:03:21.099> door

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
the clamps and here's the resulting door

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.690 
the clamps and here's the resulting door
for<00:03:21.849> my<00:03:21.969> storage<00:03:22.269> card<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:23.519> sanded<00:03:24.519> everything

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
for my storage card I sanded everything

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.069 
for my storage card I sanded everything
down<00:03:25.659> to<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> nice<00:03:26.170> smooth<00:03:26.470> surface<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:30.959> then<00:03:31.959> I

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
down to a nice smooth surface and then I

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.390 
down to a nice smooth surface and then I
primed<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:33.010> painted<00:03:33.760> two<00:03:34.689> coats<00:03:34.720> on<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
primed and painted two coats on the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.369 
primed and painted two coats on the
front<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.879> did<00:03:37.120> not<00:03:37.239> bother<00:03:37.450> painting<00:03:38.079> the

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
front I did not bother painting the

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:46.259 
front I did not bother painting the
inside<00:03:38.859> of<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.159> cart<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:44.220> drilled<00:03:45.220> holes<00:03:45.489> for

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
inside of the cart I drilled holes for

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.839 
inside of the cart I drilled holes for
mounting<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:47.319> wheels<00:03:47.590> underneath<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.609> cart

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
mounting the wheels underneath the cart

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.059 
mounting the wheels underneath the cart
they<00:03:49.120> are<00:03:49.180> positioned<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.930> half<00:03:50.470> an<00:03:50.650> inch<00:03:50.829> from

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
they are positioned a half an inch from

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.890 
they are positioned a half an inch from
the<00:03:51.310> bottom<00:03:51.879> edge<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.480> can<00:03:52.599> drill

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
the bottom edge and you can drill

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.759 
the bottom edge and you can drill
through<00:03:53.430> both<00:03:54.430> at<00:03:54.879> once<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.569> then<00:03:55.900> mounted<00:03:56.590> it

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
through both at once and then mounted it

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.369 
through both at once and then mounted it
with<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:57.010> quarter<00:03:57.400> inch<00:03:57.430> bolt<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.989> probably

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
with a quarter inch bolt it's probably

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.960 
with a quarter inch bolt it's probably
overkill<00:04:02.799> but<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.069> just<00:04:03.310> used<00:04:03.549> all<00:04:03.730> eight

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
overkill but I just used all eight

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.369 
overkill but I just used all eight
wheels<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.510> I'd<00:04:04.629> salvaged<00:04:05.049> from<00:04:05.079> the

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
wheels that I'd salvaged from the

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:12.030 
wheels that I'd salvaged from the
rollerblades<00:04:10.139> here's<00:04:11.139> a<00:04:11.230> view<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.739> bottom

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
rollerblades here's a view of the bottom

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.379 
rollerblades here's a view of the bottom
of<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.250> cart<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.669> you<00:04:12.760> can<00:04:12.879> see<00:04:13.090> there's

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
of the cart and you can see there's

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.180 
of the cart and you can see there's
three<00:04:13.569> wheels<00:04:13.840> on<00:04:14.109> each<00:04:14.229> side<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:14.829> put<00:04:15.010> two

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
three wheels on each side and I put two

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.180 
three wheels on each side and I put two
in<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.400> middle<00:04:16.260> I'm<00:04:17.260> now<00:04:17.470> fitting<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.919> front

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
in the middle I'm now fitting the front

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.460 
in the middle I'm now fitting the front
into<00:04:18.459> place<00:04:18.669> on<00:04:18.909> the<00:04:19.060> cart<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.479> couple<00:04:20.380> of

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
into place on the cart a couple of

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.379 
into place on the cart a couple of
clamps<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.070> then<00:04:21.549> I'm<00:04:21.699> drilling<00:04:22.030> and

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
clamps and then I'm drilling and

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.450 
clamps and then I'm drilling and
screwing<00:04:22.599> it<00:04:22.990> into<00:04:23.139> position<00:04:23.320> I'm<00:04:23.830> careful<00:04:24.310> to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
screwing it into position I'm careful to

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.700 
screwing it into position I'm careful to
only<00:04:24.580> drill<00:04:25.120> where<00:04:25.780> there<00:04:25.960> is<00:04:26.110> thick<00:04:26.409> trim

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
only drill where there is thick trim

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.339 
only drill where there is thick trim
