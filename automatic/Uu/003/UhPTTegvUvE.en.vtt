00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.330
 so you're going to need a maton 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 so I took a Chinese baguette 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 different ribbon according to you 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.360
 choose the shape the color the size 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.419
 that's you who see so well 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.710
 obviously a pair of scissors of a 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.150
 little metal stuff for the task is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 so that's what we have with the wise 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.500
 and revelation of the glue and why 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.360
 not a silo to mark the places where 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.100
 you're going to have to cut off so you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.519
 take your ribbon you select this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 that you want so it's not the same 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.970
 the trouble of putting too much because the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.920
 cat will be distracted for as there 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.500
 will have too many ribbons he will know more about 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.190
 which one must jump after that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.320
 it's for you to see 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.260
 so I did not take any color 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 different from whites of blues a pink 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.420
 so win her a little too much so I 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.860
 will remove anyway so then 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.110
 you take your ribbon 1 to 1 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.549
 you always leave the same point and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.799
 you will start to give them 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.479
 size that you want so 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.100
 preferably better to make a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.619
 fishing rod with plenty of ribbon but 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.549
 different sizes 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.619
 this is where the scissors come into play 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.549
 to be able to give the size you 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.549
 want to your rubin 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.090
 then you take there you take the 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.770
 little tie so you detach one 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 or two after that depends on the stability 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.930
 that you give them to your at your 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.479
 fishing rod 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.250
 you form one is with and you 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.340
 start passing the ribbons one to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.690
 a turn of those that's what will 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.690
 allow a very solid attachment 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.670
 once you have put all your 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.340
 ribbon you just have to close 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.340
 twisting the two sides together 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.149
 so after you can always do 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.000
 readjustments as I do with the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.170
 scissors so that your fishing rod 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.180
 be more to your taste once all 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.340
 is well fixed we will come to take the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.099
 stick here for this case the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.470
 wand and we 'll come fix this 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.030
 small ties on the wand 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.880
 so to do that you start with the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.590
 position correctly and then with 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.660
 a piece of ribbon that you have left 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.269
 put glue on it so there you 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:43.500
 can you go there do not hurt 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:46.720
 story that it hangs well and you 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.930
 go and wrap it around 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.030
 so here it is a tricky step 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.980
 your time it has to be really 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.720
 really tight because when you 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.430
 go play with your cat that would be 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.750
 still kalapo beast first blow of 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.750
 paw all in mourning 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.640
 so for that 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.010
 really solid you will repeat 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.650
 the operation once twice 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.459
 three times that it really really 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.459
 hold properly 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.810
 so I apologize in advance the video is going 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.129
 cut because I 'm not going to 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.690
 battery so I had to finish 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.190
 to record the next day so here's the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.730
 final result so in fact what I 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.620
 is that I ironed a ribbon 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.349
 you see between the two between 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.700
 between the two big locks and then 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.140
 I stayed a long ribbon all 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.890
 around and for the end I have everything 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.079
 simply cut 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.069
 so that's what it gives after you 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.409
 see that there is still a lot 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.930
 more solid and move them leave them all 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.870
 just frozen it's like that so 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.890
 here is the toy is ready and that's it 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.680
 now you just have to leave 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.790
 your cat having fun with 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.650
 personally lehman has already eaten the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.819
 half of the movies is done for that so 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.440
 I hope this little building 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.010
 you will be pleased I tell you soon in 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.010
 a new video
