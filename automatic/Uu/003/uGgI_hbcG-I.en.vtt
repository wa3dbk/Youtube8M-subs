00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.710 
you to my English yeah and so what I did
was<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:16.330> decided<00:02:17.380> upon<00:02:18.730> different<00:02:19.730> proportions

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
was I decided upon different proportions

77<00:03:08.800> yeah<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.160> was<00:03:09.760> dead<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:16.800> what<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:17.830> did<00:03:18.130> when

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
77 yeah so I was dead so what I did when

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.520 
77 yeah so I was dead so what I did when
I<00:03:18.760> chose<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.390> second<00:03:19.720> power<00:03:19.870> slide<00:03:20.350> was<00:03:22.380> 219

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.520 

and<00:03:27.450> then<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:31.330> problem<00:03:31.570> then<00:03:31.930> becomes<00:03:32.080> with

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
and then the problem then becomes with

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.140 
and then the problem then becomes with
the<00:03:32.620> third<00:03:32.830> bar<00:03:33.040> slide<00:03:33.310> because<00:03:33.550> initially<00:03:33.910> a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the third bar slide because initially a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.190 
the third bar slide because initially a
commission<00:03:34.540> i<00:03:34.630> wanted<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.440> do<00:03:35.620> doing<00:03:36.130> for<00:03:36.400> 19th

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
commission i wanted to do doing for 19th

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.660 
commission i wanted to do doing for 19th
the<00:03:38.200> problem<00:03:38.590> Wiz<00:03:38.800> was<00:03:41.010> would<00:03:42.010> much<00:03:42.220> work<00:03:42.459> up

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
the problem Wiz was would much work up

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.290 
the problem Wiz was would much work up
my<00:03:42.820> news<00:03:43.030> report<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.700> ended<00:03:45.700> up<00:03:45.850> with<00:03:45.910> five

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
my news report so I ended up with five

00:03:46.300 --> 00:04:00.960 
my news report so I ended up with five
steps<00:03:46.750> 5<00:03:47.440> 19<00:03:47.890> steps

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.170 

so<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.800> then<00:04:03.800> of<00:04:04.430> course<00:04:04.520> I<00:04:05.180> need<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:07.180> valve

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
so and then of course I need a valve

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.740 
so and then of course I need a valve
that<00:04:08.510> has<00:04:08.780> no<00:04:08.990> only<00:04:09.580> 119<00:04:10.580> steps<00:04:10.910> out<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.480> is

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
that has no only 119 steps out of it is

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.510 
that has no only 119 steps out of it is

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.560 

know<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:21.739> reason<00:04:22.100> why<00:04:22.130> most<00:04:22.940> microtonal

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
know the reason why most microtonal

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
instruments topics have four miles is

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.180 
instruments topics have four miles is
that<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:28.280> lowest<00:04:29.410> interval<00:04:30.410> on<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.770> trumpet

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
that the lowest interval on the trumpet

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.360 
that the lowest interval on the trumpet
is<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.730> fifth<00:04:35.050> we<00:04:36.050> need<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:36.380> bridge<00:04:36.620> down<00:04:37.010> with

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
is a fifth we need to bridge down with

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.740 
is a fifth we need to bridge down with
enough<00:04:37.640> fingerings<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.890> there's<00:04:40.130> no<00:04:40.280> gap

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
enough fingerings so there's no gap

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:49.780 
enough fingerings so there's no gap
anywhere<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:48.320> actually<00:04:48.710> having<00:04:49.040> a<00:04:49.250> bit<00:04:49.580> more

of jumping on the from the third of our
slide<00:04:51.950> help<00:04:52.220> me<00:04:52.370> bridge<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:53.420> gap<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.800> i<00:04:54.830> could

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
slide help me bridge this gap so i could

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.390 
slide help me bridge this gap so i could
play<00:04:55.330> dramatically<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.570> 90<00:04:57.190> another<00:04:58.190> reason

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
play dramatically in 90 another reason

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.740 
play dramatically in 90 another reason
why<00:04:58.669> i<00:04:58.700> choose<00:04:58.940> these<00:04:59.180> features<00:04:59.600> these

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
why i choose these features these

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.920 
why i choose these features these
proportions<00:05:00.140> was<00:05:00.680> when<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:01.570> change<00:05:02.570> in<00:05:02.780> your

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
proportions was when you change in your

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.809 
proportions was when you change in your
instrument<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:04.130> first<00:05:04.370> thing<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.669> thing<00:05:04.730> is

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
instrument the first thing this thing is

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.420 
instrument the first thing this thing is
years<00:05:07.819> and<00:05:08.240> now<00:05:08.449> I'm<00:05:08.630> changing<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:10.220> could

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
years and now I'm changing it that could

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.339 
years and now I'm changing it that could
mean<00:05:10.610> different<00:05:11.150> fingering<00:05:11.810> different<00:05:12.229> ways

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
mean different fingering different ways

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.159 
mean different fingering different ways
to<00:05:12.530> blow<00:05:12.740> into<00:05:12.949> with<00:05:13.280> you<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.840> in<00:05:14.840> actual

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
to blow into with you in it in actual

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.650 
to blow into with you in it in actual
fact<00:05:15.259> I<00:05:15.800> chose<00:05:16.490> these<00:05:16.699> proportions<00:05:17.120> because

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
fact I chose these proportions because

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.999 
fact I chose these proportions because
the<00:05:18.199> fingerings<00:05:19.150> divisional<00:05:20.150> trumpet<00:05:21.009> very

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
the fingerings divisional trumpet very

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.480 
the fingerings divisional trumpet very
much<00:05:22.220> based<00:05:22.460> on<00:05:22.750> normal<00:05:23.750> standard<00:05:24.490> bystander

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
much based on normal standard bystander

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.890 
much based on normal standard bystander
trumpet<00:05:25.819> fingerings<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:26.870> when<00:05:27.289> I<00:05:27.560> play<00:05:28.810> when<00:05:29.810> I

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
trumpet fingerings so when I play when I

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.059 
trumpet fingerings so when I play when I
played<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:30.289> flats<00:05:30.560> Oh<00:05:31.569> case<00:05:32.569> the<00:05:33.440> I<00:05:33.830> use<00:05:34.039> a

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
played the flats Oh case the I use a

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:50.589 
played the flats Oh case the I use a
normal<00:05:34.340> thing<00:05:34.699> being<00:05:34.940> across<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.870> 119th<00:05:49.599> and

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
normal thing being across the 119th and

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.290 
normal thing being across the 119th and
then<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.259> Sharks<00:05:51.740> all<00:05:52.009> having<00:05:52.610> normal<00:05:52.880> sharp

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
then the Sharks all having normal sharp

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.180 
then the Sharks all having normal sharp
fingerings<00:05:53.780> and<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.110> normal<00:05:54.440> notes<00:05:54.710> natural

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
fingerings and the normal notes natural

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.159 
fingerings and the normal notes natural
notes<00:05:55.370> have<00:05:55.639> not<00:05:55.940> met<00:05:56.210> normal<00:05:56.750> natural

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
notes have not met normal natural

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.089 
notes have not met normal natural
fingerings<00:05:58.030> that<00:05:59.030> meant<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.659> could<00:06:00.169> practice

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
fingerings that meant I could practice

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.760 
fingerings that meant I could practice
very<00:06:01.639> quickly<00:06:01.940> on<00:06:02.300> this<00:06:02.449> instrument<00:06:02.810> from<00:06:03.560> a

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
very quickly on this instrument from a

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.070 
very quickly on this instrument from a
technical<00:06:04.520> point<00:06:04.789> of<00:06:04.970> view<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.389> did<00:06:05.900> have<00:06:06.050> to

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
technical point of view I did have to

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.589 
technical point of view I did have to
learn<00:06:06.319> to<00:06:06.440> really<00:06:06.710> extra<00:06:07.190> fingerings<00:06:08.030> you

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
learn to really extra fingerings you

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.200 
learn to really extra fingerings you
might<00:06:08.810> think<00:06:09.050> why<00:06:09.500> did<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:09.860> choose<00:06:10.130> 19<00:06:10.789> you

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
might think why did you choose 19 you

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.700 
might think why did you choose 19 you
know<00:06:11.270> when<00:06:11.570> you<00:06:11.719> choose<00:06:11.960> 20<00:06:12.530> or<00:06:12.680> 18<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:14.710> quick

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
know when you choose 20 or 18 and quick

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.580 
know when you choose 20 or 18 and quick
answer<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.310> that<00:06:16.550> originally<00:06:17.509> we<00:06:18.139> were<00:06:18.259> part

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
answer is that originally we were part

instrument<00:06:31.970> that<00:06:32.000> they<00:06:32.210> could<00:06:32.420> convert

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
instrument that they could convert

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:47.800 
instrument that they could convert
between<00:06:32.990> 12<00:06:35.680> 2014<00:06:36.680> division<00:06:37.130> and<00:06:46.330> a<00:06:47.330> practical

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
between 12 2014 division and a practical

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.830 
between 12 2014 division and a practical
solution<00:06:48.550> that<00:06:49.550> didn't<00:06:49.880> cost<00:06:50.030> three<00:06:50.330> thousand

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
solution that didn't cost three thousand

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.710 
solution that didn't cost three thousand
powers<00:06:51.080> to<00:06:51.500> build<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.740> new<00:06:51.770> instrument<00:06:52.600> can<00:06:53.600> you

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
powers to build a new instrument can you

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.720 
powers to build a new instrument can you
guess<00:06:53.990> how<00:06:54.350> much<00:06:54.530> it<00:06:54.590> costs<00:06:55.010> to<00:06:55.130> convert<00:06:55.580> this

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
guess how much it costs to convert this

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.450 
guess how much it costs to convert this
instrument<00:06:57.730> so<00:06:59.410> hows<00:07:00.410> about<00:07:00.740> it<00:07:00.950> and<00:07:01.160> it<00:07:01.250> cost

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
instrument so hows about it and it cost

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.640 
instrument so hows about it and it cost
me<00:07:01.580> two<00:07:01.940> hundred<00:07:02.000> euros<00:07:02.720> for<00:07:03.260> all<00:07:03.470> these

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
me two hundred euros for all these

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.550 
me two hundred euros for all these
lights<00:07:04.070> and<00:07:04.460> the<00:07:04.790> mouth<00:07:05.000> another<00:07:05.900> 200<00:07:06.410> for<00:07:06.530> the

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
lights and the mouth another 200 for the

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.980 
lights and the mouth another 200 for the
quarter<00:07:06.920> turn<00:07:07.100> so<00:07:07.580> I<00:07:07.640> had<00:07:07.790> a<00:07:07.820> very<00:07:08.000> quick<00:07:08.360> it

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
quarter turn so I had a very quick it

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.620 
quarter turn so I had a very quick it
was<00:07:09.110> good<00:07:09.260> it<00:07:09.290> possible<00:07:09.710> exactly<00:07:10.670> skimp<00:07:11.450> and

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
was good it possible exactly skimp and

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:19.360 
was good it possible exactly skimp and
then<00:07:11.840> I<00:07:12.080> just<00:07:12.890> play<00:07:16.360> again
