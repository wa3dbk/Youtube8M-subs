00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.730 
that crap so now he goes a desiccant I
know<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.890> can't<00:01:44.340> oko<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.140> solar<00:01:46.409> beam

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
know I can't oko it with the solar beam

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.249 
know I can't oko it with the solar beam
but<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.189> thinking<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.729> might<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> lot<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
but I was thinking it might do a lot but

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.160 
but I was thinking it might do a lot but
see<00:01:49.740> how<00:01:49.920> much<00:01:50.130> does<00:01:50.579> did<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> much

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
see how much does did then do that much

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.170 
see how much does did then do that much
actually<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.610> he's<00:01:53.820> running

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
actually and I don't think he's running

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.940 
actually and I don't think he's running
Mac<00:01:54.360> special<00:01:54.869> defense<00:01:55.170> simply<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:55.680> he

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
Mac special defense simply because he

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.850 
Mac special defense simply because he
has<00:01:56.070> he<00:01:56.430> showed<00:01:56.670> me<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.000> call<00:01:57.390> mind<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
has he showed me that call mind but the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
has he showed me that call mind but the
adesso<00:01:59.189> cons<00:01:59.460> his<00:01:59.670> pro<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
adesso cons his pro so I go for the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.380 
adesso cons his pro so I go for the
solar<00:02:01.200> beam<00:02:01.500> again<00:02:01.829> doesn't<00:02:02.790> quite<00:02:02.969> knock<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
solar beam again doesn't quite knock it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
solar beam again doesn't quite knock it
out<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.719> he<00:02:03.869> goes<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.320> shadow<00:02:04.590> bomb<00:02:04.799> like

play<00:02:23.350> on<00:02:23.470> his<00:02:23.620> part<00:02:23.740> so<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.970> solar<00:02:25.240> beam<00:02:25.480> will

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
play on his part so the solar beam will

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.500 
play on his part so the solar beam will
now<00:02:25.960> destroy<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.920> desk<00:02:27.250> an<00:02:27.610> even<00:02:28.210> though<00:02:28.330> he

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
now destroy the desk an even though he

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.500 
now destroy the desk an even though he
has<00:02:28.630> plus<00:02:28.960> two<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:30.000> now<00:02:31.000> he's<00:02:31.210> going<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.420> go

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
has plus two and now he's going to go

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.930 
has plus two and now he's going to go
into<00:02:31.660> his<00:02:31.900> Infernape<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:33.310> only<00:02:33.460> move<00:02:33.820> I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
into his Infernape and the only move I

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.270 
into his Infernape and the only move I
can<00:02:34.120> hit<00:02:34.270> him<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> sludge<00:02:35.290> bomb<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.130> knew

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
can hit him is a sludge bomb and I knew

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.550 
can hit him is a sludge bomb and I knew
probably<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.940> won't<00:02:37.150> kill<00:02:37.540> even<00:02:37.960> though<00:02:38.110> i<00:02:38.140> am

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
probably it won't kill even though i am

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.520 
probably it won't kill even though i am

but<00:02:42.190> he<00:02:42.490> goes<00:02:42.670> me<00:02:42.790> more<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.030> flare<00:02:43.270> blitz<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
but he goes me more the flare blitz and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.420 
but he goes me more the flare blitz and
he<00:02:44.020> actually<00:02:44.140> lives<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.680> recoil<00:02:45.130> which<00:02:45.280> is

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
he actually lives the recoil which is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.700 
he actually lives the recoil which is
perfect<00:02:45.970> for<00:02:46.060> me<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.570> i<00:02:46.600> can<00:02:46.690> set<00:02:47.200> up<00:02:47.350> with<00:02:47.530> my

Hitmonlee go to my hitman lee now go for

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.770 
Hitmonlee go to my hitman lee now go for
the<00:02:50.440> indoor<00:02:50.830> cuz<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.000> new<00:02:52.180> unburden

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
the indoor cuz this is the new unburden

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.370 
the indoor cuz this is the new unburden
Hitmonlee<00:02:53.400> well<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.760> ability<00:02:55.210> unburden<00:02:55.720> what

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
Hitmonlee well the ability unburden what

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.880 
Hitmonlee well the ability unburden what
does<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.100> use<00:02:57.400> your<00:02:57.750> item<00:02:58.750> then<00:02:59.680> your

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
does if you use your item then your

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.510 
does if you use your item then your
speed<00:03:00.280> gets<00:03:00.550> doubled<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.570> get<00:03:01.870> up<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.470> 1<00:03:03.130> HP

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
speed gets doubled so I get up to 1 HP

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.210 
speed gets doubled so I get up to 1 HP
get<00:03:04.000> my<00:03:04.180> lychee<00:03:04.450> berry<00:03:04.780> going<00:03:05.200> on<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.590> now<00:03:06.190> I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
have that burden boost so I go from his

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.950 
have that burden boost so I go from his
last<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> reversal<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.780> pretty

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
last for a reversal so that is pretty

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.130 
last for a reversal so that is pretty
