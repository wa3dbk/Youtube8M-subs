you<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:11.190> best<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.599> show

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you it's best if you do a show

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.470 
you it's best if you do a show
clip<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.220> video<00:02:14.370> first<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:15.120> make<00:02:15.239> sure<00:02:15.300> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
clip of a video first to make sure it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.080 
clip of a video first to make sure it's
working<00:02:15.870> because<00:02:16.409> with<00:02:16.590> tohko<00:02:17.099> train<00:02:17.430> we

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
working because with tohko train we

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.509 
working because with tohko train we
discovered<00:02:18.540> very<00:02:18.810> quickly<00:02:19.159> that<00:02:20.159> we<00:02:20.340> had<00:02:20.459> a

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
discovered very quickly that we had a

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.940 
discovered very quickly that we had a
black<00:02:20.730> screen<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.900> didn't<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.319> anything<00:02:22.560> but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
black screen we didn't have anything but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.559 
black screen we didn't have anything but
a<00:02:22.980> black<00:02:23.310> screen<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.760> had<00:02:23.849> audio<00:02:24.209> but<00:02:24.480> we

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
a black screen we had audio but we

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.869 
a black screen we had audio but we
didn't<00:02:24.780> have<00:02:24.870> video<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.220> happens

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
didn't have video so if that happens

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.600 
didn't have video so if that happens
there's<00:02:27.120> some<00:02:27.450> instances<00:02:28.170> where<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.860> need<00:02:29.129> to

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
there's some instances where you need to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
there's some instances where you need to
change<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.299> capture<00:02:30.810> method<00:02:31.200> from<00:02:31.379> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
change this capture method from the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.970 
change this capture method from the
direct<00:02:31.950> axis<00:02:32.400> which<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.819> actually<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.480> better

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
direct axis which is actually a better

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940 
direct axis which is actually a better
quality<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.790> screen<00:02:36.269> capture<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.110> doesn't

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
quality to screen capture it doesn't

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.130 
quality to screen capture it doesn't
work<00:02:38.099> quite<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:38.370> fast<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.660> get<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
work quite as fast but you get the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.610 
work quite as fast but you get the
screen<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.640> has<00:02:41.849> pretty<00:02:42.090> important<00:02:42.690> anyhow

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
screen so it has pretty important anyhow

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.490 
screen so it has pretty important anyhow
let<00:02:44.129> me<00:02:44.250> show<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.459> once<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.970> did<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.690> just

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
let me show you once I did that I just

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:58.160 
let me show you once I did that I just
very<00:02:46.890> quickly<00:02:47.250> went<00:02:47.670> into<00:02:47.910> toca<00:02:48.269> train<00:02:57.170> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
very quickly went into toca train and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.750 
very quickly went into toca train and
this<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.620> where<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:58.829> would<00:02:59.069> have<00:02:59.160> started<00:02:59.489> my

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
this is where I would have started my

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.330 
this is where I would have started my
voice<00:02:59.940> over<00:03:00.359> for<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.750> video<00:03:01.019> where<00:03:01.950> we<00:03:02.129> took

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
voice over for that video where we took

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.240 
voice over for that video where we took
you<00:03:02.579> into<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.239> full<00:03:03.599> app<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.620> showed<00:03:05.010> you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
you into the full app and showed you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:15.170 
you into the full app and showed you
exactly<00:03:05.489> what<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.239> were<00:03:06.359> doing<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.940> if<00:03:15.060> you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
exactly what we were doing and if you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.300 
exactly what we were doing and if you
saw<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.480> video<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.349> is<00:03:16.560> exactly<00:03:16.920> what<00:03:17.280> you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
saw that video this is exactly what you

saw that video this is exactly what you
saw<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.049> manipulate<00:03:19.319> this<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.310> whole

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
saw and we can manipulate this a whole

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.620 
saw and we can manipulate this a whole
360<00:03:21.980> we<00:03:22.980> can<00:03:23.160> actually<00:03:23.609> look<00:03:23.790> down<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.389> the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
360 we can actually look down on the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:35.170 
360 we can actually look down on the
train

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.539 

and<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:36.230> were<00:03:36.349> seeing<00:03:36.620> exactly<00:03:36.980> what<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.310> am

made<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.579> video<00:03:41.469> for<00:03:42.469> toppa<00:03:42.799> train<00:03:43.069> review

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
made the video for toppa train review

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.380 
made the video for toppa train review
which<00:03:44.689> you<00:03:44.840> can<00:03:44.989> see<00:03:45.019> on<00:03:45.439> the<00:03:45.739> website<00:03:45.950> whoa<00:03:46.489> I

which you can see on the website whoa I
didn't<00:03:47.959> have<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.200> perspective<00:03:48.469> they're<00:03:48.950> real

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
didn't have the perspective they're real

didn't have the perspective they're real
good<00:03:49.519> did<00:03:49.969> I<00:03:57.159> and<00:03:58.900> it's<00:03:59.900> capturing<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:02.060> screen

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
good did I and it's capturing the screen

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.679 
good did I and it's capturing the screen
is<00:04:02.780> capturing<00:04:03.409> the<00:04:03.920> audio<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:05.120> app<00:04:05.269> and

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
is capturing the audio of the app and

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.509 
is capturing the audio of the app and
it's<00:04:06.129> capturing<00:04:07.129> my<00:04:07.459> voice<00:04:09.040> now<00:04:10.040> if<00:04:10.340> we<00:04:10.370> go

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
it's capturing my voice now if we go

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:19.330 
it's capturing my voice now if we go
back<00:04:10.849> to<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.849> display<00:04:14.389> recorder<00:04:17.949> you<00:04:18.949> again

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
back to the display recorder you again

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.069 
back to the display recorder you again
see<00:04:19.759> the<00:04:19.940> part<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.449> would<00:04:20.690> be<00:04:20.810> clipping

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
see the part that I would be clipping

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.339 
see the part that I would be clipping
off<00:04:21.380> at<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.650> end<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:22.009> the<00:04:22.130> video<00:04:23.050> what<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.080> would

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
off at the end of the video what I would

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.890 
off at the end of the video what I would
be<00:04:24.380> doing<00:04:24.500> now<00:04:25.009> is<00:04:25.370> tapping<00:04:25.970> on<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.419> glowing

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
be doing now is tapping on that glowing

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.350 
be doing now is tapping on that glowing
red<00:04:27.380> button<00:04:28.220> on<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.490> lower<00:04:28.849> left<00:04:31.090> just<00:04:32.090> stop

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
red button on the lower left just stop

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.640 
red button on the lower left just stop
the<00:04:32.599> recording<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:34.180> then<00:04:35.320> hit<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.440> black

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
the recording and then hit the black

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.200 
the recording and then hit the black
button<00:04:36.680> that's<00:04:37.370> on<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.610> other<00:04:37.639> end<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.150> that

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
button that's on the other end of that

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.779 
button that's on the other end of that
bar<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.380> will<00:04:39.590> merge<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.250> but<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.490> can't

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
bar and that will merge it but I can't

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.140 
bar and that will merge it but I can't
do<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.180> without<00:04:41.780> stopping<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:42.979> video<00:04:43.310> so

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
do that without stopping this video so

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.750 
do that without stopping this video so
that<00:04:44.539> is<00:04:44.720> exactly<00:04:45.080> what<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.770> would<00:04:45.889> do<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.580> what

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
that is exactly what I would do and what

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.870 
that is exactly what I would do and what
I<00:04:46.789> did<00:04:47.120> do<00:04:47.389> for<00:04:48.169> making<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.860> toca<00:04:49.250> train<00:04:49.490> video

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
I did do for making the toca train video

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.270 
I did do for making the toca train video
for<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.199> wasn't<00:04:51.650> crackling

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
for you so that it wasn't crackling

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.730 
for you so that it wasn't crackling
snapping<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:52.970> popping<00:04:53.510> like<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.380> was<00:04:54.560> before

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
snapping and popping like it was before

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.129
