 just tight on he dreamed of rank 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:48.280
 General Reds Mist is such a title 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.329
 meant high honor and past glory 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.760
 also characteristic leadership skills 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.189
 battle scored by the bloodiest 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.019

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:05.710
 but there was one problem to his swift 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.100
 take off the career ladder more than once 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.590
 contributed to the fact that he 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 it cost nothing to behead your 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.580

 at times 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.490
 a seven year old company on a 1000 swamp he 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 distinguished bloody battle is not about the star 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.920
 his glories 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:53.190
 shone even brighter while the number 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.190
 his associates invariably declined 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.760
 fight the battle bulls became 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 less and less 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.550
 day by day the angle got smaller and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.660
 less but axx didn't care how 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:39.510
 real fan belle fury hall 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.920
 in battle he overshadowed his mind with blood 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.920
 that directed and 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.690
 on the night of the greatest victory he proclaimed 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:39.270
 yourself a general red fog rank 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.680
 whom he also gave he took the highest 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.100
 title after that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.100
 but where did it just 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.420
 however, in his squad now 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:04.570
 It was not on any of the war, many soldiers 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:07.740
 enemies were defeated but also from AGS blade 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.520
 killed no less 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:16.390
 however after such fights 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.880
 the ax could have broken but despair not 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:24.340
 took on 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.970

 former 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.010
 For books, friends are worth saying that 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.950
 most soldiers 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.950
 would not have gone under his banner 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:46.020
 I think it's not worth it because of this 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.000
 in no way worries for him 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:53.380
 the main thing is that he can always 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.380
 rely only on your strength dear 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.140

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.780
 because at the end you are waiting for small jokes 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.100
