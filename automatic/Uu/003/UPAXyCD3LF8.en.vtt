right<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.530> now<00:03:25.650> we're<00:03:25.950> into<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.550> guess<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
right and so now we're into I guess the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.130 
right and so now we're into I guess the
the<00:03:27.720> 2022<00:03:28.350> one<00:03:28.769> which<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.930> not

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the 2022 one which you know it's not

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.190 
the 2022 one which you know it's not
really<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> qualifiers<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.690> codicil

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
really the qualifiers but the codicil

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.320 
really the qualifiers but the codicil
involves<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.890> same<00:03:35.100> teams<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.090> guess

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
involves the same teams and I guess

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.850 
involves the same teams and I guess
obviously<00:03:36.750> if<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.900> win<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.500> obviously

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
obviously if you win this it obviously

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.949 
obviously if you win this it obviously
gives<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.610> bit<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.180> seating<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.720> bit<00:03:39.870> of

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
gives you a bit of seating a bit of

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.040 
gives you a bit of seating a bit of
ranking<00:03:40.320> obviously<00:03:40.680> going<00:03:40.950> into<00:03:41.450> will<00:03:42.450> t20

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
ranking obviously going into will t20

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.660 
ranking obviously going into will t20
qualifying<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.830> stuff<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.580> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
qualifying and stuff like that so the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.180 
qualifying and stuff like that so the
first<00:03:44.880> game<00:03:45.260> against<00:03:46.260> Kenya<00:03:46.560> we<00:03:46.680> won<00:03:46.860> by<00:03:46.980> 8

which<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.110> think<00:04:10.500> by<00:04:10.739> quite<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.250> big<00:04:11.459> margin

which I think by quite a big margin

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.289 
which I think by quite a big margin
especially<00:04:12.150> for<00:04:12.299> 2020<00:04:13.010> by<00:04:14.010> 37<00:04:14.700> runs<00:04:14.820> boring

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299
