00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699 

and<00:00:00.089> the<00:00:00.480> last<00:00:00.690> bit<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.170> fun<00:00:01.350> bit<00:00:01.530> goes

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
and the last bit the fun bit goes

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.070 
and the last bit the fun bit goes
appears<00:00:04.940> roughly<00:00:05.940> again<00:00:06.600> I'll<00:00:06.690> slow<00:00:06.930> this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
appears roughly again I'll slow this

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.419 
appears roughly again I'll slow this
down<00:00:07.140> there's<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> bit<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.799> weird<00:00:08.010> bit<00:00:08.189> it

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
down there's a bit of a weird bit it

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.040 
down there's a bit of a weird bit it
seems<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.730> bit<00:00:08.760> odd<00:00:08.910> when<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.330> play<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.719> slowly

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
seems a bit odd when you play it slowly

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.459 
seems a bit odd when you play it slowly
but<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.679> definitely<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.610> he<00:00:11.849> did<00:00:12.630> so

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
but this is definitely what he did so

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.790 
but this is definitely what he did so
it's<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:13.799> three<00:00:14.219> note<00:00:14.400> per<00:00:14.429> string<00:00:14.580> patterns

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
it's all three note per string patterns

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.920 
it's all three note per string patterns
but<00:00:16.800> using<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.460> slightly<00:00:18.180> different<00:00:18.330> one<00:00:18.750> than

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
but using a slightly different one than

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.599 
but using a slightly different one than
the<00:00:19.050> typical<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.859> there's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.160> harmonic<00:00:20.580> minor

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the typical so there's a harmonic minor

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.160 
the typical so there's a harmonic minor
scale<00:00:21.240> kind<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.140> shape<00:00:26.960> alright<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
scale kind of a shape alright so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.500 
scale kind of a shape alright so
starting<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> ninth<00:00:29.189> fret<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> second

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
starting on the ninth fret of the second

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.089 
starting on the ninth fret of the second
string<00:00:30.539> you'll<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> bit<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> stretching<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
string you'll do a bit of a stretching a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.910 
string you'll do a bit of a stretching a
nine<00:00:32.369> 12<00:00:32.790> 13<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.590> string

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
nine 12 13 and then on the first string

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.630 
nine 12 13 and then on the first string
10<00:00:38.550> 11<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.540> 13<00:00:43.040> that's<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.460> little

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
10 11 and 13 that's a good little

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
10 11 and 13 that's a good little
stretch<00:00:45.000> good<00:00:45.270> workout<00:00:45.750> anyway

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.920 

and<00:00:50.580> that's<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.880> all<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.060> first<00:00:51.270> babies

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.090 

just<00:00:54.930> straight<00:00:55.200> up<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.500> down<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.740> pattern

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
just straight up and down that pattern

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.070 
just straight up and down that pattern
okay<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.600> third<00:00:57.750> stream

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
okay then you go to the third stream

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.270 
okay then you go to the third stream
what<00:00:58.260> you're<00:00:58.380> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> actually<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
what you're going to do is actually a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
what you're going to do is actually a
duplicate<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> note<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.630> just<00:01:00.809> played

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
duplicate of the note you just played

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.080 
duplicate of the note you just played
before

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
before

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
before
sounds<00:01:03.090> exactly<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> same<00:01:03.720> music<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.250> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
sounds exactly the same music so this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.109 
sounds exactly the same music so this
part<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.140> where<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.290> got<00:01:07.380> 13<00:01:07.920> 12<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.180> 10<00:01:11.119> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
part is where we got 13 12 and 10 and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.430 
part is where we got 13 12 and 10 and
well<00:01:12.479> basically<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.930> shape<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.290> gonna

we've<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> first<00:01:34.320> six<00:01:34.920> note<00:01:35.100> music<00:01:38.210> okay

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
we've got the first six note music okay

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.810 
we've got the first six note music okay
then<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> next<00:01:40.440> part<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.830> break<00:01:41.039> it<00:01:41.190> down<00:01:41.220> goes

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.710 

in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> shape<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.330> just<00:01:48.509> talked<00:01:48.690> about

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
in the shape that we just talked about

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.219 
in the shape that we just talked about
so<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.479> sequence<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> notes

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so it is a little sequence of notes

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.139 
so it is a little sequence of notes
starting<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.310> 13th<00:01:53.640> fret<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:53.940> third

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
starting on the 13th fret of the third

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.630 
starting on the 13th fret of the third
string<00:01:54.179> so<00:01:56.300> 1<00:01:57.300> 2<00:01:57.450> 3<00:01:57.479> 4<00:01:57.929> then<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
string so 1 2 3 4 then you go to the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.370 
string so 1 2 3 4 then you go to the
12th<00:02:00.000> fret<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.360> 3rd<00:02:00.660> string<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.259> go
