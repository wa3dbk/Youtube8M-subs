00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
just for that time period to put them

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.530 
just for that time period to put them
out<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:38.340> that's<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.819> unless<00:03:39.359> they

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
out and then that's it unless they

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.539 
out and then that's it unless they
decide<00:03:39.900> you're<00:03:40.079> we<00:03:40.259> up<00:03:40.409> the<00:03:40.859> licensing<00:03:41.430> which
