00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.680

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.600
 ace 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.150
 a supervised dish you never have to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.840
 single 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.540
 you are ready for the party line yes i am 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.500
 finishing combing I had to use 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.380
 a lot of water to achieve it but you know only 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.380
 I hope this time is not 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.380
 sponge 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:00.620
 full lot well you know that the boom 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.620
 Ludwig van Beethoven mean nothing 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.940
 so you see there's nothing that you 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.940
 bother truth 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.290
 just as I thought it is being cut 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.750
 administrations I'm going to give my aunt 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.370
 a birthday card maybe like that 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.370
 I forgot that I did not do the homework 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.740
 mathematics how can you come to think 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.360
 something like that is that I was always interested in 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.720
 anything the noble the subject 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.720
 'charlie brown' 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 stupid dog how is he going to remember 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.320
 where he buried that bone I did not 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.320
 I would worry about him 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.080
 you had been meditating because you were not 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.160
 I think I served you, you look the same 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.110
 that before I am new in this is always 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.060
 I think you're happy because you feel 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.940
 happy all the time good actually 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.370
 feeling sad is also being happy 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.530
 sadness is part of happiness if you 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 you feel sad sometimes so you're 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.370
 happy forever 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.770
 forget it 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.709
 I am bad meditating, I always stay 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.709
 asleep 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.060
 you know you confuse me a lot and I do not know 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.700
 why I'm bordering on you I've done 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.040
 nice things for you I have tried to be the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.730
 person that I think you like but not 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.840
 you react, you do not do anything, you tell me nothing 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.269
 I talk to you and you do not even answer sometimes 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.810
 I feel like you do not know what exists in this 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.810
 world 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.970
