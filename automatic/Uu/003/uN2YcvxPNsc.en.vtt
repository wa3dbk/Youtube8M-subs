about<00:00:13.559> clay<00:00:13.889> polish<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.730> want<00:00:15.209> to<00:00:15.270> show<00:00:15.480> you

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
about clay polish I want to show you

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.130 
about clay polish I want to show you
what<00:00:16.110> this<00:00:16.320> does<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.160> how<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.420> get<00:00:18.660> some

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
what this does and how you can get some

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.400 
what this does and how you can get some
really<00:00:19.440> good<00:00:19.740> results<00:00:20.369> using<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:21.990> clay

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
really good results using that now clay

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.829 
really good results using that now clay
polish<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.039> not<00:00:23.099> necessarily<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.179> dynamesh

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
polish is not necessarily a dynamesh

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.009 
polish is not necessarily a dynamesh
feature<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.910> turn<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.210> model<00:00:27.539> off<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
feature you can turn your model off and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.210 
feature you can turn your model off and
still<00:00:28.619> use<00:00:29.150> clay<00:00:30.150> polish<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.890> would<00:00:32.099> be

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
still use clay polish this would be

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.550 
still use clay polish this would be
accessible<00:00:32.759> no<00:00:33.240> matter<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> has

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
accessible no matter what but it has

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.850 
accessible no matter what but it has
value<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.120> dynamesh<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.620> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
value here with dynamesh because if you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590 
value here with dynamesh because if you
have<00:00:38.100> dynamesh<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.300> click<00:00:39.480> this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
have dynamesh on and you click this

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.459 
have dynamesh on and you click this
little<00:00:39.809> button<00:00:39.989> auto<00:00:41.149> polish<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:42.989> every

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
little button auto polish then every

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.410 
little button auto polish then every
time<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.859> control<00:00:44.219> click<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.640> drag<00:00:44.879> it'll

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
time you control click and drag it'll

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.470 
time you control click and drag it'll
rebuild<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.000> that's<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.359> help

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
rebuild this and that's going to help

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.619 
rebuild this and that's going to help
you<00:00:48.780> establish<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.710> certain<00:00:50.129> planar<00:00:50.640> quality

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you establish a certain planar quality

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
you establish a certain planar quality
to<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.109> how<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.769> get<00:00:52.980> control<00:00:53.460> over

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to it but how do you get control over

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
to it but how do you get control over
what's<00:00:54.390> being<00:00:54.629> built<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.800> by<00:00:56.489> default<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
what's being built so by default it

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.650 
what's being built so by default it
starts<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:57.929> edge<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.379> zero<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.539> that's<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
starts with an edge of zero and that's a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680 
starts with an edge of zero and that's a
little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:01.019> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.589> soft<00:01:01.890> side<00:01:02.370> edge<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.420> zero

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
little bit on the soft side edge of zero

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410 
little bit on the soft side edge of zero
plus<00:01:04.110> actually<00:01:04.620> let's<00:01:05.160> set<00:01:05.370> it<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.880> total

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
plus actually let's set it to total

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
plus actually let's set it to total
default<00:01:06.750> settings<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.650> max<00:01:08.070> curvature<00:01:08.880> will

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
default settings your max curvature will

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
default settings your max curvature will
be<00:01:09.060> 25<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.190> that's<00:01:11.550> quite<00:01:11.970> soft<00:01:12.740> but

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
be 25 and so there that's quite soft but

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
be 25 and so there that's quite soft but
let's<00:01:13.950> break<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.940> talk<00:01:15.180> about<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
let's break this down and talk about the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
let's break this down and talk about the
features<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.800> set<00:01:16.980> edge<00:01:17.160> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
features I'm going to set edge to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.660 
features I'm going to set edge to
negative<00:01:18.060> 10<00:01:18.530> control<00:01:19.530> click<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.130> drag<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
negative 10 control click and drag and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.710 
negative 10 control click and drag and
what<00:01:21.420> you'll<00:01:21.660> notice<00:01:21.690> is<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.720> points

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
what you'll notice is that the points

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.500 
what you'll notice is that the points
where<00:01:24.870> the<00:01:25.020> curve<00:01:25.760> changed<00:01:26.760> those<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.480> a

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
where the curve changed those get a

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.720 
where the curve changed those get a
little<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:28.080> harder<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.250> everything

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
little bit harder and then everything

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.900 
little bit harder and then everything
else<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.120> kind<00:01:30.690> of<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.870> little<00:01:31.200> soft<00:01:31.560> okay<00:01:32.580> and

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
else is kind of a little soft okay and

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.910 
else is kind of a little soft okay and
this<00:01:33.330> is<00:01:33.510> in<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.930> particular<00:01:34.230> case<00:01:34.620> that's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
this is in this particular case that's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
this is in this particular case that's
actually<00:01:35.160> quite<00:01:35.850> nice<00:01:36.120> because<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.780> has

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
actually quite nice because it has

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.260 
actually quite nice because it has
almost<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:38.190> almost<00:01:38.340> gives<00:01:38.520> me<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.790> skin

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
almost a it almost gives me that skin

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.110 
almost a it almost gives me that skin
quality<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> lot<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> stuff<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.940> free

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
quality so I get a lot of stuff for free

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.880 
quality so I get a lot of stuff for free
and<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.750> way<00:01:42.870> you<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.230> think<00:01:43.380> about<00:01:43.500> clay

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and the way you want to think about clay

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.760 
and the way you want to think about clay
polish<00:01:44.370> is<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:45.300> way<00:01:45.480> a<00:01:45.510> traditional<00:01:46.050> sculptor

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
polish is the way a traditional sculptor

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.540 
polish is the way a traditional sculptor
will<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.310> let's<00:01:48.270> say<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> torch<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:48.990> melt<00:01:49.550> clay

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
will use let's say a torch to melt clay

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.530 
will use let's say a torch to melt clay
into<00:01:51.120> kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> skin<00:01:52.680> shape<00:01:53.550> so

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
into kind of more of a skin shape so

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.140 
into kind of more of a skin shape so
edge<00:01:54.870> to<00:01:55.470> negative<00:01:55.830> 10<00:01:56.040> has<00:01:56.430> some<00:01:56.670> value<00:01:57.000> what

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
edge to negative 10 has some value what

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.590 
edge to negative 10 has some value what
happens<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.660> hit<00:01:57.780> edge<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.800> 10<00:01:59.600> okay

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
happens if you hit edge to 10 okay

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.760 
happens if you hit edge to 10 okay
instead<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.840> pulling<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:04.230> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
instead of it kind of pulling out and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.479 
instead of it kind of pulling out and
the<00:02:05.370> form<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> becoming<00:02:06.680> rounder<00:02:07.680> it's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the form kind of becoming rounder it's

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.430 
the form kind of becoming rounder it's
actually<00:02:09.000> done<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> inverse<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.259> now

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
actually done the inverse and it's now

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.339 
actually done the inverse and it's now
starting<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.099> push<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.450> that's<00:02:13.049> pretty

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
starting to push in and that's pretty

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.570 
starting to push in and that's pretty
cool<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.340> has<00:02:14.849> some<00:02:15.120> value<00:02:15.659> for

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
cool because that has some value for

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.820 
cool because that has some value for
kind<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:17.000> say<00:02:17.570> creating<00:02:17.990> some<00:02:18.200> Peaks

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
kind of really say creating some Peaks

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.810 
kind of really say creating some Peaks
really<00:02:19.610> strong<00:02:20.000> Peaks<00:02:20.540> really<00:02:21.290> strong

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
really strong Peaks really strong

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.320 
really strong Peaks really strong
valleys<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.060> hence<00:02:23.600> really<00:02:24.590> planar

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
valleys and hence really planar

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.950 
valleys and hence really planar
structure<00:02:26.380> okay<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.680> could<00:02:27.920> be<00:02:28.100> valuable

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
structure okay so that could be valuable

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.290 
structure okay so that could be valuable
but<00:02:29.960> can<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.290> modify<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.460> little<00:02:32.000> bit

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
but can you modify this a little bit

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.830 
but can you modify this a little bit
let's<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.380> drop<00:02:33.740> this<00:02:34.040> down<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.760> then<00:02:35.600> come

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
let's just drop this down and then come

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.480 
let's just drop this down and then come
over<00:02:36.050> here<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.380> try<00:02:36.740> another<00:02:37.100> something<00:02:37.340> to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
over here and try another something to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.360 
over here and try another something to
undo<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.510> what<00:02:39.260> happens<00:02:39.590> if<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.770> set<00:02:39.980> max

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
undo and what happens if I set max

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.310 
undo and what happens if I set max
curvature<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.090> 90<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.930> do<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> same<00:02:42.800> thing

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
curvature to 90 and do the same thing

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.570 
curvature to 90 and do the same thing
notice<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> little<00:02:45.830> bit<00:02:45.950> softer

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
notice that it's a little bit softer

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.090 
notice that it's a little bit softer
because<00:02:46.760> max<00:02:47.360> curvature<00:02:47.990> now<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.410> going<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.920> be

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
because max curvature now is going to be

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.410 
because max curvature now is going to be
taking<00:02:49.490> into<00:02:49.640> account<00:02:50.080> more<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.800> model<00:02:52.420> so

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
taking into account more of the model so

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.750 
taking into account more of the model so
it's<00:02:53.570> not<00:02:53.690> going<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.930> be<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.470> militant<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.400> just

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
it's not going to be so militant in just

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.000 
it's not going to be so militant in just
a<00:02:55.940> couple<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.480> areas<00:02:56.930> it's<00:02:57.350> going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.620> take

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
a couple of areas it's going to take

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.949 
a couple of areas it's going to take
into<00:02:58.280> account<00:02:58.490> more<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.360> curvature<00:02:59.840> and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
into account more of the curvature and

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.010 
into account more of the curvature and
really<00:03:00.500> give<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.830> nice<00:03:01.100> soft<00:03:02.020> round

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
really give you a nice soft round

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.260 
really give you a nice soft round
quality<00:03:04.480> watch<00:03:05.480> what<00:03:05.690> happens<00:03:07.000> when<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:08.150> do

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
quality watch what happens when we do

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.430 
quality watch what happens when we do
the<00:03:08.390> same<00:03:08.570> thing<00:03:08.810> but<00:03:08.959> we<00:03:09.080> set<00:03:09.260> edge

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
the same thing but we set edge

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.490 
the same thing but we set edge
smoothness<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.100> negative<00:03:11.090> 10<00:03:11.350> let's<00:03:12.350> just

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
smoothness to negative 10 let's just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.140 
smoothness to negative 10 let's just
return<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.010> 25<00:03:13.459> get<00:03:13.850> our<00:03:14.000> base<00:03:15.790> okay<00:03:16.790> there

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
return it to 25 get our base okay there

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.850 
return it to 25 get our base okay there
we<00:03:17.300> go

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
we go

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.880 
we go
now<00:03:19.030> we're<00:03:20.030> going<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.180> undo<00:03:20.410> set<00:03:21.410> our<00:03:21.560> max

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
now we're going to undo set our max

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.610 
now we're going to undo set our max
curvature<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:23.019> 90<00:03:24.019> control<00:03:24.800> click<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:25.730> drag

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
curvature to 90 control click and drag

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.090 
curvature to 90 control click and drag
all<00:03:27.620> right<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:27.920> we're<00:03:28.730> polishing<00:03:29.330> more<00:03:30.080> of<00:03:30.380> the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
all right so we're polishing more of the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.580 
all right so we're polishing more of the
of<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.790> angle<00:03:32.269> angle<00:03:33.080> arity<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.470> is

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
of the angle angle arity and this is

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.290 
of the angle angle arity and this is
really<00:03:33.800> creating<00:03:34.310> more<00:03:34.489> angularity<00:03:35.150> than

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
really creating more angularity than

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.030 
really creating more angularity than
what<00:03:35.450> we<00:03:35.570> have<00:03:35.750> over<00:03:36.019> here<00:03:36.500> where<00:03:36.709> it's<00:03:36.830> just

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
what we have over here where it's just

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.030 
what we have over here where it's just
soft<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.600> this<00:03:39.500> can<00:03:39.739> really<00:03:40.040> help<00:03:40.250> us<00:03:42.040> plane

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
soft so this can really help us plane

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.670 
soft so this can really help us plane
the<00:03:43.310> model<00:03:43.670> really<00:03:44.150> help<00:03:44.360> us<00:03:44.480> see<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.260> forms

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
the model really help us see the forms

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.300 
the model really help us see the forms
and<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:47.120> can<00:03:47.269> be<00:03:47.360> just<00:03:47.480> part<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.989> our

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
and this can be just part of our

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.610 
and this can be just part of our
building<00:03:49.310> process<00:03:50.120> part<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.870> where<00:03:51.200> we<00:03:51.500> are

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
building process part of where we are

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.949 
building process part of where we are
starting<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.160> define<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:53.090> decide<00:03:53.420> planes

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
starting to define and decide planes

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.729 
starting to define and decide planes
this<00:03:54.709> is<00:03:55.010> actually<00:03:55.580> intended<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.959> be<00:03:57.140> part<00:03:57.470> of

this is actually intended to be part of

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.060 
this is actually intended to be part of
your<00:03:57.950> sculpting<00:03:58.600> process<00:03:59.620> when<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.709> just<00:04:00.860> go

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
your sculpting process when you just go

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.070 
your sculpting process when you just go
in<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.370> start<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.670> define<00:04:02.090> well<00:04:02.480> then<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.870> can

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
in and start to define well then I can

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.490 
in and start to define well then I can
say<00:04:03.980> go<00:04:04.820> into<00:04:04.940> Damien<00:04:05.480> standard<00:04:05.959> brush<00:04:06.230> and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
say go into Damien standard brush and

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.460 
say go into Damien standard brush and
