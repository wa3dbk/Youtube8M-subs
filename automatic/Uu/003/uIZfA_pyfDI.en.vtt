00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.340 

for<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.610> bit<00:03:45.880> i<00:03:45.910> think<00:03:46.090> they<00:03:46.570> should<00:03:46.780> you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
for that bit i think they should you

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.690 
for that bit i think they should you
should<00:03:47.380> put<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.630> sensitivity<00:03:49.630> on<00:03:49.660> now<00:03:51.960> slow

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
should put the sensitivity on now slow

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:06.900 
should put the sensitivity on now slow
options<00:03:55.740> so<00:03:56.740> its<00:03:56.890> ability<00:03:57.900> no<00:03:58.900> not<00:03:59.170> Hollow<00:03:59.380> no

the<00:04:54.510> solenoid<00:04:58.850> just<00:04:59.850> follow<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.210> little

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
the solenoid just follow that little

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.500 
the solenoid just follow that little
skull<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:01.500> they<00:05:01.620> sure<00:05:01.680> like<00:05:02.120> when<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.270> die

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
watch everything days and then you

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:16.340 
watch everything days and then you
typically<00:05:06.000> get<00:05:06.450> there<00:05:06.690> like<00:05:06.930> this

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.340

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
couple of times I kind of I'm gender

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:30.629 
couple of times I kind of I'm gender
pressure<00:05:22.920> like<00:05:23.340> this

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.040

there we did it you must fell right

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.850 
there we did it you must fell right
through<00:05:35.110> just<00:05:35.590> jump<00:05:36.219> onto<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:37.590> then<00:05:38.590> on

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
through just jump onto that and then on

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.689 
through just jump onto that and then on
to<00:05:39.189> that<00:05:39.430> yeah<00:05:40.409> and<00:05:41.409> then<00:05:41.770> on<00:05:42.009> to<00:05:42.219> this<00:05:42.430> one

to that yeah and then on to this one

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:55.510 
to that yeah and then on to this one
here<00:05:43.949> with<00:05:44.949> all<00:05:45.129> these<00:05:45.279> fears<00:05:45.639> are<00:05:45.789> working
