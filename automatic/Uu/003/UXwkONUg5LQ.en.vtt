or<00:02:35.530> build<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.890> or<00:02:36.099> anything<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:36.730> goes

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
or build up or anything it just goes

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300 
or build up or anything it just goes
back<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.329> like<00:02:37.660> soft<00:02:38.109> texture<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.220> think

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
back to like soft texture so I think

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.530
