00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello and welcome to the live 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.560
 test of novelties from the mouth patrice 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.480
 assortment as you can see i have 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.450
 I decided for three new particles 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.820
 and once an eyeshadow then 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.820
 once a mascara and once invites 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.650
 I've got the eyeshadow mascara 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 I've got myself up and in the plus 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.369
 sounds too 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.160
 and that should be enough for me 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.930
 today want Hesse knows her for you 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.000
 see there are no pallets or doing 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 like just do my 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 basic range did not like 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.739
 or 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.719
 these colors are already enough 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.690
 that's why you have these three 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.950
 Here we start with the products 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.559
 eyeshadow that one of many nine 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:51.809
 Months continent are a beautiful 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 color that is such a former whole 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.329
 really great for the blue eyes than that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.879
 blue also correct power to the validity 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.049
 I have blue-gray eyes therefore the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.240
 color 630 window partie and a whole 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.640
 great color her equal in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.200
 Although the swatch has many different features 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 once top first spot rhone base 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.030
 the second station is also my base 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.030
 Swatch though on the food sign of state 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.530
 swatch on a white which was that 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.899
 and the fanbase is the color art of 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 and in the live chat the whole thing like that 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.900
 I look out of my eyes at mine 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.490
 isle of stage user 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.120
 and on the right also finished city 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.980
 no best use 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.710
 You see, I think the picture is shadow 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.370
 very courageous if you are also at the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.300
 Brush off the belt in the order he is yes 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.220
 actually pretty nice hardly and advertise 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.670
 one sees intends despite this trick the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.670
 I personally think 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.610
 he can be distributed very nicely nothing 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.610
 to complain 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.530
 I have a layer again 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.310
 long designed so just crass 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.310
 comes into effect 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.459
 and for the other eyes here is no 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.670
 mushroom or I have no best 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.200
 and here too I will be two layers 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.980
 build up so you can see if it's optical 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.840
 there or not 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.540
 I can not tell you 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.510
 understand the only difference again 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.879
 in the eye shadow whether for me 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.159
 I rather general no problem with 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.419
 That's why we do it 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.419
 with me no difference 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.950
 secondly I would very much like the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:11.360
 new native letters to crash imagines 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.040
 and finally there is a fiber mascara 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.090
 with German market resp 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.920
 again a fiber mascara I am 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.260
 a big fan of fiber that know yes 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.269
 at the latest after my scenes with the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.890
 flamingo mascara love i have and 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.930
 extend the passenger 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.359
 However, I have to say somehow 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.489
 I do not like that one here at the 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.680
 sausage stand short so far 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.030
 unspectacular in my opinion and 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.859
 I can not do the fibers at first 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.599
 the chains so look the order 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.030
 is the first layer in the order 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.650
 I wear these rulers as well 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:54.579
 how can I apply that to everything 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.579
 root to be pulled up 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.860
 I also think here you do not see that 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.200
 So they own the eyelashes 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.010
 just like everyone else in the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.040
 first shift 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.940
 there is not really as volume find 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.659
 I personally 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.180
 it extends ok but that can 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.350
 Other mascara can do such a thing 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.360
 second layer I thought okay 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.790
 now the fibers came into force 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.380
 but again I have to say 20 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.770
 but you do not sow your swing without being shortened 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.270
 from big clack extension find 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.700
 i also see nothing here and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.950
 which other mascara 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.960
 I see that much more of that 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.430
 I saved my trainer 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.860
 that his club will last show me 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.230
 let you have one with me personally 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.910
 Do not get rid of the lipstick fan 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.100
 and judy tossell it with me too 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:01.830
 borderline live a very nice color 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.009
 new and shine masts in fresh 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.189
 lip gloss 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.960
 which is quite interesting applicator he 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:12.470
 is easy 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.090
 strip first broken rich with that 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.130
 a little as you can see 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.500
 what the order really quite 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:26.000
 Slimming in the spot it looks quite like this 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.980
 yes it is in my opinion so one 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.550
 can i really say speechtek is 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.950
 is definitely nude that we recognize 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.000
 and on my lips is natural 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.150
 not so the best colored but there 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.820
 that too 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.360
 still ok it is not quite like that 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.360
 Well 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.060
 that just does not look that great and 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.590
 from the actual color is for the 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.840
 I would then find nothing more man 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.889
 get a nice shine 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.490
 the lips will of course still one 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.490
 tick lighter 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.810
 that would be the whole overall concept finished 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.190
 made up and with a very strict 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.889
 back so that you also what counts and 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.630
 I put off the hair and time 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.889
 then i hope i made fun and 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.139
 found interesting 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.919
 and then I'm looking forward to the next one 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.919
 see you soon
