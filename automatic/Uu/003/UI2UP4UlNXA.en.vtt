00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 because of rock'n'roll 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.280
 Every step is hard for him every step 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.120
 move a qual 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.130
 Elvis really has a big problem 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 because the cat was neatly fattened 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.670
 Now his disease list settled 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.350
 like a medicine book diabetes osteoarthritis 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.580
 Obesity is a few years ago 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.039
 the hangover ever at the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.930
 Tierschutzverein landed at that time 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.580
 the animal rights activists the animal of 14 on 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 slimmed down nine kilos and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:43.920
 he is back again 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:46.739
 thicker than send 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 so via as sad as much to eat 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.000
 of course, the hangover must be on first 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 the scales 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.309
 The question is rather fat because he is ill 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 is he or is he so sick because he is fat 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.789
 is veterinarian leonie long wants 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.789
 find out 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 and then I took blood to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 check how are they now 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.369
 Sugar also long-term sugar value 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.170
 taken to look at is he 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.540
 set correctly you can then 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.070
 What is his overweight improvement? 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.210
 maybe also of organic causes 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.280
 obviously it has the ex-owner 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.710
 already elvis with feeding tremendous 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960
 not exaggerated the first case in the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.909
 veterinary practice age the think the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.600
 animals animal what good that think that 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.920
 animal is hungry 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.649
 they do not understand that this is not 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.840
 saturation and then it happens 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.610
 fast that the fed after the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.480
 keepers who see that from one 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.420
 certain time no longer 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.550
 her cat is so thick now where elvis 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.220
 transitional at katrin hess bridge 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.560
 only when he is on his own 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.810
 scratching tree is coming for him a new one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.810
 wanted at home and that may take
