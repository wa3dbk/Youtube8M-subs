00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.270
 good welcome to another video tutorial 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.879
 here in tablacoms and sheet music puntocom 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.910
 today let's go with a great song 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.550
 enormous of the cheico maestro feliciano who 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.520
 the mouse calls the chords are very 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.740
 singles we divide it into two parts 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.260
 chorus verse and a bridge between 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.180
 between the two then let's see the 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.180
 chords that we will use are the minor 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.280
 2 7a 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.670
 without major 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.019
 yes 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.710
 hello sharp as you prefer to call it 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.640
 do not 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 OK so 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 Y 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 Y 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.420
 we add a small bass to the beginning 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.420
 what would this do 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.200
 0 2 4 on the sixth string and it would be 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.200
 this way 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.570
 or that on the bridge does the following 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.570
 make 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.830
 it would be a the least an easy 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.830
 and a major 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.050
 and the chorus 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.590
 makes the minor re minor and my greatest 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.590
 I remember in this way 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.519
 then we are going to do a review of the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.519
 whole song that would stay like that 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.549
 here that with the right hand we would do what 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.150
 next we would do the bass of each 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.389
 chord ok and then 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.200
 we pull up with the index finger 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:41.650
 and when going down multi let the strings remain 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.650
 A) Yes 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.920
 Y
