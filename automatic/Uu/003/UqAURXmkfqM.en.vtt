there is also a newer model so often due

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.430 
there is also a newer model so often due
to<00:00:32.850> videos<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> know<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.350> make

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to videos because you know I can make

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.229 
to videos because you know I can make
them<00:00:34.559> look<00:00:34.680> different<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.790> also<00:00:36.000> I'm

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
them look different and then also I'm

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.370 
them look different and then also I'm
going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.480> trying<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> truck<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
going to be trying to do a truck like a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.979 
going to be trying to do a truck like a
pickup<00:00:37.680> truck<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.129> something<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.090> let's<00:00:39.809> get

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
pickup truck or something so let's get

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.750 
pickup truck or something so let's get
right<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:40.170> pimping<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.800> vehicle<00:00:41.219> now<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
right into pimping this vehicle now I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.880 
right into pimping this vehicle now I
believe<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:42.660> trucks<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.140> isn't<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.500> much

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
believe for trucks there isn't that much

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.819 
believe for trucks there isn't that much
to<00:00:44.100> change<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.840> body<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> vehicle

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to change on the body of the vehicle

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.220 
to change on the body of the vehicle
itself<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.520> obviously<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.329> color<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.079> like

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
itself but obviously I can color it like

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.750 
itself but obviously I can color it like
every<00:00:49.440> other<00:00:49.500> car<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.010> let's<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.550> into

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
every other car so let's get right into

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.340 
every other car so let's get right into
it

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
it
now<00:00:52.350> we'll<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.649> full<00:00:52.829> armor<00:00:53.100> upgrades<00:00:53.489> full

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
now we'll get full armor upgrades full

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.139 
now we'll get full armor upgrades full
brakes<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.460> bumpers<00:00:56.969> on

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
brakes and now we can have bumpers on

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.920 
brakes and now we can have bumpers on
here<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> couple<00:00:57.840> different

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
here so there's a couple different

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.360 
here so there's a couple different
choices<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.500> bumper<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.920> let's<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.190> through

into all I'll add that on there never
get<00:01:33.840> full<00:01:33.990> engine<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> vehicle<00:01:34.890> is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
get full engine because this vehicle is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.210 
get full engine because this vehicle is
pretty<00:01:35.520> slow<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> custom<00:01:37.200> exhaust<00:01:37.320> pretty

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
pretty slow and custom exhaust pretty

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.920 
pretty slow and custom exhaust pretty
much<00:01:38.400> makes<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.790> from<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.030> single<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> double

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
much makes it from a single to a double

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.870 
much makes it from a single to a double
exhaust<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.829> yeah<00:01:41.009> let's<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.430> double

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
exhaust so yeah let's go with a double

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.179 
exhaust so yeah let's go with a double
exhaust<00:01:42.240> why<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.560> horn<00:01:43.860> let's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
exhaust why not all right horn let's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:54.940 
exhaust why not all right horn let's
listen<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:45.210> horns

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.120 

I<00:01:56.350> think<00:01:57.350> for<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.590> one<00:01:57.649> I'm<00:01:57.860> gonna<00:01:57.950> go<00:01:58.100> with

I think for this one I'm gonna go with

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.770 
I think for this one I'm gonna go with
horn<00:01:58.460> number<00:01:58.700> five<00:01:58.939> now<00:01:59.149> lights<00:01:59.450> are<00:01:59.630> always

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
horn number five now lights are always

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.270 
horn number five now lights are always
xenon<00:02:00.289> if<00:02:00.469> you've<00:02:00.590> seen<00:02:00.799> any<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.039> my<00:02:01.189> other

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
xenon if you've seen any of my other

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.039 
xenon if you've seen any of my other
episodes<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:02.329> one's<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.659> clear<00:02:02.869> choice

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
episodes that one's a clear choice

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.569 
episodes that one's a clear choice
