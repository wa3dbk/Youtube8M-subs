play them and find the one that speaks
to<00:02:03.200> them<00:02:03.350> exactly<00:02:03.800> that's<00:02:04.400> what<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.700> want<00:02:04.910> to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
to them exactly that's what you want to

to them exactly that's what you want to
do<00:02:05.090> with<00:02:05.240> these<00:02:05.360> because<00:02:05.540> this<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.960> old-school

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
do with these because this is old-school

man very very cool

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.870 
man very very cool
so<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.960> started<00:02:09.350> off<00:02:09.470> making<00:02:09.740> just<00:02:10.160> 15-inch

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
so we started off making just 15-inch

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.570 
so we started off making just 15-inch
high<00:02:11.060> hat<00:02:11.330> prototypes<00:02:11.930> because<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.400> kind

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
high hat prototypes because this is kind

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.810 
high hat prototypes because this is kind

written all over it that sounds like the
older<00:02:40.850> hi-hat<00:02:41.330> sound<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.930> guys<00:02:42.110> are<00:02:42.350> looking

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
older hi-hat sound the guys are looking

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
about side effects there are high hats

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.699 
about side effects there are high hats
and<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.360> said<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> top<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.560> way

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
and you said that the top is what way

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.650 
and you said that the top is what way
it's<00:02:49.100> thin<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.520> medium<00:02:49.850> thin<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.390> in<00:02:50.570> the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
it's thin the medium thin and in the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.840 
it's thin the medium thin and in the
bottoms<00:02:50.930> are<00:02:51.050> medium<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.310> we'll<00:02:52.430> move<00:02:52.550> on<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
bottoms are medium so we'll move on to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.400 
bottoms are medium so we'll move on to
the<00:02:52.970> 14s<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:53.780> one<00:02:53.870> thing<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.050> want<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.230> point

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
the 14s but one thing I want to point

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.130 
the 14s but one thing I want to point
out<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.709> each<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.760> models<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.780> know<00:02:56.900> when

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
out is each of the models you know when

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.020 
out is each of the models you know when
we<00:02:57.260> were<00:02:57.380> doing<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.739> cup<00:02:57.980> shape<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.610> cups<00:02:58.850> on

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
we were doing the cup shape the cups on

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.420 
we were doing the cup shape the cups on
the<00:02:59.060> 15s<00:02:59.570> are<00:02:59.660> bigger<00:02:59.840> than<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.140> 14<00:03:00.620> which

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
the 15s are bigger than the 14 which

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.100 
the 15s are bigger than the 14 which
when<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:01.940> look<00:03:02.120> at<00:03:02.239> regular<00:03:02.570> Zildjian<00:03:02.959> high

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
when you look at regular Zildjian high

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.560 
when you look at regular Zildjian high
hats<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.470> cup<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.980> same<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:05.030> we<00:03:05.209> really

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
hats the cup is the same so we really

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.460 
hats the cup is the same so we really
kind<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.739> know<00:03:07.000> shape<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.600> cup<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.230> voice

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
kind of you know shape the cup to voice

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.770 
kind of you know shape the cup to voice
the<00:03:09.769> symbol<00:03:10.190> for<00:03:10.730> what<00:03:10.910> we<00:03:11.090> knew<00:03:11.299> that<00:03:11.630> it

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
the symbol for what we knew that it

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.449 
the symbol for what we knew that it
needed<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.049> do<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> difference<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
needed to do so in the difference in the

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.160 
needed to do so in the difference in the
cup<00:03:13.670> what<00:03:13.910> does<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.120> do<00:03:14.360> between<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.900> two

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
cup what does that do between the two

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.500 
cup what does that do between the two
cymbal<00:03:15.500> sizes<00:03:15.860> well<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.580> larger<00:03:17.090> cup<00:03:17.299> is<00:03:17.390> going

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
cymbal sizes well a larger cup is going

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.150 
cymbal sizes well a larger cup is going
to<00:03:17.570> give<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.810> little<00:03:17.989> bit<00:03:18.200> more<00:03:18.410> volume<00:03:18.769> and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
to give you a little bit more volume and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.630 
to give you a little bit more volume and
in<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.970> 15<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:21.080> know<00:03:21.200> they<00:03:21.380> tend<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.920> be<00:03:22.100> lower

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
in a 15 you know they tend to be lower

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.910 
in a 15 you know they tend to be lower
in<00:03:22.760> pitch<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.750> we<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.200> shape<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.709> little

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
in pitch so we we shape this a little

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.770 
in pitch so we we shape this a little
bit<00:03:25.130> higher<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.670> we're<00:03:26.390> going<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.660> get<00:03:26.750> a

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
bit higher and we're going to get a

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.289 
bit higher and we're going to get a
little<00:03:26.900> bit<00:03:27.110> more<00:03:27.230> highs<00:03:27.470> out<00:03:27.739> of<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:32.150> is

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
little bit more highs out of it that is

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.110 
little bit more highs out of it that is
a<00:03:32.329> great<00:03:32.570> sounding<00:03:33.170> set<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.470> hats<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.760> over

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
a great sounding set of hats so over

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.900 
a great sounding set of hats so over
here<00:03:35.269> we<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.709> 18s<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.769> 19's<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.670> these

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
here we have 18s and 19's and these

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.729 
here we have 18s and 19's and these
would<00:03:38.120> be<00:03:38.209> considered<00:03:38.750> like<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:39.230> heavy

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
would be considered like a heavy

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.060 
would be considered like a heavy
paper-thin<00:03:40.280> or<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.810> really<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.650> know<00:03:42.680> light

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
paper-thin or a really you know light

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.210 
paper-thin or a really you know light
thin<00:03:43.549> style<00:03:44.360> cymbal<00:03:44.870> now<00:03:45.440> we're<00:03:45.739> not<00:03:45.860> calling

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
thin style cymbal now we're not calling

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.090 
thin style cymbal now we're not calling
them<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.549> crash<00:03:47.060> but<00:03:47.810> these<00:03:48.019> sizes<00:03:48.290> generally

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
them a crash but these sizes generally

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.130 
them a crash but these sizes generally
lend<00:03:49.549> themselves<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.030> being<00:03:50.120> crashes<00:03:50.840> but<00:03:50.989> I'm

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
lend themselves to being crashes but I'm

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.000 
lend themselves to being crashes but I'm
gonna<00:03:51.320> ride<00:03:51.530> them

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
gonna ride them

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.190 
gonna ride them
so<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.310> can<00:03:52.489> hear
