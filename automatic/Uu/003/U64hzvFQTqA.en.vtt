00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.630
 a great leap from paternÃ² to messina is 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.720
 the goal is to continue as you have finished 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.609
 with a brace and greeted his 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.289
 old fans in the best way that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.980
 these two words go to heaven 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.980
 it would be really nice 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.700
 win at cost if you score or not 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.860
 it matters because why here when the group 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.860
 count the ultimate goal is definitely 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.020
 on a personal level I am happy that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 which I did in paternÃ² I hope to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.330
 continue to win messina well 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.340
 because the goal is the one there together 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.560
 to the arch deacon that to the cosenza but also 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.630
 along with tiscione if one of the players 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.820
 more considered, some consider 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.830
 even the best player of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.720
 this championship 6 similar as 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.700
 features to them there are a 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.680
 outside an outside of attack the outside 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.110
 in midfield I can adapt, let's say 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.690
 in the midfield areas and attack a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 right or left 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.180
 then the coach will decide 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.009
 all these praise 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.740
 make me make me happy but i know 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.990
 well then I will have to demonstrate in the field 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 I am a very humble person 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 I mount my head rather for me when 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.990
 things are good time to work 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.149
 even more and to do the skin again 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.369
 you have always scored very 9 goals 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.350
 this year often in double figures in 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.740
 previous seasons yet you will find here 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.600
 too much competition as I said in 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.380
 precedence to competition must be 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.720
 healthy in a team that strives for 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.060
 win the championship 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.800
 and this competition is normal 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.550
 and the important thing is that there is always the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.780
 respect with my companions and then I can't 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.780
 that I can only learn 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.250
 people like a crown so i am a 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.260
 their complete disposition because here 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.850
 there is a fantastic group they have me 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.740
 welcomed very well I can only 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 thank them excluding the latter 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.290
 Messina championship almost always 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.510
 lost 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.760
 if nothing else he got to know 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.350
 also an audience a facility that 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.350
 surely they are not a series of no 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.410
 coming to Messina is always an opponent 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.410
 of course always and always a bad one 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.330
 what because you know that it meets a 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.450
 great fans of a team that 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.930
 naturally he will struggle he will fight to win 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.820
 the championship and so I hope you will 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.410
 the stadium is always filled with more and 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.430
 give him this satisfaction from these 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.110
 fans 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.810
 what is the first impact with Catalan i 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.670
 new companions learn about the queen tones though 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.980
 I know the coach I knew of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.390
 presence but I have had the opportunity to speak 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.450
 with him it seems like a person 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.650
 very prepared and therefore 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.420
 I hope that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.420
 I hope to return his trust
