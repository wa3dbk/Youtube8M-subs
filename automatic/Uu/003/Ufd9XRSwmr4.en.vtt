Depot all right now we're gonna build
this<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.370> iPhone<00:03:34.610> simulator<00:03:35.090> see<00:03:36.019> you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
this on this iPhone simulator see you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:44.230 
this on this iPhone simulator see you
later<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:38.209> let's<00:03:38.450> run<00:03:38.660> this<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:43.519> you

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
later and let's run this and you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.410 
later and let's run this and you
see<00:03:44.390> we<00:03:44.510> have<00:03:44.690> this<00:03:44.900> blue<00:03:45.460> UI<00:03:46.460> navigation<00:03:46.640> bar

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
see we have this blue UI navigation bar

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.900 
see we have this blue UI navigation bar
right<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.130> even<00:03:49.130> when<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.400> hit<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.640> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
right here and even when you hit it and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.950 
right here and even when you hit it and
you<00:03:49.940> go<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:51.200> second<00:03:51.710> page<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.250> dumb<00:03:53.180> comes

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
you go to this second page it dumb comes

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.170 
you go to this second page it dumb comes
to<00:03:54.110> there<00:03:54.320> because<00:03:55.190> if<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.550> look<00:03:55.700> at<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:55.910> flip

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
to there because if we look at this flip

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.490 
to there because if we look at this flip
side<00:03:57.610> here<00:03:58.610> it's<00:03:59.680> think<00:04:00.680> it's<00:04:00.830> in<00:04:00.980> here<00:04:01.310> I

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
side here it's think it's in here I

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.590 
side here it's think it's in here I
don't<00:04:03.500> know<00:04:03.680> where<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.950> code<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:05.030> at<00:04:05.270> some

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
don't know where the code is but at some

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.300 
don't know where the code is but at some
point<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.610> imports<00:04:07.610> these<00:04:08.240> files<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.960> so<00:04:09.740> um

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
point it imports these files and so um

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.500 
point it imports these files and so um
this<00:04:11.180> viewdidload<00:04:12.310> stuff<00:04:13.310> well<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:14.120> can<00:04:14.300> use

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
this viewdidload stuff well you can use

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.979 
this viewdidload stuff well you can use
this<00:04:14.690> stuff<00:04:15.020> in<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.790> flip<00:04:17.690> side<00:04:17.959> view

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
this stuff in the flip side view

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:18.699 
this stuff in the flip side view
controller

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
you go into the simulator and we look at

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.070 
you go into the simulator and we look at
this<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:54.500> can<00:04:54.680> see<00:04:54.920> that<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.280> have<00:04:55.520> this<00:04:56.390> ugly

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
add our button lick here or here let's

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.270 
add our button lick here or here let's
say<00:05:09.170> we<00:05:09.320> make<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.530> like<00:05:09.920> I<00:05:11.170> normally<00:05:12.170> guess<00:05:13.130> you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
say we make it like I normally guess you

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.030 
say we make it like I normally guess you
would<00:05:13.460> have<00:05:13.490> that<00:05:13.820> there<00:05:14.240> um<00:05:16.900> sorry<00:05:18.040> didn't

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040

yeah alright and let's say you had
another<00:05:24.590> one<00:05:24.710> here<00:05:24.920> that<00:05:25.010> says<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:27.100> menu<00:05:28.780> if

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
another one here that says like menu if

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.880 
another one here that says like menu if
we<00:05:30.620> build<00:05:31.040> this<00:05:32.170> you<00:05:33.170> can<00:05:33.290> see<00:05:33.470> these<00:05:33.620> look

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
we build this you can see these look

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.400 
we build this you can see these look
really<00:05:34.340> ugly<00:05:34.730> so<00:05:35.720> you<00:05:35.750> don't<00:05:35.990> really<00:05:36.140> want

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
that and so the next twirl I'll help

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.250 
that and so the next twirl I'll help
show<00:05:40.670> you<00:05:40.730> how<00:05:40.910> to<00:05:40.970> make<00:05:41.180> one<00:05:41.720> of<00:05:41.840> those<00:05:41.930> for
