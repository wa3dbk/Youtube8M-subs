00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
surprising actually because I was

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.220 
surprising actually because I was
pounding<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.490> Zerg<00:00:29.699> around<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:31.050> don't

well<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:38.160> been<00:00:38.460> hearing<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> lot<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
well I have been hearing a lot of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.310 
well I have been hearing a lot of
complaints<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.960> they

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
complaints about that is that they

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.080 
complaints about that is that they
aren't<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.770> good<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.309> people<00:00:41.579> thought<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
aren't as good what people thought and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.130 
aren't as good what people thought and
they<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:42.809> no<00:00:42.930> good<00:00:43.399> or<00:00:44.399> effective<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.660> taking

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
they are no good or effective at taking

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.700 
they are no good or effective at taking
ground<00:00:46.500> support<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.570> tank<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> truck<00:00:49.260> I'll

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
ground support or tank as a truck I'll

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.979 
ground support or tank as a truck I'll
show<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.309> exact<00:00:50.640> opposite<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.390> taken<00:00:51.870> out

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
show you the exact opposite I taken out

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
show you the exact opposite I taken out
some<00:00:52.170> ground<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.280> take<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> few

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
some ground I think I take out a few

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.110 
some ground I think I take out a few
troops<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.930> take<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.949> some<00:00:56.309> fellow<00:00:56.850> Jets

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
troops and I take out some fellow Jets

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
troops and I take out some fellow Jets
as<00:00:57.270> well<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.199> something<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> look

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
as well so it's something to look

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
as well so it's something to look
forward<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.879> gameplay

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
forward to and it's all in one gameplay

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.060 
forward to and it's all in one gameplay
which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.109> very<00:01:01.410> surprising<00:01:01.800> because

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
which is very surprising because

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.940 
which is very surprising because
I<00:01:03.130> managed<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.150> wrap<00:01:04.300> over<00:01:04.659> 20<00:01:04.930> kills<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.409> assume

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
I managed to wrap over 20 kills I assume

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.810 
I managed to wrap over 20 kills I assume
and<00:01:06.600> over<00:01:07.600> 7k<00:01:07.960> points<00:01:08.800> i<00:01:09.040> say<00:01:09.280> assume<00:01:09.610> because

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
and over 7k points i say assume because

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.270 
and over 7k points i say assume because
the<00:01:10.690> game<00:01:10.870> actually<00:01:11.050> crashed<00:01:11.590> long<00:01:11.979> story

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the game actually crashed long story

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.660 
the game actually crashed long story
short<00:01:12.640> i<00:01:13.380> run<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.530> memory<00:01:14.800> through<00:01:15.130> because<00:01:15.460> I

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
short i run the memory through because I

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.940 
short i run the memory through because I
not<00:01:16.030> recorded<00:01:16.840> in<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.050> match<00:01:17.200> was<00:01:17.530> from<00:01:17.800> a

and repeatedly asked to or remind them
to<00:02:42.130> subscribe<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:44.829> it<00:02:44.950> does<00:02:45.070> make<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.370> that

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
to subscribe so it does make it that

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.340 
to subscribe so it does make it that
much<00:02:45.549> better<00:02:45.670> when<00:02:45.910> people<00:02:46.239> do<00:02:46.420> subscribe<00:02:46.840> and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
much better when people do subscribe and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.390 
much better when people do subscribe and
that's<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.590> way<00:02:47.650> I'm<00:02:47.709> going<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:47.950> keep<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.250> and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that's the way I'm going to keep it and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.740 
that's the way I'm going to keep it and
never<00:02:48.610> going<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.880> actually<00:02:49.000> come<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.360> grab<00:02:49.540> and

know sir and I'm sure someone else to
said<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.420> before<00:04:25.540> but<00:04:26.100> basically<00:04:27.100> when<00:04:27.310> I

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
said it before but basically when I

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.610 
said it before but basically when I
tried<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:28.030> actually<00:04:28.150> worked<00:04:28.630> so<00:04:29.080> I'm<00:04:29.470> gonna

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
tried it it actually worked so I'm gonna

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.560 
tried it it actually worked so I'm gonna
keep<00:04:29.890> trying<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.520> only<00:04:30.760> issues<00:04:31.330> that's

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
keep trying it the only issues that's

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.520 
keep trying it the only issues that's
getting<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.770> ground<00:04:33.040> which<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:35.320> tough

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
getting to the ground which is the tough

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.440 
getting to the ground which is the tough
bit<00:04:35.710> because<00:04:35.860> you've<00:04:36.100> got<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.580> know<00:04:36.610> somehow

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
bit because you've got you know somehow

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.420 
bit because you've got you know somehow
evade<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.440> micelle<00:04:38.770> while<00:04:38.980> you're<00:04:39.130> going

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
evade the micelle while you're going

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.390 
evade the micelle while you're going
back<00:04:39.580> down<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.150> I<00:04:40.990> guess<00:04:41.890> twirling<00:04:42.310> around

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
back down and I guess twirling around

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.570 
back down and I guess twirling around
actually<00:04:42.970> helps<00:04:43.380> until<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.470> get<00:04:44.620> there<00:04:44.800> and

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
actually helps until you get there and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.220 
actually helps until you get there and
it's<00:04:45.700> all<00:04:45.850> about<00:04:46.060> control<00:04:46.300> really<00:04:46.720> when<00:04:47.140> you

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
it's all about control really when you

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.380 
it's all about control really when you
get<00:04:47.440> control<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.770> your<00:04:47.980> jet<00:04:48.220> that's<00:04:48.400> how<00:04:48.580> you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
get control of your jet that's how you

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.990 
get control of your jet that's how you
start<00:04:49.630> developing<00:04:50.080> technique<00:04:50.820> I'm<00:04:51.820> on<00:04:51.940> the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
start developing technique I'm on the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.640 
start developing technique I'm on the
mouse<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.180> keyboard<00:04:52.510> if<00:04:53.140> anyone<00:04:53.500> was

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
wondering and it's relatively easy for

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.120 
wondering and it's relatively easy for
me<00:04:56.680> because<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.460> don't<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:58.780> know<00:04:58.980> slap<00:04:59.980> the
