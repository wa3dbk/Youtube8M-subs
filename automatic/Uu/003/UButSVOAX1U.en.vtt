cover at the same time that we were

cover at the same time that we were
actually<00:01:45.810> designing<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> iPad<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.700> two<00:01:47.880> are

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.960 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done
things<00:04:23.110> with<00:04:23.350> this<00:04:23.470> iPad<00:04:23.860> that<00:04:24.400> we<00:04:24.550> never

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
things with this iPad that we never

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.180 
things with this iPad that we never
could<00:04:25.270> have<00:04:25.330> done<00:04:25.570> before<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.260> it's<00:04:26.890> because

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
could have done before and it's because

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.730 
could have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.910> lot<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.240> new<00:04:28.510> innovation<00:04:29.170> driving

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.370 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.370> that's<00:04:34.150> added<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.570> lot<00:04:34.810> more<00:04:34.990> speed<00:04:35.320> to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.000 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.600> we've<00:04:43.810> made<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.140> biggest<00:04:44.560> chunk<00:04:44.770> is

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
place we've made the biggest chunk is

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.340 
place we've made the biggest chunk is
with<00:04:45.310> graphics<00:04:45.880> with<00:04:46.360> performance<00:04:46.990> that's<00:04:47.200> up

to nine times faster you'll really

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.290 
to nine times faster you'll really
notice<00:04:50.470> this<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:50.890> games<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.520> apps<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.150> use<00:04:52.270> a

we've<00:04:55.180> built<00:04:55.420> a<00:04:55.540> gyro<00:04:55.990> into<00:04:56.290> this<00:04:56.410> iPad<00:04:56.920> that

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
we've built a gyro into this iPad that

we've built a gyro into this iPad that
gives<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.180> very<00:04:58.510> precise<00:04:58.960> control<00:04:58.990> in

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
gives you very precise control in

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.400 
gives you very precise control in
multiple<00:05:00.400> dimensions<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.480> allows<00:05:01.750> us<00:05:01.990> to

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
multiple dimensions and it allows us to

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.500 
multiple dimensions and it allows us to
really<00:05:02.740> measure<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.310> orientation<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.360> the
