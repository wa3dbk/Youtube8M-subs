00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the story I thought was really bland I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.079 
the story I thought was really bland I
honestly<00:01:02.240> didn't<00:01:02.720> get<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> lot<00:01:03.320> out<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.770> I

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.390 
honestly didn't get a lot out of it I
just<00:01:05.089> didn't<00:01:06.080> even<00:01:06.140> really<00:01:06.560> pay<00:01:06.740> attention<00:01:06.770> I

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
just didn't even really pay attention I

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.249 
just didn't even really pay attention I
skipped<00:01:07.790> all<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.030> little<00:01:08.390> cutscenes<00:01:08.990> because

skipped all the little cutscenes because

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.609

screen is the story and honestly I just

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.570 
screen is the story and honestly I just
skipped<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.229> every<00:01:21.440> time<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.619> could<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.340> um

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.730 
skipped it every time I could so um
overall<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.630> story<00:01:23.899> just<00:01:23.960> really<00:01:24.560> wasn't

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
overall the story just really wasn't

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.330 
overall the story just really wasn't
that<00:01:24.979> great<00:01:25.220> in<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:25.580> game<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.720> would<00:01:27.340> just

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
that great in this game and I would just

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.649 
that great in this game and I would just
pass<00:01:28.550> on<00:01:28.850> it

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.830 

so<00:01:35.229> being<00:01:35.439> a<00:01:35.499> budgeted<00:01:35.979> title<00:01:36.460> game<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:37.270> didn't

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
so being a budgeted title game I didn't

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.529 
so being a budgeted title game I didn't
expect<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.409> graphics<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.069> be<00:01:39.539> extremely

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
expect the graphics to be extremely

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.130 
expect the graphics to be extremely
well-liked<00:01:41.409> like<00:01:41.950> wow<00:01:42.520> factor<00:01:43.270> well<00:01:43.509> but<00:01:44.109> I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
well-liked like wow factor well but I

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.410 
well-liked like wow factor well but I
expected<00:01:44.619> them<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.799> be<00:01:44.920> decent<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.700> get<00:01:46.270> the

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
expected them to be decent and get the

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.830 
expected them to be decent and get the
job<00:01:46.630> done<00:01:46.679> which<00:01:47.679> I<00:01:48.149> kind<00:01:49.149> of<00:01:49.209> say<00:01:49.359> it's<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
job done which I kind of say it's a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.690 
job done which I kind of say it's a
little<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.469> both<00:01:50.499> like<00:01:51.039> they<00:01:51.280> were<00:01:51.340> decent

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
little of both like they were decent

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.089 
little of both like they were decent
they<00:01:52.060> definitely<00:01:52.329> weren't<00:01:52.659> horrible<00:01:53.259> but

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
they definitely weren't horrible but

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.160 
they definitely weren't horrible but
they<00:01:54.280> were<00:01:54.340> definitely<00:01:54.520> not<00:01:55.509> good<00:01:55.899> either

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
they were definitely not good either

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.240 
they were definitely not good either
like<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:58.030> textures<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:59.319> lot<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.979> things

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
like the textures of a lot of the things

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.449 
like the textures of a lot of the things
in<00:02:00.459> the<00:02:00.549> jungle<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.359> on<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.500> characters<00:02:03.280> you

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
in the jungle and on the characters you

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.149 
in the jungle and on the characters you
would<00:02:03.609> kill<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.500> know<00:02:05.619> on<00:02:05.740> your<00:02:05.770> guns

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
would kill and you know on your guns

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.069 
would kill and you know on your guns
they<00:02:06.490> were<00:02:06.549> just<00:02:06.789> really<00:02:06.939> bland<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.840> mean

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
they were just really bland I mean

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.100 
they were just really bland I mean
overall<00:02:08.530> as<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.920> jungle<00:02:09.729> like<00:02:09.970> as<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.450> whole<00:02:10.840> I

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
overall as a jungle like as a whole I

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.839 
overall as a jungle like as a whole I
thought<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.620> looked<00:02:11.650> pretty<00:02:12.340> good<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.819> know

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
thought it looked pretty good you know

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.750 
thought it looked pretty good you know
the<00:02:13.060> pass<00:02:13.269> but<00:02:13.629> um<00:02:14.530> when<00:02:15.129> you<00:02:15.220> actually<00:02:15.370> got<00:02:15.700> up

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
the pass but um when you actually got up

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.330 
the pass but um when you actually got up
close<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> stuff<00:02:16.629> it<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:16.930> completely<00:02:17.709> looked

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
close to stuff it just completely looked

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.670 
close to stuff it just completely looked
pixely<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.690> looked<00:02:19.900> horrible<00:02:20.410> and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
pixely it just looked horrible and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.330 
pixely it just looked horrible and
honestly<00:02:21.579> it<00:02:21.849> wasn't<00:02:22.090> good<00:02:22.360> at<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:23.340> one

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
honestly it wasn't good at all and one

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.800 
honestly it wasn't good at all and one
of<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> things<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:24.879> really<00:02:24.910> bugged<00:02:25.420> me<00:02:25.569> was

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
of the things that really bugged me was

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.449 
of the things that really bugged me was
when<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.079> would<00:02:26.200> shoot<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.530> guy<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.099> blood

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
when you would shoot a guy the blood

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.170 
when you would shoot a guy the blood
that<00:02:27.790> would<00:02:27.970> come<00:02:28.150> out<00:02:28.180> would<00:02:29.049> just<00:02:29.680> look

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
that would come out would just look

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.089 
that would come out would just look
extremely<00:02:31.180> faint<00:02:31.450> extremely<00:02:32.349> poorly<00:02:32.709> done

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
extremely faint extremely poorly done

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.099 
extremely faint extremely poorly done
and<00:02:33.400> overall<00:02:33.879> I<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.299> didn't<00:02:34.540> like<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.870> at<00:02:34.989> all

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
and overall I just didn't like it at all

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.589 
and overall I just didn't like it at all
and<00:02:35.349> same<00:02:36.220> goes<00:02:36.250> for<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.670> explosions<00:02:37.390> they

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
and same goes for the explosions they

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.030 
and same goes for the explosions they
looked<00:02:37.780> horrible<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:39.299> overall<00:02:40.299> I<00:02:40.599> just<00:02:41.590> can't

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
looked horrible and overall I just can't

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.039 
looked horrible and overall I just can't
say<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.430> was<00:02:42.609> a<00:02:42.639> good<00:02:42.819> looking<00:02:43.150> game<00:02:43.359> but<00:02:43.810> it

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
say this was a good looking game but it

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.620 
say this was a good looking game but it
I<00:02:44.349> guess<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.010> got<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.880> job<00:02:46.060> done<00:02:46.120> for

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
I guess it just got the job done for

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.979 
I guess it just got the job done for
being<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.959> very<00:02:47.319> very<00:02:47.590> very<00:02:47.739> very<00:02:48.450> low<00:02:49.450> budgeted

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
being a very very very very low budgeted

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.040 
being a very very very very low budgeted
game<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.730> graphics

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800 

video<00:02:57.890> game<00:02:58.130> like<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.520> was<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.480> know<00:02:59.600> all

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
video game like this was you know all

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.300 
video game like this was you know all
the<00:02:59.990> assault<00:03:00.440> rifles<00:03:00.860> sounded<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.280> same

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
the assault rifles sounded the same

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.460 
the assault rifles sounded the same
though<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.210> three<00:03:02.240> of<00:03:02.660> them<00:03:02.960> that<00:03:02.990> there<00:03:03.290> were

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
though all three of them that there were

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.400 
though all three of them that there were
there<00:03:03.830> all<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.310> snipers<00:03:05.140> silenced<00:03:06.140> or<00:03:06.260> not

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
there all the snipers silenced or not

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.490 
there all the snipers silenced or not
they<00:03:06.800> just<00:03:07.100> sounded<00:03:07.550> typical<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.360> all<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
they just sounded typical and all the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.770 
they just sounded typical and all the
voiceovers<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.340> jungle<00:03:10.970> movements<00:03:11.600> they

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
voiceovers and jungle movements they

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.860 
voiceovers and jungle movements they
really<00:03:12.110> just<00:03:12.140> felt<00:03:12.620> forced<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.630> really<00:03:14.630> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
really just felt forced and really it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.410 
really just felt forced and really it
just<00:03:14.900> didn't<00:03:15.680> do<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.100> for<00:03:16.370> me<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:16.820> thought<00:03:17.120> that

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
just didn't do it for me I thought that

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.620 
just didn't do it for me I thought that
it<00:03:17.690> could<00:03:17.720> have<00:03:18.020> been<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.230> lot<00:03:18.500> better<00:03:18.710> I<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:20.120> just

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
it could have been a lot better I I just

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.150 
it could have been a lot better I I just
didn't<00:03:20.870> like<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.140> at<00:03:21.260> all<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.590> didn't<00:03:21.980> like<00:03:22.130> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
didn't like it at all I didn't like the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.520 
didn't like it at all I didn't like the
main<00:03:22.490> character's<00:03:23.120> voice<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.960> didn't<00:03:24.200> like<00:03:24.320> any

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
main character's voice I didn't like any

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.550 
main character's voice I didn't like any
of<00:03:24.620> them<00:03:24.740> so<00:03:25.810> unfortunately<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.990> sound<00:03:27.260> was

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
of them so unfortunately the sound was

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.170 
of them so unfortunately the sound was
definitely<00:03:28.010> not<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> good<00:03:28.490> thing<00:03:28.700> all<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
definitely not a good thing all the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.380 
definitely not a good thing all the
explosions<00:03:29.780> sounded<00:03:30.680> horrible<00:03:31.130> like<00:03:31.880> one<00:03:32.360> of

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
explosions sounded horrible like one of

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.570 
explosions sounded horrible like one of
the<00:03:32.630> most<00:03:32.840> horrible<00:03:33.440> sounding<00:03:33.890> explosions

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
the most horrible sounding explosions

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.310 
the most horrible sounding explosions
and<00:03:34.880> then<00:03:35.000> bae<00:03:35.210> much<00:03:35.390> played<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.900> recent

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
and then bae much played in a recent

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.890 
and then bae much played in a recent
while<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.300> overall<00:03:38.300> i<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:38.690> thought<00:03:38.870> that

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
while and overall i just thought that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.580 
while and overall i just thought that
this<00:03:39.170> was<00:03:39.350> not<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.710> good<00:03:40.070> sounding<00:03:40.520> game

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.410 

okay<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:47.650> pretty<00:03:48.099> much<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.580> far<00:03:48.849> everything

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
okay so pretty much so far everything

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.850 
okay so pretty much so far everything
hasn't<00:03:49.599> been<00:03:49.840> good<00:03:49.989> but<00:03:50.200> let's<00:03:50.410> hope<00:03:50.590> at<00:03:50.830> least

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
hasn't been good but let's hope at least

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.520 
hasn't been good but let's hope at least
the<00:03:51.160> gameplay<00:03:51.550> is<00:03:51.610> fun<00:03:51.700> right<00:03:52.000> well<00:03:52.959> it's<00:03:53.230> yes

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
the gameplay is fun right well it's yes

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.640 
the gameplay is fun right well it's yes
or<00:03:53.680> no<00:03:53.800> on<00:03:53.830> this<00:03:54.160> on<00:03:54.519> this<00:03:54.580> topic<00:03:55.239> because<00:03:55.650> it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
or no on this on this topic because it

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.710 
or no on this on this topic because it
definitely<00:03:56.890> isn't<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.819> best<00:03:58.030> gameplay<00:03:58.330> I've

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
definitely isn't the best gameplay I've

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.199 
definitely isn't the best gameplay I've
seen<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.290> been<00:03:59.500> done<00:03:59.800> before<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:00.580> it's<00:04:00.940> just

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
seen it's been done before and it's just

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.089 
seen it's been done before and it's just
a<00:04:01.330> lower<00:04:01.540> version<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.380> everything<00:04:02.890> that's

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
a lower version of everything that's

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.800 
a lower version of everything that's
been<00:04:03.220> done<00:04:03.280> before<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:04.000> got<00:04:04.150> little<00:04:04.450> bits<00:04:04.630> of

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
been done before you got little bits of

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.320 
been done before you got little bits of
modern<00:04:05.140> warfare<00:04:05.349> 2<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:06.190> feel<00:04:06.910> like<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.150> got<00:04:07.300> a

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
modern warfare 2 I feel like you got a

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.500 
modern warfare 2 I feel like you got a
little<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.660> bad<00:04:07.900> company<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.890> little<00:04:09.519> of<00:04:09.790> you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
little a bad company a little of you

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.120 
little a bad company a little of you
know<00:04:10.660> every<00:04:11.110> shooter<00:04:11.410> out<00:04:11.440> there<00:04:11.590> it's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
know every shooter out there it's

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.339 
know every shooter out there it's
nothing<00:04:12.489> special<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:13.060> mean<00:04:13.810> there<00:04:13.989> is<00:04:14.110> some

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
nothing special I mean there is some

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.319 
nothing special I mean there is some
cool<00:04:14.530> things<00:04:14.709> in<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.010> like<00:04:15.190> every<00:04:15.580> mostly

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
cool things in it like every mostly

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.940 
cool things in it like every mostly
every<00:04:16.600> time<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.930> get<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.079> cool<00:04:17.350> head<00:04:17.530> shot<00:04:17.769> from

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
every time you get a cool head shot from

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.650 
every time you get a cool head shot from
a<00:04:18.070> far<00:04:18.280> distance<00:04:18.310> away<00:04:18.790> it'll<00:04:19.150> go<00:04:19.299> into<00:04:19.450> like<00:04:19.630> a

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
a far distance away it'll go into like a

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.719 
a far distance away it'll go into like a
slow<00:04:20.049> motion<00:04:20.500> bullet<00:04:20.650> track<00:04:21.070> which<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.579> thought

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
slow motion bullet track which I thought

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.370 
slow motion bullet track which I thought
was<00:04:21.880> school<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:22.240> very<00:04:22.270> rewarding<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.020> get<00:04:23.260> one

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
was school is very rewarding to get one

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.370 
was school is very rewarding to get one
of<00:04:23.470> those<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:24.460> um<00:04:24.700> besides<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.139> just

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
of those but um besides that it just

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.800 
of those but um besides that it just
wasn't<00:04:26.440> much<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.580> would<00:04:27.760> die<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> lot<00:04:28.570> I

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
wasn't much to it you would die a lot I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.060 
wasn't much to it you would die a lot I
thought<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.229> this<00:04:29.320> was<00:04:29.470> actually<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.860> fairly

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
thought that this was actually a fairly

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.610 
thought that this was actually a fairly
challenging<00:04:30.490> game<00:04:31.169> because<00:04:32.169> there<00:04:32.530> were

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
challenging game because there were

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.670 
challenging game because there were
stealth<00:04:32.950> parts<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.550> if<00:04:33.790> you<00:04:33.880> got<00:04:34.000> caught<00:04:34.389> on

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
stealth parts and if you got caught on

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680 
stealth parts and if you got caught on
some<00:04:35.680> they<00:04:36.160> wouldn't<00:04:36.550> restart<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.120> level<00:04:37.240> and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
some they wouldn't restart the level and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.420 
some they wouldn't restart the level and
say<00:04:37.870> like<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.229> got<00:04:38.410> caught<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.040> generals

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
say like you got caught the generals

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.790 
say like you got caught the generals
escaped<00:04:39.850> blah<00:04:40.240> blah<00:04:40.479> blah<00:04:40.510> blah<00:04:40.630> but<00:04:41.620> there

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
escaped blah blah blah blah but there

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.260 
escaped blah blah blah blah but there
were<00:04:41.919> some<00:04:42.130> missions<00:04:42.460> like<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.820> but<00:04:42.970> if<00:04:43.120> you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
were some missions like that but if you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.700 
were some missions like that but if you
did<00:04:43.770> did<00:04:44.770> not<00:04:45.040> have<00:04:45.400> um<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:46.810> if<00:04:46.990> if<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.320> level

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
did did not have um like if if the level

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.800 
did did not have um like if if the level
didn't<00:04:47.919> restart<00:04:48.250> by<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.090> getting<00:04:49.570> caught

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
didn't restart by you getting caught

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.710 
didn't restart by you getting caught
getting<00:04:50.289> through<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.979> level<00:04:51.370> was<00:04:51.820> hell<00:04:52.330> you

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
getting through the level was hell you

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.110 
getting through the level was hell you
actually<00:04:53.470> had<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:54.010> restart<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.700> because<00:04:55.000> it

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
actually had to restart it because it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.029 
actually had to restart it because it
was<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.419> hard<00:04:55.720> I'd<00:04:55.930> restart<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.590> couple<00:04:56.889> levels

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
was so hard I'd restart a couple levels

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.190 
was so hard I'd restart a couple levels
because<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:57.970> just<00:04:58.030> couldn't<00:04:58.450> get<00:04:58.810> through

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
because I just couldn't get through

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.350 
because I just couldn't get through
these<00:04:59.350> waves<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.979> waves<00:05:00.100> of<00:05:00.400> waves<00:05:00.669> of<00:05:01.030> a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
these waves and waves of waves of a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.340 
these waves and waves of waves of a
weird<00:05:01.870> if<00:05:02.620> that's<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:03.039> word<00:05:03.190> aware<00:05:04.120> enemies<00:05:04.600> so

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
weird if that's a word aware enemies so

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.460 
weird if that's a word aware enemies so
um<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:06.370> just<00:05:06.610> wasn't<00:05:06.760> cool<00:05:07.030> um<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.690> as<00:05:08.289> for

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
um that just wasn't cool um and as for

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.900 
um that just wasn't cool um and as for
the<00:05:08.560> length<00:05:08.740> of<00:05:08.889> this<00:05:09.010> game<00:05:09.070> it's<00:05:09.460> actually<00:05:09.880> a

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
the length of this game it's actually a

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.240 
the length of this game it's actually a
very<00:05:10.090> short<00:05:10.539> game<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.960> completed<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.740> in<00:05:11.889> just

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
very short game I completed it in just

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.129 
very short game I completed it in just
under<00:05:12.700> five<00:05:13.000> hours<00:05:13.030> i<00:05:13.570> think<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.870> was<00:05:13.960> like

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
under five hours i think it was like

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.550 
under five hours i think it was like
four<00:05:14.950> hours<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.520> 40<00:05:15.970> minutes<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.690> that's

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
four hours and 40 minutes so that's

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.650 
four hours and 40 minutes so that's
another<00:05:17.830> reason<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.220> stay<00:05:18.400> away<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:18.940> overall

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
another reason to stay away and overall

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.140 
another reason to stay away and overall
this<00:05:19.810> wasn't<00:05:20.710> just<00:05:20.860> this<00:05:21.430> just<00:05:21.700> wasn't<00:05:21.880> the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
this wasn't just this just wasn't the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.490 
this wasn't just this just wasn't the
most<00:05:22.300> fun<00:05:22.539> game<00:05:22.780> i<00:05:22.810> mean<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.169> have<00:05:23.320> your
