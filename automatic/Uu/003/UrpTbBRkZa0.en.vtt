00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.280
 Hello and welcome to a first store to kill the decree 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.109
 I'll show you today like Pröll with the flame 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.829
 Vennemann import the authorities recommended can do that 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.279
 if one of these three stones 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.269
 returns coincidence is selected what now 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.679
 if you jump on it »break that 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:25.819
 so 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.619
 the so Gallic shuffle the little man 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.539
 prepared the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.400
 you need 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.690
 three stones 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.150
 or the one after how much you want 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.610
 they should 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.550
 he would have to make him debut Frank Drake 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.550
 Rank three 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.030
 and that he still set at flax 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.150
 without a cell phone Greg Brown carrier that's just called 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
 if we are for everyone use and went broke 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.160
 Now all we have to do is hire the students 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.980
 that's what makes Gilson's first stone gaming break in name 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.160
 Ben Brik Paretz 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.820
 in the second 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.040
 Brecht 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.570
 the topic 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.410
 End and then 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.730
 Track 3 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.590
 z after the first sign give us gates 0 1 as name 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.380
 Of course, CAD has made you want to do it 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.090
 then set at output 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 Bonn carrier 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.310
 Fire Brakke Albers and Uecker 1 and tie-break 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.820
 that is, "If we endured the war or 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.230
 that breaks 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.270
 precarious underneath 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.460
 we're doing the same thing now 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130
 Bonn carrier 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.130
 Precht 2 this mammoth project 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 Skimming names and now two men 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.380
 it is important that is what makes us what we are likely to do 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.790
 It must be the program now 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.830
 Moritz Grad 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.149
 and do the same 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.699
 and care 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.699
 Route operates Red 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.959
 how so 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.319
 the Czar more 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.730
 three moves rolls z three break-balls one would project the old signs 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.679
 Geddes Preckel touches us 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.899
 more Sami one more 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.899
 Cengiz Kulac Capecchi after saying his word 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.450
 the forest will be visible 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.779
 they hear in case test area volunteer 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 Franz Keizer 1 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.219
 in this castor-use want attractive five and so on 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.399
 that's really just 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.819
 the number 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.069
 the percentage so if now two pieces off that it's five 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.640
 tens to 50 if the three pieces on the 33 333 meters 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.419
 it's as if 1 6 2 has been got for 13 years now though 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.359
 so complained 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.509
 give 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.509
 made in the name of home 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.629
 Orban Chelsea only one 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.449
 then we'll do the title in the morning 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.819
 in the first 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.569
 and for Sal 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.630
 be it in the first case of Dr 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.680
 is later released with the first voice and elegance Rechtenstein 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.609
 thick percent that is activated that is 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.429
 the stone does not break 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:39.969
 with the person 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.319
 we do more 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.739
 Norton appreciates 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.609
 Only two this market then EMI on the 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.159
 Horns Wörz was one 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.739
 Bonn that is 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.019
 then the same to Kelsen Neutral 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.939
 and in the morning 3 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.179
 and that would have 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.029
 so unapproachable 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:02.129
 March on me 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.969
 a logic as 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.369
 he does not call mere 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:10.129
 you give him no order that he should look this 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.089
 that's why it's the first trailer and Demeter fooling in front of the investigators 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.440
 he hesitates to buy this 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.980
 two of the three 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.669
 turned off 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.779
 it means used and also secondary school students and 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:28.199
 Namaste relatively unimportant this time 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.340
 no, I do not 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.930
 Sda TuS Celle will definitely be different, of course it does not work out 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:36.999
 we take 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.999
 Kaupp short and carrier two super-g in the doubles 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.590
 Claes only does one thing with it 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.779
 So it should not be our logic yet 2 1 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:49.129
 in fact 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.779
 he takes 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.870
 Change nine 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.389
 So clicks ends up 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.210
 he is plaguing 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.400
 That was it 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.840
 So as soon as he touches the bat, he gives the vehicle 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.719
 to the logic Kelz 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.520
 so he's one of those three 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.770
 Karen whose fails 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.379
 that means only one of them is ready 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:20.019
 and as soon as we get this and touching 12, the break breaks yellow company 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.900
 it can try it out right now 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.900
 that's what Fox does with Klopsch's entrance exam 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.150
 Where 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.240
 should and want to pay 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.029
 here is the culprit 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.580
 so 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.580
 so should those now famous phrase in the end also rewarded 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.219
 should take his vacation 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.110
 a Stocker Almerares 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.159
 that one had the fact that the future shattered 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.199
 it is back 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.599
 wonderful 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.599
 SES Lexus has long since taken care Look 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.669
 What is Sweet now? 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.509
 the autumn Precht 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:09.810
 the food will be 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.449
 and it can fall on it works
