things going on paramount want a movie
in<00:01:53.890> 2016<00:01:54.819> that's<00:01:55.060> pretty<00:01:55.330> much<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.539> given<00:01:55.750> i

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
in 2016 that's pretty much a given i

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.130 
in 2016 that's pretty much a given i
would<00:01:56.140> assume

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
would assume

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.830 
would assume
so<00:01:57.710> what's<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:58.580> chance<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.150> band<00:01:59.420> staying

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840

together<00:02:00.050> for<00:02:00.979> 2016<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:02.150> mean<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:02.750> think<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.050> have

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
together for 2016 I mean I think we have

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.200 
together for 2016 I mean I think we have
to<00:02:03.290> fundamentally<00:02:03.560> accept<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.490> JJ<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.030> not

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210

that I'm not fully aware of exists it's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.650 
that I'm not fully aware of exists it's
gonna<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.330> tough<00:02:17.570> but<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:19.670> really<00:02:20.300> hope<00:02:20.450> that

everybody who worked on these last two
movies<00:02:23.290> continues<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.590> work<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:25.730> comes

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
movies continues to work on what comes

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.699 
movies continues to work on what comes
next<00:02:26.890> perhaps<00:02:27.890> in<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:29.090> different<00:02:29.120> capacity<00:02:29.709> but

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
next perhaps in a different capacity but

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.430 
next perhaps in a different capacity but
I<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.580> just<00:02:31.820> care<00:02:32.300> too<00:02:32.330> deeply<00:02:32.900> about<00:02:32.989> Trek

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
I just I just care too deeply about Trek

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.160 
I just I just care too deeply about Trek
to<00:02:33.590> step<00:02:33.830> away<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:35.180> would<00:02:35.330> be<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.480> process

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
to step away what would be the process

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.530 
to step away what would be the process
of<00:02:36.560> finding<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.430> director<00:02:37.880> did<00:02:38.060> because

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
of finding a director did because

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.570 
of finding a director did because
there's<00:02:38.720> something<00:02:39.200> about<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.560> movie<00:02:40.040> these

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
there's something about this movie these

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.060 
there's something about this movie these
two<00:02:40.820> movies<00:02:41.030> after<00:02:41.630> seeing<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.110> they<00:02:42.830> fit

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
two movies after seeing it they fit

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.740 
two movies after seeing it they fit
together<00:02:43.220> more<00:02:43.700> than<00:02:43.880> any<00:02:44.060> other<00:02:44.269> two<00:02:44.540> Star

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
together more than any other two Star

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.990 
together more than any other two Star
Trek<00:02:44.930> movies<00:02:45.230> even<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.769> two<00:02:46.130> Nimoy<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
Trek movies even the two Nimoy and the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.540 
Trek movies even the two Nimoy and the
two<00:02:47.239> breaks<00:02:48.170> directed<00:02:48.769> movies<00:02:49.130> felt

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
two breaks directed movies felt

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.890 
two breaks directed movies felt
differently<00:02:50.150> one<00:02:50.750> after<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> other<00:02:51.640> these

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
differently one after the other these

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.400 
differently one after the other these
finding<00:02:53.900> someone<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.290> stepping<00:02:54.590> into<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.800> third

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
finding someone is stepping into a third

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.660 
finding someone is stepping into a third
you'd<00:02:57.410> want<00:02:57.709> someone<00:02:57.800> who<00:02:58.100> could<00:02:58.280> keep<00:02:58.459> that

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
you'd want someone who could keep that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.550 
you'd want someone who could keep that
going<00:02:58.880> right<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.630> what<00:02:59.840> would<00:02:59.930> be<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.080> process

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
going right so what would be the process

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.370 
going right so what would be the process
like<00:03:00.769> of<00:03:00.950> finding<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.400> director<00:03:01.850> well<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.780> you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
like of finding a director well I you

like of finding a director well I you
know<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.799> I<00:03:04.519> don't<00:03:05.030> think<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.480> we<00:03:06.110> want<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.470> we

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
know I I don't think that we want it we

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.979 
know I I don't think that we want it we
you're<00:03:07.610> asking<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:08.090> question<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.690> far

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
you're asking a question that is far

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.020 
you're asking a question that is far
advanced<00:03:09.500> beyond<00:03:10.010> any<00:03:10.190> conversations<00:03:10.880> that

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
advanced beyond any conversations that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.660 
advanced beyond any conversations that
we've<00:03:11.120> had<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.510> far<00:03:11.739> JJ<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.950> such<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.220> unique

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
we've had so far JJ is such a unique

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.390 
we've had so far JJ is such a unique
talent<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:14.690> finding<00:03:15.170> someone<00:03:15.530> who<00:03:16.100> does

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
talent that finding someone who does

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.330 
talent that finding someone who does
what<00:03:16.640> he<00:03:16.790> does<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.329> next<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.780> impossible<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.950> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
what he does is next to impossible so I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.550 
what he does is next to impossible so I
think<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.850> step<00:03:20.209> one<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.600> find<00:03:21.170> someone<00:03:21.470> who

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
think that step one is find someone who

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.800 
think that step one is find someone who
has<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> passion<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.310> Trek<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.269> passion<00:03:23.660> for

has a passion for Trek and a passion for

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.440 
has a passion for Trek and a passion for
these<00:03:23.959> two<00:03:24.200> movies<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:25.040> an<00:03:25.340> edit<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.060> a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
these two movies and an edit and a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.130 
these two movies and an edit and a
vision<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:27.410> what<00:03:27.560> comes<00:03:27.829> next
