cool so the first thing I noticed is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
cool so the first thing I noticed is
that<00:00:33.390> you're<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> pavement<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.250> looks

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that you're not on the pavement it looks

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
that you're not on the pavement it looks
like<00:00:35.640> you're<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:35.880> some<00:00:36.239> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> woodchips<00:00:36.840> or

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
like you're in some kind of woodchips or

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.130 
like you're in some kind of woodchips or
dirt<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.420> will<00:00:39.510> really<00:00:39.690> help<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
just to move out onto the pavement

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.240 
just to move out onto the pavement

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
but you're not dragging it up the board

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.280 
but you're not dragging it up the board
and<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> main<00:01:23.430> problem<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.049> real

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and that's the main problem so the real

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
and that's the main problem so the real
way<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.799> ollie<00:01:25.950> works<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
way that the ollie works is you have to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.690 
way that the ollie works is you have to
pop<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.689> tail<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.350> back<00:01:28.530> foot<00:01:28.799> drag

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pop the tail with your back foot drag

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
pop the tail with your back foot drag
your<00:01:29.970> front<00:01:30.240> foot<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.990> grip<00:01:31.229> tape<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
your front foot up the grip tape and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.980 
your front foot up the grip tape and
that's<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.490> causes<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.090> lift<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> board

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that's what causes the lift on the board

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.230 
that's what causes the lift on the board
it's<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.610> lift<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.030> feet

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
it's not just that you lift your feet
and<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> board<00:01:36.960> lifts<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.430> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and then the board lifts up you have to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.060 
and then the board lifts up you have to
actually<00:01:38.759> drag<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.720> top<00:01:39.990> suede<00:01:40.409> part<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.890> your

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and then this is the main thing just

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
and then this is the main thing just
practice<00:01:57.899> dragging<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.560> foot<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.430> grip

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
tape for a while I'd spend a good 10 to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.600 
tape for a while I'd spend a good 10 to
15<00:02:03.540> minutes<00:02:03.840> straight<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
15 minutes straight just on that and you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
15 minutes straight just on that and you
can<00:02:05.640> tell<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.299> you're<00:02:06.509> doing<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.869> correctly

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
can tell if you're doing it correctly

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380 
can tell if you're doing it correctly
