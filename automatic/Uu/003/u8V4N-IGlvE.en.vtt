00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.060
 hello guys in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:07.029
 explain how to locate a group of numbers 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.480
 on the number line let's look at this 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:14.020
 case we have a scale that is 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.670
 from 0 to 1 there are 12 centimeters and so 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.830
 so much that I have to do 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.870
 I must divide that measure that to me 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.260
 gave by the denominator and 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:29.500
 multiply it by the numerator let's see 12 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:31.690
 / 34 x 14 in this case I should see if 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.149
 It is separated by 12 centimeters or 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.480
 each of those parts has to 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.149
 correspond to one centimeter yes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 I have also been told that da 4 did not occur 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.940
 the account that was 4 then I do 1 2 3 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 4 therefore here is going to be a third 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.290
 in this case 812 to you is already separated 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.450
 on the same scale that was 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.710
 the whole because it is separated into twelve 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.840
 parts and therefore I look for the number 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.080
 eight within every centimeters and what 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.530
 placed a two three four five six 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.110
 seven eight and we have the extraction on 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.080
 0.24 we have a decimal number 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.729
 we must pass the decimal abstraction 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.550
 then I have 24 cents and because 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.170
 these are the tenths hundredth would come 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.900
 to be two zeros by the two decimals yes 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 then taking into account that if I 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.620
 I separate those twelve centimeters in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.360
 millimeters 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.570
 and here I will have 10 millimeters 20 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 millimeters and story 4 until you reach the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.050
 24 millimeters therefore here it would be 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.960
 located 0.24 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.830
 let's see another example in this case I 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.980
 I have an eighth one third and two tenths 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.870
 also like to place it in those twelve 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.210
 centimeters 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.150
 remember that I must divide those twelve 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.030
 centimeters by the denominator and 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:15.570
 multiply it by the numerator if I 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:21.330
 divide a 12/8 gives me 15 therefore 15 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:24.770
 is 1 centimeter 5 in this part would have 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.770
 to an eighth 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.940
 now 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.420
 not just a little bit stronger this 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.770
 same as an eighth in that part now 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 one third 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.819
 let's consider that it is 12 centimeters 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.610
 12/34 therefore 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.500
 two 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.780
 3 and in the centimeter 4 will be located 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.150
 this fraction 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.640
 in the 2 we say 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:04.909
 now what do I do / 12/10 12/10 me 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.879
 is 12 for 2 gives me 24 is also going to 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:11.850
 look similar to the previous group 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.560
 then we have 1 2 4 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.530
 Note that was divided by 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.230
 centimeters and therefore this is going to be 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.290
 the same fraction 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.500
 now remember always that depending 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.260
 scale that to me give me what I 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.599
 divide centimeter that value by the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.000
 denominator and multiply it by the 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.760
 numerator I hope guys who have them 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.269
 served any example that they have 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.519
 that they have given them and they do not leave me 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.239
 Mandan I explain and see you 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.239
 bye
