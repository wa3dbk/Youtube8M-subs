00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I'm kind of picky why do I think some

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:11.930 
I'm kind of picky why do I think some
are<00:00:11.130> really<00:00:11.400> good<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.550> somewhere<00:00:11.820> just

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
are really good in somewhere just

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.220 
are really good in somewhere just
absolutely<00:00:12.330> crap<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.200> I

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
absolutely crap and this is one that I

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.419 
absolutely crap and this is one that I
actually<00:00:13.440> thought<00:00:13.679> was<00:00:13.830> interesting<00:00:13.950> because

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
actually thought was interesting because

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.490 
actually thought was interesting because
I<00:00:14.790> think<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.299> find<00:00:15.570> out<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> good<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
I think you find out a good bit but the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.840 
I think you find out a good bit but the
person<00:00:16.740> I'd<00:00:16.980> kind<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.279> like<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.580> don't<00:00:17.670> know

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
person I'd kind of like I don't know

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.029 
person I'd kind of like I don't know
think<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> reason<00:00:18.420> why<00:00:18.630> people<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:19.680> Todd's

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
think the reason why people like Todd's

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.380 
think the reason why people like Todd's
it's<00:00:20.430> because<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.670> get<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> know<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.270> person

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it's because you get to know the person

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.029 
it's because you get to know the person
better<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.080> kind<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.439> personal<00:00:22.830> so
