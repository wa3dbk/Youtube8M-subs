fish tank that we're going to be doing

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.450 
fish tank that we're going to be doing
for<00:00:17.619> our<00:00:17.650> aquaponic<00:00:18.609> system<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:20.140> it<00:00:20.260> is<00:00:20.460> is

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
for our aquaponic system what it is is

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.410 
for our aquaponic system what it is is
just<00:00:22.029> one<00:00:22.510> of<00:00:22.599> those<00:00:22.779> 300<00:00:23.470> gallon<00:00:23.710> totes<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
just one of those 300 gallon totes and

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.349 
just one of those 300 gallon totes and
we<00:00:25.630> took<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:26.500> sides<00:00:27.189> or<00:00:27.730> we<00:00:28.119> put<00:00:28.269> the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
we took the sides or we put the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.669 
we took the sides or we put the
insulation<00:00:28.810> on<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.990> sides<00:00:29.199> and<00:00:29.349> just<00:00:29.410> tape<00:00:29.650> it

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
insulation on the sides and just tape it

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.690 
insulation on the sides and just tape it
up<00:00:29.859> with<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.310> universe<00:00:30.939> metal<00:00:31.210> tape<00:00:31.390> stuff<00:00:31.720> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
up with the universe metal tape stuff so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.600 
up with the universe metal tape stuff so
it's<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:36.070> right<00:00:36.190> here<00:00:36.370> it's<00:00:36.520> actually

pretty cheap and that's so that's what

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.209 
pretty cheap and that's so that's what
we're<00:00:44.020> using<00:00:44.140> for<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.469> outside<00:00:44.770> insulation

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
we're using for the outside insulation

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.590 
we're using for the outside insulation
and<00:00:45.370> then<00:00:45.850> we<00:00:45.940> went<00:00:46.120> ahead<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.300> built<00:00:46.420> this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
and then we went ahead and built this

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.500 
and then we went ahead and built this
little<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.550> lid<00:00:48.820> actually<00:00:49.270> worked<00:00:49.449> out

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510

deck<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.899> put<00:00:53.530> an<00:00:53.649> aerator<00:00:54.039> in<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:55.230> show<00:00:56.230> you

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
deck and put an aerator in and show you

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.910 
deck and put an aerator in and show you
guys<00:00:56.469> how<00:00:56.649> it<00:00:56.739> works<00:00:56.920> here<00:00:57.219> so<00:00:58.079> opens<00:00:59.079> up<00:00:59.260> we

this side opens up as well so we have
two<00:01:08.140> sides<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.650> open<00:01:09.040> up<00:01:09.270> both<00:01:10.270> on<00:01:10.450> hinge

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
two sides to open up both on hinge

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
introduced these fish in this system

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.700 
introduced these fish in this system
today<00:01:33.950> they<00:01:34.850> are<00:01:34.880> more<00:01:35.320> they're<00:01:36.320> more<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.590> a

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
test fish because we don't know or we

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.770 
test fish because we don't know or we
are<00:01:40.310> there's<00:01:40.490> boiler<00:01:40.850> chemicals<00:01:41.270> inside<00:01:41.479> here

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
are there's boiler chemicals inside here

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.569 
are there's boiler chemicals inside here
inside<00:01:42.380> this<00:01:42.590> coat<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.130> we're<00:01:43.250> going<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.399> that

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
and put these test fish in to see if

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.190 
and put these test fish in to see if
they're<00:01:46.130> going<00:01:46.219> to<00:01:46.280> live<00:01:46.520> or<00:01:46.899> if<00:01:47.899> they're<00:01:48.049> to

tilapia order and see we'll put those in

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.440 
tilapia order and see we'll put those in
here<00:01:53.950> for<00:01:54.950> now<00:01:55.069> but<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.729> just<00:01:56.030> want<00:01:56.179> to<00:01:56.270> show<00:01:56.390> you

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
guys what we've been working on and this

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.319 
guys what we've been working on and this
is<00:01:59.000> going<00:01:59.179> to<00:01:59.299> connect<00:01:59.659> to<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:01.700> system<00:02:02.090> or

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
is going to connect to this system or

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.229 
is going to connect to this system or
algae<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:02.959> get<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> syringe<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.500> second<00:02:03.829> but

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
algae so you get a syringe a second but

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.620 
algae so you get a syringe a second but
and<00:02:05.239> it's<00:02:05.780> about<00:02:05.869> 300<00:02:06.259> gallons<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.630> I'm

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
and it's about 300 gallons and I'm

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.330 
and it's about 300 gallons and I'm
actually<00:02:08.810> really<00:02:09.200> really<00:02:09.619> impressive<00:02:10.160> you

actually really really impressive you
know<00:02:10.429> how<00:02:11.120> well<00:02:11.329> this<00:02:11.480> uh<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:12.349> whole<00:02:12.530> thing's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
know how well this uh this whole thing's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.650 
know how well this uh this whole thing's
turning<00:02:12.860> out<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.269> actually<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:14.569> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
turning out so this is actually going to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.949 
turning out so this is actually going to
connect<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.110> an<00:02:15.650> indoor<00:02:16.640> an<00:02:16.970> indoor<00:02:17.599> system

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
connect to an indoor an indoor system

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.780 
connect to an indoor an indoor system
and<00:02:18.170> I'll<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.130> give<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.430> guys<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.579> little

peek of that here in just a second and
this<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.920> prototype<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.400> our<00:02:25.610> indoor

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
this is the prototype for our indoor

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.530 
this is the prototype for our indoor
grow<00:02:27.430> aquaponic<00:02:28.430> system<00:02:28.700> it's<00:02:29.299> going<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.480> be

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
grow aquaponic system it's going to be

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.880 
grow aquaponic system it's going to be
connected<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.110> tank<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.379> just<00:02:30.590> showed<00:02:30.709> you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
connected to the tank I just showed you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.880 
connected to the tank I just showed you
what<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.299> it's<00:02:32.930> actually<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> Christmas

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
what this is it's actually a Christmas

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.870

bucks and they just keep marking them

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.870 
bucks and they just keep marking them
down<00:02:42.680> with<00:02:42.980> their<00:02:43.069> today<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.340> they're<00:02:43.459> only<00:02:43.549> 20

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
down with their today in they're only 20

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.280 
down with their today in they're only 20
but<00:02:44.030> we<00:02:44.480> got<00:02:44.630> four<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.930> these

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
then attached to these lines that I can

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.409 
then attached to these lines that I can
control<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.099> height<00:03:19.250> on<00:03:19.549> because<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.030> know<00:03:20.090> the

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
control the height on because I know the

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.659 
control the height on because I know the
compact<00:03:20.810> are<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.139> fluorescents<00:03:21.709> don't<00:03:22.430> do<00:03:22.549> as

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
compact are the fluorescents don't do as

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.970 
compact are the fluorescents don't do as
well<00:03:22.700> as<00:03:23.090> some<00:03:24.019> on<00:03:24.109> some<00:03:24.319> other<00:03:24.440> grow<00:03:24.620> lamps

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
well as some on some other grow lamps

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.830 
well as some on some other grow lamps
but<00:03:25.160> I've<00:03:25.669> seen<00:03:25.849> some<00:03:26.030> aquaponic<00:03:26.540> systems

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
but I've seen some aquaponic systems

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.550 
but I've seen some aquaponic systems
work<00:03:26.989> out<00:03:27.139> really<00:03:27.290> well

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
work out really well

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.349 
work out really well
so<00:03:27.829> what'll<00:03:28.430> happen<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.880> water<00:03:29.000> will<00:03:29.150> come

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
so what'll happen is the water will come

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.520 
so what'll happen is the water will come
from

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
from

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.290 
from
from<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.280> tank<00:03:31.520> just<00:03:31.730> over<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:31.970> lip<00:03:32.120> there

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
from the tank just over the lip there

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.180 
from the tank just over the lip there
we'll<00:03:32.510> go<00:03:32.600> ahead<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.780> put<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.530> little<00:03:33.890> hole<00:03:34.040> or

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
we'll go ahead and put a little hole or

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.250 
we'll go ahead and put a little hole or
something<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.550> here<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.870> piping<00:03:36.170> will

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
something in here and the piping will

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.180 
something in here and the piping will
come<00:03:36.440> out<00:03:36.590> down<00:03:38.050> it'll<00:03:39.050> drain<00:03:39.200> into<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:40.100> know

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
come out down it'll drain into you know

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.910 
come out down it'll drain into you know
all<00:03:40.940> for<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.330> grow<00:03:41.450> beds<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.930> we'll<00:03:42.800> probably

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
all for the grow beds and we'll probably

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.460 
all for the grow beds and we'll probably
have<00:03:43.070> an<00:03:43.220> external<00:03:43.520> both<00:03:43.790> sides<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.470> either

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
have an external both sides and either

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.590 
have an external both sides and either
on<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.680> corner<00:03:45.980> somewhere<00:03:46.460> this<00:03:47.300> will<00:03:47.450> fill

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
on the corner somewhere this will fill

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.480 
on the corner somewhere this will fill
up<00:03:47.750> all<00:03:48.080> four<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.500> them<00:03:48.620> will<00:03:48.740> then<00:03:48.920> empty<00:03:49.310> into

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
up all four of them will then empty into

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.210 
up all four of them will then empty into
this<00:03:49.610> one<00:03:49.880> sump<00:03:50.150> tank<00:03:50.300> and<00:03:50.630> this<00:03:51.440> sump<00:03:52.100> tank

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
this one sump tank and this sump tank

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.890 
this one sump tank and this sump tank
will<00:03:52.430> be<00:03:52.520> attached<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:54.340> pump<00:03:55.340> with<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.030> switch

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
will be attached to a pump with a switch

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.190 
will be attached to a pump with a switch
we<00:03:57.140> actually<00:03:57.410> picked<00:03:57.650> up<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.820> pumps<00:03:59.270> what<00:03:59.930> is

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
we actually picked up the pumps what is

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.729 
we actually picked up the pumps what is
it<00:04:01.480> anyway<00:04:02.480> it's<00:04:02.750> just<00:04:02.810> do<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.200> switch<00:04:03.470> it'll

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
it anyway it's just do a switch it'll

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.550 
it anyway it's just do a switch it'll
fill<00:04:03.980> up<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.340> when<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:05.090> sump<00:04:05.300> tank<00:04:05.480> has<00:04:06.170> you

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
fill up and when the sump tank has you

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.930 
fill up and when the sump tank has you
know<00:04:06.650> enough<00:04:07.010> water<00:04:07.220> in<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.430> will<00:04:07.670> pump<00:04:07.850> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
know enough water in it will pump the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.130 
know enough water in it will pump the
water<00:04:08.090> back<00:04:08.209> into<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.570> fish<00:04:08.660> tank<00:04:08.959> and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
water back into the fish tank and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.340 
water back into the fish tank and
recycle<00:04:09.620> itself<00:04:09.860> so<00:04:10.450> it'll<00:04:11.450> be<00:04:11.540> four<00:04:11.840> systems

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
recycle itself so it'll be four systems

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.030 
recycle itself so it'll be four systems
indoor<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.480> think<00:04:14.480> I'm<00:04:15.410> I'm<00:04:15.860> really
