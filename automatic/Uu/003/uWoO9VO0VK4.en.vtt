00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
might be a freshman when you walk in

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.760 
might be a freshman when you walk in
social<00:02:18.450> class<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:18.870> i'll<00:02:18.960> hear<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.260> football

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
social class but i'll hear you football

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.620 
social class but i'll hear you football
player<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.280> do<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> see<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.090> confidence

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
player so do you see that confidence

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.330 
player so do you see that confidence
crawling<00:02:21.930> though<00:02:22.020> with<00:02:22.170> yeah<00:02:22.380> absolutely<00:02:22.920> we

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
crawling though with yeah absolutely we

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.430 
crawling though with yeah absolutely we
expect<00:02:23.970> him<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.210> play<00:02:24.330> well<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:24.600> they<00:02:25.050> expect<00:02:25.410> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
expect him to play well I they expect to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.070 
expect him to play well I they expect to
play<00:02:25.620> well<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.100> when<00:02:26.280> they<00:02:26.370> make<00:02:26.520> good<00:02:26.670> plays

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
play well so when they make good plays

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.360 
play well so when they make good plays
you<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.350> that's<00:02:28.530> good<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.010> that's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you know that's that's good but that's

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.360 
you know that's that's good but that's
the<00:02:29.550> expectation<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> play<00:02:30.840> well<00:02:31.050> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
the expectation is to play well and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.270 
the expectation is to play well and
again<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:32.700> there's<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.060> balance<00:02:33.450> between

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
again I think there's a balance between

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.130 
again I think there's a balance between
you<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.400> unrealistic<00:02:35.970> expectation<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:36.990> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
you know unrealistic expectation on the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.570 
you know unrealistic expectation on the
guys<00:02:37.260> never<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.709> make<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> mistake<00:02:38.220> but

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
guys never going to make a mistake but

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.400 
guys never going to make a mistake but
but<00:02:39.060> also<00:02:39.209> that's<00:02:39.540> why<00:02:39.690> they<00:02:39.840> came<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.350> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
but also that's why they came here is to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.290 
but also that's why they came here is to
come<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.770> play<00:02:40.890> be<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> part<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.209> we

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
come and play be a part of this and we

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.880 
come and play be a part of this and we
knew<00:02:42.450> coming<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.230> that's<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.560> lot<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.770> those

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
knew coming in that's a lot of those

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.810 
knew coming in that's a lot of those
young<00:02:44.070> guys<00:02:44.190> probably<00:02:44.430> ought<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> get<00:02:44.730> in

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
young guys probably ought to get in

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.959 
young guys probably ought to get in
there<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:44.970> get<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:45.690> snaps
