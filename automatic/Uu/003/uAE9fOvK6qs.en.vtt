did<00:00:52.230> some<00:00:52.469> research<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.129> found<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
did some research and found out that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.990 
did some research and found out that
sometimes<00:00:54.719> take<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.410> better<00:00:56.070> time<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.760> actually

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
sometimes take a better time to actually

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
sometimes take a better time to actually
get<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> ordered<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> thought

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
get it ordered it to you so I thought

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.939 
get it ordered it to you so I thought
that's<00:00:59.280> fair<00:00:59.609> enough<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> place<00:01:01.649> an<00:01:01.829> order

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that's fair enough so place an order

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
that's fair enough so place an order
with<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.329> waited<00:01:03.719> patiently

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

I'm about hacked off to be honest with
you<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.319> think<00:02:10.319> three<00:02:10.619> months<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> bit

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
you I think three months is a bit

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.280 
you I think three months is a bit
excessive<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.390> wait<00:02:12.569> for

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
excessive to have to wait for

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.240 
excessive to have to wait for
order<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:15.480> don't<00:02:16.409> that<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.590> think<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.099> they

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
order and I don't that I think if they
