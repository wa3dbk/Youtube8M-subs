00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.100
 How much more do I have to lose ... 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.200
 ... so that my heart may be forgiven? 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.180
 How much more pain do I have to endure ... 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.570
 ... before I can see you again? 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.000
 Once again, if the stations only stopped 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.250
 Once again, like when we lost time 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.200
 Whenever we argued, I was the first to apologize 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.340
 Your selfish nature made me fall more in love with you 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.790
 One more opportunity, memories limit my steps 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 One more opportunity, I can not choose my next destination 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.970
 I'm always looking for you wherever I go 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.730
 On the opposite side, in the windows of the train 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.640
 Although I do not expect to find you there 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.790
 If my wish came true, I would be right now with you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.480
 There would be nothing he could not do 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.070
 I would hug you with all my might 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.020
 Although anyone would be well to forget the loneliness 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.890
 Tonight it seems that the stars were going to fall 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.510
 I can not lie 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.030
 Once again, if the stations only stopped 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.940
 Once again, like when we lost time 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.960
 I'm always looking for you wherever I go 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.800
 When crossing the street, and even in my dreams 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.350
 Although I do not expect to find you there 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.170
 If I could ask for a miracle 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.450
 I would like to show you the new dawn and the new me 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.760
 And say the "I love you" that I could never 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.360
 Memories of summer are spinning in my head 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.960
 My heart suddenly stops 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.570
 I'm always looking for you wherever I go 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.280
 At the dawn of the city, on Sakuragi Street 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.020
 Although I do not expect to find you there 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.400
 If my wish came true, I would be right now with you 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.060
 There would be nothing he could not do 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.810
 I would hug you with all my might 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.090
 I'm always looking for signs of you wherever I go 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.770
 In the stores when I travel, in the corners of the newspaper 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.460
 Although I never expect to find you there 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.080
 If I could ask for a miracle 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.460
 I would like to show you the new dawn and the new me 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.220
 And say the "I love you" that I could never 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:33.630
 I always end up looking for your smiling face wherever I go 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.310
 At the crossroads waiting for trains to pass 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.110
 Although I do not expect to find you there 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.580
 His could live my life again 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.520
 I would like to always be by your side 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.310
 Because there is nothing you want in this world 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.520
 Nothing that matters to me as much as being with you
