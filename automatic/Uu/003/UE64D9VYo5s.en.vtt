the Hydra charge it's not available to
you<00:03:27.600> yet<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.170> will<00:03:28.200> be<00:03:28.320> which<00:03:28.920> is

getting very dehydrated and falling
short<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.940> performance<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:43.170> our<00:03:43.380> workouts

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
short of performance so our workouts

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.970 
hours because there was a few of us
training<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.660> we<00:03:49.200> would<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.380> punch<00:03:49.680> off<00:03:49.950> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
training and we would just punch off the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.110 
training and we would just punch off the
adrenaline<00:03:50.600> so<00:03:51.799> again<00:03:52.799> with<00:03:53.730> some<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.060> the

adrenaline so again with some of the
comments<00:03:54.299> people<00:03:54.540> say<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> branched-chain

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
comments people say the branched-chain

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.440 
comments people say the branched-chain
amino<00:03:55.410> acids<00:03:56.190> fantastic<00:03:56.850> awesome<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.330> then

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
amino acids fantastic awesome but then

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.729 
amino acids fantastic awesome but then
others<00:03:57.720> will<00:03:57.750> say<00:03:58.019> well<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.350> doesn't<00:03:58.620> taste

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
this is fermented and we removed around

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.289 
this is fermented and we removed around
seventy<00:04:14.190> percent<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.730> bitter<00:04:14.940> aftertaste
