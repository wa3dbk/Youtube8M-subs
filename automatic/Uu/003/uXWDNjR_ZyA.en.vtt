00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
don't know if it's any faster but when

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.490 
don't know if it's any faster but when
it<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.150> upload<00:05:48.510> it<00:05:48.570> from<00:05:48.630> my<00:05:48.780> phone<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.170> can't<00:05:49.380> do

three<00:05:56.130> hours<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:57.090> upload<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.600> that's<00:05:57.720> really

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
three hours to upload and that's really

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.330
