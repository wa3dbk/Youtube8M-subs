00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 or wool and lists in today's video we're going 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.109
 to learn how to make cherries in 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.109
 nails first let's put a base 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.870
 then we will paint the nails with a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.620
 light color I have chosen the beige 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.620
 perfect beauty 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.759
 As you can see, it's pretty opaque but 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.759
 I will need two layers 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 I remind you that you have all the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.000
 information on tools and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.980
 materials that I have used including 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.910
 nail enamels in the casting of 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.910
 video information 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.430
 then I will use a coral red 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.670
 and with side team tool with the side of the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 thicker point I will draw the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.690
 cherries points 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.619
 I usually do them in pairs and having 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.060
 note that you have to leave a space 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.060
 to paint them rabbitohs 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.530
 then I will use a green 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.409
 this green is not very realistic but to me 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.520
 I really like how it looks like you see 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.520
 a little aquamarine 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:35.460
 with a very thin long brush I'm going to 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.460
 draw the twigs of the cherries 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.979
 the twigs have a v shape too 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.130
 you can draw some sheet to your 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.130
 taste 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.140
 these brushes are very useful to make 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.240
 this type of decoration because barely 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.670
 you have to slide them to make a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.830
 straight line always remember to withdraw 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.000
 the excess at the tip in this way the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.000
 line will be much thinner 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.150
 and draw a few leaves 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.390
 with the same background color as in this 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.580
 case is beige I will make the glitters of 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.300
 the cherries and I'm going to do them with the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.300
 same fine brush 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.610
 finally i will apply owns us 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.110
 is going to give a layer of brightness in addition to 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.110
 protection to our neil art 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.230
