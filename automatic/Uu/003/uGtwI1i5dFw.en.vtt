00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.849
 welcome to the channel of hades place this 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.009
 Occasion I bring you a video of giving you 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.830
 my opinions about cadbury coast that already 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.499
 it came out that four days or so 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.110
 good is my first game that I played 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:20.630
 in this account not in others but in the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.920
 first game I played I do not know how I 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.870
 the truth is I do not know if we win and lose 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.940
 I do not remember anything, I just know that in the background 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.710
 we are going to put the game to the 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.690
 first and I do not know even if it's going to 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.920
 reach for to make this comment 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.140
 and good first thing that provides the game 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.730
 would be the multiplayer the mate what not 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.749
 I tried in the campaign has not tried 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.559
 I already try it on Sunday that I come back good 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.050
 I tried multiplayer 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.149
 The first thing I thought was how is it 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.760
 strange I can not criticize much but 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.109
 it's strange to them since he played pretty 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.839
 I can tell you that it is the call of duty 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.239
 harder than played to date is 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.249
 I could say that they kill me from all sides 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.170
 this is in the center and the maps are 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.569
 so big and have so many points 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.460
 let's say that flats have several levels 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:05.840
 of height that an enemy can be 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.409
 down another up another three of the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.929
 back and move me step 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.109
 Like I notice that when you move, kill me 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:16.719
 when I do cues I notice that I give them something 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.250
 two enemies where they do not expect it and in 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.890
 this game does not die is extremely easy 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.100
 it's something incredible one dies of any 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.840
 thing the machines tricks I like how 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.899
 it works and it works a lot like very 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.520
 Good to see 3 I also like the way 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.619
 create classes and how to 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.329
 unblock it I always liked how 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.340
 was done by points or earn points 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.259
 for any things I always liked 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.709
 that and I do not have to level up is 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.840
 Extremely difficult is quite difficult 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.069
 Earning points is also pretty 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.319
 complicated 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.140
 I like the module of the new mont of 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.049
 game the game the game team new 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.090
 I like how much frenetic I like 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.200
 quite towards the most active game there 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.590
 quite a game mode that I have not 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.479
 tried the fusion breathe search and 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.799
 rescue something like that a luxury at once and 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.399
 I did not call too much attention 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.959
 then then I go back to try the weapons 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.940
 I have not tried the weapons many 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.040
 tried many assault rifles nothing more 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.060
 some I liked others I think 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.220
 so strange 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.870
 I like the connection, I do not, I can not 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.210
 to stay connected is not something like that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.400
 is only affecting a lot here 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.960
 maybe once when I was downloading a 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.910
 mobile was not passing a file and 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.860
 I was listening to youtube music then 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.860
 the game melanie a little but nothing 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.120
 more is not something like the other world that 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.120
 I quite like that everyone has 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.280
 very even connection 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.349
 something that seems strange to me are the heat 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.000
 Markets sometimes'm sure hits it 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.940
 the enemy and I do not get any and I 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.290
 kill and sometimes I see that the enemy already 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.659
 he has put the wall and I can not give him 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.299
 he shot himself and killed him is something strange and 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:52.030
 the truth is I do not understand much how 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.290
 it works that seems strange to me something else 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.540
 that I like quite a bit even if it's a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.519
 extra in the game is like we can 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.440
 dress our soldiers as we want 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.299
 I like that pretty much 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.459
 bunch of soldiers that I'll choose that all 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.379
 he has not touched it much or is not I know I am 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.450
 as level 14 at this time 15 is not 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.310
 something like the other world did not touch many 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.150
 things got disconnected something in my computer 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.150
 I hope the microphone 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.260
 what else else did I call the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.299
 attention did not seem strange that no 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.709
 I had to go the mod 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.659
 I do not think we have to because 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.670
 they put a lot of things in the game and I think 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.159
 that they put a lot of machinery on 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.900
 so I think they took it away so 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.480
 I think they said or did not say 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.280
 Mut because yes and that only complicates a 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.079
 little since you have to be recording by 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.430
 at least we youtubers if we want 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.530
 a game we have to be recording and 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.750
 recording until it does not come out and if it does not come out 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.180
 a part and we did not record we moved like 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.160
 was before seeing warfare2 host but the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.690
 we have I think it's going to be missing in a 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.549
 future I believe that someday more to each 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.859
 party'll tell you fucking did not record 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.200
 that to have a tomahawk or something like 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.940
 that is not good is going to throw something and go 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.010
 there something so incredible and I can not 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.230
 record and it's going to be or not to have is 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.489
 engraving is going to be quite sad a 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.010
 I really like the things 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.290
 animations to put q 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.060
 scream to crouch slip I do not know 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.190
 as you want to tell him and to climb me 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.620
 like those animations is not something 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.200
 different they do not know like a little 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.940
 detail that makes a different game me 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.889
 like that they have copied some things 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.790
 of the ball its because you have to say it 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.460
 basically that 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.620
 to these animations and all that but I 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.650
 I quite like how they work, cautiously 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.000
 they put a new style the game 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.950
 trying that step tour and just that 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 with a new style new way to play it 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.680
 and something that I did not like at all is that 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.080
 they did not encourage in the competitive but what 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.760
 they basically fucked no they did not put 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.380
 competitive in this game mode who 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.780
 he knows how to make it mlg if they are going to 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.910
 do because I see it complicated are maps 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.380
 are complicated I've seen like three if 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.710
 perhaps they are possible to play in 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.570
 competitive but converted is pretty 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.990
 difficult to play this game more than anything 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.670
 for maps that are very open or very 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.350
 closed with many floors then 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.510
 we can simply fall area over 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.880
 in respond shoot from the bottom up is 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.320
 too complicated in that part and 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.170
 let's see what else I can talk to you 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.340
 I liked the extinction mode 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.840
 played a lot and then once for me 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.780
 channel because I did not have much time 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.970
 I was somewhat busy and it did not seem bad 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.730
 I think I play it with friends to 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.280
 see how it works more on that squats and I 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.540
 he liked it enough as one can do 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.460
 that the weapon has more damage can do 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.200
 more things than in super valdemoro 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.900
 albitres squats I like pretty 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.090
 enough you can play the hour created the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.530
 I saw my first campaign Inter the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.390
 first mission before the headley map 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.640
 station and I liked it 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.310
 it was nice about the story that 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.170
 introduction I liked for less and I 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.910
 I think it would be all everything I can 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.490
 talk about woods since multiplayer like 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.160
 from that level 15 very difficult to climb from 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.620
 level did not touch it much then no 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.200
 not for my very specific opinions but 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.690
 would be like the first opinions that 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.130
 put them but as I say the multiplayer 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.080
 it's something different and many complain 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.900
 but I liked the truth, no, it's not 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.970
 something that can complain I remind you that 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.890
 from Friday to Sunday 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.960
 I come back I do not think that in this channel I have 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.640
 many videos and the other week I think 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.800
 I will try to record a video per day 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.840
 more livable in those that I already have ready 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.490
 by moore ferdous that by the way 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.510
 exit I have to finish if it never goes 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.970
 to finish 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.950
 I think we've been like 6 minutes or more 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.930
 least I'm not sure and I do not know how much there is 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.870
 it's example hours and if they have more 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.400
 time I'll leave it longer I think 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.930
 will have to put music because the 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.700
 gaming does not have audio since it was 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.110
 recording in a format that sony vegas 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.060
 number that is not the audio 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.460
 or maybe I get audio I do not know the truth 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.470
 right now I see what I do then I hope that 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.610
 you liked it remember to follow me 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.410
 on twitter if they want to know the 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.940
 information about me has only one 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.740
 description just like the facebook mau no 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.030
 because it is our channel through the network or the 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.800
 twitter that says little things of mine and of 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.060
 this channel later and it would not be all your 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.750
 name robert we have a lot of videos 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.750
 audios
