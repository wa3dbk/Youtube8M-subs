00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640 

I<00:00:01.429> guess<00:00:02.449> one<00:00:03.449> way<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.629> saying<00:00:03.840> well<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.410> say

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
I guess one way of saying well I say

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.110 
I guess one way of saying well I say
let's<00:00:04.799> do<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.040> informal<00:00:05.490> activity<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.940> clay

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
let's do the informal activity of clay

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.990 
let's do the informal activity of clay
we<00:00:06.299> scaffold<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.839> concepts<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.379> ideas<00:00:07.680> and

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
we scaffold the concepts and ideas and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.310 
we scaffold the concepts and ideas and
informally<00:00:09.000> in<00:00:09.120> school<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.660> exacting<00:00:10.080> light

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
informally in school in exacting light

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.180 
informally in school in exacting light
well<00:00:11.719> but<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> problem<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.349> play<00:00:13.679> has<00:00:13.950> no

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
well but the problem is that play has no

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.029 
well but the problem is that play has no
agenda<00:00:16.010> players<00:00:17.010> motivations<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:18.090> entirely

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
agenda players motivations are entirely

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.950 
agenda players motivations are entirely
intrinsic<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.189> personal<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
intrinsic and personal and so the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.660 
intrinsic and personal and so the
question<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:23.160> go<00:00:23.250> back<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.490> our<00:00:23.519> example

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
question is to go back to our example

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.880 
question is to go back to our example
blocks<00:00:24.210> how<00:00:24.750> could<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.019> guarantee<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
blocks how could you guarantee that it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.960 
blocks how could you guarantee that it
just<00:00:26.039> SAT<00:00:26.160> me<00:00:26.279> down<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.609> blocks<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
just SAT me down with the blocks that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.450 
just SAT me down with the blocks that
I've<00:00:27.119> learned<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.029> fact<00:00:30.619> is<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I've learned and in fact is to just to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.729 
I've learned and in fact is to just to
amplify<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.450> bit<00:00:33.540> i<00:00:33.750> feel<00:00:34.350> i<00:00:34.530> think

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
amplify that a little bit i feel i think

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.200 
amplify that a little bit i feel i think
that<00:00:34.860> foreplay<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.430> work<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.790> playing<00:00:36.059> there

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
that foreplay to work is playing there

affordances one of those the freedom to
experiment<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.620> same

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
experiment I think that was that same

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.470 
experiment I think that was that same
with<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.340> i<00:00:44.370> mean<00:00:44.550> by<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.059> visit

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
with what i mean by that just visit

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810 
with what i mean by that just visit
chance<00:00:46.110> driving<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> corollary

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
chance driving that and a corollary

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.940 
chance driving that and a corollary
things<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.210> freedom<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> fail<00:00:48.950> your

things of freedom to fail your

things of freedom to fail your
experiments<00:00:50.430> can't<00:00:50.850> always<00:00:51.120> work<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.199> child

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
experiments can't always work the child

experiments can't always work the child
who<00:00:52.680> built<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> building<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.550> knocks<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
who built the building then knocks it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.209 
who built the building then knocks it
down<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.539> mean<00:00:55.289> maybe<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
down I mean maybe that you know that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
down I mean maybe that you know that
they<00:00:56.579> need<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> ability<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.570> fail<00:00:57.829> they

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
they need that ability to fail they

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529 
they need that ability to fail they
can't<00:00:59.100> give<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> ten<00:00:59.609> build<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> structure

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
can't give you ten build a structure

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.060 
can't give you ten build a structure
that's<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.899> strong<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.379> can't<00:01:01.559> knock<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> down

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that's so strong and can't knock it down

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
that's so strong and can't knock it down
well<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:02.579> suddenly<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> big<00:01:03.210> burden<00:01:03.480> but

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
well that's suddenly a big burden but

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.179 
well that's suddenly a big burden but
the<00:01:03.960> ability<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> build<00:01:04.650> something<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.010> see

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the ability to build something and see

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
the ability to build something and see
what<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.820> takes<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> knock<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> down<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
what it takes to knock it down is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
what it takes to knock it down is
like<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:09.420> freedom<00:01:09.719> to<00:01:09.930> try<00:01:10.170> an<00:01:10.229> identity<00:01:10.829> that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
like the freedom to try an identity that

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 
like the freedom to try an identity that
in<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> child<00:01:12.869> would<00:01:13.110> play<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> dolls

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
in the child would play with the dolls

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
in the child would play with the dolls
as<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.250> example<00:01:14.579> but<00:01:14.789> also<00:01:14.969> just<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> player

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
as an example but also just as a player

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.139 
as an example but also just as a player
that<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.560> freedom<00:01:17.100> today<00:01:17.579> I'm<00:01:17.789> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
that the freedom today I'm going to be a

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.060 
that the freedom today I'm going to be a
really<00:01:18.479> aggressive<00:01:18.750> player<00:01:19.229> next<00:01:19.860> time<00:01:20.039> think

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
really aggressive player next time think

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.069 
really aggressive player next time think
I'm<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> different<00:01:21.659> kind<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
I'm going to be of a different kind of

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.639 
I'm going to be of a different kind of
more<00:01:22.200> thoughtful<00:01:22.619> player<00:01:23.689> this<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.560> know

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
more thoughtful player this you know

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.169 
more thoughtful player this you know
this<00:01:25.829> is<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> first<00:01:26.610> two<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.789> think<00:01:26.909> it's

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
this is what the first two I think it's

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.450 
this is what the first two I think it's
easy<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> relate<00:01:27.569> it<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.460> post-secondary

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
easy to relate it to post-secondary

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
easy to relate it to post-secondary
education<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.020> still

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
education I think this one is still

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.309 
education I think this one is still
important<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.369> post-secondary<00:01:33.179> education<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
important it post-secondary education I

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.620 
important it post-secondary education I
think<00:01:34.770> people<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.069> any<00:01:35.700> life<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.179> general<00:01:36.360> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
think people in any life in general I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.249 
think people in any life in general I
think<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.929> ability<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> keep<00:01:37.710> trying<00:01:38.100> on

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
think the ability to keep trying on

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.410 
think the ability to keep trying on
different<00:01:40.259> approaches<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> world<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:42.149> not

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
different approaches to the world to not

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.320 
different approaches to the world to not
be<00:01:42.689> trapped<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.830> persona<00:01:44.520> venue<00:01:44.970> sort<00:01:45.240> of

that<00:02:11.680> every<00:02:12.010> session<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.490> mentioned<00:02:13.210> all<00:02:13.540> of

these if you think about it that's

really what we all sort of want to see
learning<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:23.140> all<00:02:23.530> imagine<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.970> that's<00:02:25.720> what

what's involved in learning and yet it's

remember in school rarely visible think

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.660 
remember in school rarely visible think
about<00:02:32.560> where<00:02:32.890> are<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> opportunities<00:02:33.220> to

what it takes to be able to play and to

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.140 

so<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.920> get<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.070> my<00:03:53.280> original<00:03:53.430> point<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:54.000> not

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
so to get to my original point it's not

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.430 
so to get to my original point it's not
you<00:03:54.390> know<00:03:54.420> but<00:03:54.750> how<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.960> learn<00:03:55.170> about<00:03:55.260> a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
you know but how you learn about a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.830 
you know but how you learn about a
little<00:03:55.620> bit<00:03:55.770> casual<00:03:56.220> okay<00:03:56.730> it's<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:58.020> glib

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
little bit casual okay it's a it's glib

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.840 
little bit casual okay it's a it's glib
but<00:04:00.840> what<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.830> really<00:04:02.220> mean<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.520> if<00:04:02.670> you've

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
but what I really mean is that if you've

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.670 
but what I really mean is that if you've
learned<00:04:03.150> something<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.810> through<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.470> kind

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
learned something and through that kind

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.440 
learned something and through that kind
of<00:04:04.770> if<00:04:05.070> you've<00:04:05.340> been<00:04:05.490> stuffed<00:04:05.910> when<00:04:06.210> I<00:04:06.240> was
