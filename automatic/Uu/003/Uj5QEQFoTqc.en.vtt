double uploading it should happen over

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.880 
double uploading it should happen over
the<00:01:33.210> next<00:01:33.240> few<00:01:33.630> weeks<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> course<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the next few weeks but of course with

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.670 
the next few weeks but of course with
black<00:01:35.040> ops<00:01:35.250> 2<00:01:35.430> dying<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> mean<00:01:37.049> people

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
black ops 2 dying out now I mean people

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.020 
black ops 2 dying out now I mean people
are<00:01:37.770> fed<00:01:37.979> over<00:01:38.189> people<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.640> bored<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
are fed over people are bored of the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.450 
are fed over people are bored of the
same<00:01:39.060> maps<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.619> DLC<00:01:41.100> could<00:01:41.340> have

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
same maps I think the DLC could have

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
same maps I think the DLC could have
brought<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> fresh<00:01:41.970> new<00:01:42.150> thing<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
brought a fresh new thing to it but the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.450 
brought a fresh new thing to it but the
matchmaking<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> DLC<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.130> just

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
matchmaking on the DLC is just

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.969 
matchmaking on the DLC is just
absolutely<00:01:44.939> terrible<00:01:45.659> unless<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.439> only<00:01:46.649> want

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
absolutely terrible unless you only want

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.920 
absolutely terrible unless you only want
to<00:01:47.070> play<00:01:47.220> 6v6<00:01:47.640> DOM<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.329> only<00:01:48.450> real<00:01:48.689> way<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
to play 6v6 DOM is the only real way you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.469 
to play 6v6 DOM is the only real way you
can<00:01:49.140> consistently<00:01:49.829> find<00:01:50.220> games<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:51.299> is

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
can consistently find games which is

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
can consistently find games which is
just<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.990> broken<00:01:52.409> way<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> doing<00:01:53.159> things<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.549> my

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
just a broken way of doing things in my

just a broken way of doing things in my
opinion<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.920> hoping

to keep up the speed of the game the
smoothness<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.780> infinity<00:02:19.230> war<00:02:19.380> games<00:02:19.620> is

an amazing game but death streaks
absolutely<00:03:25.830> ruined<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.520> support<00:03:27.270> was

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
absolutely ruined it and support was

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.380 
absolutely ruined it and support was
stupid<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:27.959> mean<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.380> was<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> good<00:03:28.890> idea<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.880> in

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
stupid I mean it was a good idea but in

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.090 
stupid I mean it was a good idea but in
terms<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.810> YouTube<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.410> turned<00:03:31.620> out<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.920> be<00:03:32.070> a

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
terms of YouTube it turned out to be a

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.010 
terms of YouTube it turned out to be a
bad<00:03:32.430> thing<00:03:32.489> because<00:03:33.120> personally<00:03:33.780> although<00:03:33.930> i

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
bad thing because personally although i

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.780 
bad thing because personally although i
have<00:03:34.260> used<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.620> lot<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.830> support<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.400> past<00:03:35.640> i

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
have used a lot of support in the past i

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.150 
have used a lot of support in the past i
would<00:03:35.910> much<00:03:36.120> rather<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:37.110> solo<00:03:37.590> stuff<00:03:37.860> was

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
would much rather that solo stuff was

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160 
would much rather that solo stuff was
what<00:03:38.730> everyone<00:03:39.120> watched<00:03:39.300> on<00:03:39.480> youtube<00:03:39.810> i<00:03:39.930> think

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
what everyone watched on youtube i think

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.229 
what everyone watched on youtube i think
it'd<00:03:40.290> be<00:03:40.410> much<00:03:40.680> more<00:03:40.920> enjoyable<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.550> really

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
it'd be much more enjoyable and really

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.790 
it'd be much more enjoyable and really
show<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.630> better<00:03:42.810> players<00:03:43.140> from<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.500> ones

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
show the better players from the ones

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.460 
show the better players from the ones
that<00:03:44.370> really<00:03:44.610> do<00:03:44.970> rely<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.420> support<00:03:46.020> because

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that really do rely on support because

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.290 
that really do rely on support because
some<00:03:46.739> people<00:03:47.040> do<00:03:47.220> some<00:03:47.670> people<00:03:47.700> don't<00:03:48.090> some

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
some people do some people don't some

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.180 
some people do some people don't some
people<00:03:48.330> halfway<00:03:48.840> i<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.380> get<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.830> solid

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
people halfway i can get some solid

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.520 
people halfway i can get some solid
gameplay<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.450> just<00:03:51.750> really<00:03:52.170> think<00:03:52.350> it'd<00:03:52.500> be

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
gameplay but I just really think it'd be

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.320 
gameplay but I just really think it'd be
good<00:03:52.680> if<00:03:52.830> they<00:03:53.070> focus<00:03:53.520> on<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.760> game<00:03:53.880> so

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
good if they focus on the game so

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.760 
good if they focus on the game so
there's<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:54.840> good<00:03:54.900> balance<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.410> works<00:03:55.620> how

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
there's very good balance of works how

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.170 
there's very good balance of works how
bad<00:03:55.950> for<00:03:56.130> YouTube<00:03:56.489> obviously<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.030> don't

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
bad for YouTube obviously they don't

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.240 
bad for YouTube obviously they don't
make<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.540> game<00:03:57.690> for<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.930> youtubers<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.010> just

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
make the game for the youtubers but just

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.880 
make the game for the youtubers but just
from<00:03:59.730> youtubers<00:04:00.480> point<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.959> view<00:04:01.200> that's<00:04:01.650> what

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
from youtubers point of view that's what

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.770 
from youtubers point of view that's what
I<00:04:01.920> would<00:04:02.160> love<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.580> see<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.030> some<00:04:03.330> kind<00:04:03.600> of

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
I would love to see it's some kind of

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.080 
I would love to see it's some kind of
fresh<00:04:04.170> game<00:04:04.500> where<00:04:04.950> things<00:04:05.220> can<00:04:05.459> last<00:04:05.730> longer

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
fresh game where things can last longer

a<00:04:06.390> MOAB<00:04:07.050> type<00:04:07.410> thing<00:04:07.650> would<00:04:07.800> always<00:04:08.040> be<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
a MOAB type thing would always be the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.890 
a MOAB type thing would always be the
best<00:04:08.489> thing<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.850> see<00:04:09.030> my<00:04:09.209> opinion<00:04:09.570> or<00:04:09.690> really

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
best thing to see my opinion or really

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.350 
best thing to see my opinion or really
anything<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.290> keep<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.160> game<00:04:11.370> going<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:12.150> lot

anything that keep the game going a lot
longer<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.019> then<00:04:13.350> obviously<00:04:13.590> we<00:04:13.890> always<00:04:14.250> come

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
longer and then obviously we always come

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.560 
longer and then obviously we always come
up<00:04:14.519> with<00:04:14.610> different<00:04:14.760> ways<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.239> create<00:04:15.450> things
