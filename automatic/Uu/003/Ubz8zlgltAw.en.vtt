00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.190
 on exclusive channel 4 and the work of the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
 clay with partner enrique weapons 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.160
 brings you a series of reports 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.160
 specials from italy 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.610
 this is the plaza san pedro from the 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.470
 Vatican interviews with parishioners of 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.870
 everyone about the abdication of 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.280
 papa the least surprising I think that 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.580
 nobody was expected to give up the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.840
 Pope at this time already as a short time 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.210
 the man is older but he has little 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.570
 time in office then surprising 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.000
 I think that if it really is about issues of 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.860
 health I think it's okay if you can not 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.500
 give all that I think should give 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.360
 it's fine every change is believed to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.010
 we will have a european dad or we will have a 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.010
 dad from another continent I would like 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.410
 that in San Pedro square all are taken 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.540
 security measures is the seat of 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.119
 Catholics around the world and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.130
 home of the successor of Pedro the companion 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.170
 enrique armas describes us with details 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.420
 how does day to day work in this 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.520
 Vatican City we will also know 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.400
 how it was lived in the last mass of the Pope 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.990
 Benedict 16 last Wednesday of 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.300
 ashes the really is a moment 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 historical because 800 years ago that a 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.689
 Supreme Pontiff 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.189
 He did not renounce their mandates and what I 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.930
 could watch here on television in 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.000
 all Italian television 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 and the repercussion that I have had in the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 world is that everyone speaks well of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.890
 Benedict 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.530
 he misses it and the word that is most 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.810
 hear about what he has done is 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.310
 the word courage since he has had the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.520
 courage to say good 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.530
 with righteousness of conscience I have arrived 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.659
 up to here fulfilling the will of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.550
 God assisted by the will of God 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.550
 but my physical forces no longer give us 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.340
