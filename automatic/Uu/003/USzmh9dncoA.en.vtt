00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
way to do it provided the cat doesn't

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
way to do it provided the cat doesn't
have<00:01:19.500> too<00:01:19.740> long<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> coder<00:01:20.340> isn't<00:01:20.670> too<00:01:20.790> tangled

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
have too long a coder isn't too tangled

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
have too long a coder isn't too tangled
because<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.140> actually<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> look

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
because you don't actually have to look

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.640

you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> comb<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you can just do the comb like this and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
you can just do the comb like this and
then<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
then what you do is you take this and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.999 
then what you do is you take this and
you're<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> put<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.439> over<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.740> white
