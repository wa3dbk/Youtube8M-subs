00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello friends today I phone them 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.700
 teach what is the address 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.800
 this hidden game or emulator that is 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 based what it is on what he himself 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.150
 that it has is ideal to emulate 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.100
 mommy games was born well in this 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.779
 this game even though it's the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.050
 description says it's based on the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.090
 mmamm and it's practically a dame for 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.470
 our device what we should do 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 is to connect our device to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.179
 computer have games for example me 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.720
 here I have some tests and I tried it my 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.450
 ipad 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.410
 for example these games here and I 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 I will select all 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.620
 let's copy 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 and to enter it into the application we 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.480
 let's go to our pc if you have intel water and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.420
 When they enter, they will appear 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.150
 dispositives 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.400
 we must enter here 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.070
 the folders will appear 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.079
 we look for the fire 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.170
 after that we go to documents 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.080
 to the rooms folder to take the games 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.820
 that is the game that brings this half bad 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.470
 copied in front was doing a 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 test but we will not think that you do not 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.390
 let's replace everything 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.039
 the games will be copied and given 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 realize that what this game presents is 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.750
 practically a manipulator emulator 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 that formerly was in the production company 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.630
 but it was removed because they were given 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 account that users downloaded in 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.170
 the emulator but the roms got them down 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 illegally and that influences what it was 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.700
 copyright so obviously 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.890
 they went back up 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.310
 that is the game that supposedly brings 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310
 test 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.610
 does not have does not have much 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.340
 small but 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.160
 if they knew how to make these opening 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.040
 realize that it is a good emulator 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.770
 here we have the games are from neo geo 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.140
 I put the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.239
 biotechnology has no problems here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.690
 they are already in then now at 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.690
 enter 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.120
 As you can see, it detects me the games 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 also what is it that he was the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.510
 emulator that was in chair 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.769
 but have the configurations in the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.769
 games that we copy 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.290
 let's talk about what it is 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.060
 that's a 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.930
 if not euros 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.930
 let's squeeze 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.069
 to start 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.600
 we have the green button with exit star 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.890
 good the configurations and you 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.500
 can see all that photons are 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.750
 in landscape to play sideways and what 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.420
 they carry but that's the way for 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.020
 can have their games inside the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.020
 device 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.770
 let's talk to each other 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:39.810
 and so all the sites have to throw 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.750
 corresponding inside lips so that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.490
 have no problem 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.490
 and they can enjoy all 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.360
 well that's a part of today you know 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.730
 with whom they can enter the folders and 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.349
 copy the games directly to their 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.799
 dispositives 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.799
 regards
