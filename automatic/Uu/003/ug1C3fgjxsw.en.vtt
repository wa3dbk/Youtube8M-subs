00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.160
 check out jec's blog 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:13.320
 today with 26 the battle of the 85 millimeters 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.389
 1 point 2 f r2 f sm 1.4 g which is a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.310
 almost classic battle here on 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.960
 Let's talk about canon and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.520
 nikon that is a question that I always 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 I got from you there 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.119
 and here we have a good difference 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.279
 of the two manufacturers you always 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.510
 ask what you use you prefer 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.949
 canon and nikon 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.050
 and here we have two specifications 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.469
 who can simply end this 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.690
 video now because the canon ef 85 f 1 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.950
 point 2 02 m she f 1 point 2 ea nikon f 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 1.4 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.719
 the canon is the only one that has f 1 point 2 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 with auto focus on the market today and 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.890
 As I said malt f is great the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 enough thing that malt 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.320
 we just do not have it and we have 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.750
 a bunch of people out there r 1.4 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.980
 sigma a or asae has just announced 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 others 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.830
 we have r 1.4 from nikon and the canon is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 only one that has effect 1.2 then there is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 The argument ends that I do not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.310
 comparison type 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.920
 because of this one goes up to 1.2 that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.560
 two thirds are the most light and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.290
 another only goes up to 1.4 of any 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.990
 way it has operation completely 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 different and I have both in my kit 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.189
 for very different reasons and that is why 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.250
 What are we going to do here, the battle vdz? 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.460
 85 mm or not in the single let 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.500
 start with 85 1.2 the canon being the video 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 most recent one we've seen and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340
 construction is the first thing you 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.220
 note is that this is a lot but a lot 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 large is almost one kilo is one kilo and 25 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.259
 grams there of glass and metal and gives work 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 of photographing with this you can 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.070
 see here in my hand how she stands 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.810
 large it is well balanced but it is 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.299
 Difficult you can see here in my 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.280
 Arm you work compliment is with a 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.159
 arm you just have to hold with the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.100
 two is a lens is released in 2006 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.180
 this hood that rocks a little is a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.670
 lens heavy thing 85 1.4 g of nikon 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.830
 It's a pleasure to work this out here. 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.340
 can balance with three little fingers in the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.030
 camera 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.459
 are only 660 grams or is it is almost less 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.680
 of the tables half abnormal a little bit 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.540
 more than half of the canon and she is 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.920
 much easier to work with 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.349
 You see she's a little bit too 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.049
 the smaller it is a construction even more 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.549
 modern think it's 2008 nine or ten 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.220
 I know which of these three years is she? 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.290
 more recent than the canon and so is the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.120
 here my plays my favorite lens 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.920
 because it makes a difference 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.349
 great you can work here 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.260
 Full day made the bag here. 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.690
 building death 1.4 g I prefer one 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.150
 g point which is much lighter easy to 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.819
 use full day charge and canon 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.489
 evident is only one point and two per 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.440
 this she has much more glass can 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.650
 see here on muque in jec's blog she is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.739
 much heavier then in construction 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.720
 I prefer operating 1.4 people 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.579
 also has the two with auto focus and 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.709
 without exclusivity here in that we go 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.709
 dismount the rudes here for you to see 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.660
 how they operate here were as I said 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.660
 she has a motor the fm she had a 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.639
 ring is easy to go so it is not hitched 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.560
 mechanically here in my mind 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.959
 he needs electric power is if 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.780
 off that my camera 5d're connected 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.209
 and it will require nothing happens I have to 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.019
 power supply to the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.489
 lens and then it will operate here beron 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.310
 that you come there that he 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.349
 including and stir it expands here it 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.349
 not the fastest because they 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:44.069
 made the 270 degree design decision 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.750
 precision beach the 95 focus 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.970
 centimeters that connect the two 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.799
 infinite while the canon is going to walk 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.109
 slightly until near the microphone to 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.109
 You listen, it's going to make a super way. 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:03.269
 a nikon f 1.4 genão she has only 45 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.130
 degrees of precision so here the 85 she 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.549
 actually goes a little closer 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.519
 here than the canon from the 85 to the ooo 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.139
 infinite is only 45 degrees is much smaller 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.810
 so much faster you guys 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.940
 can see that nothing expands here in the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.530
 that is different from the one of the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.789
 You see here they will put in infinity her 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.620
 growing here 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.510
 nikon does not have this problem at all 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.550
 expand completely internally and 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.140
 it's back is a lot more design 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.270
 a little more resistant because 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.180
 do not have the two tubes here the tube 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.460
 of the external canon or nikon is only 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.860
 internal and also an extremely 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.900
 fast autofocus while the cane 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.630
 not only 45 degrees 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.090
 the engine here swm is as quiet as 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.250
 They'll squeeze the microphone here for you. 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.770
 listen to you the most when you listen 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.670
 it arrives at the end there from infinity the focus 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.670
 we'll try again 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.740
 she is much faster to do this 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.190
 way of construction and 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.530
 operation I continue to air 1.4 because it 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.480
 is lighter the easier to use the focus is 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.340
 much faster it does not expand too 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.230
 is mechanical and you will see that it has the 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.300
 full time better when I'm stirring 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.210
 Here the ring is not the same as here that the 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.250
 fire is mechanically connected has full 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.780
 team in any position I 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.410
 you are here df 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.630
 besides the mm he will operate this ring 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.670
 then it comes a damn thing 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.460
 simple that was how to open this video 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.740
 on the other hand the canon will have some 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.310
 point two that are images is 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.020
 necessarily different from the west 1.4 and 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.230
 if you want to have this exclusive opening 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.050
 is all this possibility of pulling the 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.660
 into your camera just 1.2 here 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.940
 will not do and the people you have with you 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.550
 rest of other manufacturers will stay 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.590
 with 1.4 and here my argument here in 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:01.140
 Battle of Canon E 20 is 85mm from the west 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.870
 1.202 or nikon fs 1.4 g 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.700
 Which is better, I honestly do not know 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.190
 I'm like the two transmission 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.320
 the tops to portray in any of the 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.210
 manufacturers do not have to 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.680
 understands how he behind that same 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.140
 who owns a car behind nikon 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.270
 remembering that depending on what you do 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.080
 in fact and maybe make some sort of 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.150
 sense 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.310
 nikon with that fastest focus there and 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.380
 also suitable for sports while 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.360
 the canon i would not recommend for this would have 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.480
 much more prepared it will depend 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.850
 there in an autofocus system very 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.010
 Hot sophisticated does not have until today 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.560
 then it is so slow to follow will not 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.120
 cars on the track people playing on the court 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.669
 in 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.389
 how does he do it but then again 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:47.120
 1.2 is only canon ef and there we have 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:49.100
 so the battle of the 85 millimeters 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.330
 here is the blog of zé I want to send a 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.669
 Hugs to you 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.530
 from the hill where I always hope to have 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.060
 send messages and 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.530
 comments are in any doubt that 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.680
 I know the answer of the two that are here. 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.190
 my favorite top medium telephoto on 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.190
