as it not enhance and I think it's it's
a<00:00:25.810> perspective<00:00:26.470> he<00:00:26.650> kind<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:26.890> take<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.160> step

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250

back we've we've seen this before it's

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.960 
back we've we've seen this before it's
been<00:00:29.830> a<00:00:29.860> while<00:00:30.100> it's<00:00:30.310> been<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.550> while<00:00:30.760> since

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
been a while it's been a while since

been a while it's been a while since
they've<00:00:31.180> not<00:00:31.600> started<00:00:32.110> 2<00:00:32.260> and<00:00:32.440> 0<00:00:32.559> so<00:00:33.129> we've

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
they've not started 2 and 0 so we've

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.820 
they've not started 2 and 0 so we've
seen<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.730> program<00:00:34.150> go<00:00:34.360> through<00:00:34.600> bumps<00:00:35.050> does

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
seen this program go through bumps does

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.530 
seen this program go through bumps does
it<00:00:35.949> come<00:00:36.070> out<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.250> it<00:00:36.430> every<00:00:36.610> year<00:00:36.760> no<00:00:37.120> but

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
it come out of it every year no but

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.910 
it come out of it every year no but
there<00:00:37.690> are<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.809> lot<00:00:37.960> of<00:00:37.989> instances<00:00:38.379> where<00:00:38.770> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
there are a lot of instances where the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.220 
there are a lot of instances where the
program<00:00:39.340> has<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:40.030> it's<00:00:40.570> two<00:00:40.690> games<00:00:40.900> into<00:00:41.110> the

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
program has and it's two games into the

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.990 
program has and it's two games into the
year<00:00:41.410> so<00:00:41.650> let's<00:00:41.860> kind<00:00:42.129> of<00:00:42.250> see<00:00:42.489> how<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:42.820> plays

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
year so let's kind of see how this plays

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.790 
year so let's kind of see how this plays
through<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:43.659> guess<00:00:43.900> what<00:00:44.110> was<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.290> little<00:00:44.680> bit

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
through I guess what was a little bit

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.229 
through I guess what was a little bit
startling<00:00:45.159> for<00:00:45.430> everyone<00:00:45.790> who<00:00:45.879> has<00:00:45.909> followed

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
startling for everyone who has followed

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.469 
startling for everyone who has followed
badger<00:00:46.629> football<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:48.010> inability<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.360> move

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
badger football is the inability to move

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.420 
badger football is the inability to move
the<00:00:49.690> chains<00:00:49.960> on<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.320> ground<00:00:50.559> we<00:00:50.800> have<00:00:51.159> seen

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
the chains on the ground we have seen

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.820 
the chains on the ground we have seen
teams<00:00:51.729> struggle<00:00:52.269> offensively<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.559> really

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
teams struggle offensively but really

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.060 
teams struggle offensively but really
not<00:00:53.979> to<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:54.370> degree<00:00:54.400> in<00:00:54.940> any<00:00:55.360> recent<00:00:56.260> memory

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
not to that degree in any recent memory

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.070 
not to that degree in any recent memory
and<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.879> I<00:00:57.909> think<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.570> source<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.930> more

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
and that I think is the source of more

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.719 
and that I think is the source of more
frustration<00:00:59.530> than<00:00:59.710> anything<00:01:00.100> else<00:01:00.280> oh<00:01:00.430> sure

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
frustration than anything else oh sure

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.310 
frustration than anything else oh sure
let's<00:01:00.970> do<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.330> this<00:01:01.420> face<00:01:01.659> of<00:01:01.809> this<00:01:01.839> offense

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
let's do to this face of this offense

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.079 
let's do to this face of this offense
has<00:01:02.350> put<00:01:02.559> up<00:01:02.650> some<00:01:02.710> record<00:01:03.129> numbers<00:01:03.460> here<00:01:03.970> in

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
has put up some record numbers here in

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.610 
has put up some record numbers here in
the<00:01:04.180> last<00:01:04.330> few<00:01:04.570> years<00:01:04.629> ago<00:01:04.960> seems<00:01:05.260> like<00:01:05.409> one

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
the last few years ago seems like one

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.280 
the last few years ago seems like one
year<00:01:05.770> trumps<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.700> previous<00:01:07.330> year<00:01:07.600> and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
year trumps the previous year and

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.500 
year trumps the previous year and
they've<00:01:08.409> had<00:01:08.560> balance<00:01:09.040> offensively<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:10.270> maybe

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
they've had balance offensively to maybe

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.789 
they've had balance offensively to maybe
that's<00:01:10.720> one<00:01:10.900> of<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.049> hidden<00:01:11.200> things<00:01:11.560> here

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
that's one of the hidden things here

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.440 
that's one of the hidden things here

defense<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.890> been<00:01:24.039> really<00:01:24.280> kind<00:01:24.399> of<00:01:24.549> funnel<00:01:24.789> in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
defense it been really kind of funnel in

defense it been really kind of funnel in
on<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.210> running

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's been it's been a tough go I mean

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
situations where maybe they could have

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.400 
situations where maybe they could have
done<00:01:32.180> some<00:01:32.570> things<00:01:32.750> better<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.080> their<00:01:33.290> own

confidence in they come in Mike with a
very<00:03:12.200> aggressive<00:03:12.620> defense<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.850> last<00:03:14.180> week

very aggressive defense that last week

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.990 
very aggressive defense that last week
was<00:03:14.720> blitzing<00:03:15.260> from<00:03:15.560> all<00:03:15.800> angles<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:16.850> is

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
was blitzing from all angles so this is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.780 
was blitzing from all angles so this is
going<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.300> be<00:03:17.420> quite<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.530> test<00:03:18.800> regardless<00:03:19.670> of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
going to be quite the test regardless of

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.760 
going to be quite the test regardless of
the<00:03:19.910> situation<00:03:20.060> with<00:03:20.600> responsive<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.560> maybe

especially so on that and it's almost a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.570 
especially so on that and it's almost a
worst-case<00:03:24.200> scenario<00:03:24.800> come<00:03:25.130> back<00:03:25.310> home

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
defense and rightly so I understand it I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.650 
defense and rightly so I understand it I
get<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.769> but<00:04:10.489> that<00:04:10.910> was<00:04:11.120> one<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.540> more

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
get it but that was one of the more

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.930 
get it but that was one of the more
promising<00:04:12.320> elements<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.190> loss<00:04:13.370> at<00:04:13.580> Oregon

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
promising elements to the loss at Oregon

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.220 
promising elements to the loss at Oregon
State<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.180> thought<00:04:14.480> with<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.720> exception<00:04:15.170> of

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
State I thought with the exception of

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.710 
State I thought with the exception of
maybe<00:04:15.920> one<00:04:16.280> bust<00:04:16.580> in<00:04:16.790> one<00:04:17.000> long<00:04:17.239> series

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
maybe one bust in one long series

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.539 
maybe one bust in one long series
Wisconsin<00:04:18.290> defensively<00:04:18.769> played<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.280> type<00:04:19.519> of

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
Wisconsin defensively played the type of

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.740 
Wisconsin defensively played the type of
defense<00:04:19.970> that<00:04:20.120> they're<00:04:20.269> going<00:04:20.390> to<00:04:20.450> need<00:04:20.600> to

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
defense that they're going to need to

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.120 
defense that they're going to need to
play<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.049> rest<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.470> year<00:04:21.620> yeah<00:04:21.830> they<00:04:21.950> did

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
play the rest of the year yeah they did

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.590 
play the rest of the year yeah they did
I<00:04:22.160> thought<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.520> really<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.060> game<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.450> saw

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
I thought I really in the game you saw

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.450 
I thought I really in the game you saw
the<00:04:23.660> corners<00:04:24.110> give<00:04:24.350> space<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.190> Oregon

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the corners give space to the Oregon

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.610 
the corners give space to the Oregon
State<00:04:25.700> receivers<00:04:26.210> maybe<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.900> little<00:04:27.080> bit<00:04:27.290> bend

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
State receivers maybe a little bit bend

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.800 
State receivers maybe a little bit bend
but<00:04:27.800> don't<00:04:27.830> break<00:04:28.100> but<00:04:28.490> bright<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.479> was<00:04:29.600> three

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
but don't break but bright it was three

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.360

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
touchdown really in the third quarter
