00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 all friends of androids years point 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.220
 com I wanted to show you this today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.639
 new purchase an adapter or tg taken 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.059
 on amazon for the modest sum of 4 euros 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.410
 and 40 shipped nothing let's enter 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:25.010
 precisely this device with the key 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:27.750
 back inside the tablet was 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.849
 automatically opens ours 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.730
 program bought nexus media 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.570
 importer which is essential for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.540
 the operation without ruth we go into 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:47.460
 here stream and soon our video 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:51.329
 should start the player used is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.579
 vs free player which works a lot 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.960
 I would say well 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.960
 and here is our movie that started 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:05.329
 I would say the hardware was fluid 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.329
 of our tablet tablet if allowed 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.240
 it is a very comfortable solution because 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.370
 the tablet just as we all know 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.550
 it does not have a large interior space 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.730
 if decisive they are limiting in many 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.730
 situations 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.570
 the only flaw to have this 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.130
 attacked contraption I preferred to buy 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.810
 adapter rather than the cable for 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.210
 limit even more 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.710
 the clutter that shaft stick here that 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.110
 is using a thumb drive from 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.110
 4gb quite poor 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.700
 but I believe that for the fluidity of the film 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 in short, it is sufficient 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.830
 some of you will have already recognized the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 film this does not matter 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.900
 through these solutions we can have 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.800
 also other alternatives for example 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.190
 connect a mouse to connect a joypad 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.630
 of the playstation 3 connect a hard 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.970
 disk 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.320
 in short, the solutions are many 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.880
 android allows us to do it and nothing 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.700
 this is what I wanted to share with 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 you my experience and the purchase 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.970
 in fact, hello is recommended to all
