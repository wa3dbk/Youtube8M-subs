00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello you love today I show you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.549
 like her super delicious and healthy 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.960
 can make pancakes and I have 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.420
 now in two different variations 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.219
 I made or the recipe of the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.240
 love bloggers than that will be some 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.240
 surely you can 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:38.550
 The other variant is still green 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.250
 and then it works with the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.160
 get started first you take your 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.300
 stop that in a bowl on so 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.860
 I have that in such a small one now 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.229
 The mixing bowl actually made itself 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.539
 are very good for it then you take the 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.880
 banana and cut off half of it 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.560
 and yes, half of them are now using for 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.030
 the dough and the other you can later 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.220
 to use garnish 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.959
 In any case, this half cuts 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.270
 you're just a bit small and give 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.380
 moreover 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.940
 and yes you can actually quite 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.940
 but I think it would be easy 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.440
 later easier to mix 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.899
 then I have such a small cup here 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.310
 taken and used the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.789
 americans always as a unit of measure so 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.869
 that it's a cup the world over 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.039
 you need a third cup for that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.569
 so oatmeal a third cup 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.090
 but that's just such a small one there 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.470
 you have to take care of it and me 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 you can still take a bit more have 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.190
 Flakes because I'm always afraid that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.020
 I take too little and then the dough 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.610
 somehow too fluid or something because 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 I think that's the first time 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.440
 happens and then you take your milk 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.410
 which you have chosen and takes 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.670
 a quarter of it and give that too and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.860
 i am sorry that i am all the time 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.840
 say I know that means take 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.340
 but somehow the whole promise me 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.540
 Time 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.190
 and yes that's the dough then I'll take 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.040
 always a spoon and stir that already 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.239
 times through is actually unnecessary though 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.700
 no idea I want that then always 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.990
 already a bit before and through 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.640
 then I take that way 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.180
 It used to be called i or 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.040
 wandmixer as the name of the wandmixer and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.230
 however this device is called 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 I simply change this mass 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.370
 so that yield a good day 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.020
 and neither bananas nor oatmeal 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.090
 somehow brock I swims around in it 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.740
 and because I have two different ones 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 I wanted to show variations now 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.370
 a little bit of the dough in one 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.010
 other bowl rhine given and have 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.630
 then done a lot to carry and when 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.540
 I have the greater amount of day 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.370
 about two to three teaspoons of cacau 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.860
 I believe tricked then the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.500
 nice chocolate and yes then I have 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.000
 the both just done well and 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.400
 with the cocoa part you have to take care 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.720
 is the cocoa really starts that way through the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.850
 so please fly a bit 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.290
 quiet then the pancakes come too 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.560
 already the front but first 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.140
 get some olive oil in and jan 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.240
 The day comes in there and I have there 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.640
 now no mini pancakes made 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.100
 so blocked that always makes it so 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.440
 long so that's right so long 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.240
 are distributed over the entire front 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.650
 but I wanted so small minis now 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.390
 I think they are very cute somehow 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.000
 you can stack that as well as we can 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.440
 already seen at the beginning and yes there 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.330
 I put directly in the pan and 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.910
 At some point, they had to be turned around 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.520
 but of course I do not get it that way 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.230
 well, and then there all the time 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.400
 somehow it 's time to turn around 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.340
 but it just did not work 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.250
 because i dont like this case if you are 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.200
 hebe please mama please how the part is called 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.940
 I somehow never know such things 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.680
 In any case, I have that way 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.590
 brought a second valley and then have the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.230
 finally managed to turn one over each 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.660
 applause for me and then they were 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.070
 continue and sizzle the second had to 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.770
 Of course, first of all turned around 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.240
 of course I will have it first, too 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.710
 not so much in the program but with the 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.880
 second , it works quite well 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.190
 So that's a good tip 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.140
 and then I have the pentax after 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.180
 The series just continued to roast 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.950
 the zim parts thereof are not now so 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.070
 many got out and then stop 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.720
 more of these chocolate things and yes 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.430
 My sister helped me to refurbish 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.170
 So helped my big sister was 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.910
 somehow with me, I think so 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.740
 It's not always that good 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.419
 now the end result of the simple 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.130
 packs that were now three pieces and 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.940
 in between, always no cream cheese 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.650
 and blueberries and above 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.030
 but you still maple syrup the chocolate 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.590
 pancakes are just yourself 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.050
 stacked on top of each other and it's like 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.090
 a giant muffin and over it 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.830
 blueberries apples must and even 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.840
 made popcorn 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.760
 and I think in this picture we see 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.200
 Again, it was delicious 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.010
 bye bye bye bye and bye today 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.010
 Until next time
