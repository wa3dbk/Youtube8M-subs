to<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.420> my<00:02:09.599> next<00:02:09.869> upload<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.069> might

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
to do for my next upload and that might

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.490 
to do for my next upload and that might
take<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.520> while<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.209> record<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.020> stuff<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
take a while to record and stuff so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.930 
take a while to record and stuff so
don't<00:02:13.530> expect<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> come<00:02:14.400> out<00:02:14.459> right<00:02:14.760> away

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
don't expect it to come out right away

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.240 
don't expect it to come out right away
but<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.050> think<00:02:16.290> he'll<00:02:16.379> be<00:02:16.410> pretty<00:02:16.680> funny<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.160> it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
but I think he'll be pretty funny and it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.820 
but I think he'll be pretty funny and it
has<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.430> relate<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:17.940> my<00:02:18.480> rant<00:02:18.810> video<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.530> first

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
has to relate to my rant video the first

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.589 
has to relate to my rant video the first
one<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.670> maybe<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.090> second<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:21.420> I'm<00:02:21.510> not

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
one and maybe the second one I'm not

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.970 
one and maybe the second one I'm not
quite<00:02:21.810> sure<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.020> haven't<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.349> developed<00:02:22.560> it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
quite sure I haven't really developed it

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.430 
quite sure I haven't really developed it
yet<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.150> pretty<00:02:24.270> interesting<00:02:24.599> idea<00:02:25.140> I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
yet but it's a pretty interesting idea I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.589 
yet but it's a pretty interesting idea I

won't tell you what it is because it's

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.759
