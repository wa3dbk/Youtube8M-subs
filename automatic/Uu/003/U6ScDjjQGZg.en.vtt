let's<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> quick<00:01:55.200> tour<00:01:55.439> around<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
let's have a quick tour around the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.950 
let's have a quick tour around the
device<00:01:56.310> itself<00:01:56.790> first<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.780> we'll<00:01:57.930> start

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
device itself first of all we'll start

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.950 
device itself first of all we'll start
off<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> top<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.490> got<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.939> micro<00:02:00.630> SIM

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
off on the top we have got the micro SIM

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.870 
off on the top we have got the micro SIM
tray<00:02:00.990> which<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.799> must<00:02:02.070> say<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.310> terms<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.670> build

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
tray which I must say in terms of build

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
tray which I must say in terms of build
quality<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> only<00:02:03.780> slight<00:02:04.200> letdown<00:02:04.680> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
quality is the only slight letdown in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.190 
quality is the only slight letdown in
the<00:02:05.219> fact<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.610> does<00:02:05.790> sometimes<00:02:06.390> protrude

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the fact that it does sometimes protrude

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.650 
the fact that it does sometimes protrude
just<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.799> little<00:02:08.190> next<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.479> got

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
just a little next to that we have got

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.380 
just a little next to that we have got
the<00:02:09.899> micro<00:02:10.560> sim<00:02:11.009> port<00:02:11.310> along<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.760> 3.5

that beautiful finish and again exactly

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.220 
that beautiful finish and again exactly
the<00:02:35.829> same<00:02:36.159> around<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.939> the<00:02:37.390> left<00:02:37.629> hand<00:02:37.870> side

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the same around on the left hand side

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.280 
the same around on the left hand side
now<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> front<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.060> got<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.810> screen

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
now on the front we have got the screen

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.179 
now on the front we have got the screen
itself

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
itself

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.399 
itself
now<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.579> screen<00:02:42.939> itself<00:02:43.329> doesn't<00:02:43.629> have<00:02:43.959> the

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
now the screen itself doesn't have the

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.619 
now the screen itself doesn't have the
best<00:02:44.829> resolution<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.909> world<00:02:46.120> as<00:02:46.299> its<00:02:46.510> only

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
best resolution in the world as its only

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.369 
best resolution in the world as its only
768<00:02:47.590> by<00:02:47.980> 1280<00:02:48.579> but<00:02:49.299> because<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:49.659> on<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> 4.5

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
768 by 1280 but because it's on a 4.5

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.589 
768 by 1280 but because it's on a 4.5
inch<00:02:50.739> screen<00:02:51.159> does<00:02:51.639> give<00:02:51.909> you<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> reasonable

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
inch screen does give you a reasonable

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.339 
inch screen does give you a reasonable
pixel<00:02:53.079> density<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:54.329> 332<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:56.019> course<00:02:56.230> it

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
pixel density of 332 and of course it

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.990 
pixel density of 332 and of course it
has<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.620> ClearBlack<00:02:57.159> display<00:02:57.220> along<00:02:57.849> with

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
has that ClearBlack display along with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.449 
has that ClearBlack display along with
pure<00:02:58.540> emotion<00:02:58.959> HD<00:02:59.409> plus<00:02:59.709> so<00:02:59.920> you<00:02:59.950> get<00:03:00.129> very

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
pure emotion HD plus so you get very

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.099 
pure emotion HD plus so you get very
very<00:03:00.730> good<00:03:00.819> blacks<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:01.840> actually

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
very good blacks and it's actually

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.770 
very good blacks and it's actually

overall a very good screen despite the

again<00:04:14.319> right<00:04:14.590> there<00:04:14.620> was<00:04:14.949> the<00:04:15.040> top<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
again right there was the top of the

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.159 
again right there was the top of the
range<00:04:15.729> smartphones<00:04:16.359> but<00:04:16.750> by<00:04:16.930> no<00:04:16.989> means

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
range smartphones but by no means

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.349 
range smartphones but by no means
blowing<00:04:17.709> any<00:04:18.039> of<00:04:18.220> them<00:04:18.340> away<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.060> terms<00:04:19.239> of

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
blowing any of them away and in terms of

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.750 
blowing any of them away and in terms of
low-light<00:04:19.690> performance<00:04:19.859> again<00:04:20.859> reasonably

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
low-light performance again reasonably

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.070 
low-light performance again reasonably
up<00:04:22.090> there<00:04:22.300> was<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.510> top<00:04:22.719> of<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.900> range

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
up there was the top of the range

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.480 
up there was the top of the range
smartphones<00:04:23.770> but<00:04:23.979> again<00:04:24.279> definitely<00:04:24.820> not

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
smartphones but again definitely not

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.570 
smartphones but again definitely not
period<00:04:25.880> them<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.389> any<00:04:26.569> way<00:04:26.780> whatsoever<00:04:27.580> now

period them in any way whatsoever now

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.059 
period them in any way whatsoever now
let's<00:04:29.060> just<00:04:29.270> move<00:04:29.479> around<00:04:29.720> onto<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.800> actual

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
let's just move around onto the actual

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.460 
let's just move around onto the actual
screen<00:04:31.580> itself<00:04:32.030> like<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.419> said<00:04:32.660> before<00:04:33.050> this<00:04:33.410> is

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
screen itself like I said before this is

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.600 
screen itself like I said before this is
only<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:34.060> 768<00:04:35.060> resolution<00:04:35.300> screen<00:04:36.259> by<00:04:36.410> 1280<00:04:36.889> but

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
only a 768 resolution screen by 1280 but

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.999 
only a 768 resolution screen by 1280 but
because<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.690> screen<00:04:39.259> has<00:04:39.470> got<00:04:39.680> all<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.860> those

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
because the screen has got all of those

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.279 
because the screen has got all of those
features<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.639> such<00:04:40.880> as<00:04:41.060> pure<00:04:41.360> motion<00:04:41.750> HD<00:04:42.050> plus

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
features in such as pure motion HD plus

features in such as pure motion HD plus
ClearBlack<00:04:42.830> display<00:04:42.889> etc<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:44.150> does<00:04:44.449> give<00:04:44.780> very

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
ClearBlack display etc it does give very

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.490 
ClearBlack display etc it does give very
very<00:04:45.710> nice<00:04:45.979> images<00:04:46.580> however<00:04:47.360> because<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.169> PPI

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
very nice images however because the PPI

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.040 
very nice images however because the PPI
is<00:04:48.650> not<00:04:48.979> quite<00:04:49.250> as<00:04:49.400> good<00:04:49.639> as<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:50.419> likes<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:50.870> the

applications<00:05:19.690> he's<00:05:20.690> just<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.050> little<00:05:21.380> bit

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
applications he's just that little bit

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.140 
applications he's just that little bit
slower<00:05:21.830> than<00:05:21.979> most<00:05:22.340> of<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.639> other<00:05:22.759> high-end

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
slower than most of the other high-end

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.999 
slower than most of the other high-end
smartphones<00:05:23.690> on<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.870> market<00:05:23.960> today<00:05:24.409> they<00:05:24.830> do

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
smartphones on the market today they do

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.439 
smartphones on the market today they do
take<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.250> few<00:05:25.490> seconds<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.060> launch

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
take a few seconds to launch

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.520 
take a few seconds to launch
and<00:05:26.599> also<00:05:27.319> the<00:05:27.620> actual<00:05:27.819> speed<00:05:28.819> of<00:05:28.849> the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
and also the actual speed of the

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.959 
and also the actual speed of the
applications<00:05:30.530> themselves<00:05:30.740> I've<00:05:31.280> found<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.789> be

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
applications themselves I've found to be

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.149 
applications themselves I've found to be
not<00:05:32.180> quite<00:05:32.419> as<00:05:32.690> good<00:05:32.900> as<00:05:33.110> those<00:05:33.560> that<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:33.889> get

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
not quite as good as those that you get

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.120 
not quite as good as those that you get
on<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:35.000> other<00:05:35.330> Android<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.110> also<00:05:36.530> iOS

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
on the other Android and also iOS

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.129 
on the other Android and also iOS
operating<00:05:37.340> systems<00:05:38.030> but<00:05:38.509> not<00:05:38.570> hugely

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
operating systems but not hugely

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.649 
operating systems but not hugely
noticeable<00:05:39.860> just<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.340> little<00:05:40.669> bit<00:05:40.789> less<00:05:41.030> the

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
noticeable just a little bit less the

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.570 
noticeable just a little bit less the
operating<00:05:41.990> system<00:05:42.259> itself<00:05:42.530> I<00:05:42.710> like<00:05:42.949> very<00:05:43.340> very

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
operating system itself I like very very

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.459 
operating system itself I like very very
much<00:05:43.849> I<00:05:44.150> really<00:05:44.719> do<00:05:44.840> love<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.199> tiled

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469 
much I really do love the tiled

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.140 
much I really do love the tiled
interface<00:05:45.740> I<00:05:46.190> love<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.490> various<00:05:46.820> different

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
interface I love the various different

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.060 
interface I love the various different
colors<00:05:47.479> however<00:05:48.020> it's<00:05:48.169> kind<00:05:48.320> of<00:05:48.409> lacking<00:05:48.830> in

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
colors however it's kind of lacking in

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.159 
colors however it's kind of lacking in
terms<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.460> customization<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.330> also<00:05:50.659> the<00:05:50.840> kind

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
terms of customization and also the kind

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.379 
terms of customization and also the kind
of<00:05:51.229> high-end<00:05:51.740> features<00:05:52.340> but<00:05:52.849> hopefully<00:05:53.210> over

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
of high-end features but hopefully over

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:54.939 
of high-end features but hopefully over
the<00:05:53.449> next<00:05:53.539> year<00:05:53.900> or<00:05:53.930> so<00:05:54.050> up<00:05:54.380> Microsoft<00:05:54.860> are

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
the next year or so up Microsoft are

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.620 
the next year or so up Microsoft are
going<00:05:55.069> to<00:05:55.130> add<00:05:55.250> that<00:05:55.460> in<00:05:55.669> and<00:05:56.090> it<00:05:56.180> will<00:05:56.240> try<00:05:56.479> and

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
going to add that in and it will try and

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.040 
going to add that in and it will try and
catch<00:05:56.810> up<00:05:57.110> with<00:05:57.440> iOS<00:05:58.009> and<00:05:58.250> also<00:05:58.580> Android<00:05:59.150> and

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
catch up with iOS and also Android and

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.809 
catch up with iOS and also Android and
that<00:06:00.169> really<00:06:00.380> brings<00:06:00.680> me<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:01.130> my<00:06:01.490> kind<00:06:01.699> of

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
that really brings me to my kind of

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.409 
that really brings me to my kind of
final<00:06:02.240> opinion<00:06:02.479> of<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:03.469> Nokia<00:06:03.919> Lumia<00:06:04.219> 925<00:06:05.000> I

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
final opinion of the Nokia Lumia 925 I

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.899 
final opinion of the Nokia Lumia 925 I
love<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.110> handset<00:06:06.590> itself<00:06:06.740> I<00:06:07.280> even<00:06:07.699> really

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
love the handset itself I even really

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.300 
love the handset itself I even really
like<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.210> operating<00:06:08.630> system<00:06:08.990> as<00:06:09.080> well<00:06:09.310> the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
like the operating system as well the

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.670 
like the operating system as well the
major<00:06:10.550> problem<00:06:11.180> with<00:06:11.330> this<00:06:11.840> particular<00:06:12.199> phone

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
major problem with this particular phone

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.850 
major problem with this particular phone
is<00:06:12.949> the<00:06:13.580> lack<00:06:13.819> of<00:06:13.900> applications<00:06:14.900> now<00:06:15.590> even

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
is the lack of applications now even

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.309 
is the lack of applications now even
just<00:06:15.889> so<00:06:16.130> much<00:06:16.219> as<00:06:16.430> recently<00:06:16.849> we've<00:06:17.060> had

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
just so much as recently we've had

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.260 
just so much as recently we've had
Instagram<00:06:18.319> themselves<00:06:18.949> stopped<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.580> use<00:06:20.000> of

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
Instagram themselves stopped the use of

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.390 
Instagram themselves stopped the use of
the<00:06:20.509> third-party<00:06:20.810> Instagram<00:06:21.680> applications

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
the third-party Instagram applications

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.279 
the third-party Instagram applications
and<00:06:22.759> I<00:06:22.909> go<00:06:23.030> back<00:06:23.210> to<00:06:23.300> my<00:06:23.330> reference<00:06:23.630> earlier<00:06:24.169> in

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
and I go back to my reference earlier in

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.930 
and I go back to my reference earlier in
the<00:06:24.349> video<00:06:24.469> of<00:06:24.800> using<00:06:25.340> this<00:06:25.430> as<00:06:25.610> much<00:06:25.909> as

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
the video of using this as much as

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.820 
the video of using this as much as
possible<00:06:26.210> and<00:06:26.960> I<00:06:27.110> really<00:06:27.380> found<00:06:27.620> myself

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
possible and I really found myself

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.159 
possible and I really found myself
struggling<00:06:28.400> to<00:06:28.759> use<00:06:29.000> this<00:06:29.210> to<00:06:29.630> any<00:06:29.810> kind<00:06:30.080> of

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
struggling to use this to any kind of

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.110 
struggling to use this to any kind of
deep<00:06:30.380> level<00:06:30.800> just<00:06:30.979> because<00:06:31.130> of<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.460> pure<00:06:31.789> lack

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
deep level just because of the pure lack

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.510 
deep level just because of the pure lack
of<00:06:32.380> applications<00:06:33.380> and<00:06:33.680> it<00:06:33.919> was<00:06:34.010> really<00:06:34.250> a<00:06:34.279> case

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
of applications and it was really a case

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.700 
of applications and it was really a case
of<00:06:34.550> you<00:06:34.849> know<00:06:34.969> simple<00:06:35.539> browsing<00:06:36.139> there's<00:06:36.589> a

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
of you know simple browsing there's a

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.780 
of you know simple browsing there's a
few<00:06:36.949> other<00:06:37.099> applications

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
few other applications

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.190 
few other applications
as<00:06:37.880> well<00:06:38.150> but<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:38.450> vast<00:06:38.720> number<00:06:39.110> of

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
as well but the vast number of

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.170 
as well but the vast number of
applications<00:06:39.770> that<00:06:39.860> I<00:06:40.010> use<00:06:40.250> just<00:06:40.520> simply

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
applications that I use just simply

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.990 
applications that I use just simply
aren't<00:06:41.390> available<00:06:42.050> on<00:06:42.200> the<00:06:42.860> Windows<00:06:43.430> Phone

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
platform and that for me is a huge shame

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.130 
platform and that for me is a huge shame
the<00:06:46.760> amount<00:06:46.970> of<00:06:47.000> developers<00:06:47.510> that<00:06:47.630> Facebook

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
the amount of developers that Facebook

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.780 
the amount of developers that Facebook
have<00:06:48.260> got<00:06:48.470> why<00:06:48.860> don't<00:06:49.010> they<00:06:49.100> just<00:06:49.310> build<00:06:49.550> a

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
have got why don't they just build a

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.300 
have got why don't they just build a
nice<00:06:50.150> application<00:06:50.510> to<00:06:51.230> go<00:06:51.380> on<00:06:51.620> Windows<00:06:52.070> Phone

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
nice application to go on Windows Phone

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.010 
nice application to go on Windows Phone
it<00:06:52.490> really<00:06:52.730> does<00:06:52.880> get<00:06:53.060> on<00:06:53.150> my<00:06:53.240> nerves<00:06:53.510> and<00:06:53.810> the

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
it really does get on my nerves and the

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.330 
it really does get on my nerves and the
same<00:06:54.200> goes<00:06:54.350> for<00:06:54.410> all<00:06:54.650> the<00:06:54.740> rest<00:06:54.950> of<00:06:55.070> them<00:06:55.190> as

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
same goes for all the rest of them as

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.320 
same goes for all the rest of them as
well<00:06:55.520> I<00:06:55.550> think<00:06:55.640> it's<00:06:55.850> really<00:06:56.000> time<00:06:56.300> that

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
well I think it's really time that

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.600 
well I think it's really time that
people<00:06:56.630> like<00:06:56.870> Google<00:06:57.050> and<00:06:57.470> also<00:06:58.100> Facebook
