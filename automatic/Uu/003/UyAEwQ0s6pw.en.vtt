00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
got the color ink available so I was

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.240 
got the color ink available so I was
searching<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.070> YouTube<00:00:26.390> or<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.250> website

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
searching on YouTube or on the website

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.930 
searching on YouTube or on the website
to<00:00:29.429> see<00:00:29.460> how<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.660> use<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.399> color<00:00:32.399> ink<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to see how can I use my color ink to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930 
to see how can I use my color ink to
bring<00:00:33.180> black<00:00:33.600> only<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:35.100> couldn't<00:00:35.430> find<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
bring black only and I couldn't find it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.139 
bring black only and I couldn't find it
so<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.719> cannot<00:00:37.380> figure<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.860> myself<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
so I cannot figure out myself and I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.959 
so I cannot figure out myself and I
think<00:00:39.210> that's<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.870> really<00:00:40.350> easy<00:00:40.590> way<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
think that's a really easy way to do it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.319 
think that's a really easy way to do it
and<00:00:42.360> also<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.829> same<00:00:44.219> thing<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.850> if

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
and also you can do the same thing as if

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.830 
and also you can do the same thing as if
you<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.260> bring<00:00:46.559> color<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.640> black<00:00:48.450> only

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you want to bring color to black only

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.529 
you want to bring color to black only
and<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.789> printer<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.360> that
