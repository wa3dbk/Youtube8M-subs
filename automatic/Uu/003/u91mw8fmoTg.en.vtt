right<00:01:22.340> I'm<00:01:22.400> going<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.610> play<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.850> lick<00:01:23.000> nice

and<00:01:23.540> slow<00:01:23.780> one<00:01:24.020> time<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.950> get<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.189> out

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
and slow one time just to get it out

there

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.719 

right<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.290> basic<00:01:36.650> idea<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.310> we're

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
right the the basic idea is that we're

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.170 
right the the basic idea is that we're
in<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:38.320> harmonic<00:01:39.320> minor<00:01:39.530> scale<00:01:40.070> really<00:01:40.790> but

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
in a harmonic minor scale really but

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.550 
in a harmonic minor scale really but
we're<00:01:41.300> going<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.479> use<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:41.690> diminished<00:01:42.260> sound

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
we're going to use that diminished sound

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.320 
we're going to use that diminished sound
for<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.890> first<00:01:43.159> part<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.670> its<00:01:43.820> kind<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.150> build

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
for the first part of its kind of build

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.510 
for the first part of its kind of build
some<00:01:44.510> tension<00:01:44.930> we're<00:01:45.050> kind<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.290> implying<00:01:45.680> like

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
some tension we're kind of implying like

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.940 
some tension we're kind of implying like
a<00:01:46.780> b7<00:01:47.780> chord<00:01:47.810> which<00:01:48.080> would<00:01:48.170> be<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> five<00:01:48.560> board

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
a b7 chord which would be the five board

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.300 
a b7 chord which would be the five board
in<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.850> key<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.660> flat<00:01:51.350> nine<00:01:51.619> we<00:01:52.100> have<00:01:52.280> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
in that key with a flat nine we have a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.859 
in that key with a flat nine we have a
jazzy<00:01:52.580> idea<00:01:52.940> but<00:01:53.119> basically<00:01:53.450> what<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:53.780> going

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
jazzy idea but basically what it's going

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.749 
jazzy idea but basically what it's going
to<00:01:55.150> give<00:01:56.150> us<00:01:56.240> Carl<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.780> let<00:01:57.080> Phrygian

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
to give us Carl that let Phrygian

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.890 
to give us Carl that let Phrygian
dominant<00:01:58.759> sounded<00:01:59.150> like<00:01:59.300> someone<00:01:59.750> like

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
dominant sounded like someone like

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.310 
dominant sounded like someone like
yngwie<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.380> would<00:02:00.740> use<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.840> Ward<00:02:02.840> knows<00:02:03.050> we're

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
yngwie we would use so Ward knows we're

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.300 
yngwie we would use so Ward knows we're
starting<00:02:03.650> off<00:02:03.770> with<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.400> C<00:02:05.080> diminished

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
you're doing it in minor thirds you can

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.310 
you're doing it in minor thirds you can
play<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:26.830> anywhere<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:28.240> but<00:03:28.810> for<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.110> sake<00:03:29.290> of

this lick the first measure is just that

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.180 
this lick the first measure is just that
idea<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:32.530> showed<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:33.010> then<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
idea I just showed you and then the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.520 
idea I just showed you and then the
second<00:03:33.640> measure<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:34.120> an<00:03:34.420> e<00:03:34.540> harmonic<00:03:35.050> minor

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
second measure is an e harmonic minor
