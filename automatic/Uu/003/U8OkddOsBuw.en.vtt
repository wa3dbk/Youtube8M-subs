hey<00:00:21.820> guess<00:00:22.090> what<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.599> OV<00:00:23.290> store<00:00:23.529> doesn't<00:00:23.980> suck

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:24.399 
hey guess what the OV store doesn't suck

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.760 
hey guess what the OV store doesn't suck
the<00:00:25.090> only<00:00:25.300> store<00:00:25.480> has<00:00:25.660> in<00:00:25.899> the<00:00:25.989> past<00:00:26.020> but<00:00:26.590> it's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
the only store has in the past but it's

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.220 
the only store has in the past but it's
much<00:00:26.980> different<00:00:27.130> on<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.520> n8<00:00:27.820> and<00:00:28.090> i<00:00:28.630> like<00:00:29.050> it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
much different on the n8 and i like it

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.470 
much different on the n8 and i like it
myself<00:00:29.529> i<00:00:30.009> should<00:00:30.520> buy<00:00:30.610> naps<00:00:30.849> on<00:00:31.029> now<00:00:31.180> so<00:00:31.360> if<00:00:31.419> we

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
myself i should buy naps on now so if we

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.090 
myself i should buy naps on now so if we
tap<00:00:31.630> on<00:00:31.779> Ovie's<00:00:32.020> door<00:00:32.050> there<00:00:32.649> it<00:00:32.770> launches

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
tap on Ovie's door there it launches

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.220 
tap on Ovie's door there it launches
right<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:33.430> this<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.300> launch<00:00:34.540> part<00:00:35.140> of

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
right so this is the the launch part of

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.630 
right so this is the the launch part of
it<00:00:35.350> which<00:00:35.500> is<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.739> recommended<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.430> i<00:00:36.460> want

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
it which is the recommended and i want

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.110 
it which is the recommended and i want
to<00:00:36.820> show<00:00:37.000> you<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:38.170> n97<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.870> have

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
to show you the n97 and we have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.340 
to show you the n97 and we have
similarly<00:00:43.120> okay<00:00:43.720> so<00:00:43.780> there's<00:00:44.140> the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
similarly okay so there's the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.560 
similarly okay so there's the
differences<00:00:44.830> here<00:00:44.980> we<00:00:45.130> see<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:46.510> the

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
differences here we see just the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.180 
differences here we see just the
interface<00:00:46.900> up<00:00:47.080> top<00:00:47.290> right<00:00:47.560> we've<00:00:47.680> got<00:00:47.710> OV

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
interface up top right we've got OV

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.800 
interface up top right we've got OV

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
store and this is recommended then we've

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.170 
store and this is recommended then we've
got<00:00:49.840> category<00:00:50.320> search<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:51.160> account<00:00:51.430> down

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
got category search and account down

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.360 
got category search and account down
here<00:00:52.420> we<00:00:52.570> see<00:00:52.780> I've<00:00:53.140> recommended<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:54.130> then<00:00:54.250> I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
here we see I've recommended and then I

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.490 
here we see I've recommended and then I

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
can tap on these other things for

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.580 
can tap on these other things for
applications<00:00:57.220> games<00:00:57.820> things<00:00:58.210> like<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.590> here

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
applications games things like that here

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.260 
applications games things like that here
I<00:00:59.860> can<00:01:00.489> scroll<00:01:00.730> down<00:01:00.940> through<00:01:00.970> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
on this one it's just a very much in my

on this one it's just a very much in my
opinion<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.630> much<00:03:05.900> more<00:03:06.050> usable<00:03:06.350> interface<00:03:07.250> and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
opinion a much more usable interface and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.480 
opinion a much more usable interface and

if we tap on sugarsync there and here
let's<00:03:10.760> see<00:03:10.940> if<00:03:11.060> they<00:03:11.240> should<00:03:11.420> be<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.660> same

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
let's see if they should be the same

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.580 
let's see if they should be the same
pretty<00:03:12.140> much<00:03:13.780> there<00:03:14.780> they<00:03:14.930> are<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.320> can<00:03:15.440> just

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
pretty much there they are you can just

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.440 
pretty much there they are you can just
see<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.950> colors<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.940> way<00:03:17.120> it's<00:03:17.270> set

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450

little bit better and that's maybe one

of the key things that I found is the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.190 
of the key things that I found is the
discovery<00:03:43.550> is<00:03:43.880> much<00:03:44.150> better<00:03:44.420> in<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.720> new<00:03:44.870> OB

was<00:03:52.010> recommended<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.670> guess<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.120> home<00:03:53.299> on

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
was recommended I guess is the home on

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.270 
was recommended I guess is the home on
this<00:03:53.600> one<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.230> was<00:03:57.440> getting<00:03:57.890> better<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.190> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
this one so it was getting better on the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.090 
this one so it was getting better on the
n97<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:59.150> is<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.450> latest<00:03:59.840> version<00:04:00.049> but<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.680> in

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
n97 this is the latest version but I in

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.860 
n97 this is the latest version but I in
my<00:04:01.250> opinion<00:04:01.549> it's<00:04:01.820> it's<00:04:02.090> much<00:04:02.360> much<00:04:02.600> better

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
my opinion it's it's much much better

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.250 
my opinion it's it's much much better
much<00:04:03.200> more<00:04:03.410> usable<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.820> on<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.180> n8<00:04:05.600> there

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
much more usable on the on the n8 there

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.350 
much more usable on the on the n8 there
