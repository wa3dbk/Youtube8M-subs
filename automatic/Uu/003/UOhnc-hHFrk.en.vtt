depth you can get into a tennis game on

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.670 
depth you can get into a tennis game on
a<00:04:45.820> console<00:04:46.330> I'm<00:04:46.510> not<00:04:46.630> quite<00:04:46.900> sure<00:04:46.930> but<00:04:47.230> for<00:04:47.650> a

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
a console I'm not quite sure but for a

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.860 
a console I'm not quite sure but for a
quick<00:04:47.890> blast<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:51.330> hence<00:04:52.330> why<00:04:52.600> it's<00:04:52.630> always

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
quick blast but hence why it's always

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.540 
quick blast but hence why it's always
been<00:04:53.200> released<00:04:53.560> fat<00:04:53.980> from<00:04:54.130> virtual<00:04:54.430> tennis

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
been released fat from virtual tennis

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.360 
been released fat from virtual tennis
for<00:04:54.850> obviously<00:04:55.330> but<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.050> first<00:04:56.290> three<00:04:56.740> we

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
for obviously but the first three we

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.710 
for obviously but the first three we
released<00:04:57.640> in<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.790> arcades<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.450> think<00:04:58.630> they

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
released in the arcades and I think they

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.970 
released in the arcades and I think they
did<00:04:58.870> really<00:04:58.900> well<00:04:59.140> with<00:04:59.560> arcade<00:04:59.860> games

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
did really well with arcade games

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.810 
did really well with arcade games
because<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.040> sort<00:05:03.250> of<00:05:03.280> thing<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.520> just<00:05:03.640> want

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
because the sort of thing you just want

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.159 
because the sort of thing you just want
to<00:05:03.880> get<00:05:04.000> up<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.330> have<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:04.510> quick<00:05:04.660> blast<00:05:04.870> at

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
to get up and just have a quick blast at
