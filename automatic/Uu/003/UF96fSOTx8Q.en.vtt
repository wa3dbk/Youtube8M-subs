sure<00:01:10.650> any<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> overclockers<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.909> there

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
sure any of the overclockers out there

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.340 
sure any of the overclockers out there
I'm<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> Wi-Fi<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.170> that's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
I'm going to use the Wi-Fi so that's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
I'm going to use the Wi-Fi so that's
kind<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.130> break<00:01:14.400> where<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
kind of like the break where it kind of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.190 
kind of like the break where it kind of
gets<00:01:15.420> into<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> mainstream<00:01:17.520> area<00:01:18.509> type<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
gets into the mainstream area type just

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
gets into the mainstream area type just
black<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.500> yellow<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.189> bumblebee<00:01:20.610> style

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
black and yellow kind of bumblebee style

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
black and yellow kind of bumblebee style
builds<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.780> anyway<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
builds but anyway I think it's time that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.440 
builds but anyway I think it's time that
we<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> look<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.060> some<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
we have a look at some of the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.109 
we have a look at some of the
accessories<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.080> come<00:01:25.259> inside<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.680> box<00:01:26.119> ok

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
accessories that come inside the box ok

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.920 
accessories that come inside the box ok
then<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.170> first<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> foremost<00:01:28.640> your<00:01:29.930> wireless

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
then so first and foremost your wireless

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
then so first and foremost your wireless
dongle<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:33.030> dongles<00:01:33.450> aerials<00:01:34.820> they're

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
dongle so your dongles aerials they're

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.490 
dongle so your dongles aerials they're
kind<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> nice<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.390> adjustable<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.350> have

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
kind of nice and adjustable you can have

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.780 
kind of nice and adjustable you can have
them<00:01:37.619> they're<00:01:37.829> magnetic<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.700> have

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
them they're magnetic so you can have

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.819 
them they're magnetic so you can have
them<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> way<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.320> adjust<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
them up or that way so you can adjust it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.700 
them up or that way so you can adjust it
so<00:01:41.759> there's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.750> couple<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.140> them<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.350> well<00:01:43.500> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
so there's a couple of them as well so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.080 
so there's a couple of them as well so
it<00:01:43.799> should<00:01:43.979> help<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.399> your<00:01:44.579> signal<00:01:44.970> quality

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it should help with your signal quality

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.539 
it should help with your signal quality
and<00:01:45.540> stuff<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.780> you've<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.470> those<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:47.340> you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and stuff that you've got those if you

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.770 
and stuff that you've got those if you
really<00:01:47.820> need<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.060> use<00:01:48.180> them<00:01:48.299> obviously<00:01:48.600> that's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
really need to use them obviously that's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.300 
really need to use them obviously that's
completely<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.500> I'm<00:01:49.710> personally<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
completely up to you I'm personally a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
completely up to you I'm personally a
big<00:01:50.369> fan<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.820> home<00:01:51.180> plugs<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> stuff<00:01:52.140> like

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
big fan of home plugs and stuff like

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.789 
big fan of home plugs and stuff like
that<00:01:52.560> next<00:01:53.460> thing<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.970> look<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.799> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that next thing that we look at is the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.590 
that next thing that we look at is the
backplate<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.850> might<00:01:57.060> sound<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
backplate which might sound like a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.270 
backplate which might sound like a
really<00:01:58.049> simple<00:01:58.439> thing<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.130> at

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
really simple thing to want to look at

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.609 
really simple thing to want to look at
but<00:01:59.430> round<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> back<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.229> all

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
but round the back it's actually all

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.139 
but round the back it's actually all
black<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.130> well<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:02.729> really

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
black as well and I actually really

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.959 
black as well and I actually really
liked<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.110> nice<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> small<00:02:05.579> small

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
liked that so nice it's a small small

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.670 
liked that so nice it's a small small
thing<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> very<00:02:06.960> nice<00:02:07.170> touch<00:02:07.439> cause

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
thing but it's a very nice touch cause

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.589 
thing but it's a very nice touch cause
normally<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.340> silver<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.270> fact<00:02:09.509> that

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
normally this is silver the fact that

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
normally this is silver the fact that
we've<00:02:09.780> got<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.110> silt<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.099> softness

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
we've got the silt the the softness

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.730 
we've got the silt the the softness
around<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.270> which<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
around the back which is

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.110 
around the back which is
where<00:02:12.860> all<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> other<00:02:13.310> motherboards<00:02:13.940> have

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
where all the other motherboards have

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.630 
where all the other motherboards have
started<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.170> kind<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.490> have<00:02:16.580> that

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
started to kind of go but to have that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.190 
started to kind of go but to have that
blackness<00:02:17.270> around<00:02:17.510> there<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.780> actually<00:02:17.930> think

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
blackness around there I actually think

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.350 
blackness around there I actually think
that's<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.530> lovely<00:02:18.770> little<00:02:19.130> touch<00:02:19.460> now

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
that's a lovely little touch now

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.770 
that's a lovely little touch now
something<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.750> confuses<00:02:21.020> me<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:22.780> this

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
something that confuses me is this this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.180 
something that confuses me is this this
is<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.890> deal<00:02:25.730> it'd<00:02:25.940> die<00:02:26.240> guard<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.890> do

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
is the deal it'd die guard and you do

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.950 
is the deal it'd die guard and you do
saw<00:02:28.580> overclock<00:02:29.210> backplate<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.720> that's

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
saw overclock backplate and that's

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.470 
saw overclock backplate and that's
basically<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.800> can<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.280> rid<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.790> on

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
basically so that you can get rid of on

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.560 
basically so that you can get rid of on
the<00:02:32.780> motherboard<00:02:33.050> itself<00:02:34.210> these<00:02:35.210> little

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
the motherboard itself these little

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.990 
the motherboard itself these little
threads<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.770> essentially<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.340> take<00:02:37.370> this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
threads so essentially you take this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.880 
threads so essentially you take this
back<00:02:38.270> plate<00:02:38.420> off<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.810> replace<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.740> that's

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
back plate off and replace it and that's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.600 
back plate off and replace it and that's
so<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.550> bolt<00:02:40.820> your<00:02:41.090> normal<00:02:42.610> die

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
so that you can bolt your normal die

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.670 
so that you can bolt your normal die
spot<00:02:43.970> or<00:02:44.180> Ellen<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.960> pot<00:02:45.200> through<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.650> that

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
spot or Ellen to pot through so that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.540 
spot or Ellen to pot through so that
side<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.190> its<00:02:46.310> brilliant<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.840> side<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.320> it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
side of its brilliant this side of it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.240 
side of its brilliant this side of it
the<00:02:49.550> D<00:02:49.790> lid<00:02:49.970> die<00:02:50.180> guard<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:51.470> confuses<00:02:52.100> me

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
the D lid die guard this confuses me

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.890 
the D lid die guard this confuses me
because<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.300> can<00:02:53.390> deal<00:02:53.750> it

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
because this is so that you can deal it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.220 
because this is so that you can deal it
to<00:02:54.020> CPU<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:55.100> this<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> 2011<00:02:55.970> board<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
to CPU but this is a 2011 board and the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.740 
to CPU but this is a 2011 board and the
CPUs<00:02:57.830> are<00:02:58.040> soldered<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> only<00:02:59.240> thing

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
CPUs are soldered and the only thing

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.150 
CPUs are soldered and the only thing
online<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.380> I've<00:03:00.470> seen<00:03:00.740> with<00:03:00.950> someone

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
online that I've seen with someone

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.190 
online that I've seen with someone
trying<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.670> delete<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.240> they<00:03:02.360> actually<00:03:02.570> ripped

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
trying to delete it they actually ripped

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.740 
trying to delete it they actually ripped
the<00:03:03.590> core<00:03:03.830> off<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.250> top<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.640> CPU<00:03:05.090> now

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
the core off the top of the CPU now

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.330 
the core off the top of the CPU now
there<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.050> lot<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.590> stuff<00:03:06.830> here<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.070> in

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
there is a lot of stuff here so in

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.240 
there is a lot of stuff here so in
removing<00:03:07.820> CPU<00:03:08.420> socket<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.050> or<00:03:09.290> just<00:03:09.590> disk

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
removing CPU socket and or just disk

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.030 
removing CPU socket and or just disk
instructing<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.060> CPU<00:03:11.480> may<00:03:12.040> invariably

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
instructing the CPU may invariably

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.910 
instructing the CPU may invariably
damage<00:03:13.430> or<00:03:13.550> destroy<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.030> CPU<00:03:14.510> um<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:15.290> need<00:03:15.890> to

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
damage or destroy the CPU um I need to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.060 
damage or destroy the CPU um I need to
clarify<00:03:16.220> about<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:16.970> with<00:03:17.330> MSI<00:03:17.930> I'm<00:03:18.710> putting

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
clarify about this with MSI I'm putting

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.440 
clarify about this with MSI I'm putting
in<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.250> video<00:03:19.460> I<00:03:19.520> have<00:03:19.790> tried<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.030> call<00:03:20.300> him

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
in the video I have tried to call him

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.540 
in the video I have tried to call him
quite<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> few<00:03:20.900> times<00:03:21.080> today<00:03:21.290> but<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:22.100> worries

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
quite a few times today but this worries

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.400 
quite a few times today but this worries
me<00:03:22.580> because<00:03:22.820> if<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.330> CPUs<00:03:23.810> are<00:03:23.960> soldered<00:03:24.290> I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
me because if the CPUs are soldered I

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.260 
me because if the CPUs are soldered I
don't<00:03:24.740> think<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.310> should<00:03:25.520> be<00:03:25.580> in<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.910> box<00:03:26.090> at

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
don't think this should be in the box at

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.180 
don't think this should be in the box at
all<00:03:26.390> because<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.690> don't<00:03:26.960> think<00:03:27.190> even

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
all because I don't think even

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.950 
all because I don't think even
experienced<00:03:28.820> users<00:03:29.300> are<00:03:29.480> going<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.840> be

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
experienced users are going to be

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.610 
experienced users are going to be
wanting<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.650> remove<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.190> tops<00:03:31.460> of<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.940> CPUs

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
wanting to remove the tops of the CPUs

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.440 
wanting to remove the tops of the CPUs
so<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.430> something<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:34.910> am<00:03:35.210> gonna

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
so this is something that I am gonna

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.360 
so this is something that I am gonna
have<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.750> clarify<00:03:36.020> with<00:03:36.290> MSI<00:03:36.650> later<00:03:36.920> on<00:03:37.130> but<00:03:37.280> if

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
have to clarify with MSI later on but if

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.460 
have to clarify with MSI later on but if
you<00:03:37.460> buy<00:03:37.670> one<00:03:37.700> for<00:03:38.120> Christ's<00:03:38.390> sake<00:03:38.660> don't<00:03:39.050> take

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
you buy one for Christ's sake don't take

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.670 
you buy one for Christ's sake don't take
a<00:03:40.180> stanley<00:03:41.180> blade<00:03:41.480> or<00:03:41.780> anything<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.530> top

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
a stanley blade or anything to the top

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.860 
a stanley blade or anything to the top
of<00:03:42.800> your<00:03:42.920> cpu<00:03:43.430> just<00:03:43.790> yet<00:03:44.060> because<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.690> may<00:03:44.840> end

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
up losing a hell of a lot of money the

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.930 
up losing a hell of a lot of money the
other<00:03:47.720> thing<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:47.990> they<00:03:48.260> have<00:03:49.010> included<00:03:49.700> in

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
other thing that they have included in

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.540 
other thing that they have included in
the<00:03:50.030> box<00:03:50.240> obviously<00:03:51.200> not<00:03:51.380> with<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.770> fan<00:03:52.010> is

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
the box obviously not with the fan is

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.350 
the box obviously not with the fan is
the<00:03:53.300> OC<00:03:53.840> fan<00:03:54.170> stand<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.920> essentially<00:03:55.730> it's

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
the OC fan stand and essentially it's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.620 
the OC fan stand and essentially it's
kind<00:03:56.660> of<00:03:56.750> an<00:03:56.960> extender<00:03:57.650> for<00:03:58.360> your<00:03:59.360> motherboard

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
kind of an extender for your motherboard

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.900 
kind of an extender for your motherboard
bumps<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:00.530> rather<00:04:00.710> than<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.520> is<00:04:01.730> your

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
bumps so rather than this is your

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.510 
bumps so rather than this is your
motherboard<00:04:03.130> standoff<00:04:04.130> which<00:04:04.370> you'd

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
motherboard standoff which you'd

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.860 
motherboard standoff which you'd
normally<00:04:04.640> screw<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.210> motherboard<00:04:05.600> through

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
normally screw the motherboard through

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.440 
normally screw the motherboard through
it's<00:04:06.560> acts<00:04:06.860> like<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.490> screw<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.300> would

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
it's acts like the screw and it would

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.080 
it's acts like the screw and it would
screw<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:09.110> without<00:04:10.040> me<00:04:10.370> dropping<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.850> like<00:04:10.970> a

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
screw in without me dropping it like a

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.440 
screw in without me dropping it like a
total<00:04:11.840> pro<00:04:12.490> would<00:04:13.490> screw<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.820> in<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:14.209> this

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
total pro would screw it in like this

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.090 
total pro would screw it in like this
but<00:04:14.810> what<00:04:14.930> I'm<00:04:15.020> going<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.200> do<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:15.709> wanted

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
but what I'm going to do I just wanted

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.550 
but what I'm going to do I just wanted
to<00:04:16.250> show<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.730> around<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.930> about<00:04:18.140> like

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
to show you it around and about like

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.710 
to show you it around and about like
this<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:19.430> what<00:04:19.609> I'm<00:04:19.730> gonna<00:04:19.880> do<00:04:20.150> is

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
this and then what I'm gonna do is

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.450 
this and then what I'm gonna do is
actually<00:04:20.870> show<00:04:21.290> you<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.130> motherboard

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
actually show you it on the motherboard

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.670 
actually show you it on the motherboard
itself

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680

okay<00:04:24.680> then<00:04:24.830> peeps<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:25.400> just<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.729> quick<00:04:25.880> one

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
okay then peeps so just a quick one

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.709 
okay then peeps so just a quick one
I've<00:04:26.479> got<00:04:26.689> the<00:04:26.870> OSI<00:04:27.409> found<00:04:27.770> stand<00:04:28.360> fam<00:04:29.360> stand

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 
I've got the OSI found stand fam stand

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.010 
I've got the OSI found stand fam stand
bandstand<00:04:30.379> yeah<00:04:30.499> fam<00:04:30.770> stand<00:04:31.159> fitted<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.930> to

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
bandstand yeah fam stand fitted just to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.499 
bandstand yeah fam stand fitted just to
give<00:04:33.139> you<00:04:33.199> a<00:04:33.259> rough<00:04:33.499> idea<00:04:33.770> of<00:04:34.249> how<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.270> works

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
give you a rough idea of how it works

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.119 
give you a rough idea of how it works
obviously<00:04:35.629> you<00:04:35.930> don't<00:04:36.080> necessarily<00:04:36.830> have<00:04:37.099> to

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
obviously you don't necessarily have to

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.459 
obviously you don't necessarily have to
have<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.819> plunked<00:04:38.389> just<00:04:38.810> there<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.229> can<00:04:39.349> put

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 
have it plunked just there you can put

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.110 
have it plunked just there you can put
it<00:04:39.529> on<00:04:39.590> any<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.210> mountain<00:04:41.210> on<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.419> top<00:04:41.659> but

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
it on any of the mountain on the top but

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.629 
it on any of the mountain on the top but
you<00:04:44.120> can<00:04:44.150> see<00:04:44.479> it's<00:04:44.840> actually<00:04:45.520> brilliant<00:04:46.520> in

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
you can see it's actually brilliant in

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.149 
you can see it's actually brilliant in
its<00:04:46.819> simplicity<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.349> easy<00:04:48.620> way<00:04:48.919> you've

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
its simplicity is the easy way you've

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.950 
its simplicity is the easy way you've
got<00:04:49.189> extenders<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.330> go<00:04:50.509> down<00:04:50.719> and<00:04:50.870> it's

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
got extenders that go down and it's

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.480 
got extenders that go down and it's
shaking<00:04:51.229> because<00:04:52.039> I've<00:04:52.159> got<00:04:52.340> their

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
shaking because I've got their

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.790 
shaking because I've got their
motherboard<00:04:52.969> stands<00:04:53.419> here<00:04:53.599> I<00:04:53.900> didn't<00:04:54.620> want<00:04:54.740> to

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
motherboard stands here I didn't want to

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.679 
motherboard stands here I didn't want to
pinch<00:04:55.039> it<00:04:55.219> into<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.610> motherboard<00:04:55.879> itself<00:04:56.389> too

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 
pinch it into the motherboard itself too

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.089 
pinch it into the motherboard itself too
much<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.229> screws<00:04:57.499> into<00:04:57.680> your<00:04:57.889> motherboard

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
much so it screws into your motherboard

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.140 
much so it screws into your motherboard
stand<00:04:58.460> rather<00:04:58.699> than<00:04:58.849> your<00:04:58.939> motherboard

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
stand rather than your motherboard

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.089 
stand rather than your motherboard
screws<00:04:59.629> which<00:05:00.289> obviously<00:05:00.590> holds<00:05:01.009> the

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
screws which obviously holds the

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.010 
screws which obviously holds the
motherboard<00:05:01.580> down<00:05:01.879> and<00:05:02.150> then<00:05:02.659> they've<00:05:02.870> got

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
motherboard down and then they've got

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.279 
motherboard down and then they've got
the<00:05:03.139> Lloyd<00:05:03.319> large<00:05:03.830> Rises<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.669> then<00:05:05.270> screws<00:05:06.110> at

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
the Lloyd large Rises and then screws at

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.140 
the Lloyd large Rises and then screws at
the<00:05:06.319> top<00:05:06.469> thumb<00:05:07.099> screws<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.699> fit<00:05:07.969> the

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
the top thumb screws that you fit the

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.600 
the top thumb screws that you fit the
stand<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.719> and<00:05:08.960> then<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:11.810> can<00:05:11.960> obviously

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
stand to and then you can obviously

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.309 
stand to and then you can obviously
direct<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.729> airflow<00:05:13.879> you<00:05:14.539> can<00:05:15.139> have<00:05:15.229> it

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
direct the airflow you can have it

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.230 
direct the airflow you can have it
blowing<00:05:15.650> at<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.800> die<00:05:16.069> spot<00:05:16.550> if<00:05:16.759> you<00:05:16.849> want<00:05:17.029> it<00:05:17.150> or

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
blowing at a die spot if you want it or

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.209 
blowing at a die spot if you want it or
knell<00:05:17.419> into<00:05:17.810> pot<00:05:18.139> you<00:05:18.650> can<00:05:18.800> have<00:05:18.889> it<00:05:19.009> just

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
knell into pot you can have it just

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.550 
knell into pot you can have it just
blowing<00:05:19.639> over<00:05:20.029> the<00:05:20.240> top<00:05:20.449> you<00:05:20.599> CPU<00:05:21.199> or<00:05:21.229> memory

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
blowing over the top you CPU or memory

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.100 
blowing over the top you CPU or memory
or<00:05:22.039> something<00:05:22.419> you<00:05:23.419> know<00:05:23.509> there's<00:05:23.719> a<00:05:23.779> few

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
or something you know there's a few

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.959 
or something you know there's a few
different<00:05:24.469> options<00:05:24.830> there<00:05:25.009> really<00:05:25.400> there's<00:05:25.879> a

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
different options there really there's a

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.929 
different options there really there's a
there's<00:05:26.449> a<00:05:26.509> fair<00:05:26.719> bit<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:27.020> adjustment<00:05:27.469> in<00:05:28.400> it

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:28.939 
there's a fair bit of adjustment in it

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.640 
there's a fair bit of adjustment in it
as<00:05:29.120> well<00:05:29.360> so<00:05:29.569> it<00:05:29.749> doesn't<00:05:29.960> necessarily<00:05:30.169> have

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
as well so it doesn't necessarily have

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.579 
as well so it doesn't necessarily have
to<00:05:30.830> fit<00:05:31.129> on<00:05:31.339> just<00:05:31.580> these<00:05:31.819> ones<00:05:32.289> although<00:05:33.289> that

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:33.589 
to fit on just these ones although that

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:35.800 
to fit on just these ones although that
is<00:05:33.710> pretty<00:05:33.919> much<00:05:34.129> its<00:05:34.939> limit<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:35.449> you<00:05:35.509> could

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
is pretty much its limit so you could

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.719 
is pretty much its limit so you could
have<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.080> right<00:05:36.289> on<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.800> lower<00:05:37.219> ones<00:05:37.550> if<00:05:37.699> you

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
have it right on the lower ones if you

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.269 
have it right on the lower ones if you
wanted<00:05:38.089> blowing<00:05:38.479> directly<00:05:39.080> graphics<00:05:39.919> cards

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
wanted blowing directly graphics cards

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.389 
wanted blowing directly graphics cards
or<00:05:40.400> something<00:05:40.819> um<00:05:41.569> but<00:05:42.199> like<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:42.680> said<00:05:42.740> it's

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399 
or something um but like I said it's

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.029 
or something um but like I said it's
brilliant<00:05:43.879> in<00:05:44.000> its<00:05:44.210> simplicity<00:05:44.649> very<00:05:45.649> simple

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
brilliant in its simplicity very simple

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.559 
brilliant in its simplicity very simple
little<00:05:46.129> thing<00:05:46.399> essentially<00:05:46.879> just<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.300> stand

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
little thing essentially just a stand

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.829 
little thing essentially just a stand
for<00:05:47.899> your<00:05:48.229> for<00:05:48.889> a<00:05:49.159> fan<00:05:49.490> rather<00:05:50.089> than<00:05:50.270> balancing

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
for your for a fan rather than balancing

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.240 
for your for a fan rather than balancing
it<00:05:50.930> on<00:05:51.020> top<00:05:51.199> of<00:05:51.229> stuff<00:05:51.529> could<00:05:51.800> actually<00:05:51.919> help

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
it on top of stuff could actually help

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.769 
it on top of stuff could actually help
you've<00:05:52.490> direct<00:05:52.909> the<00:05:53.000> airflow<00:05:53.149> slightly

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
you've direct the airflow slightly

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.589 
you've direct the airflow slightly
better<00:05:53.960> I<00:05:54.430> would<00:05:55.430> go<00:05:55.610> if<00:05:55.939> you<00:05:56.089> were<00:05:56.210> running<00:05:56.389> a

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
better I would go if you were running a

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.519 
better I would go if you were running a
super<00:05:57.050> high-speed<00:05:57.199> fan<00:05:58.419> do<00:05:59.419> the<00:05:59.629> the<00:05:59.990> bolts<00:06:00.349> up

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
super high-speed fan do the the bolts up

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:01.749 
super high-speed fan do the the bolts up
tight<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:00.860> then<00:06:00.949> I<00:06:01.009> have<00:06:01.250> here<00:06:01.460> because<00:06:01.639> like

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
tight and then I have here because like

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.429 
tight and then I have here because like
I<00:06:01.879> said<00:06:01.939> I<00:06:02.089> was<00:06:02.360> just<00:06:02.389> I'm<00:06:03.050> just<00:06:03.259> trying<00:06:03.409> to

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
I said I was just I'm just trying to

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.290 
I said I was just I'm just trying to
demonstrate<00:06:04.009> it<00:06:04.129> to<00:06:04.189> you<00:06:04.339> and<00:06:04.939> it's<00:06:05.060> not<00:06:05.180> all

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
demonstrate it to you and it's not all

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.899 
demonstrate it to you and it's not all
pinched<00:06:05.719> into<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.310> case<00:06:07.310> or<00:06:07.520> anything<00:06:07.699> but

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
pinched into a case or anything but

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.300 
pinched into a case or anything but
anyway<00:06:08.180> so<00:06:08.750> yeah<00:06:09.139> there's<00:06:09.439> that<00:06:09.680> side<00:06:09.979> of<00:06:10.189> it

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
anyway so yeah there's that side of it

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.879 
anyway so yeah there's that side of it
and<00:06:10.460> I<00:06:10.550> actually<00:06:10.699> quite<00:06:11.029> like<00:06:11.210> that<00:06:11.680> so<00:06:12.680> we've

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
and I actually quite like that so we've
