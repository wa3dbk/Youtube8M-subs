like<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:11.010> ketone<00:00:11.309> guys<00:00:11.580> will<00:00:11.849> just

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
like the ketone guys will just

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.430 
like the ketone guys will just
absolutely<00:00:12.389> smashed<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> bits<00:00:13.019> if<00:00:13.380> you

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
absolutely smashed it to bits if you

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.530 
absolutely smashed it to bits if you
don't<00:00:13.620> like<00:00:13.769> shoot<00:00:13.980> forward<00:00:14.250> stagger<00:00:14.730> them<00:00:14.849> as

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
don't like shoot forward stagger them as

don't like shoot forward stagger them as
you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.139> get<00:00:16.260> as<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> terial<00:00:16.770> so

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
you can see here they get as a terial so

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.950 
you can see here they get as a terial so
it's<00:00:17.100> not<00:00:17.190> too<00:00:17.400> bad<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.510> be<00:00:18.630> careful

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
it's not too bad but really be careful

of them the chest always pawns in the
same<00:00:20.760> spot<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.810> always<00:00:21.960> tell<00:00:22.170> if

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
same spot so you can always tell if

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.150 
same spot so you can always tell if
you've<00:00:22.350> got<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> quick<00:00:22.650> chest<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.100> why

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
you've got a quick chest that's why

you've got a quick chest that's why
voting<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:23.760> words<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.449> pretty<00:00:24.630> risky

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
voting for words but it's pretty risky

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.810 
voting for words but it's pretty risky
you<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> make<00:00:26.369> sure<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.609> clear

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
you just want to make sure you clear

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.189 
you just want to make sure you clear
absolutely<00:00:27.240> everything<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:27.930> we

kiss<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.500> need<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> run<00:00:28.859> backwards<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
kiss you need to run backwards when the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.530 
kiss you need to run backwards when the
chest<00:00:29.609> opens<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.150> skeleton<00:00:30.539> Swan<00:00:30.750> around

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.690 

I'm<00:00:38.260> doing<00:00:38.560> this<00:00:38.650> in<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.830> Giro<00:00:39.070> to<00:00:39.310> maximize

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
I'm doing this in the Giro to maximize

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.920 
I'm doing this in the Giro to maximize
loot<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:40.090> because<00:00:40.450> it's<00:00:40.600> just<00:00:40.720> actually

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
loot and because it's just actually

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.530 
loot and because it's just actually
easier<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.380> do<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.770> month<00:00:41.980> so<00:00:42.760> yeah

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
easier to do it to month so yeah

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.510 
easier to do it to month so yeah
make<00:00:46.440> sure<00:00:46.560> you<00:00:46.710> swap<00:00:46.890> back<00:00:47.040> to<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.250> real<00:00:47.370> go

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
make sure you swap back to your real go

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160 
make sure you swap back to your real go
pretty<00:00:47.790> quickly<00:00:48.060> this<00:00:48.630> might<00:00:48.810> take<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.990> bit<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
pretty quickly this might take a bit of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
pretty quickly this might take a bit of
a<00:00:49.380> training<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.340> click<00:00:50.580> things<00:00:50.790> quickly<00:00:51.060> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
a training like click things quickly but

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.140 
a training like click things quickly but
it's<00:00:51.690> worth<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.050> um<00:00:52.880> watch<00:00:53.880> out<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
it's worth it um watch out for the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's worth it um watch out for the
skylines<00:00:54.450> at<00:00:54.570> spawn<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.260> can

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
skylines at spawn because they can

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.470 
skylines at spawn because they can
one-shot<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.640> overall<00:00:57.090> they're<00:00:57.240> not<00:00:57.330> too

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
one-shot you but overall they're not too

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.460 
one-shot you but overall they're not too
hard<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.810> I'm<00:00:57.900> going<00:00:57.990> to<00:00:58.050> keep<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.290> distance

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
hard as I'm going to keep your distance

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.070 
hard as I'm going to keep your distance
it's<00:00:59.460> easy<00:00:59.700> to<00:00:59.880> do<00:00:59.970> it<00:01:00.060> two<00:01:00.180> players<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.720> keep

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
it's easy to do it two players so keep

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.400 
it's easy to do it two players so keep
that<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.260> mind

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
that in mind

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:13.290 
that in mind
once<00:01:04.339> at<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:04.670> Leroy<00:01:05.360> ms<00:01:05.660> and<00:01:05.990> restart

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.480 

this<00:01:13.960> 3<00:01:14.260> layout<00:01:14.530> so<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:14.740> can<00:01:14.890> get<00:01:15.010> on<00:01:15.160> this<00:01:15.250> map

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
this 3 layout so you can get on this map

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.520 
this 3 layout so you can get on this map
this<00:01:15.760> is<00:01:15.910> one<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.120> them<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:17.170> can<00:01:17.320> see<00:01:17.440> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
this is one of them and you can see the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.860 
this is one of them and you can see the
term<00:01:17.710> impacts<00:01:18.010> really<00:01:18.400> on<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:19.000> hard<00:01:19.240> like<00:01:19.540> as

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
term impacts really on that hard like as

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.930 
term impacts really on that hard like as
long<00:01:19.900> as<00:01:20.110> they're<00:01:20.200> not<00:01:20.230> Sauber's<00:01:20.800> they<00:01:21.760> die

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
long as they're not Sauber's they die

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.090 
long as they're not Sauber's they die
extremely<00:01:22.630> quickly<00:01:22.870> this<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.740> a<00:01:23.770> lot<00:01:23.950> you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
extremely quickly this is a lot you

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.350 
extremely quickly this is a lot you
don't<00:01:24.160> want<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.610> get<00:01:24.760> because<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.180> has<00:01:25.330> no

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
don't want to get because it has no

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.360 
don't want to get because it has no
chest<00:01:25.810> so<00:01:26.380> if<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.740> see<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:26.980> layout<00:01:27.190> as

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
chest so if you see this layout as

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.590 
chest so if you see this layout as
prematurely<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:27.880> game<00:01:28.030> as<00:01:28.150> soon<00:01:28.300> as<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.480> can

I've<00:01:35.170> just<00:01:35.439> be<00:01:35.680> careful<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.040> Soul<00:01:36.220> Reapers<00:01:36.520> and

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
I've just be careful of Soul Reapers and

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.280 
I've just be careful of Soul Reapers and
don't<00:01:36.939> be<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.060> stupid<00:01:37.299> as<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.689> own<00:01:37.810> farm<00:01:38.049> in<00:01:38.170> this

don't be a stupid as I own farm in this

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.469 
don't be a stupid as I own farm in this
chest<00:01:38.530> because<00:01:38.680> it's<00:01:38.890> at<00:01:39.009> two<00:01:39.189> more<00:01:40.060> efficient

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
chest because it's at two more efficient

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.060 
chest because it's at two more efficient
math<00:01:40.750> wise<00:01:40.990> than<00:01:41.259> farming<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.710> underbridge

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
math wise than farming the underbridge

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.620 
math wise than farming the underbridge
because<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:42.490> don't<00:01:42.670> have<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:43.030> rely<00:01:43.150> on<00:01:43.330> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
because you don't have to rely on the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.480 
because you don't have to rely on the
underbridge<00:01:43.990> spawning<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.710> then<00:01:45.009> rely<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:45.430> a

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
underbridge spawning and then rely on a

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.270 
underbridge spawning and then rely on a
chest<00:01:45.729> falling<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.500> should<00:01:47.710> in<00:01:47.860> theory<00:01:48.130> be

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
chest falling so you should in theory be

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.030 
chest falling so you should in theory be
twice<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.780> much<00:01:49.780> chance<00:01:50.080> to<00:01:50.350> get<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.500> Chester

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
twice as much chance to get a Chester

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.249 
twice as much chance to get a Chester
but<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.509> have<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.750> pay<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.869> lot<00:01:53.049> more<00:01:53.080> attention

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
but you have to pay a lot more attention

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:02.039 
but you have to pay a lot more attention
here

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.120 

this<00:02:03.049> kind<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.289> champion<00:02:03.619> pack<00:02:03.770> obviously

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
this kind of champion pack obviously

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.620 
this kind of champion pack obviously
makes<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.340> if<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.640> harder<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:04.969> do<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:05.509> then

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
makes this if it harder to do but then

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.969 
makes this if it harder to do but then
at<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.780> same<00:02:05.840> time<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.380> under<00:02:06.590> bridge<00:02:06.740> has

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
at the same time the under bridge has

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.460 
at the same time the under bridge has
champion<00:02:07.700> spearmint<00:02:08.149> just<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:08.959> hard<00:02:09.170> as<00:02:09.289> sore

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
champion spearmint just as hard as sore

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.880 
champion spearmint just as hard as sore
as<00:02:09.500> if<00:02:09.860> not<00:02:10.039> harder
