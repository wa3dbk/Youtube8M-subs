00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 speaks guys had everything quiet whom 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.880
 What do you mean, occupy college and today? 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.230
 bringing another video here for you 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.389
 Unfortunately this video has no news. 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.389
 good for us paulistas and paulistanos 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.470
 tomorrow wednesday 27th 25th and 2015 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.740
 It is scheduled a strike of subway and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.869
 Are you together too? 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.240
 Look what beauty here for people who 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.520
 depends on the subway and the cptm nÃ© 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 the last strike we had was that it was 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.820
 not just the subway movie, right? 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 lasted five days and whoever uses the subway knows 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.719
 the chaos that was imagined this strike without the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 subway and without the cptm will also be 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.309
 Difficult to Wednesday people 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.710
 the strike is not really marked yet 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.969
 work is scheduled but they will do 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.170
 meetings today on Tuesday 26 25 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.289
 to decide if this strike will roll 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.400
 even trying to agree to see 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.430
 if it rolls the neo what we have until 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.110
 then formulating starts on Wednesday 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 from the first hour in some places 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.470
 it starts at 10 am other places 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.549
 he says that since the first hour of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.159
 operation 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.250
 do not risk the kind of bus of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.590
 ride a cow and come back from work 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 where do you want to go there that you need 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 subway or cptm in case it is not what they 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.210
 are passing here for people here 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.619
 yellow line does not adhere to the strike that is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.200
 a particular line 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.159
 so if you use the yellow line maybe 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.110
 wagon has does not to ensure all 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 the other lines are part of the subway 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 They will even stop in front of the cptm good for 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.780
 also said that the subway you get 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.549
 places the administrative staff to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.619
 work on the main subway lines 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.689
 to cover the strike but I remember that the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.549
 another strike also did this and did not 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.680
 It didnt help a lot. 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.399
 but it was a hell anyway to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.710
 everybody gets really hard 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.940
 employees are claiming 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.000
 higher wages 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.860
 everything that has even claimed right 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.770
 they do what unfortunately still 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.930
 damage is no way 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.770
 What I'm going to do in this video I'm going 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.170
 put all possible information 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.840
 lines that are running lines that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 are not working experiences of the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.650
 personnel even if you have a 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 bad experience or good this dispute 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.790
 line is working guys here can 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.580
 comments or adding video 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.190
 I'm always updating everything I 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.900
 rolling around there or down there and 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.700
 I'll put it in the video here for you. 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.500
 people look what I can 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.340
 I do not know if I already 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.030
 I said that but the yellow line on the subway 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.160
 she is private she is not she is not 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.620
 Metro itself so maybe she does not come 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.459
 on strike but this is also not certain 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.050
 from the galley 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.110
 if you take the yellow line and the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.790
 Wednesday bets on the comments she 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.680
 is not working to help the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.810
 staff there all right 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.430
 I like to make this video precisely 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.140
 because a lot of people start looking 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.280
 information is all very important. 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.660
 confused 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.590
 So how I updating this video? 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.750
 for as long as possible 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.090
 You do not have information there. 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.570
 is working on which is not 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.790

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.650

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.630

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.209

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.890
