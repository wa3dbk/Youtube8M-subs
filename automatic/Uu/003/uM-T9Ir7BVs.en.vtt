00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.540
 one 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.140
 to postpone 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.140
 person 6 is better not to approach

 its crown world the way to kill 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.740
 but 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.949

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.450
 sing ufa and 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.740
