00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.450
 to maintain a clean embankment there are 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.769
 three solutions the first is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.730
 weeding by hand it takes time 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 it's not possible 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.670
 the second is using products 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 chemical weedkillers but that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.759
 frankly it's not terrible 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.929
 and then the third solution well this 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.949
 puts me a physical protection for 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.609
 prevent weeds from growing 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.249
 for example the mulch is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.410
 how well it is a kind of fabric 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.180
 synthetic that will prevent the herbs 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.940
 to push through and who will 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.800
 keep clean to put it down well 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 there is a little knack it must be well 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.760
 sure the mulch canvas and then some 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.150
 staples with which we go 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.910
 hang first step we roll out the 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.910
 roof the mulch fabric on the embankment 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.329
 he 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.150
 and now there is only to put 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.140
 in place metal staples one 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.700
 that I showed you just now 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.659
 it's the one that will prevent the web 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.490
 to be torn off by the wind 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.229
 they will allow the canvas to 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.770
 mulching to stay in place for 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.090
 years put up the staples 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.130
 it's not very complicated 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.320
 just to sink them into the ground at 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:30.850
 through the mulch canvas and we 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 on all their authors 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 puts two by author hold the canvas on 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:45.179
 all its width and so on 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.179
 we put in about every two m 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.400
 here I have just finished laying my 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.049
 staples the canvas is now fine 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.970
 applied against the earth it does not risk 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.509
 not fly off and to crash on 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.670
 this canvas 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:16.060
 well there is only one solution 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:29.050
 it's making holes in it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:30.850
 three scorers here I'm going to crash my 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.380
 seedlings for example plans of the 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.370
 plans to hold the land of 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.160
 flowering shrubs 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.920
 I'm going to make a hole through this 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 opening that I practiced at the bridge of 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.580
 spasms is like that but 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.540
 airbus will be able to push without having 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.069
 weeds 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.400
 what is growing at the foot is not 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.400
 bad no
