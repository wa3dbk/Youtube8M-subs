being<00:01:17.020> a<00:01:17.170> fair-weather<00:01:17.710> jacket<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.610> doesn't

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
being a fair-weather jacket it doesn't

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.760 
being a fair-weather jacket it doesn't
need<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.120> have<00:01:19.240> at<00:01:19.330> all<00:01:19.540> really<00:01:19.990> warm<00:01:20.230> collar

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
need to have at all really warm collar

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.260 
need to have at all really warm collar
because<00:01:21.220> that's<00:01:21.430> not<00:01:21.580> when<00:01:21.790> it's<00:01:21.940> going<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.150> be

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
because that's not when it's going to be

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.070 
because that's not when it's going to be
used<00:01:22.510> or<00:01:22.780> work<00:01:22.990> best<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.910> has<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.180> very<00:01:25.750> soft

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
used or work best so it has a very soft

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.710 
used or work best so it has a very soft
almost<00:01:26.290> like<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.590> softer<00:01:27.550> neoprene<00:01:28.060> type<00:01:28.390> cover

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
almost like a softer neoprene type cover

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.190 
almost like a softer neoprene type cover
or<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.500> collar<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:31.060> foldable<00:01:31.630> bendable<00:01:32.050> we've

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
or a collar very foldable bendable we've

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.240 
or a collar very foldable bendable we've
never<00:01:32.470> once<00:01:32.770> felt<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.600> collar<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:36.070> know<00:01:36.100> we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
never once felt the collar you know we

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.440 
never once felt the collar you know we
wish<00:01:36.370> it<00:01:36.460> would<00:01:36.550> have<00:01:36.640> been<00:01:36.730> taller<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.300> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
wish it would have been taller and the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.150 
wish it would have been taller and the
temperatures<00:01:38.350> we've<00:01:38.530> been<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.860> but<00:01:39.040> we've

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
temperatures we've been in but we've

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.440 
temperatures we've been in but we've
never<00:01:39.340> noticed<00:01:39.670> anything<00:01:39.820> else<00:01:40.030> we<00:01:40.210> didn't

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
like

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.540 
like
it<00:01:41.690> doesn't<00:01:42.200> have<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.410> frontal<00:01:42.890> closure<00:01:43.190> that

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
it doesn't have a frontal closure that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.030 
it doesn't have a frontal closure that
closes<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.120> off<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:44.810> once<00:01:45.440> again<00:01:45.590> fair
