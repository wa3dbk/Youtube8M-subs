00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.700

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.700
 we stand together 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.880
 to have fallen 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:22.570

 times may represent and what you today in the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.820
 background looks is not one 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.490
 Ordinary there wants to be every corner 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.320

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.180
 any and we could already 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.160
 Yesterday really successful start 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.490
 I think she has really blatant 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.210
 commentary rausgehauen and go like that 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.220
 you also definitely something 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.490
 to see her and the background is one 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.670
 shotgun wants ebay noon 19 on the map 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.470
 comebacker plays is all of the tooth 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.299
 and yes that was such a funny story 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.750
 he did the livestream and then 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.520
 were the pros and the funniest thing was 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.650
 He then has another round play 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.320
 Here I come for a try 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.820
 and a round after the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.230
 performance 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.190
 he gets the double dip shotgun on 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.900
 every case runs with me and I go 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.090
 after what is short you say to that 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.740
 At the beginning you might have heard that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 Clover quote cut in a puff 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.050
 from world boys and I think most 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.869
 Intel worldwide if I'm on everyone 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.380
 Just look at googling world boys 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.150
 1 and 2 are the holst with this and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.970
 really horny movies, I have to say that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.400
 was yes we are fallen together 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 together and I wanted a bit 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.790
 talk about it because I find it in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 the german scene 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.200
 this courage or better this one 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.410
 Relationship gives that one to each other 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.729
 stands and collapses and me 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.009
 It would be a bit of a clause 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.800
 from widens to the individual 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.800
 person and year start right away 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.929
 And that's what I'm doing right 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.270
 the little one and I also say one 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.770
 clan 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.930
 it stands together and simplistic environment 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.870
 together what I mean by it and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.960
 special about this quote 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.000
 if you have friends the crap then builds 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.130
 more of a cloud a money or 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.850
 whatever for a special reason that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.710
 mega shit or because one has argue 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.880
 someone else and you just have to 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.440
 must the rules for him to have 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.210
 just next to him we stand for the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.430
 six seven types to run on you 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.740
 and want to beat you up and you have to 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.630
 then try it orally too 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.270
 so without somehow managing it 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.670
 wet rain then that is a very complete 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.740
 hard and for me it is really like that 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.150
 when i fuck my girlfriend 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.160
 then I stand where it is 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.140
 Shit what happens that rather can 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.930
 that would make the biggest crap I would 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.270
 say old what something that just a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.610
 But Schell deserves to be okay 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.770
 we solve that and I think if you can do that 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.710
 the cd scene referring simply 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.290
 that they have many clans among themselves even 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.370
 in the gloss itself know pretty hard 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.140
 to let 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.150
 not the member among each other 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.070
 united and that's where I want to be 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.870
 Arena on it now 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.180
 currently have the black sheep 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.130
 and I want a little bit like that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.780
 show what we did there and 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.930
 It was very clear with us 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.580
 we all get along great 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.250
 we are buddies these really friends 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.810
 actually in the sense and 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.300
 we can talk about everything in skype 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.130
 via reallife via via call of duty 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.530
 games or we can do everything 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.690
 talk together and that's why we wanted 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.100
 to call us a clear cause for 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.430
 Clearly, I always had the meaning 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.160
 yes, a clan is up again 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.590
 youtube specially jo one does that for 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.920
 clicks man makes the team news man makes 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.680
 that's what you do for subscribers 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.720
 not fun at all 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.570
 There are many youtube in the matter now 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.970
 they just start doing it that way 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.770
 for example, what I really shit 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.980
 Do not think what we are together 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.260
 we fall together means as stop 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.820
 not only does not stop coming up youtuber 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.829
 then, like others, I help more 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.169
 I do not understand for myself 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.080
 is it really you stand together then 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.590
 it stands out when i start now 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.379
 with youtube with the buddy at the same time 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.360
 and I would already be 50 khz 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.729
 would have 3000 subscribers 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.169
 I would stand him, but I would 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.180
 besides, shit 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.919
 and the same thing would be such a small one 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.780
 story at black shop we were yes 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.789
 means that we are faking and everything 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.490
 more that they therefore have us so 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.069
 on and on 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.490
 but hey haters gonna hate that you know 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.020
 but all quite honest from the op 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.300
 have stood by us 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.389
 who have been social to us 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.669
 all the clear on one side 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.710
 Saxons have only really got the finches 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.020
 old and there is on the side 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.300
 I like to be happy never missed 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.159
 we never liked it and that 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.479
 Gameplay has been reviewed and Rossmann 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.830
 that was not a fake 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:18.349
 and there was somehow clear and him 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.050
 to say there must be the scary fans 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.210
 say the people of oberplan 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.840
 the whole people at youtube that to us 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.000
 have stood and of course the 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.460
 social plan behind it and stood and said 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.590
 that's what they think they are 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.150
 make a wrong video area that 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.229
 that was to the i hope it has you 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.969
 still liked 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.409
 a bit profound commentary 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.319
 and see you next time 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.699
 Pure skin I think so 700 reviews 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.379
 you have to make it for this box office 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.379
 gameplay and ciao
