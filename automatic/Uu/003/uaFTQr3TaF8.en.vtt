let's<00:00:00.690> start<00:00:01.170> by<00:00:01.680> closing<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.790> just

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
let's start by closing this and just

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.130 
let's start by closing this and just
creating<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.110> new<00:00:04.500> empty<00:00:05.130> frame<00:00:05.430> set<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.660> do<00:00:06.870> so

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
creating a new empty frame set to do so

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.070 
creating a new empty frame set to do so
you'll<00:00:07.440> choose<00:00:07.770> file<00:00:08.309> new<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.840> new

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
you'll choose file new and in the new

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.440 
you'll choose file new and in the new
document<00:00:10.290> dialog<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.519> want<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.759> choose<00:00:11.969> page

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
document dialog you want to choose page

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.529 
document dialog you want to choose page
from<00:00:13.019> sample<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.309> then<00:00:14.490> choose<00:00:14.790> frame<00:00:15.330> set

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
from sample and then choose frame set

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.300 
from sample and then choose frame set
this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.750> easiest<00:00:19.350> way<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.710> create<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
this is the easiest way to create a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.040 
this is the easiest way to create a
frame<00:00:20.550> set<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.000> you'll<00:00:21.180> find<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> wide<00:00:21.720> variety

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
frame set and you'll find a wide variety

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
frame set and you'll find a wide variety
of<00:00:22.289> designs<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.010> choose<00:00:23.130> from<00:00:25.430> for<00:00:26.430> now<00:00:26.580> let's

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
of designs to choose from for now let's

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
of designs to choose from for now let's
choose<00:00:27.240> fixed<00:00:27.779> right<00:00:28.170> nested<00:00:28.769> bottom<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:30.890> as

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
choose fixed right nested bottom and as

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950 
choose fixed right nested bottom and as
you<00:00:32.250> create<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.940> Dreamweaver<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.780> now

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
you create this Dreamweaver is now

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
you create this Dreamweaver is now
asking<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> name<00:00:35.250> each<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> frames

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
asking you to name each of the frames

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
asking you to name each of the frames
and<00:00:36.899> because<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> uses<00:00:37.829> fairly<00:00:38.579> logical

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
and because it uses fairly logical

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.639 
and because it uses fairly logical
naming<00:00:39.510> structure<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.320> gonna<00:00:40.410> let

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
naming structure I'm just gonna let

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.160 
naming structure I'm just gonna let
Dreamweaver<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.850> me<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> want

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
Dreamweaver do that for me now I want

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.529 
Dreamweaver do that for me now I want
you<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> open<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> frames<00:00:44.160> panel<00:00:44.940> which

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
you to open the frames panel which

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.020 
you to open the frames panel which
you'll<00:00:45.719> find<00:00:45.960> under<00:00:46.110> window<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.010> you'll<00:00:47.879> get

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you'll find under window and you'll get

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790 
you'll find under window and you'll get
a<00:00:48.090> nice<00:00:48.390> little<00:00:48.420> preview<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.289> what's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
a nice little preview of what's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.760 
a nice little preview of what's
happening<00:00:50.219> behind<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.700> scenes<00:00:51.440> let<00:00:52.440> me<00:00:52.530> open

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
happening behind the scenes let me open

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.260 
happening behind the scenes let me open
this<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:53.969> see

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
this up a little bit so we can see

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.959 
this up a little bit so we can see
better<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.920> frame<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> right

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
better we have a frame here on the right

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.450 
better we have a frame here on the right
and<00:00:57.329> once<00:00:58.109> you've<00:00:58.260> created<00:00:58.500> frames<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.309> can

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and once you've created frames you can

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.819 
and once you've created frames you can
simply<00:00:59.850> click<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.270> drag<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:01.320> adjust<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
simply click and drag to adjust the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
simply click and drag to adjust the
spacing<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.300> Dreamweaver<00:01:03.750> called

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
spacing so you see Dreamweaver called

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.920 
spacing so you see Dreamweaver called
this<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.680> frame<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.309> called<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.570> center

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this right frame it called the center

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
this right frame it called the center
frame<00:01:07.170> main<00:01:07.770> frame<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:09.180> called<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
frame main frame and it called the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.080 
frame main frame and it called the
bottom<00:01:09.960> frame<00:01:10.229> look<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> bottom<00:01:11.880> frame

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
bottom frame look at that bottom frame

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
bottom frame look at that bottom frame
to<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.990> mean<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.380> logical<00:01:13.950> naming

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to see what I mean about logical naming

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.899 
to see what I mean about logical naming
structure

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
structure

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030 
structure
I<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.390> Dreamweaver<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.900> pretty<00:01:16.259> intuitive

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
I think Dreamweaver is pretty intuitive

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.640 
I think Dreamweaver is pretty intuitive
on<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
on this one so what you see here and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.800 
on this one so what you see here and
what<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:19.950> creating<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:21.299> four

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
what you're creating is really four

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.770 
what you're creating is really four
documents<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.799> once<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.479> right

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
documents at once this here on the right

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
documents at once this here on the right
is<00:01:25.049> its<00:01:25.680> own<00:01:25.920> HTML<00:01:26.250> page<00:01:28.159> this<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> my<00:01:29.520> right

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
is its own HTML page this is my right

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.929 
is its own HTML page this is my right
page<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.229> type<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.729> add

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
page and I can type into it I can add

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.330 
page and I can type into it I can add
content<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.799> bring<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
content into it so I could bring one of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.999 
content into it so I could bring one of
these<00:01:35.430> thumbnails<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.890> just<00:01:37.890> by

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
these thumbnails into here just by

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.590 
these thumbnails into here just by
clicking<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> dragging<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.360> course

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
clicking and dragging and of course

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.969 
clicking and dragging and of course
Dreamweaver<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.200> complaining<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
Dreamweaver is complaining because I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.020 
Dreamweaver is complaining because I
haven't<00:01:41.159> saved<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.000> yet<00:01:43.549> but<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.790> still

haven't saved this yet but I can still

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.440 
haven't saved this yet but I can still
go<00:01:45.180> ahead<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.630> put<00:01:45.780> some<00:01:45.810> alt<00:01:46.140> text<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.450> in

go ahead and put some alt text in and in
the<00:01:48.570> main<00:01:48.840> frame<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.979> also<00:01:50.159> type<00:01:50.490> text<00:01:53.000> and

the main frame I can also type text and

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.749 
the main frame I can also type text and
here<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> might<00:01:55.890> add<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> bigger

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
here I might add one of the bigger

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.660 
here I might add one of the bigger
pictures<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> let's<00:01:59.340> add<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
pictures that I have so let's add the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it hasn't been saved yet so Dreamweaver

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.800

that<00:02:12.420> address

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that address

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
that address
and<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:13.980> image<00:02:14.340> will<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.760> properly<00:02:15.150> linked

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and that image will be properly linked

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.350 
and that image will be properly linked
there<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:17.099> bottom<00:02:17.459> frame<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.909> also<00:02:18.329> a

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
there the bottom frame is also a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.289 
there the bottom frame is also a
separate<00:02:18.870> document<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.220> each<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.700> these

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
separate document so each of these

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.110 
separate document so each of these
sections<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.439> frameset<00:02:26.000> represent<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
sections of the frameset represent a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.990 
sections of the frameset represent a
different<00:02:27.780> HTML<00:02:28.290> file<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.980> there<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:29.970> a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
different HTML file and there is a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.390 
different HTML file and there is a
fourth<00:02:30.480> HTML<00:02:31.109> file<00:02:31.379> here<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.099> can't

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
fourth HTML file here that you can't

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.449 
fourth HTML file here that you can't
even<00:02:32.549> see<00:02:33.030> that's<00:02:33.510> behind<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.109> scenes<00:02:34.459> that

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
even see that's behind the scenes that

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.140 
even see that's behind the scenes that
file<00:02:35.939> is<00:02:36.239> called<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.900> frameset<00:02:37.769> file<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.090> if

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
file is called the frameset file so if

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.640 
file is called the frameset file so if
you<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.659> each<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.079> these<00:02:40.200> as<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
you can think of each of these as a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.309 
you can think of each of these as a
separate<00:02:41.069> frame<00:02:41.370> made<00:02:42.150> up<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.569> an<00:02:42.780> HTML

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
separate frame made up of an HTML

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.160 
separate frame made up of an HTML
document<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.609> forth<00:02:45.000> file<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.870> frame

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
document and the forth file is the frame

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.309 
document and the forth file is the frame
set<00:02:46.680> which<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.489> another<00:02:47.790> HTML<00:02:48.329> document<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
set which is another HTML document that

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.399 
set which is another HTML document that
simply<00:02:49.889> describes<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:51.180> placement<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
simply describes the placement and the

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.000 
simply describes the placement and the
size<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:53.099> each<00:02:53.609> of<00:02:53.849> these<00:02:54.030> frames<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:55.859> is

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
size of each of these frames so there is

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.429 
size of each of these frames so there is
one<00:02:56.250> document<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.879> creates<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.870> design

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
one document that creates this design

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.039 
one document that creates this design
and<00:02:58.769> three<00:02:59.489> more<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.269> are<00:03:00.389> displayed<00:03:00.810> within

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and three more that are displayed within

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.349 
and three more that are displayed within
it<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.500> watch<00:03:02.220> what<00:03:02.489> happens<00:03:02.849> when<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.060> go<00:03:03.299> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.920 
this this one goes all the way around
the<00:03:25.650> entire<00:03:25.769> window<00:03:26.549> that's<00:03:27.269> because<00:03:27.690> this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
the entire window that's because this

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.869 
the entire window that's because this
first<00:03:28.290> document<00:03:28.949> that<00:03:29.040> Dreamweaver<00:03:29.280> wants<00:03:29.790> to

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
first document that Dreamweaver wants to

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.390 
first document that Dreamweaver wants to
save<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.780> frame<00:03:31.079> set<00:03:31.379> itself<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.220> one

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
save is the frame set itself the one

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.699 
save is the frame set itself the one
that<00:03:32.549> represents<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.299> these<00:03:33.690> files<00:03:33.989> so

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
that represents all of these files so

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.759 
that represents all of these files so
the<00:03:34.829> entire<00:03:35.159> page<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.879> highlighted<00:03:36.720> I'm<00:03:37.590> going

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
the entire page is highlighted I'm going

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.770 
the entire page is highlighted I'm going
to<00:03:37.829> create<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.190> new<00:03:38.400> folder<00:03:38.669> as<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.299> save<00:03:39.540> these

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
to create a new folder as I save these

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.449 
to create a new folder as I save these
just<00:03:40.409> to<00:03:40.500> keep<00:03:40.620> them<00:03:40.829> separate<00:03:41.220> from<00:03:41.310> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
just to keep them separate from the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.879 
just to keep them separate from the
other<00:03:41.639> files<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.419> site<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.440> let's<00:03:43.650> just

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
other files in the site so let's just

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.240 
other files in the site so let's just
call<00:03:44.099> this<00:03:44.250> frame<00:03:44.819> test<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:48.500> now<00:03:49.500> as<00:03:49.769> we<00:03:49.979> save

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
call this frame test and now as we save

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.399 
call this frame test and now as we save
these<00:03:50.489> let's<00:03:50.909> name<00:03:51.329> them<00:03:51.599> I'm<00:03:52.049> going<00:03:52.169> to<00:03:52.260> call

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
these let's name them I'm going to call

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.530 
these let's name them I'm going to call
this<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:53.150> frame<00:03:54.150> set<00:03:56.060> because<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.389> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
this one frame set because this is the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.780 
this one frame set because this is the
frame<00:03:57.840> set<00:03:58.229> that<00:03:58.470> controls<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.040> display<00:03:59.340> of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
frame set that controls the display of

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.750 
frame set that controls the display of
the<00:03:59.970> other<00:04:00.150> three<00:04:00.479> frames<00:04:01.400> now<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.459> see

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
the other three frames now you see

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.520 
the other three frames now you see
Dreamweaver<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.329> prompting<00:04:03.750> me<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.870> save<00:04:04.229> the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
Dreamweaver is prompting me to save the

Dreamweaver is prompting me to save the
next<00:04:04.769> file<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.849> highlighted<00:04:06.389> only<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
next file and it's highlighted only the

next file and it's highlighted only the
one<00:04:07.349> on<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.590> right<00:04:07.799> here<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.790> let's<00:04:08.970> call<00:04:09.150> this

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
one on the right here so let's call this

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:16.399 
one on the right here so let's call this
right<00:04:09.780> frame<00:04:12.769> save<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:15.090> there<00:04:15.659> you<00:04:15.780> go<00:04:15.959> frame

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
right frame save and there you go frame

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.890 
right frame save and there you go frame
set<00:04:16.680> file<00:04:16.949> number<00:04:17.310> three<00:04:17.639> so<00:04:18.449> that's<00:04:18.659> my

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
set file number three so that's my

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.680 
set file number three so that's my
bottom<00:04:19.349> frame<00:04:19.859> seems<00:04:20.699> like<00:04:20.909> a<00:04:20.940> good<00:04:21.180> name<00:04:21.389> for

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
bottom frame seems like a good name for

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.909 
bottom frame seems like a good name for
it

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.230 

and<00:04:25.919> if<00:04:26.099> I<00:04:26.219> were<00:04:26.370> correct<00:04:26.729> that<00:04:26.939> there<00:04:27.090> are

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
and if I were correct that there are

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.510 
and if I were correct that there are
really<00:04:27.449> four<00:04:27.900> files<00:04:28.379> here<00:04:28.800> then<00:04:29.129> I<00:04:29.250> would<00:04:29.400> get

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
really four files here then I would get

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.369 
really four files here then I would get
prompted<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.090> save<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.479> fourth<00:04:30.719> one<00:04:30.930> now<00:04:31.080> and

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
prompted to save the fourth one now and

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.740 
prompted to save the fourth one now and
you<00:04:31.830> see<00:04:32.009> Dreamweaver<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.639> highlighting<00:04:33.210> that

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
you see Dreamweaver is highlighting that

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.709 
you see Dreamweaver is highlighting that
left<00:04:34.469> or<00:04:34.740> mainframe<00:04:35.460> area<00:04:35.909> so<00:04:36.360> let's<00:04:36.539> call

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
left or mainframe area so let's call

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:43.670 
left or mainframe area so let's call
that<00:04:36.780> one<00:04:36.960> mainframe<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:41.599> save<00:04:42.599> this<00:04:43.319> isn't<00:04:43.650> a

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
that one mainframe and save this isn't a

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.439 
that one mainframe and save this isn't a
very<00:04:43.830> pretty<00:04:44.129> design<00:04:44.520> we're<00:04:45.060> going<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.270> create

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
very pretty design we're going to create

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.420 
very pretty design we're going to create
a<00:04:45.509> much<00:04:45.629> prettier<00:04:46.050> design<00:04:46.349> in<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.590> moment<00:04:46.889> but<00:04:47.400> I

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
a much prettier design in a moment but I

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.790 
a much prettier design in a moment but I
wanted<00:04:47.759> you<00:04:47.909> to<00:04:47.939> see<00:04:48.360> what<00:04:48.539> happens<00:04:48.990> here<00:04:49.349> when

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
wanted you to see what happens here when

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.010 
wanted you to see what happens here when
you<00:04:49.889> create<00:04:50.219> a<00:04:50.460> new<00:04:50.550> frame<00:04:51.030> set<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.629> you

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
you create a new frame set and you

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.809 
you create a new frame set and you
create<00:04:52.319> new<00:04:52.590> documents<00:04:53.219> in<00:04:53.310> each<00:04:53.550> frame

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
create new documents in each frame

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.409 
create new documents in each frame
you're<00:04:54.539> actually<00:04:55.050> saving<00:04:55.319> four<00:04:56.039> files<00:04:56.460> the

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
you're actually saving four files the

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.990 
you're actually saving four files the
frame<00:04:57.689> set<00:04:58.050> as<00:04:58.229> well<00:04:58.860> as<00:04:59.039> each<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.759> pages

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
frame set as well as each of the pages

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.769 
frame set as well as each of the pages
within<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.229> frame<00:05:02.029> so<00:05:03.029> let's<00:05:03.210> go<00:05:03.419> ahead<00:05:03.509> and

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
within that frame so let's go ahead and

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.439 
within that frame so let's go ahead and
close<00:05:03.990> out<00:05:04.289> of<00:05:04.319> that
