00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.570
 friends here are back or I'm 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.960
 back from the team 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.880
 steffi and we are very much in the club today 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.439
 and we have interesting job 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.360
 found now also have three days 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.300
 promoted and now it's finally 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.009
 as far as we have the 30th today 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 and we want to go out today night 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.090
 yes quasi fishing in may and yes mine 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.699
 Colleagues once again also changes from 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 team and the name as a guest of the field 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.500
 trying also be halter view of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 carp and until then the routes 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.720
 built up 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.489
 I'm on feed right now 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:55.739
 I have put together for me 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.379
 channel mixer decided and has to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.480
 a few boys from nina wrabetz 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.449
 given that are the fischer let and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.940
 a few more pellets 1 x 10 mm 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.780
 and six millimeters 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.780
 I think I'm the biggest 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.720
 since the cards are still relatively decided 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.979
 are sluggish and not so hutter 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.539
 I would say that I am active 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.140
 but you can also do a lot 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.759
 fitter 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 there are still the little cards 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.990
 Squads are on the road and if the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.979
 Once in a circle I am then 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.689
 were not those from the feeding place either 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.640
 More way means you can do it 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.049
 a few more catches that too 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.380
 feeding place fast and for the big one 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.329
 card nothing remains 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.560
 and now for the first time after scented and 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.560
 facts that gives 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.630
 I chose this spot 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.210
 decided there at this spot yet 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.830
 after all, or under the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.440
 water surface still a few shrubs 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.570
 are and right in there just like times 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.460
 the cards and I have something too 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.900
 Large area fed the same 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.550
 experience knows that just the big ones 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:13.750
 fish rather passively at the feeding places 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:15.580
 eat and thus virtually escape yes 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.060
 times people know us, we know 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.430
 still 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530
 I'm just here to cristiano marion 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.730
 came and wanted to see what's here 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.530

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.570
 unfortunately not able to go fishing because of me 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.270
 I have to leave immediately and I was filthy 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.370
 surprised when I came here because that 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.220
 we have here today is at least 10 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.510
 go up to 15 and see the reasons 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.900
 you 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.180
 probably it's a couple 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.450
 fat are there and I guess 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.709
 for the night there is what you want yes 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.410
 unfortunately say goodbye to business 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.980

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.430
 the job occurred just behind the camera 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.430
 I will present myself again 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.590
 the whole crews at the start 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.480
 if I had, however, in the meantime 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.239
 a little something to boost for 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.769
 I will soon see the map 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.150
 Take trips ball from me there 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.720
 I also the blackwidow again 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.230

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.489

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.489

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.910
 delicious and 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.680
 that just cut off 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.950

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.000

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.380
 waters here in our isolated 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.100

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:33.110
