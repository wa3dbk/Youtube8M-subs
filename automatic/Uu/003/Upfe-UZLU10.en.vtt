we could have avoided this I'm not
breaking<00:00:51.420> hearts<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> end<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.039> will

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
breaking hearts about in the end we will

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.900 
breaking hearts about in the end we will
have<00:00:53.809> probably<00:00:55.370> we<00:00:56.370> probably<00:00:56.610> would<00:00:56.850> have

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
have probably we probably would have
