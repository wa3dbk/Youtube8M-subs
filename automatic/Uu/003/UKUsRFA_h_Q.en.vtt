00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
be perfectly honest this doesn't really

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.100 
be perfectly honest this doesn't really
seem<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.369> too<00:00:32.820> much<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.210> an<00:00:33.300> upgrade<00:00:35.180> but<00:00:36.180> one

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
seem like too much of an upgrade but one

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.690 
seem like too much of an upgrade but one
of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> cool<00:00:37.500> things<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.890> TrackMania<00:00:38.579> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
of the cool things about TrackMania is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400 
of the cool things about TrackMania is
that<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.360> create<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:39.870> own<00:00:39.930> levels<00:00:40.320> in

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that you can create your own levels in

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.369 
that you can create your own levels in
it<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.510> decided<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.690> play<00:00:42.870> around<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it and I decided to play around with a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.709 
it and I decided to play around with a
level<00:00:43.770> editor<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.640> wanted<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> show<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.390> my

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
level editor and I wanted to show off my

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.400 
level editor and I wanted to show off my
own<00:00:46.469> map<00:00:47.539> which<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.809> probably<00:00:49.110> gonna<00:00:49.260> be

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
own map which is probably gonna be

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.979 
own map which is probably gonna be
pretty<00:00:49.440> bad<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.059> my<00:00:51.300> first<00:00:51.510> map<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
pretty bad because it's my first map in

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.080 
pretty bad because it's my first map in
this<00:00:52.170> new<00:00:52.320> editor<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:53.160> well<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> same

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this new editor which well it's the same

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.459 
this new editor which well it's the same
old<00:00:54.270> editor<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> haven't<00:00:55.050> played<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
old editor but I haven't played for a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.330 
old editor but I haven't played for a

what I have to do have to replay and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
what I have to do have to replay and
play<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.960> gonna<00:01:13.110> race<00:01:13.290> against<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> my

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

old times
my<00:01:15.869> only<00:01:16.110> old<00:01:16.259> time<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.740> map<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> I

figure<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.110> probably<00:01:19.320> talk<00:01:19.560> about<00:01:19.619> some<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
figure I can probably talk about some of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
figure I can probably talk about some of
the<00:01:20.189> game<00:01:20.369> while<00:01:20.610> I'm<00:01:20.729> playing<00:01:20.970> through<00:01:21.180> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.950

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.279 
versus ghost sort of thing except for
instead<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.210> racing<00:01:52.539> against<00:01:52.869> ghost<00:01:53.079> you're

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
instead of racing against ghost you're

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.190 
instead of racing against ghost you're
actually<00:01:53.560> racing<00:01:53.649> against<00:01:54.100> light<00:01:54.280> people<00:01:55.200> but

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
actually racing against light people but

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.539 
actually racing against light people but
you<00:01:56.289> can't<00:01:56.469> like<00:01:56.649> interact<00:01:57.099> with<00:01:57.250> each<00:01:57.369> other

you can't like interact with each other

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.279 
you can't like interact with each other
so<00:01:57.970> it's<00:01:58.149> exhibit<00:01:58.539> you're<00:01:58.659> racing<00:01:58.929> against<00:01:59.229> a

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
so it's exhibit you're racing against a

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.230 
so it's exhibit you're racing against a
ghost

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
ghost

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.260

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.380 
pretty crazy looking tracks and we'll
get<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:15.099> is<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.489> some<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.790> basic<00:02:16.180> stuff

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
get this is just some of the basic stuff

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.460 
get this is just some of the basic stuff
we'll<00:02:16.569> get<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> weirder<00:02:17.200> stuff<00:02:17.410> later<00:02:19.470> so

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
we'll get to the weirder stuff later so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.870 
we'll get to the weirder stuff later so
actually<00:02:21.040> now<00:02:21.160> we'll<00:02:21.280> go<00:02:21.400> into<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.610> dirt

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
actually now we'll go into a dirt

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.770 
actually now we'll go into a dirt
environment

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.790 

and<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:28.000> actually<00:02:28.240> kind<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.420> cool<00:02:28.600> how<00:02:28.990> the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
and it's actually kind of cool how the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.330 
and it's actually kind of cool how the
minor<00:02:30.460> little<00:02:30.640> graphical<00:02:31.240> things<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:33.070> how

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
minor little graphical things like how

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.580 
minor little graphical things like how
now<00:02:33.640> my<00:02:33.820> car<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.090> getting<00:02:34.450> all<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.840> crap<00:02:35.440> all

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
now my car is getting all like crap all

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.270 
now my car is getting all like crap all
over<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:37.170> thanks<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.890> fact<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.130> I'm

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
over it thanks to the fact that I'm

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.870 
over it thanks to the fact that I'm
driving<00:02:39.430> around<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.880> dirt<00:02:40.860> whoa<00:02:43.530> yeah<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
driving around in dirt whoa yeah the the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.240 
driving around in dirt whoa yeah the the
car<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.240> this<00:02:46.330> game<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.750> also<00:02:46.959> indestructible

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.380 

but<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:52.120> essentially<00:02:52.810> die<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.310> way<00:02:54.490> by

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
but you can essentially die in a way by

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.160 
but you can essentially die in a way by
uh<00:02:55.530> well<00:02:56.530> wasn't<00:02:56.890> really<00:02:57.040> paying<00:02:57.130> attention

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
uh well wasn't really paying attention

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.590 
uh well wasn't really paying attention
by<00:02:59.170> doing<00:03:00.100> just<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.910> flipping<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.390> car

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
by doing just that and flipping a car

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.110 
by doing just that and flipping a car
over<00:03:01.930> your<00:03:02.709> car<00:03:02.920> essentially<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.730> can't<00:03:03.940> do

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
over your car essentially you can't do

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.830 
over your car essentially you can't do
anything<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.739> only<00:03:06.270> thing<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:07.360> can<00:03:07.510> do<00:03:07.660> is

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
anything so the only thing you can do is

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.240 
anything so the only thing you can do is
really<00:03:07.989> go<00:03:08.200> back<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.500> checkpoint<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:09.010> start

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
really go back to a checkpoint and start

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.750 
really go back to a checkpoint and start
over

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
over

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.690 
over
technically<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.810> guess<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.260> can<00:03:11.440> die<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.580> way

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
technically I guess you can die in a way

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.540 
technically I guess you can die in a way
by<00:03:13.120> falling<00:03:13.810> off<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.140> track<00:03:14.430> depending<00:03:15.430> on

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
by falling off the track depending on

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.449 
by falling off the track depending on
what<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> track<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.770> like<00:03:17.770> if<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.980> made<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.160> track

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
what the track is like if I made a track

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.190 
what the track is like if I made a track
that<00:03:18.610> was<00:03:18.730> entirely<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.570> air<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.140> you

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
that was entirely in the air and you

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.320 
that was entirely in the air and you
fell<00:03:20.410> off<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.890> then<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.280> pretty<00:03:21.940> much<00:03:22.030> die

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
fell off of it then you pretty much die

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.090 
fell off of it then you pretty much die
couldn't<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:22.930> back<00:03:23.050> on<00:03:25.800> anyways

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
couldn't get back on anyways

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.470 
couldn't get back on anyways
oh<00:03:27.130> yes<00:03:27.430> another<00:03:27.760> thing<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.270> game

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
oh yes another thing is that this game

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.280 
oh yes another thing is that this game
does<00:03:28.720> have<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:30.070> stereotypical<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:32.019> Hot

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
does have the stereotypical like Hot

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.320 
does have the stereotypical like Hot
Wheels<00:03:32.530> esque<00:03:32.890> racing<00:03:33.760> elements<00:03:34.209> like

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
Wheels esque racing elements like

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.270 
Wheels esque racing elements like
loop-de-loops

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
loop-de-loops

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.449 
loop-de-loops
whoa<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.580> boosters<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:38.190> hold<00:03:39.190> on<00:03:39.280> tightly

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
whoa and boosters I hold on tightly

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.590 
whoa and boosters I hold on tightly
share<00:03:39.670> all<00:03:39.760> these<00:03:39.820> boosters<00:03:40.180> are<00:03:40.330> supposed<00:03:40.540> to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
share all these boosters are supposed to

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.410 
share all these boosters are supposed to
work<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:41.140> they<00:03:41.260> make<00:03:41.410> your<00:03:41.530> car<00:03:41.650> go<00:03:41.680> faster

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.350 

now<00:03:46.870> I'm<00:03:46.960> gonna<00:03:47.050> try<00:03:47.290> something<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.830> little<00:03:48.360> bit

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
now I'm gonna try something a little bit

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.760 
now I'm gonna try something a little bit
harder<00:03:49.510> than<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> loop-de-loop<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:50.680> bit

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
harder than a loop-de-loop a little bit

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.850 
harder than a loop-de-loop a little bit
of<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.980> wall<00:03:51.340> ride<00:03:55.410> they're<00:03:56.410> really<00:03:56.710> not<00:03:56.800> that

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
of a wall ride they're really not that

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.930 
of a wall ride they're really not that
difficult<00:03:57.990> unless<00:03:58.990> you<00:03:59.080> miss<00:03:59.670> just<00:04:00.670> ignore

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
difficult unless you miss just ignore

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.870 
difficult unless you miss just ignore
that

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
that

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.400 
that
yeah<00:04:03.880> I'm<00:04:04.150> not<00:04:04.600> exactly<00:04:04.930> gonna<00:04:05.110> make<00:04:05.290> it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
yeah I'm not exactly gonna make it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.640 
yeah I'm not exactly gonna make it
perfect<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.830> run<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.430> my<00:04:06.580> own<00:04:06.730> track<00:04:07.030> too<00:04:07.300> but

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
perfect to run it's my own track too but

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.020 
perfect to run it's my own track too but
things<00:04:08.650> probably<00:04:08.920> because<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.250> it's<00:04:09.580> it's<00:04:09.940> a

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
things probably because I it's it's a

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.110 
things probably because I it's it's a
long<00:04:10.210> track<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:10.960> I<00:04:11.230> did<00:04:11.470> not<00:04:11.620> design<00:04:12.120> with

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
long track that I did not design with

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.759 
long track that I did not design with
exactly<00:04:14.020> too<00:04:14.260> much<00:04:14.500> care

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.540 

okay

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.860 

no<00:04:25.550> different<00:04:26.000> way<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.120> using<00:04:26.240> those<00:04:26.599> pieces

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
no different way of using those pieces

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.839 
no different way of using those pieces
is<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.289> make<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.470> corkscrew<00:04:27.979> type<00:04:28.520> thing<00:04:28.819> like

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
is to make a corkscrew type thing like

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.369 
is to make a corkscrew type thing like
this<00:04:29.349> we're<00:04:30.349> just<00:04:30.379> gonna<00:04:31.629> yeah<00:04:32.629> one<00:04:32.990> important

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:33.379 
this we're just gonna yeah one important

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.350 
this we're just gonna yeah one important
thing<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.560> know<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.919> that<00:04:33.979> uh<00:04:34.220> this<00:04:35.000> car<00:04:35.180> does

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
thing to know is that uh this car does

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.850 
thing to know is that uh this car does
not<00:04:35.389> automatically<00:04:36.080> magically<00:04:36.680> stick<00:04:36.949> to<00:04:37.069> its

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
not automatically magically stick to its

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.559 
not automatically magically stick to its
-<00:04:39.860> at<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.069> track<00:04:40.370> like<00:04:40.669> it<00:04:40.789> does<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> Nitronic

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
- at the track like it does a Nitronic

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.619 
- at the track like it does a Nitronic
rush<00:04:41.659> you<00:04:42.319> have<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:43.120> keep<00:04:44.120> track<00:04:44.990> of<00:04:45.520> gravity

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
rush you have to keep track of gravity

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.430 
rush you have to keep track of gravity
constantly<00:04:47.629> and<00:04:47.810> if<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:47.960> don't<00:04:48.110> have<00:04:48.229> enough

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
constantly and if you don't have enough

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.689 
constantly and if you don't have enough
speed<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.830> get<00:04:48.919> through<00:04:49.129> a<00:04:49.159> loop<00:04:49.370> you're<00:04:49.550> not

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
speed to get through a loop you're not

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.029 
speed to get through a loop you're not
going<00:04:49.879> through<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.120> loop<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:51.530> sometimes

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
going through that loop and sometimes

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.529 
going through that loop and sometimes
it's<00:04:52.340> just<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.550> matter<00:04:52.699> of<00:04:52.849> how<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.210> go<00:04:53.509> through

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
it's just a matter of how you go through

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.540 
it's just a matter of how you go through
the<00:04:53.810> loop<00:04:53.960> that<00:04:53.990> determines<00:04:54.620> whether<00:04:55.490> you

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
the loop that determines whether you

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.709 
the loop that determines whether you
actually<00:04:55.819> make<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:57.699> because<00:04:58.699> if<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.270> stick<00:04:59.479> if

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
actually make it because if you stick if

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.270 
actually make it because if you stick if
you<00:04:59.900> stay<00:05:00.110> on<00:05:00.139> some<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.680> more<00:05:01.009> vertical

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
you stay on some of the more vertical

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.100 
you stay on some of the more vertical
parts<00:05:01.789> too<00:05:01.969> long<00:05:02.360> you're<00:05:02.539> just<00:05:02.719> gonna<00:05:02.840> fall

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
parts too long you're just gonna fall

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.300 
parts too long you're just gonna fall
off<00:05:04.210> like<00:05:05.210> if<00:05:05.389> you<00:05:05.539> go<00:05:06.379> up<00:05:06.500> this<00:05:06.620> wall<00:05:06.860> ride<00:05:07.129> too

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
off like if you go up this wall ride too

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.300 
off like if you go up this wall ride too
early<00:05:07.729> you'll<00:05:08.330> start<00:05:08.569> slipping<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.259> not<00:05:10.159> be

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
early you'll start slipping and not be

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.670 
early you'll start slipping and not be
able<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.520> make<00:05:10.699> it<00:05:10.909> so<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:13.550> gotta<00:05:14.349> let<00:05:15.349> go<00:05:15.530> at

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
able to make it so you gotta let go at

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.230 
able to make it so you gotta let go at
the<00:05:15.710> last<00:05:15.979> second<00:05:16.430> but<00:05:16.789> if<00:05:16.879> you<00:05:16.969> go<00:05:17.060> with<00:05:17.090> the

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
the last second but if you go with the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.939 
the last second but if you go with the
lap<00:05:17.389> if<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.629> go<00:05:17.750> too<00:05:17.810> far<00:05:18.520> then<00:05:20.680> you'll<00:05:21.680> fall

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
lap if you go too far then you'll fall

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.670 
lap if you go too far then you'll fall
off<00:05:21.979> that<00:05:22.340> way<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:23.020> for<00:05:24.020> some<00:05:24.229> reason<00:05:24.530> I'm

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
off that way and for some reason I'm

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.210 
off that way and for some reason I'm
just<00:05:24.710> doing<00:05:25.099> really<00:05:25.250> badly<00:05:25.490> at<00:05:25.729> this

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.880 

yeah<00:05:29.760> there<00:05:30.270> we<00:05:30.450> go<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:31.320> yeah<00:05:31.470> there's<00:05:31.800> a

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
yeah there we go so yeah there's a

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.560 
yeah there we go so yeah there's a
little<00:05:32.070> bit<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.280> precision-driving<00:05:32.790> required

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
little bit of precision-driving required

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.500 
little bit of precision-driving required
for<00:05:34.040> some<00:05:35.040> of<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:35.160> more<00:05:35.310> obtuse<00:05:35.550> levels<00:05:36.210> oh

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
for some of the more obtuse levels oh

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.880 
for some of the more obtuse levels oh
yeah<00:05:39.510> this<00:05:39.840> is<00:05:39.870> something<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.290> like<00:05:40.410> doing<00:05:40.770> is

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
yeah this is something I like doing is

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.980 
yeah this is something I like doing is
been<00:05:41.040> doing<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.460> long<00:05:41.970> vertical<00:05:42.270> jumps<00:05:42.870> like

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
been doing a long vertical jumps like

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.409 
been doing a long vertical jumps like
this

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.059 

the<00:05:48.960> lighting<00:05:49.229> in<00:05:49.319> this<00:05:49.439> game<00:05:49.590> is<00:05:49.710> also<00:05:49.919> pretty

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
the lighting in this game is also pretty

00:05:50.069 --> 00:06:02.420 
the lighting in this game is also pretty
nice<00:05:50.870> dynamic<00:05:51.870> shadows<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.349> everything<00:05:54.409> okay

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.670 

back<00:06:03.090> on<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.389> dirt<00:06:03.540> track<00:06:03.570> because<00:06:04.320> why<00:06:04.500> not

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
back on the dirt track because why not

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.409 
back on the dirt track because why not
and<00:06:07.680> you<00:06:07.770> can<00:06:07.800> make<00:06:08.100> like<00:06:08.490> this<00:06:08.790> is<00:06:08.970> in<00:06:09.180> no<00:06:09.389> way

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
and you can make like this is in no way

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.780 
and you can make like this is in no way
like<00:06:10.199> representative<00:06:11.010> of<00:06:11.130> the<00:06:11.280> full

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
like representative of the full

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.390 
like representative of the full
capabilities<00:06:12.479> of<00:06:12.510> this<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:12.900> track<00:06:13.139> editor

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
capabilities of this the track editor

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.340 
capabilities of this the track editor
you<00:06:14.400> can<00:06:14.550> make<00:06:14.729> like<00:06:15.030> any<00:06:15.360> sort<00:06:15.780> of<00:06:15.870> track<00:06:16.139> with

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
you can make like any sort of track with

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.500 
you can make like any sort of track with
this<00:06:16.500> thing<00:06:16.910> and<00:06:17.910> this<00:06:18.030> is<00:06:18.090> just<00:06:18.210> one

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
this thing and this is just one

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.000 
this thing and this is just one
environment<00:06:19.020> there's<00:06:19.199> other<00:06:19.380> environments

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
environment there's other environments

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.350 
environment there's other environments
which<00:06:20.100> will<00:06:20.220> probably<00:06:20.400> also<00:06:20.729> make<00:06:21.000> videos<00:06:21.150> of

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
which will probably also make videos of

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.270 
which will probably also make videos of
later<00:06:22.790> and<00:06:23.790> we'll<00:06:24.210> finish<00:06:24.660> up<00:06:24.960> with<00:06:25.229> a<00:06:25.280> epic

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
later and we'll finish up with a epic

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.550 
later and we'll finish up with a epic
jump<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:26.880> will<00:06:27.060> fall<00:06:27.300> off<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.660> track<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:28.290> die

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
jump and will fall off the track and die

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.090 
jump and will fall off the track and die
a<00:06:28.590> horrible<00:06:29.220> death<00:06:30.620> let's<00:06:31.620> try<00:06:31.800> that<00:06:31.949> one

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
a horrible death let's try that one

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.170 
a horrible death let's try that one
again<00:06:32.130> I<00:06:34.430> usually<00:06:35.430> make<00:06:35.550> that<00:06:35.729> jump<00:06:35.940> up<00:06:36.060> my

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
again I usually make that jump up my

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.650 
again I usually make that jump up my
first<00:06:36.389> try<00:06:36.660> in<00:06:36.960> these<00:06:37.169> uh<00:06:37.850> like<00:06:38.850> I<00:06:39.000> obviously<00:06:39.479> I

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
first try in these uh like I obviously I

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.790 
first try in these uh like I obviously I
already<00:06:39.810> played<00:06:40.050> this<00:06:40.139> track<00:06:40.380> at<00:06:40.530> least<00:06:40.650> once

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
already played this track at least once

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.400 
already played this track at least once
before<00:06:41.360> this<00:06:42.360> jump<00:06:42.600> isn't<00:06:42.840> that<00:06:42.930> hard

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
before this jump isn't that hard

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:51.110 
before this jump isn't that hard
it<00:06:43.710> was<00:06:43.860> weird<00:06:45.139> come<00:06:46.139> on<00:06:46.699> there<00:06:47.699> we<00:06:48.060> go<00:06:50.120> and

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
it was weird come on there we go and

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.510 
it was weird come on there we go and
there<00:06:51.539> we<00:06:51.720> go<00:06:51.870> yeah<00:06:52.680> a<00:06:52.710> lot<00:06:52.949> slower<00:06:53.190> than<00:06:53.340> my

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
there we go yeah a lot slower than my

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.260 
there we go yeah a lot slower than my
old<00:06:53.669> time<00:06:53.910> but<00:06:54.240> I<00:06:55.430> won<00:06:56.430> medals<00:06:56.760> on<00:06:57.000> my<00:06:57.120> own

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
old time but I won medals on my own

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.340 
old time but I won medals on my own
track<00:06:57.600> and<00:06:58.260> I<00:06:58.710> didn't<00:06:59.010> win<00:06:59.190> gold

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
track and I didn't win gold

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.640 
track and I didn't win gold
well<00:07:01.350> then<00:07:02.960> anyway<00:07:03.960> so<00:07:04.020> yeah<00:07:04.260> that's<00:07:04.470> uh
