00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.339
 good 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.119
 hi everyone knows she's wrong and we 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.360
 finds himself for a little tutorial how 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.930
 to install feed the beast so it's already 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.910
 a mode that allows you to good 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.449
 it's a wholesale mode 20 months of easter 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.910
 which allows you to make 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.230
 machines etc to exploit the game to 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 in short, it's a little complicated explained 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.070
 because there are full full full 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 a lot of things so there is as much to them 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.040
 see you go sure you mark 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.230
 feed the beast and then you look 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 some little videos and then it's 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.040
 very interesting you have to really like 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 the thing but it's a very website 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.829
 interesting 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.300
 so to install it just enough 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.770
 just go on feed the beast 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 points like all the links will be in 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.199
 the description I will put you the link 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.420
 so to fix track in the description 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.160
 but also the link can be direct 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.220
 to download if I can put it 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.380
 but hey it's all stupid so you 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.149
 go to their website 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 you're going to land here just enough to 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.950
 December then you have feed the beast 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.899
 it tells you the easter words 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.470
 there you do not press you have client 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.599
 customer dome lahoud 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.800
 you have the point e and xx and the bridge 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.530
 jar play me I take it all the time 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.780
 the bridge x has just enough to press 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.369
 it'll open it for you I already have it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.800
 so I will not register 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.259
 I 'm just canceled and once that 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.369
 it's done you have this little launcher 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.500
 who is here once it's done you 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 you open it that will open you 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.840
 precisely feed the beast and with according 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.390
 chuck you will just be able to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.070
 install the versions that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.330
 I want you to fix beast they are 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:02.400
 all all in or open age two 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.920
 I have not been paying attention so 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.540
 it opens you here and there now 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.000
 you have a small interface that is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.950
 nice enough so news options 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 the maps and all that so marks it 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 can be very interesting because 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.750
 bahia maps of feed the beast that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.760
 are already made 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.760
 that is, there are already machines 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.130
 already already advanced valleys 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.430
 and there you exactly say woolf who 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.050
 he did it with episodes and then he 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.440
 friends so if you want it's his 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.940
 episode 80 his episode 80 or I was 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 just you have selected them you 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.340
 put the map and then install it you will 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.239
 install the pac textures you 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.400
 have some easterly textures that have been 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.890
 modified to feed the beast a little in 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.180
 somehow somehow I hope 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.590
 you understand and you could that if 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.930
 you put a textures not that it's going 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.870
 ask you a little more power 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.290
 from your computer so lemon already feed the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.200
 beast 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.790
 with a little bit of trouble I concede 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.970
 not masters easter words because that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.620
 you just know to be unplayable 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.799
 then you have the options so the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.150
 options that it can be really good 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.760
 so you can put the oar that you 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.360
 want for me g8 gia so that but 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.850
 almost 8 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.500
 that's what the updates are all about 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.560
 you have everything you want you 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.120
 can press had 27 options and then 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.500
 it will put you read as they say 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.540
 the size of the window and there was the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.780
 bomba the news which is all that which 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.190
 is compared to the easter homos 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.140
 so here we go 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.100
 finally if you want to read you can 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.570
 read and now and especially 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.010
 to be interested in the words of Easter that's it 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.750
 the most interesting so there you have 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.320
 full full of easter words with 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:02.260
 different versions for example 1.4.2 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:04.870
 1.417 a bridge 2.5 1.417 1.5.2 all one 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.930
 point five points here are you full 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.940
 full of two different modes packs 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.830
 on two different versions 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.780
 for example if I want this one if I 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.620
 want this one there is a point is 5.2 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.930
 I launched it is not launching his 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.690
 writings launched if you press that will you 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.210
 so install for example if I 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.040
 press it there I'll throw can see that 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.220
 download me the mode pack I'm going 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.970
 to be canceled because that interests me 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.950
 not at the moment 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:44.050
 good now then select if 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.750
 you want to get started sarah 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.350
 download then it's up to you 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.780
 automatically launch the the game I have 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.780
 my davis who just bugged 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.090
 it comes from bugs and that's because 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.380
 I am doing renderings end 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.180
 rendered doing another 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.890
 next thing I can not delete it 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.180
 we will open them a simply 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.040
 it is not very serious 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.950
 so that rarely happens his first 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.420
 time it happens to me so here it is 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.820
 you have the different pact modes 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.640
 would you like to rely on them for 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.410
 download one for example this one 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.510
 it you have you already 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.580
 once played donations if you already have 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.580
 played once so you already have it 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:37.200
 necessarily download it will just be enough 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.260
 will just follow it back launched that goes 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.600
 you restart the puck mode directly 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.000
 so down so that's it 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.420
 just that you're really full 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.550
 of options a download serve zai full 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.210
 lots of stuff so that's what it is 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.420
 is so cool 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.190
 so I'll leave you in it's just 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.050
 that's the words of Easter that's it 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.910
 more interesting impressions of the debates 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.050
 for easter textures the options 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.440

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.680
