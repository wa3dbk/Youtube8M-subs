00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
actually think he might be a good

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730 
actually think he might be a good
investment<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> good<00:01:43.500> feeling

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
that if he does get a second inform

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.149 
that if he does get a second inform
it'll<00:01:45.990> probably<00:01:46.170> come<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> left-wing

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it'll probably come out as a left-wing

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.249 
it'll probably come out as a left-wing
and<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> does<00:01:48.060> come<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.420> as<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.659> left-wing

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and if it does come out as a left-wing

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.800 
and if it does come out as a left-wing
guess<00:01:49.530> what<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> only<00:01:50.490> cm<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.540> cam

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
guess what this is the only cm or cam

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
guess what this is the only cm or cam
card<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.700> really

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
as many players as i can the worst case

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.810 
as many players as i can the worst case
scenario<00:03:33.470> they<00:03:33.740> don't<00:03:34.010> increase<00:03:34.400> in<00:03:34.610> price

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
scenario they don't increase in price

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.890 
scenario they don't increase in price
the<00:03:35.180> worst<00:03:35.540> case<00:03:35.780> scenario<00:03:36.520> is<00:03:37.520> not<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.690> bad

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
the worst case scenario is not that bad

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.240 
the worst case scenario is not that bad
i<00:03:39.110> mean<00:03:39.320> if<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.500> think<00:03:39.530> about<00:03:39.680> it's<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.070> worst

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
i mean if you think about it's the worst

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.890 
i mean if you think about it's the worst
case<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:40.670> they<00:03:40.790> don't<00:03:40.970> they<00:03:41.480> don't<00:03:41.510> increase

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
case so they don't they don't increase

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.540 
case so they don't they don't increase
in<00:03:42.050> price<00:03:42.260> who<00:03:42.530> cares<00:03:42.830> i<00:03:42.980> get<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.250> sell<00:03:43.430> them
