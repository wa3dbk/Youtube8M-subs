00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
this architecture and we did not just

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 
this architecture and we did not just
specify<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> architecture<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:41.040> did<00:00:41.460> also

built<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.960> system<00:00:43.260> prototype<00:00:43.890> based<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
built a system prototype based on this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 
built a system prototype based on this
architecture<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.899> prototype<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.770> ready

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
now for field operational files then we

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
now for field operational files then we
have<00:00:50.460> developed<00:00:51.210> an<00:00:51.570> integrated<00:00:52.079> simulation

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
have developed an integrated simulation

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.619 
have developed an integrated simulation

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
it's extremely important that the OEMs

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.010 
it's extremely important that the OEMs
collaborate<00:06:07.610> in<00:06:07.820> the<00:06:07.970> area<00:06:08.330> of<00:06:08.480> cooperative

collaborate in the area of cooperative

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.110 
collaborate in the area of cooperative
systems<00:06:09.380> that's<00:06:09.890> quite<00:06:10.250> a<00:06:10.280> simple<00:06:10.520> reason<00:06:10.970> for

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
systems that's quite a simple reason for

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.120 
systems that's quite a simple reason for
that<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:11.510> that<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:11.810> that<00:06:12.380> it<00:06:12.560> is<00:06:12.680> absolutely

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
that and that is that it is absolutely

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.030 
that and that is that it is absolutely
necessary<00:06:13.280> that<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:14.000> world<00:06:14.210> war<00:06:14.360> truck<00:06:14.570> can

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
necessary that the world war truck can

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.400 
necessary that the world war truck can
communicate<00:06:16.040> with<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:16.400> Mercedes<00:06:16.940> and<00:06:17.410> open

communicate with the Mercedes and open

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.670 
communicate with the Mercedes and open
with<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.620> Fiat<00:06:18.980> so<00:06:19.900> OEM<00:06:20.900> need<00:06:21.200> to<00:06:21.350> collaborate

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
with a Fiat so OEM need to collaborate

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.760 
with a Fiat so OEM need to collaborate
in<00:06:22.010> that<00:06:22.160> area<00:06:22.340> because<00:06:22.700> otherwise<00:06:23.030> this

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
in that area because otherwise this

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.100 
in that area because otherwise this
vision<00:06:24.770> of<00:06:24.920> the<00:06:25.880> co-operative<00:06:26.450> system<00:06:26.930> will

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
vision of the co-operative system will

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.570 
vision of the co-operative system will
always<00:06:27.410> stay<00:06:27.590> a<00:06:27.620> vision<00:06:27.980> and<00:06:28.100> will<00:06:28.250> not<00:06:28.400> become

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
always stay a vision and will not become

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.150 
always stay a vision and will not become
reality
