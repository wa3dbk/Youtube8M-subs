blame<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.320> director<00:01:54.830> on<00:01:55.010> this<00:01:55.280> he<00:01:55.940> actually

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
blame the director on this he actually

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.500 
blame the director on this he actually
has<00:01:56.479> one<00:01:56.840> really<00:01:57.350> good<00:01:57.530> scene<00:01:57.860> where<00:01:58.220> he

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
has one really good scene where he

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.030 
has one really good scene where he
explains<00:01:59.510> his<00:01:59.750> point<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.110> view<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.409> Bella<00:02:00.619> and
