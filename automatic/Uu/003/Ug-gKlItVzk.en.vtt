and try to protect your go from time to
time<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.920> isn't<00:01:42.220> seeming<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:43.000> bad<00:01:43.299> I

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
time this isn't seeming that bad I

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.649 
time this isn't seeming that bad I
remember<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.320> being<00:01:44.350> more<00:01:44.890> difficult<00:01:45.659> okay

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
remember it being more difficult okay

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.030 
remember it being more difficult okay
here<00:01:46.869> comes<00:01:47.080> another<00:01:47.200> one<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.710> them<00:01:52.830> all<00:01:53.830> right

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
here comes another one of them all right

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.039 
here comes another one of them all right
she<00:01:54.490> threw<00:01:54.700> some<00:01:54.880> skull<00:01:55.180> bombs<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.869> just
