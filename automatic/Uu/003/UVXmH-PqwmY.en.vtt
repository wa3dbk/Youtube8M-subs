00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
back there is all chromed out that lift

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
back there is all chromed out that lift
gain<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> back<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.409> power<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.430> have

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
gain in the back is power so you have

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
gain in the back is power so you have
power<00:01:33.090> open<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> close<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> remote<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
power open and close on the remote and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.950 
power open and close on the remote and
there<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> back<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.299> camera<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.659> backup

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
there is a back up camera and backup

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.380 
there is a back up camera and backup
sensors<00:01:37.259> back<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.680> well<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
sensors back here as well now in the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.460 
sensors back here as well now in the
back<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.750> there's<00:01:39.930> also<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.439> call

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
back here there's also what they call

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
back here there's also what they call
rear<00:01:40.979> cross-traffic<00:01:41.250> alert<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.299> basically

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
rear cross-traffic alert so basically

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.030 
rear cross-traffic alert so basically
there's<00:01:42.840> sensors<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.439> built<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there's sensors that are built into the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
there's sensors that are built into the
beams<00:01:44.220> over<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.540> they<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.930> they

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
beams over here and what they do is they

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.530 
beams over here and what they do is they
shoot<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:46.470> left<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
shoot out left or right and what that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.819 
shoot out left or right and what that
means<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:48.960> you're<00:01:49.049> pulling<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> spot

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
means is if you're pulling out of a spot

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.800 
means is if you're pulling out of a spot
you'll<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.670> able<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.880> detect<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you'll be able to detect if there is a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.060 
you'll be able to detect if there is a
vehicle<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.200> coming<00:01:52.500> from<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> left<00:01:52.920> or

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
vehicle that's coming from the left or

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.460 
vehicle that's coming from the left or
to<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:54.200> that's<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.380> available

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to the right of you that's not available

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520 
to the right of you that's not available
on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> SLT<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.090> will<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.200> back<00:01:58.350> up

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
on the SLT but it will have the back up

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
on the SLT but it will have the back up
camera<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.009> backup<00:01:59.399> sensors<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> SLT

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
camera and backup sensors on the SLT

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.940 
camera and backup sensors on the SLT
so<00:02:01.630> that's<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.960> difference<00:02:02.230> on<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.440> SLT

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
so that's the difference on the SLT

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.620 
so that's the difference on the SLT
versus<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.370> Denali<00:02:03.580> this<00:02:04.180> truck<00:02:04.390> over<00:02:04.600> here

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
versus the Denali this truck over here

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.060 
versus the Denali this truck over here
is<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.080> SLT<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:05.680> were<00:02:05.770> talking<00:02:06.040> about

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
is the SLT that we were talking about

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.680 
is the SLT that we were talking about
again<00:02:06.400> white<00:02:06.640> diamond<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.480> see<00:02:07.570> the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
again white diamond you can see the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.830 
again white diamond you can see the
lower<00:02:07.840> fascia<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.890> all<00:02:09.100> black<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.300> basically

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
lower fascia is all black so basically

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.630 
lower fascia is all black so basically
has<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> little<00:02:11.770> bit<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.920> more<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.280> two-tone

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
has a little bit of more of a two-tone

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.030 
has a little bit of more of a two-tone
look<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.570> girl<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.900> front<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.320> not<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
look the girl on the front is not the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.470 
look the girl on the front is not the
chrome<00:02:15.280> finish<00:02:15.610> but<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.880> still<00:02:16.090> has<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.240> little

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
chrome finish but it still has a little

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.660 
chrome finish but it still has a little
bit<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.690> cratan<00:02:16.960> satin<00:02:17.560> chrome<00:02:17.680> finish<00:02:17.800> and

bit of cratan satin chrome finish and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.910 
bit of cratan satin chrome finish and
it's<00:02:18.880> got<00:02:19.030> these<00:02:19.210> LED<00:02:19.900> daytime<00:02:20.410> running<00:02:20.620> lamps

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
it's got these LED daytime running lamps

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.160 
it's got these LED daytime running lamps
which<00:02:21.250> run<00:02:21.430> both<00:02:21.580> vehicles<00:02:21.990> now<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
which run both vehicles now on the

cashmere on this one as opposed to cocoa

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.050 
cashmere on this one as opposed to cocoa
doing<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.010> we<00:02:30.070> saw<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.340> other<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.580> now

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
doing that we saw on the other one now

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.170 
doing that we saw on the other one now
you<00:02:31.120> can<00:02:31.300> see<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.690> one<00:02:31.750> here<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> top

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
you can see on this one here the top

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.570 
you can see on this one here the top
part<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.570> dashboard<00:02:34.960> is<00:02:35.050> black<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.310> seats

themselves<00:02:37.330> are<00:02:37.690> almost<00:02:37.870> like<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> dark

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
themselves are almost like a dark

chocolate almost like a brown dark tan
so<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.920> obviously<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.580> little<00:02:42.700> bit<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:42.970> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so and obviously a little bit of a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.250 
so and obviously a little bit of a
different<00:02:43.300> attribute<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> inside

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
different attribute on the inside

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.449 
different attribute on the inside
doesn't<00:02:44.860> have<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.040> wood<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.400> leather

doesn't have that wood and leather
steering<00:02:45.760> wheel<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.540> still<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.080> nicely

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
steering wheel but still is nicely

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.750 
steering wheel but still is nicely
equipped<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:47.980> got<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.220> navigation

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
equipped so it's got the navigation

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.790 
equipped so it's got the navigation
system<00:02:49.120> built<00:02:49.300> in<00:02:49.450> there<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.200> three<00:02:50.470> zones<00:02:50.500> of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
system built in there the three zones of

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.380 
system built in there the three zones of
climate<00:02:51.220> seats<00:02:51.670> are<00:02:51.820> heated<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.180> they<00:02:52.270> are

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
climate seats are heated but they are

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.760 
climate seats are heated but they are
not<00:02:52.630> perforated<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.530> not<00:02:53.590> air

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
not perforated so it's not air

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.770 
not perforated so it's not air
conditioned<00:02:54.130> seats<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:55.330> does<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
conditioned seats and it does have the

are up and the door is open you have 24

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.850 
are up and the door is open you have 24
cubic<00:03:25.540> feet<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.930> space<00:03:26.019> behind<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.620> third<00:03:26.830> row

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
cubic feet of space behind the third row

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.570 
cubic feet of space behind the third row
you<00:03:27.459> can<00:03:27.700> fold<00:03:27.970> these<00:03:28.150> down<00:03:28.450> in<00:03:28.690> both<00:03:28.900> vehicles

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
you can fold these down in both vehicles

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.940 
you can fold these down in both vehicles
to<00:03:30.580> hold<00:03:31.180> down<00:03:31.300> both<00:03:31.510> sides<00:03:31.690> that's<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.019> 60/40

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
to hold down both sides that's a 60/40

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.940 
to hold down both sides that's a 60/40
split<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:34.570> now<00:03:35.050> you<00:03:35.110> can<00:03:35.320> get<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> lot<00:03:35.709> more

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
split so now you can get a lot more

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.040 
split so now you can get a lot more
space<00:03:36.250> second<00:03:36.790> row<00:03:36.880> also<00:03:37.090> folds<00:03:37.630> down<00:03:37.750> flat<00:03:38.019> so

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
space second row also folds down flat so

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.270 
space second row also folds down flat so
you<00:03:38.170> had<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.380> carry<00:03:38.530> something<00:03:38.739> really<00:03:39.100> long

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
you had to carry something really long

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.710 
you had to carry something really long
you<00:03:39.670> could<00:03:39.790> do<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:39.940> only<00:03:40.090> from<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.420> back<00:03:40.570> to

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
you could do that only from the back to

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.750 
you could do that only from the back to
the<00:03:40.750> front<00:03:40.959> another<00:03:41.709> note<00:03:41.920> another<00:03:42.340> little

thing<00:03:42.790> that's<00:03:43.060> different<00:03:43.269> between<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.750> SLT

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
thing that's different between the SLT
