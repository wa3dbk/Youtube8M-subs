00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
screen and the other thing that I also

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.330 
screen and the other thing that I also
then<00:02:39.239> use<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.720> recommend<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.260> recording<00:02:41.160> with

then use and recommend is recording with
ScreenFlow<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.420> Camtasia<00:02:43.670> now<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.450> app<00:02:45.629> that

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
ScreenFlow and Camtasia now the app that

ScreenFlow and Camtasia now the app that
you<00:02:46.140> need<00:02:46.319> for<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:47.340> actually<00:02:48.000> not

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
you need for this is actually not

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.509 
you need for this is actually not
something<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.440> install<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.099> iPad

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
something that you install on your iPad

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.770 
something that you install on your iPad
it's<00:02:50.730> something<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.150> need<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.299> install

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
it's something that you need to install

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.750 
it's something that you need to install
on<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> computer<00:02:52.440> where<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.099> want<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.400> share

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
on a computer where you want to share

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.710 
on a computer where you want to share
the<00:02:54.660> screen<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:55.260> your<00:02:55.319> computer<00:02:56.329> so<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.599> app

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
the screen of your computer so the app

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.380 
the screen of your computer so the app
that<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.989> need<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.470> called

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
that you need for that is called

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.640 
that you need for that is called
reflection<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.900> think<00:03:01.380> it's<00:03:01.500> called

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
reflection I think it's called

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.690 
reflection I think it's called
reflection<00:03:02.069> or<00:03:02.130> something<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.489> I'll

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
reflection or something like that I'll

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.130 
reflection or something like that I'll
link<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.150> below<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.540> video<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.079> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
link to it below this video so that you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.750 
link to it below this video so that you
can<00:03:04.260> click<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.250> go<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.489> get<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
can click on it and and go and get it I

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.339 
can click on it and and go and get it I
think<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.090> something<00:03:06.239> like<00:03:06.360> 5<00:03:06.750> or<00:03:06.959> 10<00:03:07.140> bucks

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
think it's something like 5 or 10 bucks

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.350 
think it's something like 5 or 10 bucks
however<00:03:08.099> much<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.519> it's<00:03:08.670> totally<00:03:08.849> worth<00:03:09.180> it

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
however much it is it's totally worth it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.670 
however much it is it's totally worth it
because<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.810> allows<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.319> share<00:03:10.500> your

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
screen like this which is very very

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.610
