hey what's up again back in the other
videos<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:19.730> uh<00:00:19.760> today<00:00:20.330> I'm<00:00:20.450> talking<00:00:20.630> about<00:00:20.869> one

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
videos so uh today I'm talking about one

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.980 
videos so uh today I'm talking about one
of<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.730> common<00:00:22.730> here<00:00:23.060> stretching<00:00:23.420> technique

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
of the common here stretching technique

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.810 
of the common here stretching technique
known<00:00:24.140> as<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.619> tape<00:00:24.830> wrapping<00:00:25.130> method<00:00:25.610> and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
known as the tape wrapping method and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.240 
known as the tape wrapping method and
the<00:00:26.779> tape<00:00:26.990> wrapping<00:00:27.260> method<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:27.860> basically

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
the tape wrapping method is basically

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.619 
the tape wrapping method is basically
just<00:00:28.689> wrapping<00:00:29.689> layers<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:30.140> tape<00:00:30.320> around<00:00:30.830> a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:31.629 
just wrapping layers of tape around a

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.510 
just wrapping layers of tape around a
set<00:00:32.629> of<00:00:32.660> plugs<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.320> slowly<00:00:33.620> increase<00:00:34.100> up<00:00:34.489> to

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
set of plugs to slowly increase up to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.840 
set of plugs to slowly increase up to
the<00:00:34.730> next<00:00:35.000> size<00:00:35.210> you're<00:00:35.449> trying<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.720> get<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.850> so

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
the next size you're trying to get to so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.600 
the next size you're trying to get to so
a<00:00:38.420> tape<00:00:39.050> wrapping<00:00:39.320> method<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:39.980> good<00:00:40.220> because

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
a tape wrapping method it's good because

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.580 
a tape wrapping method it's good because
it's<00:00:41.000> pretty<00:00:41.210> slow<00:00:41.510> it's<00:00:41.780> not<00:00:41.930> as<00:00:42.050> drastic<00:00:42.500> as

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
it's pretty slow it's not as drastic as

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.650 
it's pretty slow it's not as drastic as
using<00:00:42.920> tapers<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:43.640> like<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:43.850> said<00:00:43.970> it's<00:00:44.269> it's

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
using tapers but like I said it's it's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.649 
using tapers but like I said it's it's
you<00:00:45.620> know<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.890> lot<00:00:46.129> more<00:00:46.309> gradual<00:00:46.790> process<00:00:47.360> and

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
you know a lot more gradual process and

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.439 
you know a lot more gradual process and
takes<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.930> little<00:00:48.050> more<00:00:48.229> time<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.449> generally

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
takes a little more time so generally

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.700 
takes a little more time so generally
the<00:00:50.540> people<00:00:50.659> who<00:00:50.960> use<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.260> tape<00:00:51.440> wrapping

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the people who use the tape wrapping

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.590 
the people who use the tape wrapping
method<00:00:52.129> most<00:00:52.339> of<00:00:52.640> those<00:00:52.790> with<00:00:53.000> already<00:00:53.510> a

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
method most of those with already a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.850 
method most of those with already a
larger<00:00:54.019> size

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
larger size

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.189 
larger size
you<00:00:55.549> know<00:00:55.610> for<00:00:56.299> example<00:00:56.360> people<00:00:56.870> who<00:00:56.989> have

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
you know for example people who have

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.990 
you know for example people who have
stretched<00:00:57.470> up<00:00:57.650> to<00:00:57.680> an<00:00:57.920> inch<00:00:58.159> there's<00:00:58.760> not

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
stretched up to an inch there's not

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.579 
stretched up to an inch there's not
really<00:00:59.269> any<00:00:59.510> tapers<00:00:59.900> that<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:00.080> can<00:01:00.229> get<00:01:00.379> after

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
really any tapers that you can get after

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.210 
really any tapers that you can get after
one<00:01:01.250> inch<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.530> basically<00:01:03.530> using<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.010> tape

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
one inch so basically using the tape

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.219 
one inch so basically using the tape
wrapping<00:01:04.460> method<00:01:04.909> is<00:01:05.030> only<00:01:05.210> this<00:01:05.659> is<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.080> only

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
wrapping method is only this is the only

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.320 
wrapping method is only this is the only
method<00:01:06.500> people<00:01:06.950> can<00:01:07.100> use<00:01:07.310> for<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.700> for<00:01:08.270> the

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
method people can use for the for the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.399 
method people can use for the for the
larger<00:01:08.690> size<00:01:08.900> stretching<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.780> but<00:01:11.780> onto<00:01:12.290> the

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
larger size stretching so but onto the

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.770 
larger size stretching so but onto the
stretcher<00:01:12.619> on<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.250> tape<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.210> tape<00:01:14.420> there's

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
stretcher on the tape the tape there's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.120 
stretcher on the tape the tape there's
two<00:01:14.930> different<00:01:15.049> kinds<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.409> tape<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.680> people

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
two different kinds of tape that people

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.010 
two different kinds of tape that people
generally<00:01:16.369> use<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.940> first<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.540> light<00:01:17.780> your

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
generally use the first is light your

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.130 
generally use the first is light your
tape<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:19.670> know<00:01:19.759> pretty<00:01:20.359> much<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:20.689> everybody's

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
tape you know pretty much in everybody's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.980 
tape you know pretty much in everybody's
house<00:01:21.649> you<00:01:22.039> know<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.640> it's<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.509> not<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
house you know it's a it's it's not the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.770 
house you know it's a it's it's not the
best<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.439> use<00:01:24.619> because<00:01:25.479> when<00:01:26.479> you've<00:01:26.600> already

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
best to use because when you've already

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.870 
best to use because when you've already
wrapped<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:27.350> up<00:01:27.469> around<00:01:27.649> your<00:01:27.799> plug<00:01:28.159> it's

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
wrapped it up around your plug it's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.090 
wrapped it up around your plug it's
sometimes<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.750> stickiness<00:01:30.409> on<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.770> inside

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
sometimes the stickiness on the inside

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.760 
sometimes the stickiness on the inside
will<00:01:31.399> actually<00:01:31.729> sometimes<00:01:32.689> leak<00:01:33.020> out<00:01:33.289> in<00:01:33.590> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
will actually sometimes leak out in the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.490 
will actually sometimes leak out in the
inside<00:01:34.219> of<00:01:34.609> your<00:01:35.210> ear<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:35.810> some<00:01:36.229> people

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
inside of your ear so some people

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
inside of your ear so some people
actually<00:01:36.649> kind<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.039> have<00:01:37.189> an<00:01:37.310> allergic

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
actually kind of have an allergic

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.399 
actually kind of have an allergic
reaction<00:01:37.820> with<00:01:38.329> that<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.840> some<00:01:39.109> people<00:01:39.380> just

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
reaction with that and some people just

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.419 
reaction with that and some people just
I've<00:01:40.130> heard<00:01:40.340> some<00:01:40.609> bad<00:01:40.789> stories<00:01:41.299> about<00:01:41.329> it<00:01:41.659> so

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
I've heard some bad stories about it so

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.190 
I've heard some bad stories about it so
I've<00:01:43.429> heard<00:01:43.609> good<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.060> bad<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.749> know<00:01:44.899> I

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
I've heard good and bad but you know I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.410 
I've heard good and bad but you know I
think<00:01:45.560> for<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.070> bad<00:01:46.249> stories<00:01:47.240> I've<00:01:47.390> heard

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
think for the bad stories I've heard

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.779 
think for the bad stories I've heard
it's<00:01:47.780> probably<00:01:48.140> not<00:01:48.229> worth<00:01:48.439> trying<00:01:48.710> what<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.700> do

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's probably not worth trying what I do

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.649 
it's probably not worth trying what I do
recommend<00:01:50.090> getting<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.810> PTFE<00:01:51.710> tape<00:01:52.659> it's

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
recommend getting is PTFE tape it's

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.989 
recommend getting is PTFE tape it's
really<00:01:53.990> cheap<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:54.679> it's<00:01:55.009> really<00:01:55.460> efficient

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
really cheap it's it's really efficient

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.880 
really cheap it's it's really efficient
it's<00:01:56.179> not<00:01:56.359> them<00:01:56.570> having<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:56.929> sticky<00:01:57.439> mess<00:01:57.649> in

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
it's not them having that sticky mess in

opinion<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:07.090> well<00:02:08.090> on<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.539> actual

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
opinion so well on to the actual

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.800 
opinion so well on to the actual
wrapping<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.500> know<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:10.120> always<00:02:11.120> recommend

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
wrapping you know I always recommend

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.890 
wrapping you know I always recommend
using<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.290> single<00:02:12.680> flare<00:02:12.860> tunnel<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:14.569> reason

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
using a single flare tunnel the reason

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.800 
using a single flare tunnel the reason
for<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.319> because<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.970> already<00:02:17.240> got<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
for this is because it's already got the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.870 
for this is because it's already got the
lip<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.319> front<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.770> know<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.550> hold<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
lip on the front you know to hold the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.670 
lip on the front you know to hold the
front<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.600> hold<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> front<00:02:21.050> from<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.590> know

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
front to hold the front from you know

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.460 
front to hold the front from you know
falling<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.390> back<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.900> actually<00:02:24.230> you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
falling out in the back and actually you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.460 
falling out in the back and actually you
know<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.830> actually<00:02:24.980> kind<00:02:25.280> of

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
know you can actually kind of

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.410 
know you can actually kind of
at<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.740> tape<00:02:25.950> inside<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.730> back<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> plug

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
at the tape inside the back of the plug

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.810 
at the tape inside the back of the plug
so<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.160> there's<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> bunch<00:02:29.730> of

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
so you know so there's not a bunch of

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.100 
so you know so there's not a bunch of
stuff<00:02:30.060> sticking<00:02:30.510> out<00:02:30.630> when<00:02:30.840> you're<00:02:30.960> actually

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
stuff sticking out when you're actually

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.320 
stuff sticking out when you're actually
inserting<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.280> not<00:02:32.490> too<00:02:32.730> hard<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.060> get<00:02:33.210> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
inserting it it's not too hard to get it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.770 
inserting it it's not too hard to get it
and<00:02:33.450> don't<00:02:33.630> get<00:02:33.750> all<00:02:33.870> bunched<00:02:34.170> up<00:02:34.410> so

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
and don't get all bunched up so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
and don't get all bunched up so
basically<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.320> pull<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.800> know<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.340> cut<00:02:38.550> a

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
basically you pull you know you cut a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.160 
basically you pull you know you cut a
piece<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.820> tape<00:02:39.120> off<00:02:39.360> yours<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.750> there's<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
piece of tape off yours and there's a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.560 
piece of tape off yours and there's a
piece<00:02:40.380> I've<00:02:40.560> already<00:02:40.800> kind<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.010> cut<00:02:41.220> out<00:02:41.570> you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
piece I've already kind of cut out you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.230 
piece I've already kind of cut out you
know<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.750> pull<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.680> put<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.490> length<00:02:44.820> out<00:02:45.030> that

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
know you pull a put a length out that

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.570 
know you pull a put a length out that
makes<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.600> wrap<00:02:45.810> all<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.290> way<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.800> little<00:02:47.400> more

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
makes it wrap all the way a little more

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.840 
makes it wrap all the way a little more
than<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> full<00:02:48.150> wrap<00:02:48.450> around<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.800> plug<00:02:50.040> so

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
than a full wrap around your plug so

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.450 
than a full wrap around your plug so
just<00:02:51.540> take<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.720> wrap<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.680> full<00:02:52.920> way<00:02:53.130> around

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
just take that wrap it a full way around

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.100 
just take that wrap it a full way around
and<00:02:53.760> here's<00:02:54.060> one<00:02:54.270> I've<00:02:54.480> already<00:02:54.630> got<00:02:54.870> done

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
and here's one I've already got done

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.360 
and here's one I've already got done
this<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.470> what<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> should<00:02:55.800> look<00:02:55.830> like<00:02:56.010> when

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
this is what it should look like when

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.100 
this is what it should look like when
you're<00:02:56.460> done<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:57.360> should<00:02:57.390> still<00:02:57.720> see<00:02:57.930> them<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
you're done you should still see them a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.510 
you're done you should still see them a
little<00:02:58.380> bit<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.590> metal<00:02:58.920> out<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.190> front

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
little bit of the metal out the front

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.540 
little bit of the metal out the front
and<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.630> back<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.050> tucked<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.130> inside

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
and the back is tucked in on the inside

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.210 
and the back is tucked in on the inside
so<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.780> know<00:03:03.870> all<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.200> gotta<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:04.950> put

a little Lube on it and just pop that
thing<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.490> it's<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.209> really<00:03:09.450> won't<00:03:09.600> even

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
about one layer at a time you'll one

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.640 
about one layer at a time you'll one
full<00:03:14.580> wrap<00:03:14.940> around<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.930> really<00:03:16.170> won't<00:03:16.350> even

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
full wrap around you really won't even

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.530 
full wrap around you really won't even
feel<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.100> going<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.550> it's<00:03:17.880> not<00:03:18.090> gonna<00:03:18.300> feel

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
feel it going in it's not gonna feel

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.480 
feel it going in it's not gonna feel
like<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.750> stretch<00:03:19.110> but<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:20.070> know<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.459> a

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
like a stretch but you know it is a

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.180 
like a stretch but you know it is a
gradual<00:03:20.970> process<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.080> know<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.590> does<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
gradual process but you know it does the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.960 
gradual process but you know it does the
job<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.500> key<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.830> doing<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.220> do<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
job so and the the key to doing is do a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.720 
job so and the the key to doing is do a
wrap<00:03:27.270> between<00:03:27.810> I'd<00:03:28.320> say<00:03:28.560> over<00:03:28.740> one<00:03:29.100> two<00:03:29.430> weeks

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
wrap between I'd say over one two weeks

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.020 
wrap between I'd say over one two weeks
you<00:03:29.970> know<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:31.350> know<00:03:31.440> after<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.610> two<00:03:32.640> weeks

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
he should be fun - to do it the next

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.810 
he should be fun - to do it the next
wrap<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.920> definitely<00:03:37.920> not<00:03:38.010> rush<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.519> if<00:03:38.640> you
