00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:02.520
 Hello again 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.720
 movellán jeep huston found the amount 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.340
 However, if you do not change the name in the past but these workshops 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.639
 as 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.449
 intervenes does not complicate me either 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.519
 a body in the head photo he found looking in google 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.679
 he is not very hard to find 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.070
 as saxophone mix 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.169
 good paper 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.579
 in the meeting between them has more than saleh in exchange for that four times 768 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.640
 well this is the tribute to those 1024 by 768 of véteris 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.900
 cut it 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.440
 forget it in some way so that it is this resolution since it is necessary 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.260
 so that it is accepted in the songs that narrate that aena 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.290
 luckily the when is very well 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.150
 i just behind year 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.860
 so clement 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 now we are going to put everything first 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.340
 we have 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.290
 we have no difficulties so 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.510
 I will answer directly the name I'm going to put reckless is the 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.250
 type of cyclists that I do 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.720
 it is something like absurd 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 something 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 totally decompensated 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.310
 the answers is not the difficulty that you want to feed osuna 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 another ginter already exists as pixmania rooms 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.990
 or not achieve as they are the dragon temple 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.950
 percent 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.510
 there is a lot of difficulty 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.670
 when you can make her wait 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.840
 I'm going to do reckless as I say it's common to 15 years pretty complex 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.740
 the first 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.010
 I hope to leave as is the locals will not touch 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.710
 we would 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.000
 of those summoned in total are 1 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.700
 of the total of stays in apartments of 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.970
 from the campus 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.060
 and I'm going to put it down because combos usually come up 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.039
 the little screen 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.480
 jimena that three 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 decade color I approached debris 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.309
 earth the colors we are going to make 3 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.449
 and the first one is going to be to turn this background color 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.929
 but more clearly 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:25.259
 which is approximately is a bit acid gray and a little reddish 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.259
 like this 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.259
 so what to do a little bit more clearly 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.699
 if you can do it but little more because of doing it because 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.089
 cute also kind of pretty good effect 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.309
 pass this color 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.329
 a little bit stronger 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.919
 and finally one darker 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.789
 to highlight 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.449
 qin 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.449
 vie if you do not like the combos you can believe 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.349
 that advice 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.989
 take the picture and look for the three colors 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.459
 or four golds that have 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.380
 what 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.059
 also did 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.009
 happens that stands out in some areas 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:14.309
 there is only one color 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:19.349
 that was another reason why we recommend making a scale two or three colors 1 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.719
 more clarito to the intermediate and others cured 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.289
 but try to go out and finish them assange said to go to scale if there was more 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.149
 clear and then I saw the cigars 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.559
 because otherwise 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.479
 you do not win letter experience 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.429
 well this does not matter 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.789
 because the song that they put us is obligatory 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.379
 but I'm not going to put 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.379
 ortiz was born in quito 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.349
 and the stirrup albino in this case without success 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.540
 stop the combos and 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.429
 apparently they have been pretty good 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.649
 so what I'm going to teach now is how 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:59.589
 Manzana 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.429
 the sounds good 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.429
 despite this great volume the song has a volume 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.739
 and a force 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.579
 If it is passages 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.859
 the song sounds bad his height and his image 2 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.690
 i also 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.860
 that the lack itself and it is about that they sound alike 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.059
 everything depends on the effect you want to give 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.059
 a little bit stronger a little bit weaker 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.069
 for example I spin but we have to be at the end you can leave it at 5 which is the 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.449
 minimum volume 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.449
 let's start 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.800
 I'm going to do 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 some tests 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.219
 does not think hitting everything alone and 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.110
 a little 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 for the volume 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 and we were to try to buy volume that comes 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.770
 zoé too strong and also we do not want 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.330
 percent of the normal type let's go to yourself 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.279
 the sample choose 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.389
 warm sadop with minute 50 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
 It also has 52 hours 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.620
 they all one pretty well 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.800
 so I'm going to let the cinema count 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.139
 i 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.770
 with him sa 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.889
 how to differentiate the parties that have to go shock and the parties and that have 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.250
 what to go 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.300
 normal 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.630
 if that's so bland 3 listen to the battery when 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.249
 sybase inc a part that is very strong 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.360
 or a note that is a very nice 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.900
 we are very happy if you have to put normal because it is what we most 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.470
 remains 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.749
 p if it is for example such a simple piano 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:56.689
 or it is simply a melody 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.930
 on matters of background jose a 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.309
 a cappella 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:01.509
 percent 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:02.349
 So be it
