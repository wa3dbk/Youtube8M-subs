00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.980
 -there is my name is Adam Perez Plaza 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.099
 the world 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.370
 we currently live in a society 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.530
 fully mechanized this has caused 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.000
 that over the years since childhood 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.500
 to adulthood we suffer great 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 changes in our mentality our 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.190
 way of seeing things and our way 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050
 to carry them out when we were children 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.489
 our creativity spontaneity 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 in front of a problem of an obstacle 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.630
 It was amazing but over the years we 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.460
 losing what little by little since you are looking 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.190
 a solution for all if you try not 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.870
 being spontaneous that makes our life 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.309
 it becomes monotony and we lose 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.930
 a lot of time in giving value to what 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.330
 we think that it has more and for the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.100
 otherwise it is not the parkour or 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.230
 movement in itself the control of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.240
 body helps break this mold that 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.690
 mechanization that limits us in body and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.690
 in mind 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.510
 from my point of view we have to be more 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 exhaustive in our search that 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.380
 we really want for us studied 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.150
 sciences of physical activity and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.620
 sport in these last three years I have 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.150
 learned how important is the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.150
 training one like the other 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.790
 the parkour taught much the latter 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.770
 years like for example values â€‹â€‹that have 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.270
 a great reference in my life and about 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.340
 everything has taught me to value what 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.590
 really important in this enjoy 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.090
 doing what you like most has made me 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590
 taught to face challenges every day 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.270
 who have crossed my path I 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.880
 learned a lot from the failures that I've 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.590
 had since I started in this try 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.600
 mentalizing myself that one fails in something 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.220
 for the mere fact of not trying it for 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.079
 what as said charles dickens 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.479
 every failure teaches us something that 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.649
 we need to learn and in this way the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.759
 man never knows what he is capable of 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.759
 until he tries 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.060
 over the years it can be seen that the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.979
 effort and dedication are the values 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.840
 most important to succeed in the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.459
 attainment of a goal so 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.040
 I learned that this effort and dedication 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.050
 has a reward in the person and his 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.240
 personality without having to wait for anything 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.920
 in return in this way you can see the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.590
 great potential that parkour has for 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.480
 train people there is also a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.790
 direct relationship between the movement of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.720
 the person and his character expressing well 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.550
 his personality in the form of movement 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.410
 I consider that the mind is a piece 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.210
 essential nothing would be possible if not 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.980
 let's trust ourselves if we do not 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.780
 we could do something or something 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.330
 but rationalize what we see 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.370
 physically possible trust in one 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.840
 same is very important in life by 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.270
 so it should be our first 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.070
 goal that has failed several times 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.840
 when training this confidence has to 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.760
 try to get small milestones for 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.190
 be rewarded and always try 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.320
 Go more to be ambitious in achieving 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.550
 of a goal for oneself is not bad if 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.470
 does not intervene in the life of a third party 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.150
 we have to keep in mind that we do not have 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.890
 control over the future and we can not 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.630
 intervene in what has already happened 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.460
 so we have to try to be 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.010
 effective in what is happening the 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.540
 now this moment is to say in life 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.830
 like in a jump you have to try 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.750
 control every moment you get 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.380
 poses as a problem without thinking that 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.360
 achievement may have in the future 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.010
 and one who does not understand what is based 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840
 this those who say that it is something 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.460
 dangerous do not have to what extent 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.650
 we are aware of our body and 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.600
 of the environment that surrounds us I would like 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.100
 convey how much satisfaction can 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.320
 get to provide a good jump 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.030
 done or the fact of getting to get 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.250
 something that you have been training for 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.320
 a lot of time those thousandths of a second 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.090
 can not be expressed with words anymore 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.010
 that beyond these cause a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.080
 feeling of self-improvement difficult to 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.480
 explain life to the last moment 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.970
 gives you the opportunity to learn to 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.360
 I have a lot more is more 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.360
 start
