00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.480
 Welcome or welcome to this new 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.020
 video tutorial today we are going to learn how 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.020
 we can download the office preview 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.810
 2016 for both 32 and 64 bits 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.790
 for windows ok I want to emphasize on this 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.580
 because for those who do not know the version 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.080
 was released first of all for mac and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.640
 now officially has already released this 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.770
 version for windows I had the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.260
 opportunity to try it and I thought 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.059
 pretty good in my concept as far as 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.910
 to the value of the graphics in terms of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.530
 GUI does not vary much the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.059
 Truth has you tried on another machine not 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.620
 on this computer but I can 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.239
 tell them that the interface in the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.549
 moment of understanding that is the preview 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.409
 it is not yet the end of office 2016 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.750
 but they have simply added him in the 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.940
 top part what is a single tone 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.890
 colored something like saint material 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.080
 let's say other words colors more 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.549
 nice and we also have the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.170
 opportunity for something of the most important 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.479
 that comes with a teddy bear 2016 that is 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.010
 obviously that is in the news is that 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.470
 we will have the opportunity to edit 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.820
 an online document with several people 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.890
 of if we can create a document and 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.109
 many people can edit it online 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.700
 in that document at the same time something 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.720
 Well, it really is quite 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.070
 excellent so 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.440
 those who want to download it because this 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.750
 new preview version of ofitas link 16 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.410
 you can do it already so we started with 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.410
 this video tutorial 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.430
 in the description of this video you will be able to 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.560
 find a link so we can 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.120
 download then it is previous one time 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.070
 that you click on that entity 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.350
 directly to an entry in my blog or 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.850
 on web page as well as this one that you 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.150
 come here which is called the ofi 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.980
 2016 preview for both 32 and 64 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.750
 bits for here it's worth just let's 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.250
 go down a little bit more in the entrance and we 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.860
 let's go to these options where 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.900
 says download here they specify both 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.120
 for 32 bits is going to click on this 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.910
 function here here and perform by 32 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.530
 bits and for 64 bits it will click 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.090
 in the function below in this case my 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.950
 system at that time is 32 bits 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.420
 we implemented click on the first 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.040
 function that will send us to a page 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.590
 of affleck we just have to wait 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.820
 not only 5 seconds after this 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.700
 let's click on the top 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.590
 right where it says jump advertising 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.750
 this is going to send us to a page of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.459
 mediafire the download manager for 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.860
 that can download the file in this 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.180
 case it only weighs 1.1 mb so 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.010
 I just love to click on this 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.690
 green box where it says download 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.070
 once we do it we will see that 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.540
 already the file is going to start 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.490
 download on the desktop so 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.410
 let's see where we stayed 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.720
 at that time I have already stayed here in 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.160
 the desktop the download would be a matter 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.870
 to select them then click 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.510
 right on him and we will give him where 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.250
 says extract here that we will have the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.320
 next folder that we are going to dislike 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.240
 what is the setup to can install this 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.400
 32-bit previews so just 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.140
 kind let's double click on the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.550
 folder and we will find inside 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.360
 them a file that would go by name or 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.700
 16 by 32 bits and a serial that we're going 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.900
 to ask after installation ok in 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.550
 this case is very simple simply 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.810
 let's double click on the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.920
 application 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.960
 we have to be connected to the internet 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.280
 because some files are required 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.710
 additional obviously to be able 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.360
 install this preview how it works 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.800
 we simply double click as they 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.070
 I say let's download it internally and let's go 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.540
 to wait a few minutes and then this 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.160
 it will automatically be installed for example 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.320
 if you have questions the main 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.030
 is that if you must from 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.120
 uninstall the previous version either 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.800
 the 2007 the 2010 because the truth is that not 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.110
 they must uninstall to there is no 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.330
 problem in my case the machine that 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.370
 install had both versions and there was no 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.500
 no problem just doing the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.180
 download automatically installs and 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.480
 then let us see the packages in this 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580
 case 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.250
 with microsoft word microsoft powerpoint 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.049
 excel and other functions more so that 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.549
 you can try them on the concept 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.959
 Well, I gave you the concept at the beginning 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.480
 that obviously the graphic interface in 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.709
 this moment does not change very much 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.360
 simply some internal functions 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.280
 but you obviously can get your 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.379
 own conclusion if you want to download it 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.239
 this new function because nothing this would be 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.920
 the video tutorial of this occasion I hope 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.900

 you will like the new features and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.810
 the evolution that this 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.120
 channel over time so a lot
