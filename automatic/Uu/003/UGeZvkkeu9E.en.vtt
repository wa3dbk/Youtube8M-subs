next<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.689> won<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
think honestly because no one knows what

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.819 
think honestly because no one knows what
the<00:00:33.059> world<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> shushing<00:00:33.870> delirious<00:00:34.320> that's

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the world of shushing delirious that's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.340 
the world of shushing delirious that's
because<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> came<00:00:35.460> from<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
because it came from right here so it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.049 
because it came from right here so it
might<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.649> pay<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> thought

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
might not pay that as well as we thought

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.139 
might not pay that as well as we thought
but<00:00:39.590> we'll<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.610> we're<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> start

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but we'll see first we're going to start

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.779 
but we'll see first we're going to start
off<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.719> our<00:00:42.960> fish<00:00:43.559> basket<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> reason

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
off with our fish basket and the reason

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.479 
off with our fish basket and the reason
I<00:00:44.910> chose<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.270> fish<00:00:45.539> basket<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.309> simply<00:00:47.309> because

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I chose a fish basket is simply because

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
I chose a fish basket is simply because
it's<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.360> something<00:00:48.719> round<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:50.070> holes<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it's it's something round with holes in

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
it's it's something round with holes in
it<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.640> stuff<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.180> hang<00:00:51.360> from<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.899> there<00:00:52.050> may

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it that stuff can hang from so there may

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
it that stuff can hang from so there may
be<00:00:52.199> something<00:00:52.530> even<00:00:52.829> better<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
be something even better out there that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
be something even better out there that
say<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> use<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
say you can think up to use this is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.930 
say you can think up to use this is
really<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> first<00:00:56.340> thing<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.610> came<00:00:56.910> to

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.860 
basically as you know you can bend wire
hanger<00:02:35.469> so<00:02:35.709> make<00:02:35.889> sure<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.370> bend<00:02:36.579> it

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
little bit of flex to them and then just

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.330 
little bit of flex to them and then just
just<00:02:55.299> take<00:02:55.540> them<00:02:55.689> with<00:02:55.810> your<00:02:55.930> hands<00:02:56.189> bend<00:02:57.189> them

be facing the exact same way that the
holders<00:03:12.010> are<00:03:12.159> pointing<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.299> this<00:03:13.540> project

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
holders are pointing but if this project

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.420 
holders are pointing but if this project
doesn't<00:03:14.019> work<00:03:14.260> out<00:03:14.409> for<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.799> if<00:03:14.919> you<00:03:15.069> think<00:03:15.280> to

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
yourself this just doesn't look good at

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.189 
yourself this just doesn't look good at
all<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:18.310> might<00:03:18.729> not<00:03:19.000> well<00:03:19.449> I'm<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:20.019> as
