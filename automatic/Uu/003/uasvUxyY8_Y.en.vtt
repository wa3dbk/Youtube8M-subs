of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> key<00:01:16.979> changes<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
of the key changes that we have this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.700 
of the key changes that we have this
time<00:01:18.540> around<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:18.960> actually<00:01:19.140> affected<00:01:19.619> how

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
time around which actually affected how

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.050 
time around which actually affected how
we<00:01:19.770> balance<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.280> game<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> fact<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
we balance the game is the fact that the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
we balance the game is the fact that the
locust<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> lot<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.869> hit<00:01:22.049> reactions<00:01:22.530> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
locust have a lot more hit reactions so

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.499 
locust have a lot more hit reactions so
when<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> player<00:01:23.549> shoots<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.060> few<00:01:24.240> bullets

when the player shoots a few bullets

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.999 
when the player shoots a few bullets
into<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> locust<00:01:25.170> chest<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> locust<00:01:25.860> will

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
into a locust chest the locust will

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.149 
into a locust chest the locust will
actually<00:01:26.369> react

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
actually react

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.309 
actually react
believable<00:01:27.640> fashion<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:28.299> stumble<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.020> when

were that was a tough character to
evolve<00:03:32.000> because<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.720> mechanics<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.770> we

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
evolve because of the mechanics of it we

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.560 
evolve because of the mechanics of it we
came<00:03:34.250> up<00:03:34.280> with<00:03:34.459> this<00:03:34.550> idea<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:35.150> kind<00:03:35.300> of<00:03:35.390> have

basically<00:05:25.280> yeah<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.880> think<00:05:26.270> if<00:05:26.360> you<00:05:26.450> were<00:05:26.540> to

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
basically yeah I think if you were to

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.219 
basically yeah I think if you were to
compare<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:27.310> rom<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.880> scourge<00:05:29.540> and<00:05:29.660> used<00:05:29.930> cars

compare a rom to scourge and used cars
as<00:05:30.500> an<00:05:30.620> example<00:05:30.919> I<00:05:31.130> think<00:05:31.310> Rob<00:05:31.520> would<00:05:31.550> be<00:05:31.790> the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
as an example I think Rob would be the

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.640 
as an example I think Rob would be the
Humvee<00:05:32.270> where<00:05:32.600> scores<00:05:32.960> would<00:05:33.140> be<00:05:33.290> the<00:05:33.410> Duke

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.210 

it's<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.740> steak<00:05:37.070> versus<00:05:37.610> for<00:05:37.970> garage<00:05:38.800> it's<00:05:39.800> flip

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
it's a steak versus for garage it's flip

00:05:40.220 --> 00:06:02.350 
it's a steak versus for garage it's flip
flops<00:05:40.490> versus<00:05:40.970> boots<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:42.140> can<00:05:43.040> get<00:05:43.220> going
