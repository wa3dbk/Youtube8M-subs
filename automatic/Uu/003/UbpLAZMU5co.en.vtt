trying to get this all together in a
week<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.439> don't<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> hold

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
week so we don't really want to hold

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310 
week so we don't really want to hold
them<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> same<00:01:23.930> level<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> we're<00:01:25.170> trying

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
them to the same level that we're trying

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
them to the same level that we're trying
to<00:01:25.409> hold<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> other<00:01:25.860> teams<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:27.210> far<00:01:27.509> as

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to hold the other teams to as far as

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.770 
to hold the other teams to as far as
video<00:01:28.380> production<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.000> bots<00:01:30.270> readiness

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
video production and the bots readiness

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260 
video production and the bots readiness
but<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.979> will<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.400> streaming<00:01:32.820> their<00:01:33.060> build

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
but they will be streaming their build

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
but they will be streaming their build
live<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.840> producing<00:01:34.290> YouTube<00:01:34.619> videos<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.400> so

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
live and producing YouTube videos and so

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
live and producing YouTube videos and so
this<00:01:36.030> whole<00:01:36.210> robot<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.810> breed<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.259> network

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
this whole robot and breed a network

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.149 
this whole robot and breed a network
what<00:01:38.640> we're<00:01:38.790> trying<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:40.560> create<00:01:41.009> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
what we're trying to do is is create a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.380 
what we're trying to do is is create a
network<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.920> prototypers<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.250> builders<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
network of prototypers and builders and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.469 
network of prototypers and builders and
bloggers<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.430> posting<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.299> their

aggregation we're aggregating things in

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.070 
aggregation we're aggregating things in
one<00:02:02.660> place<00:02:03.790> aggregation<00:02:04.790> as<00:02:05.600> part<00:02:05.870> of<00:02:05.960> the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
one place aggregation as part of the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.740 
one place aggregation as part of the
robot<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.440> three<00:02:06.560> days<00:02:06.680> Network<00:02:07.040> we're<00:02:07.220> gonna

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
robot in three days Network we're gonna

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.750 
robot in three days Network we're gonna
every<00:02:08.750> night<00:02:08.900> we're<00:02:09.080> gonna<00:02:09.140> review<00:02:09.590> some<00:02:10.010> of

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
every night we're gonna review some of

your prototypes that you submit to us at

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.290 
your prototypes that you submit to us at
the<00:02:18.350> network<00:02:18.670> yeah<00:02:19.670> maybe<00:02:19.880> if<00:02:20.000> there's<00:02:20.180> some

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
the network yeah maybe if there's some

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.180 
the network yeah maybe if there's some
good<00:02:20.480> stuff<00:02:20.510> yeah<00:02:21.080> well<00:02:21.590> show<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.860> off<00:02:21.980> we'll
