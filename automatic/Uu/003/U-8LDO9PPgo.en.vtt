00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello to the followers of the long leap 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.680
 dotcom today in the gin tonics section 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.019
 let's elaborate a list of botany and 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.630
 For this we will follow the recommendations 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.189
 of containing or marking in the water 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.140
 recommends that for cases 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.850
 We spend a little lemon A 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390
 little cinnamon and then we will give you a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.029
 personal touch with a point we're going 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 as always to the water 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.940
 we have to use an ice with a 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.320
 adequate thickness 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.320
 and the entity 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.050
 you always create a footprint that we have 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.050
 to slide so they do not disturb 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.450
 in this case we are going to remove two types of 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.670
 channel to a female more than the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.700
 we will do at the end of the duration and another 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.700
 in powder for one with a consideration 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.120
 own normally when we miss the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.120
 cinnamon on branch 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 if it's not too late when the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.369
 we put in powder we will notice immediately the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.509
 characteristics that the 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.509
 cinnamon to water 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.600
 in this case we have used tonic 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.080
 schweppes because we consider that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.520
 temptation is the only tonic to burn 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.090
 perfectly with gabriel type 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.090
 defend them 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.520
 what we will do here next comes 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.720
 to take a slice of orange to intern 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 a little bit with quality 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.990
 next step 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:17.590
 and finally extract the oils 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.590
 Essentials of the lemon peel 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.760
 two 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.050
 this is what we consider a 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.050
 Internet present bonany more 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.430
 yes
