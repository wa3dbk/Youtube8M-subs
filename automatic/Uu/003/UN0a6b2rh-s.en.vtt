00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.750 
this is a 10th favorite card from the
set<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.369> reason<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.210> card<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
set the reason I like this card is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
set the reason I like this card is
because<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.420> there's<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:36.809> these<00:00:36.930> apples

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
because for one there's all these apples

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
because for one there's all these apples
in<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.340> fruit<00:00:38.700> too<00:00:38.879> often

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
in there you don't see fruit too often

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.190 
in there you don't see fruit too often
in<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:40.500> pokemon<00:00:41.309> card<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.750> there's<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
in a pokemon card and then there's a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.279 
in a pokemon card and then there's a
slowpoke<00:00:43.910> Totodile<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> Pikachu<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
slowpoke Totodile and Pikachu so the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
slowpoke Totodile and Pikachu so the
reason<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.280> there's<00:00:47.460> three

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
reason that so that there's three

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.220 
reason that so that there's three
Pokemon<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.719> why<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
Pokemon on here that's why I like this

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.670 
Pokemon on here that's why I like this
card<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:50.579> tenth<00:00:50.820> card<00:00:51.120> number<00:00:52.110> nine<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
card as my tenth card number nine is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.150 
card as my tenth card number nine is
Eevee<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.550> has<00:00:56.940> two<00:00:57.120> Pokemon<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
Eevee and this one has two Pokemon on it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.979 
Eevee and this one has two Pokemon on it
but<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.390> about<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.750> card

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
but what I really like about this card

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.830 
but what I really like about this card
is<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.440> reminds<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> Tron<00:01:02.840> something

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
is it reminds me of Tron something

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
is it reminds me of Tron something
similar<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.830> art<00:01:05.250> style<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
similar to that the art style on this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.960 
similar to that the art style on this
card<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.659> why<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.110> number<00:01:07.320> 9<00:01:07.500> card

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
card so that's why it's my number 9 card

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.630 
card so that's why it's my number 9 card
number<00:01:08.970> 8<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.450> ruins<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.650> alph<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> stadium

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
number 8 is ruins of alph it's a stadium
card<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.479> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.320> close

how<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.049> holographic<00:02:59.500> pattern<00:03:00.069> looks<00:03:00.250> on

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
how the holographic pattern looks on

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.110 
how the holographic pattern looks on
here<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.889> smeargle<00:03:02.889> is<00:03:03.099> basically<00:03:03.430> painting

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
here and smeargle is basically painting

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.599 
here and smeargle is basically painting
this<00:03:04.419> and<00:03:04.750> if<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.319> look<00:03:05.500> at<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.769> style<00:03:06.069> the

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
this and if you look at the style the

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.990 
this and if you look at the style the
detail<00:03:07.090> that's<00:03:07.359> in<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:09.280> background<00:03:09.519> here
