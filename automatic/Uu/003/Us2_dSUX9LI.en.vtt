that's<00:01:56.549> quick<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.869> car<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.469> clearly

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that's quick but this car is clearly

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.300 
that's quick but this car is clearly
without<00:01:59.490> bodywork<00:02:00.409> meaning<00:02:01.409> you're<00:02:01.860> sort<00:02:02.189> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
without bodywork meaning you're sort of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
without bodywork meaning you're sort of
limited<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> aerodynamic<00:02:03.990> field<00:02:04.289> which

limited in the aerodynamic field which

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.300 
limited in the aerodynamic field which
usually<00:02:05.579> aids<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.360> top<00:02:06.600> speed<00:02:07.039> that's<00:02:08.039> why

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
usually aids in top speed that's why

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.240 
usually aids in top speed that's why
this<00:02:08.369> car<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.330> more<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:10.019> quickness<00:02:10.440> off<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this car is more about quickness off the

understand when the tires are locking up
into<00:02:26.849> stuff<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.720> clearly<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.620> baby<00:02:29.010> seems

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
into stuff so clearly this baby seems

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.479 
into stuff so clearly this baby seems
fast<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.209> handles<00:02:30.810> well<00:02:31.049> but<00:02:31.769> like<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.250> learn

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
fast and handles well but like you learn

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.880 
fast and handles well but like you learn
in<00:02:32.730> your<00:02:32.849> 8th<00:02:33.120> grade<00:02:33.420> chemistry<00:02:33.810> class<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
in your 8th grade chemistry class the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.580 
in your 8th grade chemistry class the
atom<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.819> basic<00:02:36.360> unit<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.840> matter<00:02:37.230> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
atom is the basic unit of matter and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.670 
atom is the basic unit of matter and
guess<00:02:38.250> what<00:02:38.579> this<00:02:39.209> car<00:02:39.569> was<00:02:39.810> named<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.170> atom

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
guess what this car was named the atom

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.250 
guess what this car was named the atom
for<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> reason<00:02:41.400> now<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> notice<00:02:42.299> is<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.049> the
