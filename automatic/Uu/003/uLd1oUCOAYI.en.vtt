then hook it somewhere
grab<00:03:16.480> some<00:03:16.870> B<00:03:18.390> then<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.599> got<00:03:21.660> your<00:03:22.660> beads<00:03:25.769> add

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
grab some B then you got your beads add

grab some B then you got your beads add
them<00:03:27.099> on

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.270 

when<00:03:43.630> you're<00:03:43.780> doing<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.980> want<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.220> make

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
when you're doing this you want to make

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:54.760 
when you're doing this you want to make
sure<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.790> have<00:03:46.030> enough<00:03:46.450> beads<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.430> use

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.320 

so<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.010> blade<00:03:57.680> has<00:03:58.680> enough<00:03:59.640> room<00:03:59.910> so<00:03:59.970> it

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
so that you blade has enough room so it

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.360 
so that you blade has enough room so it
will<00:04:00.480> not<00:04:00.630> touch<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.230> end<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.710> hook<00:04:01.920> or

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
will not touch the end of the hook or

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:48.439 
will not touch the end of the hook or
the<00:04:02.580> map<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.650> need<00:04:04.830> about<00:04:04.920> seven

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.890 

thread<00:04:49.169> them<00:04:49.469> all<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.309> way<00:04:50.400> down<00:04:50.749> to<00:04:51.749> the

thread them all the way down to the

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.290 
thread them all the way down to the
hooks<00:04:54.139> should<00:04:55.139> look<00:04:55.319> like<00:04:55.349> that<00:04:56.309> so<00:04:56.729> far<00:04:56.999> you

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
hooks should look like that so far you

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.529 
hooks should look like that so far you
can<00:04:57.930> use<00:04:58.080> any<00:04:58.259> kind<00:04:58.469> of<00:04:58.589> any<00:04:58.860> color<00:04:59.219> beads<00:04:59.550> any

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
can use any kind of any color beads any

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:16.950 
can use any kind of any color beads any
color<00:05:00.960> hooks<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:05.180> whatever<00:05:06.180> colors<00:05:06.509> you<00:05:06.689> like

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960

get<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:18.540> clevis

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:34.250 

put<00:05:25.000> it<00:05:25.120> through<00:05:30.840> so<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:31.990> looks<00:05:32.229> like<00:05:32.350> that

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
put it through so it looks like that

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.689 
put it through so it looks like that
find<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.350> end<00:05:35.530> of<00:05:35.979> your<00:05:36.760> line<00:05:38.370> let<00:05:39.370> make<00:05:39.550> sure

find the end of your line let make sure

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.110 
find the end of your line let make sure
you're<00:05:39.820> not<00:05:39.940> putting<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.360> on<00:05:40.479> backwards

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
loaded all the way down to your beats I

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:10.370 
loaded all the way down to your beats I
have<00:06:02.669> this<00:06:03.060> so<00:06:03.330> far<00:06:06.889> and<00:06:08.360> then<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.660> usually<00:06:10.169> have

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
have this so far and then I usually have

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.180 
have this so far and then I usually have
mine<00:06:10.620> my<00:06:11.550> line<00:06:12.210> out<00:06:12.540> to<00:06:13.550> 4<00:06:14.550> feet<00:06:15.590> so<00:06:16.590> hook<00:06:16.830> it<00:06:17.010> at

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
mine my line out to 4 feet so hook it at

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.659 
mine my line out to 4 feet so hook it at
