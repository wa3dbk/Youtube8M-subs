I<00:00:27.720> already<00:00:28.710> made<00:00:29.900> fondant<00:00:30.900> circles<00:00:31.369> for<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
I already made fondant circles for the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.420 
I already made fondant circles for the
petals<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.450> need<00:00:33.600> fondant<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.430> ziplock

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
petals so we just need fondant a ziplock

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.280 
petals so we just need fondant a ziplock
bag<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.880> any<00:00:36.000> plastic<00:00:36.450> bag<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.630> got<00:00:36.899> there<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that's it and you're gonna already make

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.560 
that's it and you're gonna already make
your<00:00:39.390> rose<00:00:40.370> first<00:00:41.370> take<00:00:41.640> one<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.149> small

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
your rose first take one of those small

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.410 
your rose first take one of those small
circles<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.850> roll<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.079> palm

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
circles and roll it out on your palm

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.420 
circles and roll it out on your palm
until<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> reaches<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.050> shape<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.190> put

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
until it reaches this shape and then put

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.540 
until it reaches this shape and then put
it<00:00:53.520> under<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.760> plastic<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.399> flatten<00:00:56.399> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
it under your plastic and flatten that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.420 
it under your plastic and flatten that
out

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.649 

and<00:01:06.430> then<00:01:06.579> this<00:01:06.759> will<00:01:07.090> be<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.710> center<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:09.659> your

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
and then this will be the center of your

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.740 
and then this will be the center of your
rose<00:01:11.579> so<00:01:12.579> if<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.759> can<00:01:12.880> see<00:01:13.180> I'm<00:01:13.329> hoping<00:01:13.659> you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
rose so if you can see I'm hoping you

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.620 
rose so if you can see I'm hoping you
can<00:01:13.930> see<00:01:15.960> roll<00:01:16.960> it<00:01:17.170> from<00:01:17.439> one<00:01:17.740> end<00:01:18.329> from<00:01:19.329> left

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
can see roll it from one end from left

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.460 
can see roll it from one end from left
to<00:01:19.720> right<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:23.590> see<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:26.080> are<00:01:26.110> rolling

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
to right you can see that we are rolling

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.609 
to right you can see that we are rolling
that<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.780> just<00:01:28.990> use<00:01:29.289> maybe

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
that and then you just use maybe

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.850 
that and then you just use maybe
one-fourth<00:01:30.189> or<00:01:30.429> one-third<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:32.500> create<00:01:32.829> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
one-fourth or one-third to create a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.680 
one-fourth or one-third to create a
spiral<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:39.009> I'm<00:01:39.369> hoping<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:39.909> guys<00:01:40.149> can<00:01:40.390> see<00:01:40.569> it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
spiral so I'm hoping you guys can see it

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.289 
spiral so I'm hoping you guys can see it
here<00:01:41.729> okay<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.330> will<00:01:43.420> be<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.750> center<00:01:44.110> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
here okay so that will be the center of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.980 
here okay so that will be the center of
your<00:01:46.299> rose<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:48.000> let<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.119> sit<00:01:49.479> there<00:01:49.659> for<00:01:49.720> a

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
your rose and let it sit there for a

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
your rose and let it sit there for a
while

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
while

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.039 
while
then<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.849> rest<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.479> could<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.780> do<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:52.929> same

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
then the rest you could just do the same

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.199 
then the rest you could just do the same
thing<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:53.709> these<00:01:54.310> are<00:01:54.549> all<00:01:55.000> circles<00:01:57.209> flatten

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
thing so these are all circles flatten

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:09.029 
thing so these are all circles flatten
them<00:01:58.360> out<00:01:58.509> and<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:08.140> depends<00:02:08.560> on<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.799> if<00:02:08.920> you

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
them out and it depends on you if you

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.430 
them out and it depends on you if you
want<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:11.260> know<00:02:11.350> really<00:02:11.829> really<00:02:12.190> flat<00:02:12.519> petals

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
want you know really really flat petals

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.960 
want you know really really flat petals
or<00:02:19.890> if<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.100> would<00:02:21.220> want<00:02:21.489> them<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.850> know<00:02:21.940> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
or if you would want them you know a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.390 
or if you would want them you know a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
little chunky so here goes

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.370 
little chunky so here goes
you<00:02:24.609> just<00:02:25.170> make<00:02:26.170> sure<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:28.200> put<00:02:29.200> these

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
you just make sure that you put these

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.140 
you just make sure that you put these
petals<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:31.090> an<00:02:31.329> alternate<00:02:31.989> fashion<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.639> clip

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
petals in an alternate fashion so clip

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.420 
petals in an alternate fashion so clip
it<00:02:34.269> there<00:02:35.280> tuck<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.430> down<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:42.400> a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
it there tuck it down here and for a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.650 
it there tuck it down here and for a
more<00:02:42.579> realistic<00:02:42.910> effect<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:44.069> push<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.510> edge

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
more realistic effect just push the edge

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.220 
more realistic effect just push the edge
of<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:48.190> petal<00:02:48.370> very<00:02:48.730> softly<00:02:49.829> going<00:02:50.829> out<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
of the petal very softly going out and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:03.040 
of the petal very softly going out and
let<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.560> sit<00:02:53.920> here

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.630 

you're<00:03:04.050> just<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> same<00:03:04.860> for<00:03:05.190> all<00:03:05.430> of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
you're just gonna do the same for all of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.720 
you're just gonna do the same for all of
these<00:03:07.070> circles<00:03:09.410> tow<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.590> speed<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.610> we

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
these circles tow to speed up so that we

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.060 
these circles tow to speed up so that we
won't<00:03:11.820> add<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.360> very<00:03:12.540> long<00:03:12.780> video<00:03:13.770> I'm

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
won't add up with a very long video I'm

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.530 
won't add up with a very long video I'm
gonna<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.850> ahead<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.090> do<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.510> other<00:03:17.540> circles

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
in there alternately at this point I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.850 
in there alternately at this point I
don't<00:03:43.770> really<00:03:44.010> need<00:03:44.400> water<00:03:45.170> because<00:03:46.170> they

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
don't really need water because they

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.310 
don't really need water because they
still<00:03:47.100> stick<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:48.540> gonna<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> little<00:03:49.140> messy

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
still stick it's gonna be a little messy

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:57.730 
still stick it's gonna be a little messy
if<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:51.020> put<00:03:52.020> water<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:54.209> connect<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.350> one

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:11.480 

one<00:03:58.740> petal<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.220> another

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.910 

and<00:04:12.490> I<00:04:12.580> think<00:04:12.640> for<00:04:13.680> gumpaste

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
and I think for gumpaste

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.699 
and I think for gumpaste
users<00:04:15.340> they<00:04:15.610> will<00:04:15.760> have<00:04:15.940> more<00:04:16.810> flexibility

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
users they will have more flexibility

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.690 
users they will have more flexibility
I've<00:04:18.160> seen<00:04:18.549> a<00:04:18.850> couple<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:19.630> videos<00:04:19.959> on<00:04:20.700> gumpaste

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
I've seen a couple of videos on gumpaste

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.900 
I've seen a couple of videos on gumpaste
they<00:04:22.180> truly<00:04:22.720> look<00:04:23.460> more<00:04:24.460> realistic<00:04:24.790> and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
they truly look more realistic and

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.220 
they truly look more realistic and
that's<00:04:27.910> because<00:04:28.270> there's<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.810> different

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
that's because there's a different

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.180 
that's because there's a different
technique<00:04:29.830> obviously<00:04:30.040> for<00:04:30.580> gum<00:04:30.730> paste<00:04:30.940> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
technique obviously for gum paste and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.560 
technique obviously for gum paste and
all<00:04:33.190> different<00:04:33.520> sorts<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.850> materials<00:04:34.390> and

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
all different sorts of materials and

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.830 
all different sorts of materials and
cutters<00:04:34.870> used<00:04:35.230> so<00:04:36.040> but<00:04:36.700> this<00:04:36.790> one<00:04:37.030> what<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.600> like

nice<00:06:22.729> is<00:06:23.379> like<00:06:24.379> getting<00:06:24.649> pink<00:06:25.419> pink<00:06:26.419> fondant

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
nice is like getting pink pink fondant

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.739 
nice is like getting pink pink fondant
and<00:06:27.080> then<00:06:27.139> getting<00:06:27.529> a<00:06:27.649> piece<00:06:27.889> of<00:06:27.919> that<00:06:28.189> and

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:28.749 
and then getting a piece of that and

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:31.570 
and then getting a piece of that and
adding<00:06:29.749> white<00:06:29.990> fondant<00:06:30.319> so<00:06:31.009> as<00:06:31.189> you<00:06:31.339> move

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
adding white fondant so as you move

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.719 
adding white fondant so as you move
further<00:06:32.649> the<00:06:33.649> petals<00:06:34.009> will<00:06:34.189> become<00:06:34.459> lighter

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
further the petals will become lighter

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.260 
further the petals will become lighter
