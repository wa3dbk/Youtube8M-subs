00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.989
 salma hayek was moved to the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.550
 tears during the press conference that 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.260
 offered at the lincoln center of the 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.810
 city of new york when he talked about 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.790
 his latest film the prophet and the 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.620
 surprise that was brought when the bank 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.600
 who lent him the money to finance it 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.650
 he forgave him the millionaire debt 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.960
 after this experience the bank the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.200
 representatives of the bank came to me to 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.700
 tell me 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.700
 they almost make me cry 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:36.770
 and you know that you never hear me say 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.370
 this in my life in my whole life we do not 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.890
 interested in money 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.620
 if you do not return us the money does not matter 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.620
 is this little gem that was stolen from 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.829
 Our country is much more than money 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.860
 more than anything more than what is 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.870
 can you imagine this as scare me 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.970
 In addition, Salma was extremely 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.220
 proud because her daughter valentina 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.050
 participated in the dubbing of French 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.479
 this same movie although it came to 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.670
 think that it was not yet time to 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.550
 release me her little daughter 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.370
 they asked if valentina could be the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.390
 paper of the girl 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.850
 I said no because I did not let her act 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.870
 because I do not want it to be so soon but 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 they told me why do not you ask how 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.580
 I'm going to ask you to let us know 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.300
 that we want to be part of the film that 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.180
 it could even be a compliment to her 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.100
 it was very confusing for me the subject was very 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.840
 uncomfortable 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.840
 and they made me feel guilty 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.460
 is that they are people who know me very 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.430
 well and wish it's not fair that she 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 I did not know I told him front and even 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 my husband 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.300
 who knew he was going to say no bolt 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.060
 and he said why is not she not really 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.270
 an actress and I'm not in favor of the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.299
 children actors 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.770
 I wanted to skip this question so what 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.590
 we did 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.590
 and will read a small text 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.530
 and started reading in French without problems 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.850
 she started and the director said that 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.620
 continue that continued with the other line 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.620
 he made the whole movie in an hour
