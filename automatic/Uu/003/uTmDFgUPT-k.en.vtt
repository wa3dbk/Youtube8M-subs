00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.049
 here is the fitbit flex and a bracelet 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.940
 health so very simple bracelet since 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.309
 in fact as we will see is a small 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 module so that's the module that has it 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.590
 betrayed in quotation marks this is the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.910
 bracelet so if you then that is it 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.619
 is supplied with two different sizes 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.910
 to buy so like that you can in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.930
 to have one for you someone point 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.920
 else if you do not have the same 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.810
 size of points and it's really very 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.760
 practice and that the bracelets can be bought 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 in addition to different colors and more 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.240
 to accessorize so what is needed 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 to know is that suddenly this little 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.189
 bracelet we will wear it on the wrist and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 that as the day and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.149
 the night it will record different 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.320
 information via the vibrations of the shot 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.430
 whenever I go to walk he is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.570
 aware and it will allow 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.680
 to record data like the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 number of steps taken the number of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 calories burned distance speed 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 and have a follow-up via the application of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 website to find out where I am 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.170
 of my activity in the day so this 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 who is nice is the little screen like 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.870
 you want to see there are small 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.480
 diodes these little diodes actually makes me 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.180
 let me know that I'm here at 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 4 out of 5 of my goal which is ten 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.229
 thousand by so I'm pretty much 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.159
 between 6000 and 8000 steps from my goal 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.510
 so that allows throughout the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.439
 day to know where I am and know 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.790
 if I need to make an effort 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.260
 additional to reach my 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.189
 goals 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.680
 the second mode by tapping is the one 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.939
 that's the night mode so there's actually 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.259
 imagine that I went to bed I 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.549
 put him in night mode he will start to 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.900
 analyze my night and what I have a lot 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.180
 moved that I slept well that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 say how long and in the morning I just 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.110
 to reactivate so that they resume his 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.070
 normal operation of pedometers so 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.850
 it's really convenient that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.180
 works very well 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.470
 behind we have a small application on 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.210
 the smartphone or on the phone that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 allows us to have all the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.009
 interesting information know if 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.479
 I achieved my goals and the other 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.009
 advantage is that we do not need 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.710
 necessarily a smartphone or a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.990
 tablet since we have this little dongle 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.100
 which is provided with the fitbit flex which 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.500
 can connect to any 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.850
 computer and that will allow blow 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 over the plex to communicate 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.530
 directly with the computer sense that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.640
 I need one of a smartphone so the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.229
 blow is really an arm is very 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.420
 interesting with a value for money 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.409
 very handy if you want to lose 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 weight or if you just want to 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.670
 monitor your activity check that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.720
 check that you have an activity 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.520
 sufficient 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.470
 it's really the perfect accessory 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.290
 if in addition we accumulate with a balance 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.430
 or with other connected objects of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.100
 sheffield bits that really helps 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.270
 to have a complete vision of your health 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.820
 and its daily activity 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.170
 so it's really a product we 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.170
 advise you the fitbit flex
