an emergency situation is to bring that

an emergency situation is to bring that

to front of mind to bring that to the
things<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.439> think<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
things that you can think of in a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.820 
things that you can think of in a
stressful<00:01:05.369> situation<00:01:06.080> with<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> simulator<00:01:07.650> we

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
stressful situation with a simulator we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
stressful situation with a simulator we
can<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> anything<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.479> can

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can do anything we want so we can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
can do anything we want so we can
actually<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> pilot<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.340> no-win

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actually put the pilot in a no-win

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.390 
actually put the pilot in a no-win
scenario<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.140> only<00:01:13.560> option<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> polar

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
scenario the only option is a polar

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.240 
scenario the only option is a polar
parachute<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.540> what's<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.799> very

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
parachute and what's actually very

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.330 
parachute and what's actually very
interesting<00:01:17.400> when<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.060> started<00:01:18.540> doing<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
interesting when we started doing that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.450 
interesting when we started doing that
we<00:01:20.340> had<00:01:20.700> pilots<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.470> simulator<00:01:23.009> fight<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
we had pilots in the simulator fight the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
we had pilots in the simulator fight the
airplane<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> ground<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
airplane all the way to the ground to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
airplane all the way to the ground to
maintain<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.100> pneus<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> stressful

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
maintain that we're pneus in a stressful

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.969 
maintain that we're pneus in a stressful
situation<00:01:27.030> takes<00:01:27.900> training<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.950> takes

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
situation takes training it takes

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
situation takes training it takes
developing<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.090> habit<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> takes<00:01:30.810> talking

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
developing that habit it takes talking

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.719 
developing that habit it takes talking
to<00:01:31.350> people<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> gonna<00:01:32.490> do

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to people about how are you gonna do

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
to people about how are you gonna do
this<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.150> takes<00:01:33.360> practice<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.200> simulator<00:01:34.710> or

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
this it takes practice in a simulator or

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.490 
this it takes practice in a simulator or
in<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> real<00:01:35.579> airplane<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.509> takes<00:01:36.840> reaching<00:01:37.350> for

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
in a real airplane it takes reaching for

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
in a real airplane it takes reaching for
the<00:01:37.590> handle<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> take<00:01:38.850> off<00:01:39.030> every<00:01:39.450> time

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the handle when you take off every time

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.380 
the handle when you take off every time
those<00:01:40.350> kinds<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> efforts<00:01:41.100> start<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.210> build

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
those kinds of efforts start to build

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.499 
those kinds of efforts start to build
the<00:01:42.630> habits<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> encourage<00:01:44.159> people<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> rely

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the habits and encourage people to rely

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.530 
the habits and encourage people to rely
on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.899> parachute<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.770> save<00:01:46.979> their<00:01:47.159> lives<00:01:47.540> if

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
on the parachute to save their lives if

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200 
on the parachute to save their lives if
you<00:01:48.840> haven't<00:01:49.259> already<00:01:50.090> pictured<00:01:51.090> yourself

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
you haven't already pictured yourself

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.300 
you haven't already pictured yourself
doing<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.350> gonna<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.740> hard<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> make

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
doing this it's gonna be hard to make

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609
