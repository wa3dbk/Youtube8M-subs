00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
standing up a little bit like a book

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.650 
standing up a little bit like a book
okay<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.550> let's<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> inside<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
okay so let's just go at the inside and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.330 
okay so let's just go at the inside and
I'll<00:00:54.750> show<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> how<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:56.219> I've

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
I'll show you how to do this now I've

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
I'll show you how to do this now I've
got<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.520> alongside<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:57.270> other<00:00:57.420> blue<00:00:57.629> rays

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
got it alongside two other blue rays

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840 
got it alongside two other blue rays
from<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.440> blu-ray<00:00:58.649> shelf<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.160> I've<00:00:59.280> got<00:00:59.489> an<00:00:59.579> N

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
from my blu-ray shelf so I've got an N

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.490 
from my blu-ray shelf so I've got an N
and<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> piece<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.750> goes<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> between<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and a piece and this goes in between you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
and a piece and this goes in between you
don't<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.859> many<00:01:02.129> films<00:01:02.520> starting<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.879> oh<00:01:03.030> oh

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
don't get many films starting with oh oh

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
don't get many films starting with oh oh
so<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.780> them<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.519> gonna<00:01:05.760> fit

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so you have them and this is gonna fit

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.429 
so you have them and this is gonna fit
between<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.630> let's<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> size

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
between them so let's just do the size

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.340 
between them so let's just do the size
to<00:01:07.680> start<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.510> it's<00:01:09.510> exactly<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> same

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to start with it's exactly the same

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.700 
to start with it's exactly the same
height<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> normal<00:01:11.880> very<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:13.080> slightly

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
height as a normal very very slightly

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
height as a normal very very slightly
thicker<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.670> I've<00:01:14.760> got<00:01:15.030> these<00:01:15.240> blue<00:01:15.509> aids<00:01:15.689> in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
thicker so I've got these blue aids in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.469 
thicker so I've got these blue aids in
cardboard<00:01:16.560> sleeves<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
cardboard sleeves that I know from this

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.100 
cardboard sleeves that I know from this
you<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.380> where<00:01:20.250> I'd<00:01:20.369> say<00:01:20.640> you've<00:01:21.150> got<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you see and where I'd say you've got a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.929 
you see and where I'd say you've got a
very<00:01:22.470> similar<00:01:22.770> thickness<00:01:23.009> certainly<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> can't

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
very similar thickness certainly I can't

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.730 
very similar thickness certainly I can't
fit<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.450> inside<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> cardboard<00:01:25.350> sleeve

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
fit that inside on the cardboard sleeve

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
fit that inside on the cardboard sleeve
so<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.610> mil<00:01:26.880> thicker

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so this is one or two mil thicker

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
so this is one or two mil thicker
nothing<00:01:28.229> much<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.040> few<00:01:29.280> middle

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
nothing much in it but it's a few middle

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.240 
nothing much in it but it's a few middle
thickest<00:01:30.000> isn't<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.299> big<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> slightly

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
thickest isn't it big of a slightly

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
thickest isn't it big of a slightly
increased<00:01:32.250> size<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.240> shelf<00:01:33.570> let's<00:01:34.530> open

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
increased size in your shelf let's open

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.499 
increased size in your shelf let's open
this<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.189> course<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.299> disc

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
this up of course you get the the disc

happens<00:02:18.340> yeah<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.210> white<00:02:19.390> frame<00:02:19.660> does

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
happens yeah the white frame does

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.960 
happens yeah the white frame does
completely<00:02:20.350> come<00:02:20.530> off<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> inside<00:02:21.460> case

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
completely come off so the inside case

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.970 
completely come off so the inside case
is<00:02:22.660> actually<00:02:22.780> completely<00:02:23.320> see-through<00:02:23.530> in

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
is actually completely see-through in

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.890 
is actually completely see-through in
front<00:02:24.250> exactly<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> same<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.450> I'm<00:02:25.570> now<00:02:25.750> able

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
front exactly the same but I'm now able

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.750 
front exactly the same but I'm now able
to<00:02:26.110> release<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.550> like<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
to release this and it really is like a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.820 
to release this and it really is like a
plastic<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:28.990> either<00:02:29.140> very<00:02:29.350> specially

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
plastic so it's either very specially

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.580 
plastic so it's either very specially
laminated<00:02:30.400> card<00:02:30.910> or<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.270> do<00:02:31.870> suspect<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.470> that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
laminated card or I do suspect is that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.800 
laminated card or I do suspect is that
giratina's<00:02:33.100> plastic<00:02:33.520> there's<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.330> texture<00:02:34.780> to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
giratina's plastic there's a texture to

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.120 
giratina's plastic there's a texture to
it<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.170> will<00:02:35.320> hear<00:02:35.500> with<00:02:35.680> me<00:02:35.860> running<00:02:36.040> my

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it you will hear with me running my

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.000 
it you will hear with me running my
nails<00:02:36.400> over<00:02:36.580> there<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.290> often<00:02:38.620> not<00:02:38.890> on

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
nails over there so it's often not on

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.830 
nails over there so it's often not on
the<00:02:39.070> inside<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.580> stays<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.300> outside<00:02:40.330> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
the inside it stays on the outside so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.440 
the inside it stays on the outside so
you<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:41.080> turn<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> over<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.150> like

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
you just turn it over and you just like

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.210 
you just turn it over and you just like
make<00:02:43.660> sure<00:02:43.780> lined<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.110> up<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:45.100> you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
make sure lined it up and then you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.100 
make sure lined it up and then you
crunch<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.640> outer<00:02:46.330> white<00:02:46.660> your<00:02:46.780> frame<00:02:46.930> back

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
crunch the outer white your frame back

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.960 
crunch the outer white your frame back
on<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:48.070> there<00:02:48.280> we<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:49.980> picture<00:02:50.980> frame<00:02:51.220> now

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
on so there we have a picture frame now

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.790 
on so there we have a picture frame now
the<00:02:52.030> nice<00:02:52.240> things<00:02:52.540> about<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:52.900> some<00:02:53.530> people

is you can actually crazy self a very
nice<00:03:06.490> looking<00:03:07.030> case<00:03:07.480> regardless<00:03:08.170> with<00:03:08.320> users

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
nice looking case regardless with users

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.340 
nice looking case regardless with users
as<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.800> frame<00:03:09.130> or<00:03:09.340> not<00:03:09.930> obviously<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.200> going

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
as a frame or not obviously it's going

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.650 
as a frame or not obviously it's going
to<00:03:11.440> look<00:03:11.530> better<00:03:11.770> with<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> horizontal<00:03:13.060> aspect

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
to look better with a horizontal aspect

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.880 
to look better with a horizontal aspect
picture<00:03:13.990> because<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.380> frame<00:03:14.590> itself

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
picture because the frame itself

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.460 
picture because the frame itself
standing<00:03:15.340> up<00:03:15.430> like<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> shelf<00:03:17.110> on<00:03:17.410> a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.380 
standing up like this on a shelf on a
side<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.920> going<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.100> look<00:03:18.250> much<00:03:18.370> more<00:03:18.610> better

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
side is going to look much more better

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.350 
side is going to look much more better
than<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.810> would<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:19.989> think<00:03:20.290> as<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:21.310> book<00:03:21.820> style

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
than it would have think as a book style

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.390 
than it would have think as a book style
frame<00:03:22.690> like<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:23.200> would<00:03:23.350> have<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:24.280> this

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
frame like it would have to with this

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.040 
frame like it would have to with this
picture<00:03:24.880> but<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.420> think<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> white

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
picture but I think that the white

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.830 
picture but I think that the white
frames<00:03:26.620> surround<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.730> being<00:03:28.090> for<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.420> plebian

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
frames surround it being for a plebian

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.330 
frames surround it being for a plebian
it<00:03:28.959> makes<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.230> lot<00:03:29.380> of<00:03:29.410> sense<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.830> think<00:03:29.860> frame

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
it makes a lot of sense I think frame

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.210 
it makes a lot of sense I think frame
media<00:03:30.820> frame<00:03:31.120> for<00:03:31.480> me<00:03:31.630> media<00:03:32.110> releasing<00:03:33.100> this

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
media frame for me media releasing this

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.190 
media frame for me media releasing this
as<00:03:33.400> part<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.820> Bolivian<00:03:34.209> packaging<00:03:34.660> makes

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
as part of the Bolivian packaging makes

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.120 
as part of the Bolivian packaging makes
a<00:03:35.290> lot<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.440> sense<00:03:35.620> because<00:03:35.800> it's<00:03:35.950> very

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
a lot of sense because it's very

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.220 
a lot of sense because it's very
stylized<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.910> goes<00:03:37.060> along<00:03:37.209> with<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.959> kind<00:03:38.170> of

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
stylized and goes along with the kind of

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.800 
stylized and goes along with the kind of
futuristic<00:03:38.920> view<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.610> oblivion<00:03:40.000> has<00:03:40.180> an<00:03:40.660> an

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
futuristic view that oblivion has an an

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.229 
futuristic view that oblivion has an an
overall<00:03:41.200> look<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.519> think<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.910> anything's

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
overall look so I think that anything's

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.810 
overall look so I think that anything's
my<00:03:43.390> only<00:03:43.630> negatives<00:03:44.050> are<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:45.459> get<00:03:45.700> the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
my only negatives are that you get the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.759 
my only negatives are that you get the
blu-ray<00:03:46.300> disc<00:03:46.330> logo<00:03:47.050> on<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.290> side<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.709> you

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
blu-ray disc logo on this side so you

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.800 
blu-ray disc logo on this side so you
even<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.280> did<00:03:48.519> switch<00:03:48.790> over<00:03:49.090> both<00:03:49.300> pictures

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
even you did switch over both pictures

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.020 
even you did switch over both pictures
you<00:03:50.320> couldn't<00:03:50.650> simply<00:03:50.860> have<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:51.550> on<00:03:51.730> show

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
you couldn't simply have this on show

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.240 
you couldn't simply have this on show
unless<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.930> had<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.170> on<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.730> an<00:03:54.730> aspect

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
unless you had it on a an aspect

on the same orientation as the icon I'd
opt<00:04:01.180> would<00:04:01.480> adapt<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.350> will<00:04:02.440> show<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.800> off<00:04:02.920> so

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
opt would adapt it will show that off so

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.759 
opt would adapt it will show that off so
I'd<00:04:03.280> only<00:04:03.430> be<00:04:03.610> looking<00:04:03.700> at<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.030> one<00:04:04.150> side<00:04:04.390> and

I'd only be looking at the one side and

I'd only be looking at the one side and

into a point we can stand it on its base
the<00:04:12.580> hinge<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:13.090> visible<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.660> although<00:04:14.110> this

the hinge is visible and although this

the hinge is visible and although this

you<00:04:23.979> now<00:04:24.130> can't<00:04:24.400> see<00:04:24.669> where<00:04:25.419> oblivion<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:25.930> so

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
you now can't see where oblivion is so

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.860 
you now can't see where oblivion is so
almost<00:04:26.629> becomes<00:04:27.610> now<00:04:28.610> you<00:04:28.669> see<00:04:28.970> me<00:04:29.180> they

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
almost becomes now you see me they

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.899 
almost becomes now you see me they
become<00:04:30.199> oblivious<00:04:30.349> so<00:04:30.800> I'll<00:04:31.280> see<00:04:31.520> if<00:04:31.550> it's<00:04:31.789> the

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
become oblivious so I'll see if it's the

blu-ray that they ever do this for fair
enough<00:04:36.349> you're<00:04:36.590> gonna<00:04:36.680> know<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:36.979> oblivion

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
enough you're gonna know this oblivion

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.969 
enough you're gonna know this oblivion
and<00:04:37.669> like<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.389> say<00:04:38.629> iconically<00:04:39.500> goes<00:04:39.770> with

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
and like I say iconically goes with

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.100 
and like I say iconically goes with
white<00:04:40.250> styling<00:04:40.759> of<00:04:40.879> the<00:04:40.969> film<00:04:41.210> otherwise

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
final visible very very fine writing in

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.589 
final visible very very fine writing in
here<00:05:00.289> or<00:05:00.500> something<00:05:00.860> in<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.789> angle<00:05:02.270> that<00:05:02.449> you

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
here or something in the angle that you

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.469 
here or something in the angle that you
can<00:05:02.719> almost<00:05:02.810> flip<00:05:03.139> over<00:05:03.500> flip<00:05:03.800> around<00:05:04.159> or<00:05:04.490> flip

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
can almost flip over flip around or flip

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.270 
can almost flip over flip around or flip
internal<00:05:06.020> so<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.229> have<00:05:06.379> a<00:05:06.409> short<00:05:06.680> shelf<00:05:06.919> mode

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
internal so you have a short shelf mode

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.180 
internal so you have a short shelf mode
and<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:08.240> frame<00:05:08.690> mode<00:05:08.960> that<00:05:09.710> would<00:05:09.800> be<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:09.949> bit

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
and a frame mode that would be a bit

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.290 
and a frame mode that would be a bit
more<00:05:10.310> clever<00:05:10.580> than<00:05:10.639> what<00:05:10.789> they've<00:05:10.909> done<00:05:11.030> here

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
more clever than what they've done here

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.330 
more clever than what they've done here
so<00:05:11.719> all<00:05:12.020> in<00:05:12.199> all<00:05:12.289> nice<00:05:12.740> idea

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
so all in all nice idea

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.240 
so all in all nice idea
it<00:05:14.060> certainly<00:05:14.509> gets<00:05:15.050> rid<00:05:15.289> of<00:05:15.349> the<00:05:15.530> ugly<00:05:15.770> side

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
it certainly gets rid of the ugly side

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.619 
it certainly gets rid of the ugly side
of<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.460> packaging<00:05:16.819> that<00:05:16.849> effort<00:05:17.300> has<00:05:17.449> to<00:05:17.539> put

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
of the packaging that effort has to put

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.839 
of the packaging that effort has to put
up<00:05:17.719> with<00:05:17.779> all<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.020> little<00:05:18.229> blu-rays<00:05:18.819> what<00:05:19.819> I

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
up with all the little blu-rays what I

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.930 
up with all the little blu-rays what I
say<00:05:20.120> this<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.449> gonna<00:05:20.569> replace<00:05:20.930> tin<00:05:21.830> boxes<00:05:22.460> no<00:05:22.909> I

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
say this is gonna replace tin boxes no I

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.469 
say this is gonna replace tin boxes no I
think<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.599> metal<00:05:23.900> boxes<00:05:24.379> are<00:05:24.860> still<00:05:25.669> the<00:05:26.180> best

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
think the metal boxes are still the best

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.510 
think the metal boxes are still the best
kind<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.199> design<00:05:27.529> that<00:05:27.560> they've<00:05:27.919> got<00:05:28.189> for<00:05:28.430> this

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
kind of design that they've got for this

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.209 
kind of design that they've got for this
kind<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.150> packaging<00:05:29.599> and<00:05:29.719> all<00:05:30.409> this<00:05:30.590> crunching

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
kind of packaging and all this crunching

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:33.550 
kind of packaging and all this crunching
around<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.639> the<00:05:31.699> case<00:05:31.909> it<00:05:32.690> really<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.110> quite<00:05:33.440> a

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
around of the case it really is quite a

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.589 
around of the case it really is quite a
gruesome<00:05:33.919> thing<00:05:34.129> and<00:05:34.639> you're<00:05:35.240> gonna<00:05:35.330> always

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
gruesome thing and you're gonna always

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.719 
gruesome thing and you're gonna always

I've<00:05:39.560> just<00:05:39.770> peeled<00:05:40.009> off<00:05:40.129> that<00:05:40.190> case<00:05:40.610> there

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
I've just peeled off that case there

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.540 
I've just peeled off that case there
every<00:05:41.779> time<00:05:41.960> I'm<00:05:42.080> pushing<00:05:42.440> on<00:05:42.529> this<00:05:42.680> case<00:05:42.979> I'm

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
every time I'm pushing on this case I'm

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.740 
every time I'm pushing on this case I'm
actually<00:05:43.759> really<00:05:44.000> putting<00:05:44.360> quite<00:05:44.509> a<00:05:44.569> bit

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
actually really putting quite a bit

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.649 
actually really putting quite a bit
fatigue<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.529> this<00:05:46.129> picture<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.789> there's

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
fatigue to this picture and there's

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.230 
fatigue to this picture and there's
gonna<00:05:47.750> come<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:48.080> point<00:05:48.319> when<00:05:48.589> I<00:05:49.240> accidentally

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
gonna come a point when I accidentally

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.149 
gonna come a point when I accidentally
make<00:05:50.659> an<00:05:50.810> indent<00:05:51.169> because<00:05:51.560> of<00:05:51.680> course<00:05:51.889> on<00:05:52.069> the

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
make an indent because of course on the

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.740 
make an indent because of course on the
front<00:05:52.370> you've<00:05:52.580> got<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:52.819> hooks<00:05:53.000> so<00:05:53.659> you've

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
front you've got the hooks so you've

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.059 
front you've got the hooks so you've
actually<00:05:53.870> got<00:05:54.139> two<00:05:54.289> little<00:05:54.560> holes<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.919> you

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
actually got two little holes and you

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:56.829 
actually got two little holes and you
put<00:05:55.279> your<00:05:55.400> fingers<00:05:55.699> on<00:05:55.789> all<00:05:55.879> the<00:05:56.000> pressure<00:05:56.270> in

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:56.839 
put your fingers on all the pressure in

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.450 
put your fingers on all the pressure in
the<00:05:57.020> wrong<00:05:57.169> place<00:05:57.409> potentially<00:05:58.190> you're<00:05:58.339> gonna

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
the wrong place potentially you're gonna

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.029 
the wrong place potentially you're gonna
you<00:05:59.029> know<00:05:59.180> crater<00:05:59.599> fold<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.289> a<00:06:00.349> damage<00:06:00.740> to

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
you know crater fold and a damage to

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.749 
you know crater fold and a damage to
your<00:06:01.219> plastic<00:06:02.180> picture<00:06:03.139> and<00:06:03.349> that<00:06:04.250> song<00:06:04.460> isn't

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
your plastic picture and that song isn't

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.610 
your plastic picture and that song isn't
your<00:06:04.879> idea<00:06:05.120> so<00:06:05.719> let's<00:06:05.900> just<00:06:06.050> do<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:06.199> final<00:06:06.440> one

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
your idea so let's just do the final one

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.769 
your idea so let's just do the final one
so<00:06:06.650> we<00:06:06.949> didn't<00:06:07.190> do<00:06:07.339> a<00:06:07.580> horizontal<00:06:08.389> orientation

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
so we didn't do a horizontal orientation

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.320 
so we didn't do a horizontal orientation
suppose<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.949> box<00:06:10.129> again<00:06:10.400> makes<00:06:10.610> a<00:06:10.729> lot<00:06:10.879> easier

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
suppose the box again makes a lot easier

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.260 
suppose the box again makes a lot easier
make<00:06:11.479> sure<00:06:11.599> the<00:06:11.659> picture<00:06:11.960> goes<00:06:12.139> in<00:06:12.319> this

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
make sure the picture goes in this

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.409 
make sure the picture goes in this
indents<00:06:14.270> correctly<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:16.669> you<00:06:16.909> just<00:06:17.089> crunch

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
indents correctly and you just crunch

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.269 
indents correctly and you just crunch
that<00:06:17.629> white<00:06:18.110> frame<00:06:18.349> back<00:06:18.560> on<00:06:18.740> again<00:06:18.860> so<00:06:18.979> there

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
that white frame back on again so there

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.689 
that white frame back on again so there
we<00:06:19.370> go

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
we go

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.399 
we go
done<00:06:20.060> both<00:06:20.210> sighs<00:06:20.449> there's<00:06:20.750> a<00:06:20.810> horizontal<00:06:21.020> one

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
done both sighs there's a horizontal one

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.680 
done both sighs there's a horizontal one
there's<00:06:21.979> a<00:06:22.099> vertical<00:06:22.250> one<00:06:22.639> there's<00:06:23.360> a<00:06:23.479> bleed

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
there's a vertical one there's a bleed

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.809 
there's a vertical one there's a bleed
you<00:06:23.839> throw<00:06:24.800> that<00:06:24.949> away<00:06:25.069> and<00:06:25.550> you've<00:06:25.699> got

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:25.819 
you throw that away and you've got

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.890 
you throw that away and you've got
yourself<00:06:26.120> a<00:06:26.680> new<00:06:27.680> style<00:06:28.129> the<00:06:28.580> red<00:06:28.729> box<00:06:28.940> let<00:06:29.779> me
