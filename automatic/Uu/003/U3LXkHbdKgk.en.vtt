thought how that looks um but yeah this
is<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.600> semi-permanent<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:09.840> i<00:01:09.960> believe

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
is I'm semi-permanent which i believe

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.250 
is I'm semi-permanent which i believe
last<00:01:10.530> around<00:01:10.979> six<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> eight<00:01:11.400> weeks<00:01:11.900> but<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
last around six to eight weeks but I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.020 
last around six to eight weeks but I
wash<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.650> hair<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.100> times<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.460> day<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
wash my hair or two times a day so it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.260 
wash my hair or two times a day so it
probably<00:01:15.210> lost<00:01:15.420> me<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.720> two<00:01:15.979> um<00:01:17.090> but<00:01:18.090> yeah
