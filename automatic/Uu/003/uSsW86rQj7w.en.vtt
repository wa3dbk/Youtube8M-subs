00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello together hand welcome back 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.349
 on my channel today i want to 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 you like to imagine the balisto löhle 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.580
 Pistol is a universal oil that like it 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.600
 the name here on the pack already 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.189
 says for 1000 purposes is to use 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.600
 I'm honest to the first one 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.410
 sometimes stumbled over it as me 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 I started getting more and more knife 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.910
 to buy 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.210
 This oil is a wonderful solution 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.649
 to smear knife and knife 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.840
 So in the form of oil to lubricate and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.120
 the food-safe means when I'm here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.110
 my little victorinox pocket knife 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 Take this for example 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.140
 beautiful nature of victorinox and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.539
 the knife with this because it's great here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.850
 smear and with afterwards the apple 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.440
 Schneider then I have not had anxiety 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 Do not worry about that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.629
 I do any synthetic things 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.210
 here take me but've got a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.240
 Oil made in Germany 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.570
 and secondly from one 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.250
 medical a so-called white 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.150
 will be produced 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.530
 So you have to talk here 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.009
 no thoughts at all 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.780
 do 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.549
 the smell is now open and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 smell it rises here also such a 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.220
 bit in the nose 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.290
 the tastes certainly go there 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.090
 apart i am i like the smell 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.700
 from this ballast without even at all 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.390
 but not that is certainly as often 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.970
 in life 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 matter of taste yes that's one 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.729
 food genuine universal oil that for 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.000
 1000 different things are used 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.220
 can sometimes be such a leaflet from 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.110
 the because it will make great and there times 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.659
 daily 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.439
 As you can see that is almost 100 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.680
 years, this balles thole exists here 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.780
 This was the first time in 1905 in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.969
 Germany was originally produced 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.090
 the oil alkaline weapon that is 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.300
 basically a lye so that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.050
 against the opposite of an acid 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.790
 and most importantly, this oil will ooze it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.100
 That's why it's wonderful, too 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.660
 You can smear a knife quite a lot 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.870
 Things to do with it when we get here 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.720
 back of this or here on the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.110
 Back of the small ball is high 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.510

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.730
 different logos on the back 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.260
 You can do it all here, for example 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 household sector or in the motor vehicle sector 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.050

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.840

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.090
 Reason that you all the rubbers

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.210

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.360
 Things of this kind also the care of 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.739
 wood precious metals and all such 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.810

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.420
 passionate cyclist himself there 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.010

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.700

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.959
 heard about this case is thole 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.310
 obviously very good to need yes 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.200
 I have only experience so far 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.380
 collected by sounding with it 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 have written off and learned 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.860
 so he made resistant stainless 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.630
 or here but the knife 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.390
 so it's an easier on and on 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.020
 to go yes I use this 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.940
 balisto yes I take the link to you 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.230
 manufacturer an infobox with purely about 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.100
 The oil is actually pretty much 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.590
 everywhere it was with her knife load 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.260
 also online is amazon you get 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.900
 Everything is great here in one 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.599
 Spray form because it is great universal 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.849
 a school form there is gas in here 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.159
 At the back you do not have a small tube 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.970
 like the 40 and could then 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.220
 over it extensive banesto spray 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.470
 then there is once in the form of 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.569
 his pre-soaked cloth come after 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.750
 take it wonderful and on the other 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.729
 then here in a normal way 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.919
 glass surfaces in the case 150 milliliters 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.229
 it is even in the packaging here 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.770
 you can push it all a bit 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:31.070
 so that you have that bottle here very much 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.440
 can be kept well in the packaging 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.050
 So if you need a universal oil 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.780
 to just about everything about what can only be in 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.550
 Cannes already have their door seals 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.770
 Rubber seal in the car your messe etc pp 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.330
 then this is certainly a lot 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.580
