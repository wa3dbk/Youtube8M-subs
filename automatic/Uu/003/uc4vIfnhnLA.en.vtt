00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
iPhone for a pretty reasonable size
considering<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.540> core<00:01:37.170> i3

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
considering that this is a core i3

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
considering that this is a core i3
machine<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.579> our<00:01:39.150> excuse<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
machine so it's our excuse me this is a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.130 
machine so it's our excuse me this is a
core<00:01:40.320> i7<00:01:40.530> machine<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.180> form<00:01:42.450> factor<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
core i7 machine and the form factor is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.859 
core i7 machine and the form factor is
just<00:01:43.829> outstanding<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.520> pillar<00:01:44.790> let's<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.750> see

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
just outstanding a pillar let's just see

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.149 
just outstanding a pillar let's just see
if<00:01:45.960> there's<00:01:46.140> anything<00:01:46.320> else<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
if there's anything else in here of it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
if there's anything else in here of it
so<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.790> probably<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> retail

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
so this is probably what the retail

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
so this is probably what the retail
packaging<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.200> look<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.130> will

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
packaging will look like but it will

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.130 
packaging will look like but it will
actually<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.759> stuff<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:51.869> let's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
actually have stuff in it so now let's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
actually have stuff in it so now let's
check<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.890> machine<00:01:53.189> itself<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.820> has

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

an aluminum sort of diamond pattern

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.280 
an aluminum sort of diamond pattern
scratch<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.660> going<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:07.050> kind<00:02:07.230> of

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
scratch in it so it's going at kind of

scratch in it so it's going at kind of
diagonals<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.759> two<00:02:09.000> things<00:02:09.030> about

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
diagonals here I like two things about

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.290 
diagonals here I like two things about
this<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.899> looks<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.530> nice<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.910> like

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
this it looks really nice and I like

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.180 
this it looks really nice and I like
that<00:02:12.630> if<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.080> accidentally<00:02:13.560> scratch<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.040> it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
that if you accidentally scratch it it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.710 
that if you accidentally scratch it it
will<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.460> more<00:02:14.700> hidden<00:02:14.910> than<00:02:15.210> something<00:02:15.450> like

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
will be more hidden than something like

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.690 
will be more hidden than something like
say<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:15.990> example<00:02:16.140> an<00:02:16.530> iPad<00:02:16.860> 2<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.580> the

anything<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:40.980> form<00:03:41.190> factor<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.549> wouldn't

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
anything in this form factor I wouldn't

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.410 
anything in this form factor I wouldn't
expect<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:43.430> speakers<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.640> be<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:45.030> amazing

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
expect the speakers to be like amazing

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.860 
expect the speakers to be like amazing
or<00:03:45.780> anything<00:03:45.959> once<00:03:46.830> we<00:03:46.950> open<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.340> up<00:03:47.459> we<00:03:48.269> find<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
or anything once we open it up we find a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.210 
or anything once we open it up we find a
standard<00:03:49.290> keyboard<00:03:49.530> layout<00:03:49.980> we're<00:03:50.100> gonna

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
standard keyboard layout we're gonna

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.880 
standard keyboard layout we're gonna
find<00:03:50.489> out<00:03:50.640> how<00:03:50.790> quickly<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.269> wakes<00:03:51.450> up<00:03:51.890> from

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
find out how quickly it wakes up from

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.190 
find out how quickly it wakes up from
actually<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.310> think<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.480> sleep<00:03:54.900> I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
actually I think is this and sleep I

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.479 
actually I think is this and sleep I
guess<00:03:55.560> we'll<00:03:55.709> find<00:03:55.920> out<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.220> way<00:03:56.340> or<00:03:56.400> the

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
guess we'll find out one way or the

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.720 
guess we'll find out one way or the
other

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.330 

yeah<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.760> was<00:04:00.000> in<00:04:00.120> sleep<00:04:00.390> hey<00:04:00.989> I'm<00:04:01.830> not<00:04:02.190> sure

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
yeah I was in sleep hey I'm not sure

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.270 
yeah I was in sleep hey I'm not sure
actually<00:04:02.519> alright<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:03.900> once<00:04:04.890> we<00:04:05.040> get<00:04:05.160> inside

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
actually alright so once we get inside

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.069 
actually alright so once we get inside
we<00:04:05.700> find<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:06.060> chiclet<00:04:06.269> type<00:04:06.630> with<00:04:06.840> Kate

we find a chiclet type with Kate

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.349 
we find a chiclet type with Kate
keyboard<00:04:07.500> layout<00:04:07.739> with<00:04:07.950> no<00:04:08.190> cardinal<00:04:08.820> sins<00:04:09.090> to

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
keyboard layout with no cardinal sins to

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.610 
keyboard layout with no cardinal sins to
speak<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.870> so

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620

speak of so
we've<00:04:10.709> got<00:04:10.920> long<00:04:11.220> shift<00:04:11.580> keys<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.890> tricky

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
we've got long shift keys and tricky

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.699 
we've got long shift keys and tricky
actually<00:04:14.549> yeah<00:04:14.700> correct<00:04:15.120> Enter<00:04:15.510> key

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
actually yeah correct Enter key

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.259

backspace delete are actually pretty

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.289 
backspace delete are actually pretty
cleverly<00:04:18.900> positioned<00:04:19.280> long<00:04:20.280> tab<00:04:20.579> everything

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
cleverly positioned long tab everything

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.820 
cleverly positioned long tab everything
in<00:04:21.389> here<00:04:21.540> looks<00:04:21.570> okay<00:04:22.019> if<00:04:22.260> anything<00:04:22.500> they've

in here looks okay if anything they've

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.409 
in here looks okay if anything they've
shrunk<00:04:23.100> some<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.610> stuff<00:04:23.820> that's<00:04:23.940> stupid

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
shrunk some of the stuff that's stupid

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.909 
shrunk some of the stuff that's stupid
like<00:04:24.600> who<00:04:24.720> uses<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.169> top<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.500> their<00:04:25.620> Enter<00:04:25.889> key

like who uses the top of their Enter key

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.640 
like who uses the top of their Enter key
and<00:04:26.310> who<00:04:27.090> wants<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.570> hit<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.720> caps<00:04:28.110> loft<00:04:28.410> heel

and who wants to hit the caps loft heel
key<00:04:29.220> all<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.460> time<00:04:29.639> not<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:31.580> they<00:04:32.580> were<00:04:32.760> using

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
key all the time not I they were using

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.300 
key all the time not I they were using
like<00:04:33.210> an<00:04:33.360> edge<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.510> edge<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.440> like<00:04:34.680> no<00:04:35.100> we're

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
like an edge to edge and like no we're

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.740 
like an edge to edge and like no we're
using<00:04:35.490> it's<00:04:35.820> using<00:04:36.120> edge<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.419> edge<00:04:36.479> glass

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
using it's using edge to edge glass

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.270 
using it's using edge to edge glass
almost<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.500> edge<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:37.620> there's<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.040> little

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
almost to the edge so there's a little

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.680 
almost to the edge so there's a little
bit<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.490> aluminum<00:04:38.940> here<00:04:39.120> from<00:04:39.330> sort<00:04:39.540> of<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
bit of aluminum here from sort of the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.140 
bit of aluminum here from sort of the
unibody<00:04:40.110> top<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.710> then<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.370> goes<00:04:41.550> right<00:04:41.850> to

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
unibody top and then it goes right to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.520 
unibody top and then it goes right to
here<00:04:42.510> that's<00:04:42.720> where<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.960> glass<00:04:43.139> is<00:04:43.380> so

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
here that's where the glass is so

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.590 
here that's where the glass is so
that'll<00:04:43.800> allow<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.729> easily<00:04:44.880> swipe<00:04:45.419> in

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
that'll allow you to easily swipe in

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.180 
that'll allow you to easily swipe in
from<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.960> bottom<00:04:46.110> or<00:04:46.470> swipe<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:46.889> from<00:04:47.070> the

from the bottom or swipe in from the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.920 
from the bottom or swipe in from the
side<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.820> is<00:04:47.880> an<00:04:48.090> engineering<00:04:48.510> sample

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
side this is an engineering sample

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.120 
side this is an engineering sample
notebook<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.410> actually<00:04:49.770> some<00:04:49.979> of<00:04:50.039> the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
notebook so actually some of the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.680 
notebook so actually some of the
gestures<00:04:50.490> aren't<00:04:50.729> working<00:04:51.030> correctly<00:04:51.180> on<00:04:51.570> it

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
gestures aren't working correctly on it

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.570 
gestures aren't working correctly on it
so<00:04:51.840> forgive<00:04:52.169> me<00:04:52.289> guys<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.310> not<00:04:53.550> a

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
so forgive me guys this is not a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.450 
so forgive me guys this is not a
finished<00:04:53.910> product<00:04:54.300> but<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.500> actual<00:04:55.889> one<00:04:56.190> will

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
finished product but the actual one will

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.219 
finished product but the actual one will
work<00:04:56.610> correctly<00:04:56.850> for<00:04:57.180> all<00:04:57.570> of<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.840> gestures

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
work correctly for all of the gestures

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.020 
work correctly for all of the gestures
that<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.530> want<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.889> do<00:04:59.010> screen<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.850> actually

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
that you want to do screen is actually

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.180 
that you want to do screen is actually
pretty<00:05:00.990> darn<00:05:01.199> good<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:01.800> you've<00:05:01.949> got

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
pretty darn good so you've got

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.640 
pretty darn good so you've got
reasonable<00:05:02.970> viewing<00:05:03.449> angles<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.139> glossy

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
reasonable viewing angles it is glossy

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.890 
reasonable viewing angles it is glossy
so<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.220> do<00:05:05.460> have<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.639> contend<00:05:06.060> with<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.389> here

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
so you do have to contend with that here

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.090 
so you do have to contend with that here
this<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:07.199> probably<00:05:07.440> gonna<00:05:07.560> be<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.770> better<00:05:07.949> way

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
this is probably gonna be a better way

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.010 
this is probably gonna be a better way
to<00:05:08.130> give<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.430> guys<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.610> look<00:05:08.880> at<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.840> there

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
to give you guys a look at it so there

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.689 
to give you guys a look at it so there
you<00:05:10.110> go<00:05:10.229> viewing<00:05:10.620> angles<00:05:10.949> aren't<00:05:11.370> quite

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
you go viewing angles aren't quite

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.610 
you go viewing angles aren't quite
excellent<00:05:12.090> if<00:05:12.510> you<00:05:12.600> come<00:05:12.720> up<00:05:12.750> here<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:13.470> can

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.010 
excellent if you come up here you can
still<00:05:13.830> see<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.190> very<00:05:14.400> very<00:05:14.700> well<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.240> what<00:05:15.990> I

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
still see it very very well and what I

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.930 
still see it very very well and what I
like<00:05:16.260> most<00:05:16.530> about<00:05:16.650> this<00:05:16.950> is<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.580> portability

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
like most about this is the portability

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.450 
like most about this is the portability
it<00:05:18.240> weighs<00:05:18.419> almost<00:05:18.599> nothing<00:05:19.229> so<00:05:19.410> here<00:05:20.160> I<00:05:20.190> never

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
it weighs almost nothing so here I never

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.400 
it weighs almost nothing so here I never
did<00:05:20.669> show<00:05:20.849> you<00:05:20.910> guys<00:05:21.150> my<00:05:21.360> iPhone<00:05:21.750> comparison

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
did show you guys my iPhone comparison

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.050 
did show you guys my iPhone comparison
for<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.650> thinness<00:05:23.039> of<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.220> overall<00:05:23.490> notebook

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
for the thinness of the overall notebook

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.510 
for the thinness of the overall notebook
which<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.139> just<00:05:25.560> crazy

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
which is just crazy

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.820 
which is just crazy
tiny<00:05:27.389> tiny<00:05:27.750> things<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:28.260> there<00:05:28.410> that<00:05:28.440> gives<00:05:28.740> you

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
tiny tiny things so there that gives you

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.950 
tiny tiny things so there that gives you
some<00:05:29.039> idea<00:05:29.310> of<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:30.000> size<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.389> this<00:05:30.510> notebook

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
some idea of the size of this notebook

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.750 
some idea of the size of this notebook
and<00:05:31.200> then<00:05:31.789> the<00:05:32.789> thinness<00:05:33.950> here<00:05:34.950> I<00:05:34.979> go<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.430> can

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
and then the thinness here I go I can

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.100 
and then the thinness here I go I can
move<00:05:35.880> it<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:36.150> edge<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.330> almost<00:05:36.750> lose<00:05:37.050> it

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
move it to the edge you almost lose it

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.260 
move it to the edge you almost lose it
in<00:05:37.410> the<00:05:37.590> yeah<00:05:37.770> in<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:39.210> cloth<00:05:39.570> here<00:05:40.460> very<00:05:41.460> very

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
in the yeah in the cloth here very very

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.120 
in the yeah in the cloth here very very
thin<00:05:42.570> very<00:05:42.780> light<00:05:43.139> because<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.710> aluminum

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
thin very light because of the aluminum

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.189 
thin very light because of the aluminum
plastic<00:05:44.340> construction<00:05:44.699> very<00:05:45.599> solid<00:05:46.020> feeling

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
plastic construction very solid feeling

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.810 
plastic construction very solid feeling
so<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.680> would<00:05:46.830> actually<00:05:47.220> use<00:05:47.400> this<00:05:47.580> with

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
so I would actually use this with

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.879 
so I would actually use this with
confidence<00:05:48.360> like<00:05:48.930> this<00:05:49.169> because<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.650> hinge

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
confidence like this because the hinge

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.969 
confidence like this because the hinge
is<00:05:50.070> quite<00:05:50.400> sturdy<00:05:51.440> like<00:05:52.440> I<00:05:52.530> wouldn't<00:05:52.830> worry

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
is quite sturdy like I wouldn't worry

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.620 
is quite sturdy like I wouldn't worry
about<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.430> breaking<00:05:53.880> or<00:05:54.150> anything<00:05:54.300> which<00:05:54.599> is

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
about it breaking or anything which is

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.930 
about it breaking or anything which is
usually<00:05:55.139> the<00:05:55.289> case<00:05:55.440> on<00:05:55.740> notebooks<00:05:56.580> of<00:05:56.729> this

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
usually the case on notebooks of this

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.140 
usually the case on notebooks of this
kind<00:05:57.240> of<00:05:57.360> size<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:58.520> here<00:05:59.520> is<00:05:59.610> aluminum<00:05:59.820> as

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
kind of size and here is aluminum as

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.300 
kind of size and here is aluminum as
well<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:00.960> that's<00:06:01.139> again<00:06:01.500> what<00:06:01.740> contributes<00:06:02.220> to

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
well so that's again what contributes to

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.430 
well so that's again what contributes to
the<00:06:02.520> sturdiness<00:06:02.880> of<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:03.240> machine<00:06:03.570> touchpad

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
the sturdiness of the machine touchpad

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.129 
the sturdiness of the machine touchpad
is<00:06:05.090> reasonably<00:06:06.090> sized<00:06:06.419> to<00:06:06.720> actually<00:06:06.990> here

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
is reasonably sized to actually here

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.200 
is reasonably sized to actually here
I'll<00:06:07.229> do<00:06:07.410> another<00:06:08.070> iPhone<00:06:08.250> size<00:06:08.639> comparison

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
I'll do another iPhone size comparison

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.900 
I'll do another iPhone size comparison
haha<00:06:09.570> reasonably<00:06:10.560> sized<00:06:10.889> actually<00:06:11.699> for<00:06:11.880> a

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
haha reasonably sized actually for a

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.670 
haha reasonably sized actually for a
notebook<00:06:12.210> of<00:06:12.330> this<00:06:12.449> size<00:06:12.570> as<00:06:12.750> well<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.110> the

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
notebook of this size as well and the

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.670 
notebook of this size as well and the
correct<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:15.180> correct<00:06:15.300> aspect<00:06:15.570> ratio<00:06:16.199> for<00:06:16.229> the

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
correct the correct aspect ratio for the

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.830 
correct the correct aspect ratio for the
sixteen<00:06:17.130> by<00:06:17.250> nine<00:06:17.280> screen<00:06:17.639> so<00:06:17.760> it's<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:17.910> 1366<00:06:18.780> by

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
sixteen by nine screen so it's a 1366 by

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.159 
sixteen by nine screen so it's a 1366 by
768<00:06:19.580> screen<00:06:20.580> on<00:06:20.820> there<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.240> think<00:06:21.810> that<00:06:21.960> pretty

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
768 screen on there I think that pretty

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.570 
768 screen on there I think that pretty
much<00:06:22.289> wraps<00:06:22.409> it<00:06:22.800> up<00:06:22.890> thank<00:06:23.219> you

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
much wraps it up thank you

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.520 
much wraps it up thank you

look at the Acer Aspire s7 it's kind of

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.839 
look at the Acer Aspire s7 it's kind of
a<00:06:28.080> lie<00:06:28.319> calling<00:06:28.830> this<00:06:28.919> a<00:06:28.979> first<00:06:29.340> look<00:06:29.580> because
