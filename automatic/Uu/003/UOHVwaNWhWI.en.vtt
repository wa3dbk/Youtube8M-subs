the metal gear so it's a bit faster it's
a<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.800> stronger<00:00:59.629> it's<00:01:00.629> sort<00:01:01.080> of<00:01:01.230> waterproof

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
a bit stronger it's sort of waterproof

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
screws so there's a long screw here

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.770 
screws so there's a long screw here
which<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> thought<00:02:34.950> set<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:36.180> goes<00:02:36.390> through

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
which is a thought set it goes through

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.729 
which is a thought set it goes through
the<00:02:36.989> ESC<00:02:37.739> mount<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:39.140> servo<00:02:40.140> mount<00:02:40.410> and

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
the ESC mount and in servo mount and

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.400 
the ESC mount and in servo mount and
then<00:02:40.980> you've<00:02:41.160> got<00:02:41.840> three<00:02:42.840> other<00:02:43.489> flathead<00:02:45.410> hex

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
then you've got three other flathead hex

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.070 
then you've got three other flathead hex
screws

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
screws

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.930 
screws

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
okay so once you've done that you can

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:58.440 
okay so once you've done that you can
just<00:02:49.210> sort<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.290> slide<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.770> out<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:57.450> so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
just sort of slide it out like this so

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.840 
just sort of slide it out like this so
yeah<00:02:58.780> there<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.590> Traxxas<00:03:00.070> sort<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.370> an<00:03:00.550> onion

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
yeah there you Traxxas sort of an onion

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.430 
yeah there you Traxxas sort of an onion
salt<00:03:02.580> 20<00:03:03.580> or<00:03:03.670> 75<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.600> these<00:03:05.050> aren't<00:03:05.290> bad

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
salt 20 or 75 so these aren't bad

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.650 
salt 20 or 75 so these aren't bad

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
into a different carb upgraded from the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.330 
into a different carb upgraded from the
different<00:03:11.170> server<00:03:11.410> there<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.830> car<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.190> guys

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
different server there that car you guys

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.540 
different server there that car you guys
I'm<00:03:12.580> back<00:03:12.700> here<00:03:12.910> with<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.270> servo<00:03:14.550> which

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
I'm back here with this servo which

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.550 
I'm back here with this servo which
isn't<00:03:15.760> completely<00:03:16.240> dried<00:03:16.600> but<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.900> figured

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
isn't completely dried but I figured

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.410 
isn't completely dried but I figured
that<00:03:17.680> doesn't<00:03:17.950> happen<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.220> be<00:03:18.250> I've<00:03:19.180> done

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
that doesn't happen to be I've done

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.920 
that doesn't happen to be I've done
three<00:03:19.990> coats<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.710> putting<00:03:21.670> sugar<00:03:22.120> one<00:03:22.600> here

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
three coats of putting sugar one here

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.690 
three coats of putting sugar one here
which<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.740> a<00:03:23.770> bit<00:03:23.950> different<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.400> what<00:03:24.430> most

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
which is a bit different to what most

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.820 
which is a bit different to what most
people<00:03:24.850> do<00:03:25.300> for<00:03:26.020> waterproofing<00:03:26.620> their

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
people do for waterproofing their

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.010 
people do for waterproofing their
servers<00:03:27.340> machine<00:03:27.910> who<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.240> material<00:03:28.810> that's

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
servers machine who is material that's

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.449 
servers machine who is material that's
rubberized<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:30.670> like<00:03:31.170> plastidip<00:03:32.280> which<00:03:33.280> is

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
rubberized just like plastidip which is

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.430 
rubberized just like plastidip which is
what<00:03:33.610> most<00:03:33.940> people<00:03:34.090> usually<00:03:34.540> use<00:03:34.810> toward

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
what most people usually use toward

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.620 
what most people usually use toward
proof<00:03:35.650> their<00:03:35.890> servers<00:03:36.250> but<00:03:37.120> pretty<00:03:37.330> much<00:03:37.390> as

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
proof their servers but pretty much as

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.150 
proof their servers but pretty much as
you<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.840> see<00:03:37.990> I'm<00:03:38.080> masked<00:03:38.500> off<00:03:38.680> everywhere

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
you can see I'm masked off everywhere

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.110 
you can see I'm masked off everywhere
where<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.430> don't<00:03:39.550> want<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:41.730> covered<00:03:42.730> up<00:03:42.910> with

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
where I don't want to be covered up with

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.980 
where I don't want to be covered up with
sugar<00:03:43.570> okay<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:44.320> now<00:03:44.709> what<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.980> need<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.190> do<00:03:45.490> is

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
sugar okay so now what you need to do is

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.260 
sugar okay so now what you need to do is
slide<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.200> server<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:47.950> here<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.120> can

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
slide the server in here so that you can

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.040 
slide the server in here so that you can
get<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.510> underneath<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.200> ESC<00:03:50.920> screw<00:03:52.050> it's

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
get it underneath that ESC screw it's

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.509 
get it underneath that ESC screw it's
going<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.290> be<00:03:53.380> proved<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.130> bit<00:03:54.310> difficult

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
going to be proved to be a bit difficult

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.540 
going to be proved to be a bit difficult
and<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.959> can<00:03:56.170> reinstall<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:57.160> with<00:03:57.370> the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
and then you can reinstall it with the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.640 
and then you can reinstall it with the
same<00:03:57.790> screws<00:03:58.300> here<00:03:58.660> however<00:03:58.959> I'm<00:03:59.260> going<00:03:59.470> to

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
receiver as the other server was before

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.930 
receiver as the other server was before
okay<00:04:32.710> once<00:04:33.010> you've<00:04:33.160> done<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.640> need<00:04:33.760> to

was<00:05:36.900> saying<00:05:37.110> before<00:05:37.170> I<00:05:37.440> want<00:05:37.710> it<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:37.950> be

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
was saying before I want it to be

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.590 
was saying before I want it to be
centered<00:05:38.490> like<00:05:38.700> this<00:05:39.860> because<00:05:41.450> when<00:05:42.450> it's

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
centered like this because when it's

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.640 
centered like this because when it's
turned<00:05:42.780> on<00:05:42.990> it's<00:05:43.200> right<00:05:43.440> in<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.620> center

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
turned on it's right in the center

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.010 
turned on it's right in the center
because<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.640> sorry<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.180> also<00:05:45.360> need<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.780> change

your trims on the Urim own to at zero

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.100 
your trims on the Urim own to at zero
right<00:05:49.170> at<00:05:49.680> zero<00:05:49.920> and<00:05:50.190> then<00:05:51.000> you've<00:05:51.150> gotta<00:05:51.360> try

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
right at zero and then you've gotta try

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.460 
right at zero and then you've gotta try
and<00:05:52.170> put<00:05:52.380> this<00:05:52.500> servo<00:05:52.980> saver<00:05:53.190> on<00:05:53.550> in<00:05:54.420> them<00:05:55.200> as

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
and put this servo saver on in them as

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.980 
and put this servo saver on in them as
much<00:05:55.980> to<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.490> middle<00:05:56.850> as<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.300> possibly<00:05:57.720> can

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
much to the middle as you possibly can

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.300 
much to the middle as you possibly can
and<00:05:58.050> then<00:05:58.380> you're<00:05:58.470> gonna<00:05:58.590> screw<00:05:59.040> it<00:05:59.160> in<00:05:59.280> with

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
and then you're gonna screw it in with

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.430 
and then you're gonna screw it in with
that<00:05:59.640> screen<00:05:59.970> out<00:06:00.150> before<00:06:02.720> you<00:06:03.720> install<00:06:04.140> that

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
that screen out before you install that

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.640 
that screen out before you install that
on<00:06:04.500> there<00:06:04.830> and<00:06:05.780> that's<00:06:06.780> it<00:06:06.990> it's<00:06:07.530> pretty

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
on there and that's it it's pretty

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:22.440 
on there and that's it it's pretty
simple<00:06:08.540> process<00:06:09.540> so<00:06:09.810> changing<00:06:10.650> server<00:06:20.450> yep

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
simple process so changing server yep

definitely<00:06:23.450> Fausto<00:06:24.550> it's<00:06:25.550> a<00:06:25.580> bit<00:06:25.730> noisy<00:06:25.940> but

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
definitely Fausto it's a bit noisy but

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.950 
definitely Fausto it's a bit noisy but
it's<00:06:26.780> much<00:06:27.020> faster<00:06:27.670> so<00:06:28.670> there<00:06:28.820> you<00:06:28.880> go<00:06:29.000> that's

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
it's much faster so there you go that's

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.510 
it's much faster so there you go that's
