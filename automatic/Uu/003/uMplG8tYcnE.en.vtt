00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
preferred is where the curve is the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.330 
preferred is where the curve is the
total<00:05:18.340> character<00:05:18.790> for<00:05:19.060> me<00:05:19.210> is<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.260> guide<00:05:20.650> as<00:05:21.070> you

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
total character for me is a guide as you

total character for me is a guide as you
can<00:05:21.550> see<00:05:21.790> it<00:05:21.850> is<00:05:22.300> at<00:05:22.720> this<00:05:22.960> really<00:05:23.440> big<00:05:23.620> so<00:05:25.590> it

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
can see it is at this really big so it

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.380 
can see it is at this really big so it
really<00:05:27.130> doesn't<00:05:27.430> show<00:05:28.110> his<00:05:29.110> character's

macro<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.600> these<00:05:44.080> are<00:05:44.260> reference<00:05:44.620> for<00:05:44.890> the

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
macro and these are reference for the

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.910 
macro and these are reference for the
different<00:05:45.730> classes<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:46.990> these<00:05:47.170> that<00:05:47.590> is<00:05:47.770> you

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
different classes so these that is you

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.260 
different classes so these that is you
can<00:05:48.130> see<00:05:48.400> they<00:05:48.940> that<00:05:49.480> means<00:05:51.060> every<00:05:52.060> one<00:05:52.210> of

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
can see they that means every one of

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.040 
can see they that means every one of
them<00:05:52.600> are<00:05:52.810> four<00:05:53.290> and<00:05:53.950> it's<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.310> time<00:05:55.050> thirty

them are four and it's that time thirty

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.550 
them are four and it's that time thirty
hours<00:05:56.820> so<00:05:57.820> after<00:05:58.120> 15<00:05:58.330> hours<00:05:58.600> I<00:05:58.900> will<00:05:58.960> lose<00:05:59.230> them

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560
