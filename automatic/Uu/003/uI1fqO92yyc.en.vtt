compared<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.430> original<00:00:50.430> UV<00:00:51.090> 500<00:00:51.660> deck<00:00:51.899> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
compared to the original UV 500 deck is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.340 
compared to the original UV 500 deck is
more<00:00:52.649> detailed<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.280> terms<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.610> design<00:00:54.350> here's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
more detailed in terms of design here's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.310 
more detailed in terms of design here's
the<00:00:55.469> back<00:00:55.649> design<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.539> adds<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the back design you can see that adds a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.310 
the back design you can see that adds a
lot<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.559> feathers<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.489> bunch<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> crazy

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
lot of feathers and a bunch of crazy

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
lot of feathers and a bunch of crazy
things<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.160> no<00:01:02.399> idea<00:01:02.730> what's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
things going down have no idea what's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.800 
things going down have no idea what's
going<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:05.070> design<00:01:05.400> does<00:01:06.299> show<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
going on the design does show in the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
going on the design does show in the
back<00:01:06.960> design<00:01:07.189> when<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.220> fan<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.939> it's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
back design when you fan it but it's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.440 
back design when you fan it but it's
really<00:01:09.210> hard<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:10.040> still<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> person

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really hard to see still but in person

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
really hard to see still but in person
it's<00:01:12.630> easier<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:14.670> performance

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it's easier to see the performance

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380 
it's easier to see the performance
coating<00:01:15.540> fans<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.229> good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.080 

no<00:01:20.080> pressure<00:01:20.409> needed

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.300 

yeah<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.750> fan<00:01:25.900> equality<00:01:26.440> is<00:01:26.500> still<00:01:26.680> up<00:01:26.860> there

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
yeah the fan equality is still up there

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.230 
yeah the fan equality is still up there
I<00:01:27.510> don't<00:01:28.510> think<00:01:28.540> da<00:01:28.840> fan<00:01:29.140> as<00:01:29.470> good<00:01:30.040> as<00:01:30.250> UV<00:01:30.640> 500

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
I don't think da fan as good as UV 500

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.690 
I don't think da fan as good as UV 500
duck<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:32.650> they<00:01:32.740> still<00:01:32.950> fan<00:01:33.220> really<00:01:33.670> nice<00:01:35.700> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
know what they look like this is

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.310 
know what they look like this is
obviously<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.360> performance<00:03:06.660> coating<00:03:07.170> one

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
obviously the performance coating one

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.380 
obviously the performance coating one
you<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.070> see<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.459> detail<00:03:08.850> on<00:03:08.880> scrollwork

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
you can see all the detail on scrollwork

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.420 
you can see all the detail on scrollwork
this<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.810> UV<00:03:10.080> 501<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.950> can<00:03:11.100> barely<00:03:11.310> see

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
this is UV 501 you can barely see

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.650 
this is UV 501 you can barely see
anything<00:03:11.610> on<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.910> box<00:03:13.040> here's<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.250> sides

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
anything on the box here's the sides

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.180 
anything on the box here's the sides
again<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:16.050> could<00:03:16.200> actually<00:03:16.470> read<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.890> just

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
again you could actually read it just

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.380 
again you could actually read it just
one<00:03:17.490> says<00:03:17.760> UV<00:03:18.060> 500<00:03:18.540> airflow<00:03:18.959> but<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:21.060> really

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
one says UV 500 airflow but it's really

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.729 
one says UV 500 airflow but it's really
dark<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.810> hard<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.050> see<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.630> on<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.410> bottom

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.940 
dark and hard to see and on the bottom
corner<00:03:26.459> over<00:03:26.820> here<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:28.200> focus<00:03:28.530> there's<00:03:28.890> a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
corner over here the focus there's a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.630 
corner over here the focus there's a
snake<00:03:29.430> right<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:30.140> on<00:03:31.140> here<00:03:31.459> snake<00:03:32.459> is

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
snake right there on here snake is

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.330 
snake right there on here snake is
almost<00:03:32.880> invisible<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.980> it's<00:03:34.980> practically

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
almost invisible and it's practically

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.340 
almost invisible and it's practically
not<00:03:35.580> there<00:03:37.880> let's<00:03:38.880> compare<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.450> actual<00:03:39.840> cards

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
not there let's compare the actual cards

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.520 
not there let's compare the actual cards
now<00:03:41.269> is<00:03:42.269> what<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.600> back<00:03:42.750> design<00:03:43.050> looks<00:03:43.320> like

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
now is what the back design looks like

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.449 
now is what the back design looks like
on<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:44.190> UV<00:03:45.060> 501<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.040> here's<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.160> back<00:03:47.280> design

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
on the UV 501 and here's the back design

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.110 
on the UV 501 and here's the back design
to<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.940> performance<00:03:48.450> one<00:03:49.940> performance<00:03:50.940> one

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120

you can see more stuff and finally

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.110 
you can see more stuff and finally
there's<00:03:54.959> one<00:03:55.019> last<00:03:55.320> difference<00:03:56.239> deysa<00:03:57.239> speeds

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.119 

this<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.420> ace<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.720> spades<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.260> UV<00:04:04.500> 500

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129
