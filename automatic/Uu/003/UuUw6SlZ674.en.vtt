went was literally once take and that is

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.380 
went was literally once take and that is

the difference between this mission and
the<00:00:41.749> mission<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.109> we<00:00:42.170> just<00:00:42.440> did<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.339> last

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
the mission that we just did the last

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.220 
the mission that we just did the last
mission<00:00:43.730> is<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.449> whole<00:00:44.719> bunch<00:00:44.929> of<00:00:45.050> look

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
mission is a whole bunch of look

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.509 
mission is a whole bunch of look
involved<00:00:45.679> a<00:00:45.739> whole<00:00:45.890> bunch<00:00:46.039> of<00:00:46.159> bullshit

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
involved a whole bunch of bullshit

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.069 
involved a whole bunch of bullshit
because<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.850> mechanic<00:00:47.239> is<00:00:47.390> relying<00:00:47.749> on<00:00:47.899> is

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
because the mechanic is relying on is

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.689 
because the mechanic is relying on is
not<00:00:48.409> good<00:00:48.589> enough<00:00:48.829> for<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.070> sensors<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.489> the

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
not good enough for the sensors of the

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.099 
not good enough for the sensors of the
AI<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.539> mission

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
AI this mission

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.399 
AI this mission
hitman<00:00:51.949> at<00:00:52.100> its<00:00:52.249> finest<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:53.839> you<00:00:53.899> do<00:00:54.109> not<00:00:54.260> have

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
hitman at its finest so you do not have

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.169 
hitman at its finest so you do not have
to<00:00:54.559> use<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:55.039> event<00:00:55.249> to<00:00:55.489> get<00:00:55.640> into<00:00:55.850> this<00:00:55.940> club

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
on this room for some reason I'm not

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.020 
on this room for some reason I'm not
entirely<00:01:20.960> sure<00:01:21.079> why<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.130> guy<00:01:22.310> never<00:01:22.700> stood

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
entirely sure why the guy never stood

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.940 
entirely sure why the guy never stood
there<00:01:23.329> and<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.439> doesn't<00:01:24.590> really<00:01:24.770> matter

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
there and it doesn't really matter

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.020 
there and it doesn't really matter
because<00:01:25.280> he's<00:01:25.399> not<00:01:25.520> gonna<00:01:25.670> see<00:01:25.909> you

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
because he's not gonna see you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.340 
because he's not gonna see you
assassinate<00:01:26.570> him<00:01:26.750> if<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.930> do<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:27.170> correctly

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
assassinate him if you do this correctly

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.830 
assassinate him if you do this correctly
but<00:01:27.799> there<00:01:28.789> are<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:28.939> couple<00:01:29.149> of<00:01:29.299> ways<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:29.659> can

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
but there are a couple of ways this can

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.209 
but there are a couple of ways this can
go<00:01:29.899> wrong<00:01:30.229> because<00:01:30.409> I've<00:01:30.590> experienced<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
go wrong because I've experienced it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.609 
go wrong because I've experienced it
myself<00:01:31.630> when<00:01:32.630> he<00:01:32.750> finishes<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.229> lap<00:01:33.409> dance

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
myself when he finishes the lap dance

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.950 
myself when he finishes the lap dance
because<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.579> pathing<00:01:34.969> on<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.210> AI<00:01:35.329> is<00:01:35.509> kind<00:01:35.630> of

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
because the pathing on the AI is kind of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.139 
because the pathing on the AI is kind of
stupid<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.859> the<00:01:37.100> AI<00:01:37.219> itself<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:37.909> kind<00:01:38.090> of

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
stupid and the AI itself is kind of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.050 
stupid and the AI itself is kind of
stupid<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.170> stripper<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.770> Dom<00:01:40.310> will<00:01:40.820> both

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
stupid the stripper and Dom will both

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.969 
stupid the stripper and Dom will both
leave<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.689> room<00:01:41.899> sometimes<00:01:42.289> they'll<00:01:42.740> do<00:01:42.859> it

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
leave the room sometimes they'll do it

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.560 
leave the room sometimes they'll do it
at<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.189> much<00:01:43.340> quicker<00:01:43.609> pace<00:01:43.759> than<00:01:44.000> you're<00:01:44.390> about

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
at a much quicker pace than you're about

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.020 
at a much quicker pace than you're about

DOM is actually sat through the
furniture<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.110> he's<00:02:36.350> not<00:02:36.500> having<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.830> fun<00:02:37.040> time

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
because as soon as he turns around as

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.310 
because as soon as he turns around as

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
can silently garrote him with the wire

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.870 
can silently garrote him with the wire
so<00:02:53.660> watch<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:54.080> she<00:02:54.620> walks<00:02:54.890> out<00:02:55.100> he<00:02:55.370> stands<00:02:55.670> up

so watch this she walks out he stands up

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.449 
so watch this she walks out he stands up
soon<00:02:56.450> as<00:02:56.540> he<00:02:56.660> hesitates<00:02:57.140> he's<00:02:57.320> down<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.980> he's

hopefully there'll be plenty more I wish
I<00:04:49.160> could<00:04:49.310> get<00:04:49.460> them<00:04:49.610> on<00:04:49.670> every<00:04:49.910> mission<00:04:50.030> but<00:04:50.450> it

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
I could get them on every mission but it

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.840 
I could get them on every mission but it
just<00:04:51.050> doesn't<00:04:51.320> seem<00:04:51.440> possible<00:04:51.850> really

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
just doesn't seem possible really

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.760 
just doesn't seem possible really
