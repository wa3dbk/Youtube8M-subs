00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
cheaper you can hook it up to a TV and

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.810 
cheaper you can hook it up to a TV and
you<00:05:01.050> can<00:05:01.290> use<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.710> sixaxis<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.640> would<00:05:02.790> be

you can use the sixaxis and it would be

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.000 
you can use the sixaxis and it would be
it<00:05:03.360> would<00:05:03.420> be<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.660> would<00:05:03.870> not<00:05:04.110> be<00:05:04.290> exactly<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
it would be it would not be exactly the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.160 
it would be it would not be exactly the
same<00:05:05.250> but<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.880> would<00:05:06.000> be<00:05:06.030> similar<00:05:06.420> to<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.810> ps3

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170

experience<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:07.890> you<00:05:07.950> would<00:05:08.070> say<00:05:08.220> five

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
hundred dollars in the process so you

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.780
