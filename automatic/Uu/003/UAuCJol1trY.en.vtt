00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.160
 mayday i will find it again mira and we 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.469
 make a hearty nutty sweet today 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 Wallertheim is made super fast 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.949
 and first we need it 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.000
 of course ours did 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 I do a classic for that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:32.640
 shortcrust pastry and for that we need as 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:36.420
 first mail powdered sugar and a pinch 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.190
 salt and stir we already 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.210
 times as a bit together before 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 We then mother in room temperature 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.969
 Add it and now everything 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.739
 knead it together a bit 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 until we have such a scary pond 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.010
 come 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.500
 For this you take either one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.730
 crochet or just yours 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.730
 washed finger tip 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.050
 the butter is already alright 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.460
 distributed and we have a total now 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.250
 nasty lying sandy dough and now 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 we continue as we us the money 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.250
 take and about two to two and a half 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.970
 tablespoon of water as cold water 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.410
 and that's what comes with it 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.180
 first one thinks oh god how should that be 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.860
 everything come together and a dough 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.720
 because it's so insanely dry 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.090
 looks and yet relatively little 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.430
 liquid now but you have 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.830
 trust kneads hard on it and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.509
 I assure you will be a wonderful 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.960
 day really trying not only times 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 to get more water and if necessary 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.640
 you can still do something 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.560
 to do so 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.280
 but that should be so good 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.280
 function 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.929
 this is now the ready-made shortcrust pastry 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.549
 and in fact everything is wonderful 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.429
 come together though I only have two 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.780
 have taken tablespoon of water so have 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.379
 Trust and do not be seduced anymore 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.000
 to take 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.640
 because too much water makes the dough 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.650
 later broken and really nice and 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.890
 Now I take the dough and turin 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.580
 On it fresh foil presses the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.580
 something flat and packs him nice 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 because coming now again for a 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.200
 until two hours in the refrigerator 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.349
 before we continue to process ours 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.610
 shortcrust pastry had long enough in the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.470
 Refrigerator located and can now 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.450
 finally be processed 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.829
 I'll just leave it for that 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.019
 on the film so I like them 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.440
 its better to move over into mine 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.530
 shape and roll out of the must 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.209
 now of course fit into shape and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.250
 I take my shape from time to time 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.930
 and see if the size of the already good 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.340
 enough is obviously needs of a 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.130
 so he will be a little bit bigger 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.540
 over the randstein over land and what the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.739
 form if you just now that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.959
 hertie because tinkered there 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.880
 I have the shapes so that I have the battery 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.419
 and can dissolve beautifully later 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.630
 because I have no jump form 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:16.959
 so to speak, I did my act of 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.090
 buttered and then with baking paper 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.299
 laid out and under this baking paper 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.459
 I just have to strip two 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.079
 Baking paper laid with it then I out of it 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.540
 you can drag the ball later 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.280
 rauszuholen 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.030
 but now only times roll take it 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.880
 I here my rolling pin and gold 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.169
 of course, is currently going on 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.000
 very hard when he leaves the 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.700
 fridge comes to catch it again 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.079
 to leave little discourse before you 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.180
 with the roll out beginning 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.370
 so that the whole thing is not so difficult 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.230
 so she drops you now 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.150
 very good from now often again 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.010
 quickly so wonderful over the edge and 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.310
 is that really big enough and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.030
 Now I'm just coming up here 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.200
 the way to 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:12.500
 good to leave that on the slide and 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.770
 just slaps her here now for the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.770
 move 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.450
 he shares that a bit in common 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.889
 rand rubacuori though if you're on 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.330
 Some are too much about it 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.930
 just with the fingers really taking off 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.880
 again, that all are needed 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.190
 tell my lady to hand and ask 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.720
 a couple is to know one which is here 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.030
 ground and who comes now at 210 degrees 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.950
 circulated for about 10 minutes in the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.080
 oven so that it even a little bit of 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.669
 you can also pack a lindberg 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.100
 Doing so means that they are 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.470
 balls or balls on the dough now 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.930
 legumes does not do that with the dough 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.460
 high back and nice flat mostly stays 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.380
 does not work but without it 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.180
 I do without it here during the 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.070
 We already take care of the floor in the oven 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.840
 times to fill the wall and the 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.870
 chocolate is not here yet 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.460
 to use the namely later but us 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.500
 Of course you also need a nice one 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.260
 sought with the whole is poured over 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.260
 and for that we take the eggs first 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.760
 we whisk now and give year 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.760
 rehabilitated injury 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.620
 if you have sugar and picture with each other 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.110
 have mulled then come 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.670
 sugar beet syrup to the war the whole 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.980
 normal in the supermarket of you can 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.600
 no case on the upbeat prescription 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:46.000
 For example, there's the Grafschafter 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:47.470
 gold creates so is the sauce then 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.150
 finished and now we just have to 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.010
 wait until the bottom finally leaves the 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.560
 oven comes out if we continue 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.120
 So the floor is out of the oven 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.890
 get out the oven right away 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.080
 but let the temperature turn something 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.850
 down to 190 degrees 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.650
 and now I'll take my fork again 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.340
 and stab again a few holes 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.050
 pure and now the chocolate sweeps 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.630
 on it on the still warm soil 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:17.470
 so had to play and then 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.940
 come on the bavaria must as can 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.200
 Just leave it as you are 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.920
 you have to chop with small or something 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.620
 just beautiful 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.200
 the pieces are and now comes only 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.200
 still our beautiful syrup on top 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.280
 so now caution is of course still 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.640
 hot so draw your vacant Czech Republic 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.710
 on 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.400
 and then again with it in the oven 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.620
 Circulated 190 degrees and now for 40 minutes 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.320
 when he comes out, he's still calm 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.930
 a bit wobble and that 's ours 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.870
 finished walnut free i know that 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.220
 Perhaps the most beautiful is not there 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.740
 as we know, ten are the inner values 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.540
 especially with cakes and that's why 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.540
 I'll cut them right now 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.120
 I really love the fight 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.980
 I became with you in the 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.720
 Last comment with me thumbs up 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.310
 Subscribed to above channel if it still 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.610
 did not do that and until the next one 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.610
 times
