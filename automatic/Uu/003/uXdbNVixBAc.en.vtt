00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.540
 to spend a little 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.380
 the latest events of these 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.960
 days 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.960
 first the birth of this little boy 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 he wants him with her mom right now 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.380
 so you can see its size a little 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.380
 It is not so tiny 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.950
 Y 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090
 I have them here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.590
 it's more clarita now it's known a little 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.079
 Now I take evening as and 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.750
 lathes 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.320
 to teach us 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.100
 what is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.100
 in the other one 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.700
 knowing 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.219
 is more savvy 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.219
 as you will see 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.270
 I bought it at the expo in madrid 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.229
 and we are going to get 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.219
 they love to climb 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.470
 the guerrillas that I have made 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.470
 how many 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420
 Y 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.460
 or teach us better 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:13.020
 I have as always good in its own 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:13.020
 decoration and have bred yesterday I think 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.040
 and see if we find 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.370
 had to change it to the day of this 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.909
 shape 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.909
 yes 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.610
 they are there 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.819
 now we will pay the debt 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.730
 and the wineries I made three 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.810
 Well, I already had it a little like that in 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.950
 tiny 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.000
 and here I have micro shines 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.000
 I have let them grow 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.910
 because he did not want us so small but 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.030
 they were not normal 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.490
 and good they have grown already enough they are 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.350
 crazy ones escape me every two for three 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.420
 because there are not some things 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.450
 but good here they are 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.370
 another one that I've done 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.370
 is this is a large container 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.430
 this is the drinker and this is the stopper 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.430
 feeder 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.700
 and I have done them 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.100
 I think crushed dog 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.530
 of the iguanas 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.170
 a mix like that 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.170
 a little to taste also made wheat 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.630
 and another day grid that I have done is this 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.430
 I have to put more 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.629
 marc back to these larger 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.629
 there are a few 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.630
 these are black crickets 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:15.700
 and equal the egg cups the stopper with the 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.430
 I think and the drinker I use these 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.820
 systems 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.539
 because I've seen him recommending in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.520
 pages and the truth is that yes it has 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:32.419
 seemed like they 're fine 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.449
 and the few assets and you want to see them 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.449
 near 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.830
 there we have one 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.320
 and the other 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.190
 Recently 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.190

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.819

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.710

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.100
 and nothing we will be able to hoist a little 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.820
 there I throw a little 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:34.989
 and here I plan to throw and put 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.989
 later moss plants 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.200
 ah 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.070
 nothing nothing more here the achievements and 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.409
 dried 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.349
 the crickets 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:00.629
 and here are not the guinea pigs but good 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:03.259
 I have lowered the small one so that you see it 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.259
 close up 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.210
 and it is already 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.080
 I leave 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.080
 Y 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.390
 Well, I'm saying goodbye 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.850
 with the iguanas 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.340
 I have here the incubator attempt of 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.120
 buy one but already for the year that 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:34.300
 come they are up here 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.630
 and measures that are not going to greet the 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:41.370
 camera are already lying down 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.370
 but we can join 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.720

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.919

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:02.350
