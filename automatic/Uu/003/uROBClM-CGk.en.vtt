usually<00:03:51.459> like<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.670> put<00:03:51.760> my<00:03:51.909> finger<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.239> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
usually like to put my finger in the

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.420 
usually like to put my finger in the
middle<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.659> stabilize<00:03:53.079> it<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:54.010> one<00:03:54.250> has<00:03:54.400> a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
middle to stabilize it this one has a

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.369 
middle to stabilize it this one has a
left<00:03:54.760> hand<00:03:55.030> thread<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.689> actually<00:03:55.989> have<00:03:56.260> to

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
left hand thread so you actually have to

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.119 
left hand thread so you actually have to
go<00:03:56.470> backwards<00:03:57.010> from<00:03:57.099> clockwise<00:03:58.890> goes<00:03:59.890> all<00:04:00.099> the

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
go backwards from clockwise goes all the

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:09.890 
go backwards from clockwise goes all the
way<00:04:00.340> through<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:01.239> just<00:04:01.269> tighten<00:04:01.569> it<00:04:01.720> down

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.199
