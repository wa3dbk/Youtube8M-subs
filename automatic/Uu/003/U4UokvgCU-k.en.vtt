to the ground and just go around and

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.700 
to the ground and just go around and
measure<00:01:38.200> about<00:01:38.979> how<00:01:39.310> wide<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.090> want<00:01:40.150> your

I've<00:02:49.950> wet<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:51.000> area<00:02:51.480> down<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.780> want<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.470> dirt

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
I've wet the area down I want the dirt

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.809 
I've wet the area down I want the dirt
to<00:02:53.760> pack<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.230> here's<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.769> trailer<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.430> told

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
to pack in so here's the trailer I told

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.369 
to pack in so here's the trailer I told
you<00:02:57.000> about<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.510> was<00:02:57.720> full<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:59.420> dirt<00:03:00.420> but

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
you about and that was full of dirt but

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.500 
you about and that was full of dirt but
you<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.620> see<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.159> some<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.700> these<00:03:02.790> areas<00:03:02.849> maybe

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
you can see in some of these areas maybe

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.350 
you can see in some of these areas maybe
the<00:03:04.220> angles<00:03:05.220> are<00:03:05.430> getting<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.879> little<00:03:06.180> bit

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the angles are getting a little bit

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.819 
the angles are getting a little bit
steep<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.769> then<00:03:07.980> I'll<00:03:08.129> I'll<00:03:08.519> go<00:03:08.849> around<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
steep so then I'll I'll go around and I

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.640 
steep so then I'll I'll go around and I
like<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:10.950> say<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.190> step<00:03:11.760> back<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.359> I<00:03:12.930> look<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.530> I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
like I say I step back and I look and I

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.670 
like I say I step back and I look and I
step<00:03:13.980> back<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.640> look<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:16.609> see<00:03:17.609> how<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
step back and I look and I see how the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.979 
step back and I look and I see how the
spiral<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.859> is<00:03:20.099> going<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:21.359> I'm<00:03:21.450> always<00:03:21.629> adding

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
spiral is is going but I'm always adding

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.860 
spiral is is going but I'm always adding
a<00:03:22.260> little<00:03:22.409> bit<00:03:22.500> more<00:03:22.760> dirt<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.389> more

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
a little bit more dirt and then more

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.420 
a little bit more dirt and then more
stones<00:03:25.349> more<00:03:26.099> dirt<00:03:26.400> more<00:03:26.730> stones<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.750> stones

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
stones more dirt more stones the stones

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.759 
stones more dirt more stones the stones
hold<00:03:29.430> up<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.790> dirt<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.569> dirt<00:03:31.170> holds<00:03:31.620> up

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
hold up the dirt and the dirt holds up

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.390 
hold up the dirt and the dirt holds up
the<00:03:31.920> stones<00:03:32.540> here's<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.659> view<00:03:33.900> from<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.230> top<00:03:34.400> so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the stones here's a view from the top so

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.330 
the stones here's a view from the top so
you<00:03:35.430> can<00:03:35.670> kind<00:03:35.909> of<00:03:36.060> see<00:03:36.510> how<00:03:36.750> our<00:03:37.190> spiral<00:03:38.190> is

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
you can kind of see how our spiral is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.220 
you can kind of see how our spiral is
coming<00:03:38.760> around<00:03:39.030> you're<00:03:39.299> around<00:03:39.629> will<00:03:39.930> spiral

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
coming around you're around will spiral

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.160 
coming around you're around will spiral
in<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:41.010> few<00:03:41.609> hours<00:03:41.670> or<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.359> half<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.930> day<00:03:43.109> but

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
in just a few hours or a half a day but

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.379 
in just a few hours or a half a day but
I<00:03:43.620> generally<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.549> take<00:03:44.909> a<00:03:44.940> little<00:03:45.239> bit

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
I generally like to take a little bit

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.050 
I generally like to take a little bit
more<00:03:45.599> time<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.049> build<00:03:46.409> mine<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.310> just

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
more time to build mine and and just

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.470 
more time to build mine and and just
kind<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.450> go<00:03:48.930> out<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.349> look<00:03:49.530> at<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:50.359> like<00:03:51.359> I

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
kind of go out and look at it like I

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.150 
kind of go out and look at it like I
said<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.989> if<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.199> angles<00:03:52.799> are<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.010> little

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
said if it if the angles are a little

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.800 
said if it if the angles are a little
bit<00:03:53.340> too<00:03:53.489> steep<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:54.120> maybe<00:03:54.359> you're<00:03:54.540> going<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
bit too steep you maybe you're going to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.170 
bit too steep you maybe you're going to
get<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> little<00:03:55.230> bit<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.500> water<00:03:55.790> running<00:03:56.790> down<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
get a little bit of water running down a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.629 
get a little bit of water running down a
little<00:03:57.660> bit<00:03:57.840> but<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:58.379> do<00:03:58.590> want<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.919> mulch<00:03:59.220> these

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
little bit but we do want to mulch these

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.710 
little bit but we do want to mulch these
um<00:04:00.919> so<00:04:01.919> that<00:04:02.160> we<00:04:02.549> don't<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.209> happening

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
um so that we don't get that happening

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.599 
um so that we don't get that happening
but<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.169> can<00:04:04.349> see<00:04:04.590> here<00:04:04.949> now<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.370> it's

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
but you can see here now that it's

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.909 
but you can see here now that it's
pretty<00:04:06.090> much<00:04:06.299> done<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.930> maybe<00:04:07.290> add<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> few<00:04:07.889> more

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
pretty much done I maybe add a few more

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.470 
pretty much done I maybe add a few more
stones<00:04:08.459> over<00:04:08.760> time

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
stones over time

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.319 
stones over time
this<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.410> our<00:04:10.560> first<00:04:10.799> herbal<00:04:11.430> spiral<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.150> at

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
this is our first herbal spiral up at

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.409 
this is our first herbal spiral up at
the<00:04:12.510> cabin<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.530> permaculture<00:04:14.489> Center<00:04:15.120> and

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
the cabin and permaculture Center and

the cabin and permaculture Center and
now<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.660> can<00:04:15.959> see<00:04:16.229> after<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.650> year<00:04:16.919> or<00:04:17.010> two<00:04:17.190> it's

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
now you can see after a year or two it's

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.020 
now you can see after a year or two it's
just<00:04:17.489> completely<00:04:18.799> becoming<00:04:19.799> overgrown<00:04:20.609> as

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
just completely becoming overgrown as

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.510 
just completely becoming overgrown as
stones<00:04:21.389> really<00:04:21.810> bring<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.380> heat<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.460> is

permaculture Center the first year after
we<00:04:29.039> built<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.470> now<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.530> can<00:04:31.860> see<00:04:32.130> here<00:04:32.970> it
