00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.960

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.240
 try to grow with the success of 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.590
 first team at that time a lot of work 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 before and dfb expected because certain 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.520
 Comply with the junior performance center 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.890
 must be created must give concepts 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.070
 a clear structure must be created 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.520
 and these are things that are now in this 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.660

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.270
 derby against vfr basking well played theirs 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.010
 opinion on the game 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.250
 yes I think we have a high class 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:40.370
 game with many chances many 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.440
 Emotions but always fair and went up 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.070
 the right level like the sow 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.050
 Oberliga has earned for her now 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.540
 this was an important start now 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.090
 in the new season for you, too, of course 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.500
 We as a freshman in the league always 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.260
 very satisfied that you start such a 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.980
 in the derby victory that is 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.960
 of course excellent 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.080
 Next week, one click everything clear 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.410
 mister thank you europeans great 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.030
 play or was it anyway 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.500
 undeservedly lost or how would they be 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.350
 the game and write many opportunities 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.130
 they had when i found it was a 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.110
 class game 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.550
 that's why we deserve it 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.560
 because we did not use the chances 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.810
 had the heidenheimer us 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.150
 how to do it and why yes 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:28.900
 a deserved defeat really does us 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:33.670
 hurts because she was totally on everyone 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:38.680
 case is correct is in there is so 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.910
 soccer robot in the 86 minute then 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.610
 the connection hit and then again 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.080
 Really experienced pressure from the team 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.960
 Then he would have a goal again 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.180
 can or should have always known 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.630
 opponent have an accurate tory in there 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.380
 had he kept the balls this 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:58.660
 header before the 1 0 or 2 1 den 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.190
 Do not stop those and when we are in the 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.260
 make first half bistro 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:06.120
 responding to class then becomes easy 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.120
 it would have been easier for us 

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.999
 ndw energy needs impetus
