00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.600
- BEFORE I DO
ANYTHING ELSE,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.033
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE STATE OF MY BUSHES.

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:07.200
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THEY NEED A TRIM,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.900
AND MY GARDNER NICK
IS OFF THIS WEEK

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.833
BECAUSE HE'S SHOOTING THE SEQUEL
TO "MAGIC MIKE,"

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.966
AND--WHICH IS--
YEAH, THAT'S EXCITING.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.933
[cheers and applause]

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.600
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.766
TO SEE HOW BIG
HIS PART IS.

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.833
THAT'S--

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.566
[laughter]

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.233
THAT SOUNDED WRONG.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.000
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS,
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.366
FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT
TO SEE THE LENGTH OF HIS ROLE.

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.700
[laughter]

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.700
NEVER MIND.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.200
ANYWAY, NICK IS AWAY,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000
AND I NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF MY BUSHES.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.700
SO I ASKED MY VIEWERS

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.633
TO POST SOME AUDITIONS
ON YOUTUBE,

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:43.266
AND THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF SUBMISSIONS,

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.966
AND THERE ARE THREE
THAT I ACTUALLY CAN SHOW YOU

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.500
ON DAYTIME TV.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.700
I'VE GOTTEN QUITE A FEW
THAT I CAN'T SHOW YOU.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.633
BUT THIS IS FROM TEEGAN ROSE
FROM LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.100
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, ELLEN?
I AM TEEGAN ROSE.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.666
YES, YOU HEARD RIGHT.
TEEGAN ROSE.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.100
MY LAST NAME IS ROSE,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.200
WHICH MEANS I WAS DESTINED
TO BE YOUR NEW GARDNER.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.600
TO WHY SHOULD YOU APPOINT ME
AS YOUR GARDNER--

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.900
WELL, I PULL WEEDS.
OH, I MOW LAWNS.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.666
AND I'VE BEEN KNOWN
TO BE AN EXPERT

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.166
AT TRIMMING BUSHES.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.566
SO AMONG ALL THE APPLICANTS,
TO REMEMBER ME,

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.066
JUST REMEMBER THIS:

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.766
THE FLOWER ONLY GROWS
IF ITS WATERED

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.566
BY TEEGAN ROSE.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.633
[applause]

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:30.733
- WELL...

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.433
TEEGAN ROSE.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:34.800
TEEGAN ROSE, YOUR NAME PUTS YOU
IN THE LEAD,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.066
UNLESS WE GET A SUBMISSION
FROM BILLY BUSH.

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.733
[laughter]

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.433
TYLER WINDOR

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.066
- MISS ELLEN DEGENERES,

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.600
I HEARD YOU NEED A GARDNER
FOR YOUR SHOW.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.466
THINK I'M JUST THE MAN
FOR YOU.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.766
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I GOT.

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:57.766
[pulsing dance music]

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.033
[laughter and applause]

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.033
- [laughs]

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.266
[cheers and applause]

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.266
[sighs]

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:24.966
IS EATING A ROSE

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.433
AND SPITTING
THE PETALS OUT SEXY?

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:28.666
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:30.600

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.900

AND THIS IS EMMA DEAN
FROM HEATH, TEXAS.

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:42.633
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT YOU CAN TALK NOW IN VIDEOS.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.000
[laughter]

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.400
THAT'S WHAT I GOT.
THAT'S THE ENTIRE VIDEO.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
BUT IF YOU--

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400
[applause]

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.766
[cheers and applause]

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.000
IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.100
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT EMMA
IS WATERING THE TREE WITH.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.900
IT'S A GASOLINE CONTAINER.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.500
EMMA, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA WIN,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.933
BUT FOR POSTING
YOUR VIDEO,

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:07.500
I'M GONNA SEND YOUR PARENTS
THIS ELLEN SMOKE DETECTOR.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500
[laughter and applause]

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.200
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
WHAT IT TAKES TO TRIM MY BUSHES,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.500
POST A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.800

"ELLEN'S NEW GARDNER."
