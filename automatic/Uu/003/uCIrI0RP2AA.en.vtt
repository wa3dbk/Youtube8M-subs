some money at this high level and it's

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.609 
some money at this high level and it's
really<00:00:20.400> difficult<00:00:20.609> because<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.869> spells<00:00:22.230> my

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
really difficult because the spells my

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.000 
really difficult because the spells my
forty<00:00:23.010> five<00:00:23.220> thousand<00:00:23.910> each<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.740> troops<00:00:25.740> are

forty five thousand each and troops are

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.370 
forty five thousand each and troops are
you<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.369> forty<00:00:26.849> forty<00:00:27.480> thousand<00:00:27.900> plus<00:00:28.080> each

you know forty forty thousand plus each

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.150 
you know forty forty thousand plus each
as<00:00:28.560> well<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:30.140> I've<00:00:31.140> been<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.500> trying<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.040> come

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
as well so I've been just trying to come

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.310 
as well so I've been just trying to come
up<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.700> how<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.540> farm<00:00:33.870> at<00:00:34.140> this

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
up with the way how I can farm at this

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.750 
up with the way how I can farm at this
level<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.930> bet<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.309> thought<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> way

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
level and I bet you thought of the way

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
level and I bet you thought of the way
where<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> could<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.559> very

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
where I could do this but it's very

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
where I could do this but it's very
difficult<00:00:41.399> because<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.329> risk<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
difficult because you're at risk of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
difficult because you're at risk of
losing<00:00:43.320> trophies<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:44.309> well<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.149> gaining

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
losing trophies as well as gaining

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
losing trophies as well as gaining
resources<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> trick<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.879> two

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
resources now the trick is to get two

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
resources now the trick is to get two
golems<00:00:49.850> one<00:00:51.110> or<00:00:52.110> actually<00:00:52.469> both<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.949> take<00:00:53.129> all

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
golems one or actually both to take all

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.939 
golems one or actually both to take all
the<00:00:53.579> heavy<00:00:53.789> weaponry<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> firepower<00:00:55.620> off

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the heavy weaponry all the firepower off

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.790 
the heavy weaponry all the firepower off
in<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.250> archers<00:00:56.989> if<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.530> these

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
in your archers if you can see on these

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.150 
in your archers if you can see on these
bases<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> lot<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.890> people

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
bases a lot of them what a lot of people

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
bases a lot of them what a lot of people
do<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.460> throw<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:03.030> their<00:01:03.210> resources

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
do is they throw all their resources

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.550 
do is they throw all their resources
outside<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.119> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.900> how<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
outside and this is this is how you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.160 
outside and this is this is how you
prevent

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
prevent

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.620 
prevent
you<00:01:10.009> know<00:01:10.159> Wizards<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.759> everyone<00:01:11.119> from<00:01:11.330> going

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
you know Wizards and everyone from going

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.090 
you know Wizards and everyone from going
inside<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.320> town<00:01:12.530> hall

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
inside to the town hall

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.920 
inside to the town hall
because<00:01:13.729> when<00:01:14.000> you're<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:14.180> vassalage<00:01:14.689> and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
because when you're in vassalage and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.050 
because when you're in vassalage and
you're<00:01:15.080> losing<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:16.040> lot<00:01:16.189> of<00:01:16.250> heavy<00:01:16.490> troops<00:01:16.850> like

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
you're losing a lot of heavy troops like

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.929 
you're losing a lot of heavy troops like
that<00:01:17.330> it's<00:01:17.869> easy<00:01:18.170> for<00:01:18.470> them<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.830> one<00:01:19.040> start<00:01:19.430> now

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
that it's easy for them to one start now

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.899 
that it's easy for them to one start now
so<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.270> trick<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:20.770> defend<00:01:21.770> your<00:01:21.920> base<00:01:22.159> so

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
so the trick is to defend your base so

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.700 
so the trick is to defend your base so
that<00:01:23.090> they<00:01:23.210> can't<00:01:23.479> get<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.810> your<00:01:23.899> Town<00:01:24.140> Hall

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
that they can't get to your Town Hall

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.139 
that they can't get to your Town Hall
that's<00:01:25.130> pretty<00:01:25.280> what's<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.670> reason<00:01:26.000> why

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
that's pretty what's the reason why

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.940 
that's pretty what's the reason why
people<00:01:26.210> throw<00:01:26.690> all<00:01:26.930> their<00:01:27.140> resources<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
people throw all their resources and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.279 
people throw all their resources and
everything<00:01:28.070> outside<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.210> distract<00:01:29.720> the

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
everything outside to distract the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.350 
everything outside to distract the
pekka's<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.100> stuff<00:01:31.399> from<00:01:31.549> getting<00:01:31.850> inside<00:01:32.000> to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
pekka's and stuff from getting inside to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.260 
pekka's and stuff from getting inside to
the<00:01:32.450> Town<00:01:32.659> Hall<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:34.250> that's<00:01:34.549> actually<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the Town Hall and that's actually the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.779 
the Town Hall and that's actually the
advantage<00:01:35.930> for<00:01:36.380> people<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:36.979> one<00:01:37.159> would<00:01:37.580> want

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
advantage for people that one would want

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.149 
advantage for people that one would want
a<00:01:37.820> farm<00:01:38.180> at<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.600> level<00:01:38.840> because<00:01:39.770> with<00:01:39.979> all

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
a farm at this level because with all

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.800 
a farm at this level because with all
the<00:01:40.189> money<00:01:40.460> outside<00:01:40.970> all<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.330> have<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.539> do<00:01:41.690> is

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
the money outside all you have to do is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.260 
the money outside all you have to do is
take<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.170> all<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.740> ability<00:01:43.729> stretches<00:01:44.119> out

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
take out all the ability stretches out

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.330 
take out all the ability stretches out
there<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.750> that'll<00:01:45.289> give<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.740> 50<00:01:46.069> star

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
there that that'll give you the 50 star

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.969 
there that that'll give you the 50 star
you're<00:01:46.580> looking<00:01:46.850> for<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.440> that's<00:01:48.590> pretty<00:01:48.890> much

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
you're looking for so that's pretty much

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.520 
you're looking for so that's pretty much
the<00:01:49.250> method<00:01:49.549> I've<00:01:49.670> decided<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.149> do<00:01:50.330> I'm<00:01:51.259> using

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
the method I've decided to do I'm using

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.499 
the method I've decided to do I'm using
golems<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.130> take<00:01:52.369> all<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.640> firepower<00:01:52.850> off<00:01:53.330> of

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
golems to take all the firepower off of

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.529 
golems to take all the firepower off of
my<00:01:53.630> archers<00:01:54.140> or<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.100> women<00:01:55.549> I've<00:01:56.119> put<00:01:56.360> about

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
my archers or the women I've put about

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.080 
my archers or the women I've put about
180<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.229> those<00:01:57.440> things<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:57.979> there<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.429> use

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
180 of those things in there and use

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.600 
180 of those things in there and use
about<00:01:59.240> 2<00:01:59.569> golems<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.340> that's<00:02:01.340> pretty<00:02:01.490> much

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
about 2 golems and that's pretty much

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.699 
about 2 golems and that's pretty much
how<00:02:01.759> I'm<00:02:02.060> farming<00:02:02.539> at<00:02:02.720> Master<00:02:03.350> League<00:02:03.500> level

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
how I'm farming at Master League level

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.680 
how I'm farming at Master League level
so<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.549> think<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.209> a<00:02:05.360> really<00:02:05.659> awesome

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
so I think this is a really awesome

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.930 
so I think this is a really awesome
method<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:08.509> just<00:02:08.539> used<00:02:09.049> this<00:02:10.039> technique<00:02:10.580> and

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
method you just used this technique and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.569 
method you just used this technique and
it'll<00:02:11.720> give<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.900> some<00:02:12.200> money<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:13.130> I'm<00:02:13.340> really

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
it'll give you some money and I'm really

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.370 
it'll give you some money and I'm really
thankful<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.269> because<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> lot<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.230> these

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
thankful to you because a lot of these

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.180 
thankful to you because a lot of these
bases<00:02:15.769> have<00:02:15.920> 200<00:02:16.609> 200k<00:02:17.420> each<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.620> just<00:02:19.010> you're

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
bases have 200 200k each and just you're

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.820 
bases have 200 200k each and just you're
worried<00:02:19.489> about<00:02:19.549> losing

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
worried about losing

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.490 
worried about losing
and<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> do<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:22.030> get<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:22.930> these<00:02:23.230> five

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
and so what I do is get in these five

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.130 
and so what I do is get in these five
lightning<00:02:23.920> spills<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.810> usually<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.080> get

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
lightning spills and usually I can get

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.970 
lightning spills and usually I can get
to<00:02:26.320> 45<00:02:26.650> percent<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.840> I'll<00:02:28.840> use<00:02:29.110> my<00:02:29.440> lightning

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
to 45 percent and I'll use my lightning

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.440 
to 45 percent and I'll use my lightning
spell<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.310> take<00:02:30.460> out<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.910> know<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.210> hero

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.420 

I<00:02:39.129> really<00:02:39.909> like<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.269> nested<00:02:41.129> I'm<00:02:42.129> gonna<00:02:42.310> go

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
I really like this nested I'm gonna go

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.890 
I really like this nested I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.760> keep<00:02:42.879> using<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:43.719> guys

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900

my<00:02:51.730> height<00:02:52.030> here<00:02:52.390> will<00:02:53.109> be<00:02:53.349> using<00:02:53.769> balloons

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
my height here will be using balloons

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.550 
my height here will be using balloons
and<00:02:54.370> minions<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:55.060> really<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.659> that<00:02:55.870> technique

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and minions I really like that technique

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.740 
and minions I really like that technique
and<00:02:56.829> usually<00:02:57.340> usually<00:02:57.849> I<00:02:58.090> can<00:02:58.329> get<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.629> the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and usually usually I can get to the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.229 
and usually usually I can get to the
town<00:02:58.930> hall<00:02:59.140> with<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.790> go<00:03:01.000> white

strategy<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.109> little<00:03:02.470> difficult<00:03:02.950> for<00:03:03.010> me

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
strategy is a little difficult for me

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.949 
strategy is a little difficult for me
because<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:03.970> know<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.359> to<00:03:04.510> use<00:03:04.689> on

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
because you know you have to use on

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.089 
because you know you have to use on
somebody's<00:03:05.620> wall<00:03:05.650> breaking<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:08.099> usually

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
somebody's wall breaking and I usually

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.099 
somebody's wall breaking and I usually
messed<00:03:09.340> up<00:03:09.549> because<00:03:09.730> my<00:03:10.120> heroes<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.689> technical

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
messed up because my heroes in technical

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.530 
messed up because my heroes in technical
go<00:03:11.349> around<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.889> base<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.400> they<00:03:13.209> don't<00:03:13.389> go

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
go around the base and they don't go

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.860 
go around the base and they don't go
through<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.810> town<00:03:13.989> hall<00:03:15.480> that's<00:03:16.480> reason<00:03:16.780> why

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
through the town hall that's reason why

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.360 
through the town hall that's reason why
I'm<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.019> using<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.530> strategy<00:03:17.769> with<00:03:18.159> more

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
I'm not using that strategy with more

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.789 
I'm not using that strategy with more
power<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.030> people<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.480> be<00:03:19.659> it's<00:03:20.409> a<00:03:20.530> very

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
power to the people that be it's a very

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.199 
power to the people that be it's a very
expensive<00:03:21.220> unit<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.329> you<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:23.230> I'm<00:03:23.620> sure<00:03:24.069> it<00:03:24.760> is

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
expensive unit to you but I'm sure it is

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.860 
expensive unit to you but I'm sure it is
possibly<00:03:25.870> likely<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.470> give<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.829> brief<00:03:27.129> dark

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
possibly likely to give you a brief dark

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.960 
possibly likely to give you a brief dark
ocean<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:29.799> like<00:03:30.069> using<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.790> less

ocean but I like using the the less

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.089 
ocean but I like using the the less
costly<00:03:31.269> tree<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.019> this<00:03:32.409> is<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.709> message<00:03:32.889> that

costly tree and this is the message that
