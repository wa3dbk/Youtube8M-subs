think of these maps I think there are

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
think of these maps I think there are
more<00:01:48.149> maps<00:01:48.329> coming<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.290> they

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
more maps coming but that's all they

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.520 
more maps coming but that's all they
have<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.799> far<00:01:50.689> like<00:01:51.689> actually<00:01:52.170> added<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
have so far like actually added to the
website<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:53.070> still<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.549> very<00:01:53.790> cool<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
