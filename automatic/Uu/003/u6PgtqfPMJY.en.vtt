00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.659 
doesn't really matter you can just have
equal<00:01:59.549> sides<00:02:00.590> alright<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:01.979> far<00:02:02.279> this<00:02:02.520> is

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:02.669 
equal sides alright so so far this is

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:05.330 
equal sides alright so so far this is
what<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.029> have<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:04.259> we're<00:02:04.439> going<00:02:04.739> to<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:05.099> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
what we have what we're going to do is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.370 
what we have what we're going to do is
just<00:02:05.669> pull<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> cap<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:06.840> bit<00:02:06.989> further

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
just pull the cap a little bit further

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.339 
just pull the cap a little bit further
to<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.919> back

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.929 

and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.979> we're<00:02:11.159> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.430> bring<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> edge

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
and then we're going to bring the edge

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.240 
and then we're going to bring the edge
up<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.659> top<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.680> basically

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
up right on top of it so you basically

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.149 
up right on top of it so you basically
want<00:02:14.969> your<00:02:15.239> head<00:02:15.480> job<00:02:15.719> and<00:02:16.019> your<00:02:16.140> cap<00:02:16.439> to<00:02:16.829> be<00:02:16.980> on

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
want your head job and your cap to be on

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.539 
want your head job and your cap to be on

don't<00:02:23.819> stretch<00:02:24.180> out<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.450> head<00:02:24.599> job<00:02:24.810> although

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
don't stretch out the head job although

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.289

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
using a pin to pin them so this pin

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.770 
using a pin to pin them so this pin
right<00:02:51.629> here<00:02:51.689> it<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.319> pretty<00:02:53.010> big<00:02:53.389> you<00:02:54.389> guys<00:02:54.569> can
