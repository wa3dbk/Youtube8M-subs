00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.100
 two minifigures since this set has 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.840
 me since 2010 packaging I threw away 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 unfortunately I have to do it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.450
 throw away the packaging from either because 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.820
 I have hundreds 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.189
 Lego sets I can not store as much 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 waste paper and so now you have everything

 the contents of this set 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 the set is small but as you can see there is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.190
 quite interesting details especially 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.360
