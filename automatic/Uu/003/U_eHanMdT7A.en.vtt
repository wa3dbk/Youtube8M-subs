here<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.669> just<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.300> overall<00:05:40.450> decision

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
here and just the overall decision

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.740 
here and just the overall decision
making<00:05:41.290> from<00:05:41.470> secret<00:05:41.800> was<00:05:41.950> really<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.750> decided

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
making from secret was really I decided

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.120

I<00:05:43.900> could<00:05:44.200> have<00:05:44.290> got<00:05:44.380> out<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:44.830> hand<00:05:44.889> real

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
I could have got out of hand real

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.890 
I could have got out of hand real
quickly<00:05:45.340> let's<00:05:45.940> say<00:05:46.060> they<00:05:46.180> miss<00:05:46.360> play<00:05:46.660> that

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
quickly let's say they miss play that

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.960 
quickly let's say they miss play that
trial<00:05:47.410> and<00:05:47.770> they<00:05:47.950> instead<00:05:48.370> give<00:05:48.580> up<00:05:48.700> three

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
trial and they instead give up three

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.790 
trial and they instead give up three
kills<00:05:49.240> because<00:05:49.419> they<00:05:49.690> underestimate<00:05:50.440> the

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
kills because they underestimate the

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.159 
kills because they underestimate the
tankiness<00:05:51.280> of<00:05:51.430> necrophos<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:52.240> could<00:05:52.450> sort

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
tankiness of necrophos it could sort

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.330 
tankiness of necrophos it could sort
would<00:05:53.320> just<00:05:53.500> be<00:05:53.650> out<00:05:53.740> of<00:05:53.800> control<00:05:53.950> they<00:05:54.190> didn't

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
would just be out of control they didn't

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.700 
would just be out of control they didn't
really<00:05:54.520> have
