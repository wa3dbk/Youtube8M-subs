00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.700
 So always say I'm am incredibly 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.040
 with other bands is certainly nothing 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 Lastly, it's a lot of fun 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 is very very strong 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.890
 I think so around 600 of them 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.890
 World champions do everything very fast 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.570
 at that time in the early morning together 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.400
 have watered the water 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.370
 mixed with salt we have different 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.210
 temperatures at the strength of the plan 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.960
 prepared malt sugar after that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.730
 Master on the flag in the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.820
 lauter tun business is in 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.559
 Instantly the firm of the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.710
 separate liquid ingredients as with 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.270
 Full hardness to be separated when done 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.230
 just stop and we'll do it 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.600
 whole to cook 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.589
 then we need one and a half hours the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.970
 at the same time give the sacrifices to the 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.680
 cooking then the seasoning comes from grÃ¼t 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.680
 ship still clean everything 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.820
 chorisch brew times to something else 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.000
 that's mine for me 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.020
 girlfriend she had people the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.729
 actually our landscape like that 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.500
 have made this time 17 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.750
 The century has it easy for me 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 interested but 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.520
 that wanted to receive so actually the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.860
 original idea and then we have 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.890
 thought I have to do it that way 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.700
 over 300 years have been built and it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700
 is really fun 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.939
 the win for us that this at all 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.469
 we too have come to be there 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.280
 connected that is it 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.439
 build 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.700
 and who has lust, of course, noticed 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.700
 and welcome 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.229
 you see what work there then 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.690
 actually behind it then it went 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.770
 Next to that, I'm sure I will 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.090
 from now on between a bit 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.040
 more important one or the other 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.630
 still bottle up so if you have it now 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.630
 I'm still going to finish
