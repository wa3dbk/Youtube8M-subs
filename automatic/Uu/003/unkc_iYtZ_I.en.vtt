synthetic 530 oil it's not cheap

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.890 
synthetic 530 oil it's not cheap
I<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:05.490> about<00:01:05.700> 35<00:01:06.330> pounds<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.140> Halfords

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
I think about 35 pounds from Halfords

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.410 
I think about 35 pounds from Halfords
but<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:11.190> given<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.490> turbo<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
but I think given the turbo and the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
but I think given the turbo and the
various<00:01:13.350> horror<00:01:13.770> stories<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.460> probably

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
various horror stories this is probably

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
various horror stories this is probably
a<00:01:14.910> sensible<00:01:15.420> oil<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.520> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a sensible oil to use a little bit of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
a sensible oil to use a little bit of
oil<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:25.280> just<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.880> edge<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.660> seal<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
oil to just the edge of the seal on the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.490 
oil to just the edge of the seal on the
oil<00:01:32.010> filter<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.960> stops<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:38.900> sea<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.110> getting

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
oil filter that stops the sea or getting

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
oil filter that stops the sea or getting
damaged<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.220> screw<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.729> onto<00:01:41.880> the

mounting<00:01:42.990> face<00:01:44.030> okay

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.849 

I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:49.899> pretty<00:01:50.020> worthwhile<00:01:50.560> giving

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
I think it's pretty worthwhile giving

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.760 
I think it's pretty worthwhile giving
the<00:01:51.009> engine<00:01:51.700> mount<00:01:51.990> bit<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.079> a<00:01:53.170> wipe<00:01:53.380> over

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the engine mount bit of a wipe over

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.649 
the engine mount bit of a wipe over

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
because you're gonna be pushing the oil
