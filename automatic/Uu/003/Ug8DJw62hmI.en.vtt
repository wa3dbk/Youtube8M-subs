00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:13.510
 hi man in touch vladimir shamshurin 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:18.789
 today we are humans and we all decided this 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.320
 time for the weekend love me too 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.560
 it occurred to tell you about 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.230
 what movies will talk and on and 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.039
 what movies do I want to advise 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.039
 it is necessary to watch 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.520
 if of course, and here I am in principle myself 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.700
 I do not like to go sucks often replaceable 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.700
 movie 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.550
 patronymic that I never understood when 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.000
 people go chest with big currents 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.390
 cinemas recruit there even buckets 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.030
 popcorn here and looks some garbage 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.860
 like there is some kind of war of the worlds 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.200
 some kind of something else 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.540
 shooting some knights that is she 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.309
 so many films of the same type that I think 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.770
 what not but they are not interesting at all 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.720
 impossible to watch and they are no good 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.400
 I will lead the supporter of what you need 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.500
 constantly evolve before or 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.119
 accordingly, you need to watch a movie 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.090
 which push how to distinguish it 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:21.009
 motivates it makes me wonder 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.320
 I will advise just a few films if 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.410
 you looked prettier and did not watch that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.220
 it will be very cool to see which ones 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.520
 good films 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.869
 we recently revisit the movie is sick 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.869
 very cool movie about how 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.120
 Well, there is such a very good 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.400
 life story yes there and just 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.440
 some kind of plus about how a person 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.510
 sold on non-existent shares pro 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.860
 rich people some kind of people who 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.080
 achieved something achieved 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.190
 and when watching a movie it is very 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.030
 motivates also a very good movie 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.490
 reach heaven 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.020
 I think everyone knows now if you donâ€™t 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.720
 looked well, of course you must 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.100
 watch this movie i like those 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.440
 what's the plot two people they 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.240
 were sentenced to death ie they 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.420
 had a deadly disease they had to 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.280
 die literally almost and here they are 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 I like the moment they lie on 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.440
 beds and writes what they want to do 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.600
 last days what wishes from their 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.040
 the way that they've been dreaming all their lives on 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.580
 could not afford and now he has 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.560
 there is nothing to lose and here in theory you should also 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.600
 set goals also go to them 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.060
 pull as if to live tomorrow 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.220
 end and you just need huge 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.590
 steps to run in his village that is there 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.300
 the very motivating moment is still very 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.270
 good movie fight club 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.060
 I am personally very much motivate very 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.790
 many moments when they say that would 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.940
 you are not your clothes are not yours this 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.350
 external attributes is what's inside and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.520
 plus there is a great moment again by 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.250
 motivation when the main character he pulled 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.650
 I put a backyard guy from work 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.390
 feeling to the head and said that if you're in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.150
 this in two months you will not be who 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.320
 you want I'll find you and kill you 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.070
 if each of us could have such 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.230
 motivation 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.090
 apply to yourself do yourself then 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.130
 I think we would have all the style for a long time. 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.610
 features still quite good requiem movie by 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.540
 dream 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.280
 a bit tragic given from service yet 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.400
 I would advise you to watch a movie 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.950
 the butterfly effect is also very interesting 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.220
 psychological film that told 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.700
 about how to be a man's life 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.740
 differently 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.470
 what situations can be that is if 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.670
 would fate not be like her 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.510
 has developed somehow a little differently 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.510
 blues 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.420
 to this film I would advise you 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.760
 see a movie called 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.530
 American history is all pretty 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.330
 old movies but they are very cool 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.190
 american stall x is a movie pro 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.490
 skinheads then have a very serious 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.460
 such 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.600
 human season is real 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.900
 the movie makes you think makes you 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.519
 somehow start 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.739
 committed to what to do in yourself 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.060
 abandon some destructive 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:18.259
 bad habits moments sects do not know 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.259
 his occupation that destroys you
