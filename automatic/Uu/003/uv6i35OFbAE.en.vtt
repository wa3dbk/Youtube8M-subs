state with the controller it really is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
highlighted this is a good controller I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.870 
highlighted this is a good controller I
have<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:28.260> been<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.470> fan<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.800> either<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> ps2

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the ps1 or the ps3 controllers and I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.400 
the ps1 or the ps3 controllers and I
always<00:00:33.059> thought<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
always thought it was because that the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.700 
always thought it was because that the
sticks<00:00:34.800> were<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:36.000> same<00:00:36.300> latitude<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
sticks were on the same latitude and I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.900 
sticks were on the same latitude and I
realized<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.129> not<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.489> case<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> was

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
realized that's not the case it was

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.520 
realized that's not the case it was
really<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:39.300> an<00:00:39.420> issue<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.690> resistance<00:00:40.410> in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
really more an issue of resistance in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
really more an issue of resistance in
that<00:00:40.649> sense<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.070> solidity<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.120> ps4

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that sense of solidity and the ps4

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
that sense of solidity and the ps4
controller<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.230> seems<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.680> address<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
controller really seems to address that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
controller really seems to address that
far<00:00:44.820> more<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.300> than<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.719> ever

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
far more so than I would have ever

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
far more so than I would have ever
expected<00:00:46.110> um<00:00:46.739> let's<00:00:47.250> talk<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.460> some<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
expected um let's talk about some of the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.610 
expected um let's talk about some of the
buttons<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.200> would<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
buttons first you have what would be the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.290 
buttons first you have what would be the
equivalent<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> bumper<00:00:50.340> button<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.820> right

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
equivalent of a bumper button and right

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.029 
equivalent of a bumper button and right
below<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> trigger<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.620> took<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
below it it's a trigger it took me a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.619 
below it it's a trigger it took me a
second<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.550> used<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.449> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
second to get used to it because I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
second to get used to it because I
attempted<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.410> these<00:00:55.890> two<00:00:56.190> fingers

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
attempted to put these two fingers

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
attempted to put these two fingers
covering<00:00:56.940> both<00:00:57.059> buttons<00:00:57.360> realize<00:00:57.930> that's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
covering both buttons realize that's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
covering both buttons realize that's
just<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> natural<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.010> normal<00:00:59.280> way<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> play

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
just not a natural a normal way to play

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.209 
just not a natural a normal way to play
the<00:01:00.270> triggers<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.289> primary<00:01:01.710> buttons<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the triggers are the primary buttons and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
the triggers are the primary buttons and
you<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.640> gravitate<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.210> same<00:01:03.420> finger<00:01:03.719> up

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you just gravitate that same finger up

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.090 
you just gravitate that same finger up
when<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> use<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> bumpers

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
when you want to use the bumpers

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
when you want to use the bumpers
especially<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> case<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.119> Killzone<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.900> send

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
especially the case of Killzone to send

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.230 
especially the case of Killzone to send
out<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.260> owl<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> throw<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> grenade<00:01:08.580> now

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
out your owl or to throw a grenade now

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
out your owl or to throw a grenade now
the<00:01:09.299> sticks<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> big<00:01:11.070> revelation

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the sticks really are the big revelation

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
the sticks really are the big revelation
though<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.049> beautiful<00:01:13.500> sense

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
though and that's it's a beautiful sense

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010 
though and that's it's a beautiful sense
of<00:01:13.950> resistance<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> subtle<00:01:15.270> modest

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
of resistance that subtle modest

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.359 
of resistance that subtle modest
movements<00:01:16.470> seem<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.890> reading<00:01:17.250> on-screen

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
movements seem to be reading on-screen

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.060 
movements seem to be reading on-screen
and<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.570> feel<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.530> put<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and you do feel that you can just put it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.380 
and you do feel that you can just put it
all<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.670> side<00:01:20.880> without<00:01:21.060> things

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
all the way to the side without things

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.910 
all the way to the side without things
getting<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:22.110> sort<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
getting a little bit sort of out of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
getting a little bit sort of out of
whack<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.210> seems<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
whack because you just seems to want to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
whack because you just seems to want to
go<00:01:24.930> back<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> center<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> perfect

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
go back to the center with that perfect

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.630 
go back to the center with that perfect
sense<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.270> force<00:01:27.600> now<00:01:28.470> there<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> touch

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
sense of force now there is the touch

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520 
sense of force now there is the touch
pad<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> middle<00:01:30.840> I've<00:01:31.200> seen<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pad that's in the middle I've seen it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.929 
pad that's in the middle I've seen it

finger over it and that would change the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the owl in Killzone it still wasn't the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.929 
the owl in Killzone it still wasn't the
most<00:01:42.899> natural<00:01:43.350> place<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:44.340> thumb<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> want

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
most natural place for my thumb to want

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.460 
most natural place for my thumb to want
to<00:01:45.030> gravitate<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> off<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.200> stick

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
to gravitate and take it off the stick

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.560 
to gravitate and take it off the stick
especially<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.610> middle<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.909> combat<00:01:48.180> but

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
especially in the middle of combat but

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.210 
especially in the middle of combat but
that<00:01:48.720> probably<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.710> due<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> fact

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that probably is also due to the fact

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.550 
that probably is also due to the fact
that<00:01:50.399> well<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.689> new<00:01:51.960> thing<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that well it's it's a new thing and I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.810 
that well it's it's a new thing and I
have<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> sort<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> training<00:01:53.189> my<00:01:53.340> muscles<00:01:53.700> can

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
have a sort of training my muscles can

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
have a sort of training my muscles can
want<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.049> seems<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
want to do that but there seems to be a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.010 
want to do that but there seems to be a
lot<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.070> potential<00:01:56.460> use<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.420> area<00:01:57.689> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
lot of potential use in that area that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.780 
lot of potential use in that area that
is<00:01:58.409> before<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.860> time<00:01:59.040> been<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.579> just
