00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.170
 dreamlike 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.710

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.489
 safetycar alonso comes in only 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.530
 the spray out of poly what to do 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.820

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
 you do not even break off the now 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.880
 can not even slow on the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.330
 stay on track 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.310
 Trulli I did not expect her 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.900
 cancel because you monsoon rain I 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.400
 already said that would have 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.979
 actually break off colt turns 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.050
 right after they both get the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920
 do not turn 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.450
 and he has decided 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 drive in maybe not so 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.770

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.450
 city draw here that is massa can 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.950
 everyone on the brake fly out of the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.600
 you will not get that turn anymore 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.120
 aquaplaning that is not possible 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.980
 with the rain to women toya 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:52.850

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.720
