00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.340
 the constellation of the scorpion is one 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.199
 of the most beautiful of those visible in the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 summer sky right in the sky area 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.619
 which is close to the plan 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 galactic traced from the suggestive street 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 milky numerous objects are concentrated 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.109
 heavenly some of which may be 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.609
 observed even with a little 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.140
 difficulties already with the naked eye 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.990
 one of these is the star cluster 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 open called put and 6 also known 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.800
 as a mass butterfly a name that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.809
 born from the distribution of his 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 stars reminiscent of deployed wings 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.379
 precisely of a butterfly to identify 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.809
 the mass can be taken as 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.340
 shaula reference is the exact two 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.140
 stars that ideally identify the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 scorpion tail and turn up 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.340
 look at the light blue object 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 it was discovered in the mid-1600s 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.610
 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.100
 Baptist Hodierna is then classified 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 as the sixth element of the famous catalog 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.609
 of charlene monsieur it is composed of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.770
 a hundred stars extends to 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.300
 about 12 light years the one that still does not 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.799
 has been confirmed with accuracy of the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.080
 its distance whose current estimates 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
 they vary between 1,500 and 2,000 light years 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.799
 we continue now in our tour of the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.510
 heavenly vault of July to know 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.610
 constellations planets and phenomena that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.320
 will characterize this month towards the south 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.970
 dominates the scene said the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.229
 low scorpion constellation 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.000
 on the horizon 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.250
 the sagittarius flanks it to the west 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.170
 and eastward to the topmost scale 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 sky fire to the west and set 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.409
 virgin and the lion while raising it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.240
 look it's easy to spot the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.430
 constellation of bots and with the brilliant 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 arturo the berenice hair and the bear 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.000
 major around the pole star 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 towards the north the constellations rotate 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.740
 of the dragon's giraffe cepheus e 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.720
 cassiopea towards east instead only with the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.460
 pegaso lapping capricorn high 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.140
 on the horizon almost at the zenith and the three 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.820
 constellations that dominate the sky of 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.009
 these months or the swan the lira e 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.159
 the eagle their main stars 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.509
 respectively good shop and altair 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.729
 form the so-called summer triangle 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.930
 with regard to the planets we point out 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.460
 a spectacular event that takes place 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.340
 will verify the very evening of the first 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.320
 day of the month 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.179
 the very narrow conjunction of Venus 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.619
 jove the two celestial bodies will be found 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.869
 the apparent distance even 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.459
 less than the diameter of the full moon 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.110
 the event will be followed by looking for the two 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.220
 celestial bodies already in the evening 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.590
 to the west 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.260
 the couple sets after 22 30 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.000
 mercury earlier this month is quite well 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.099
 visible in the morning rising over 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.690
 an hour before the sun to the right with the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.610
 days go by the planet returns to 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 approach the sun with which it will be in 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.080
 conjunction on 23 hold during the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.360
 month sees her significantly reduce 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.390
 visibility period to get to 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.590
 be almost undetectable in late July 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.660
 Mars that looks very early in the morning 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.239
 but always close to the sun is practically 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.560
 undetectable jupiter protagonist with 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.220
 Venus of the conjunction of the first 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.630
 July 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.000
 it follows the trend at the end of the month 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.590
 it also becomes difficult to observe 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.930
 Saturn finally be forwarded 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.340
 observable when it can culminate in the south 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.140
 then still look smoothly 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.329
 although with the passing of the hours 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.709
 it will always be lower to the south west where 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.560
 finally sets over the hours 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.420
 central of the night to conclude 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.400
 we recall two interesting conjunctions 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.130
 of the moon that will occur in the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.170
 month of July the first on the 18th when on 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.910
 evening and low on the horizon yes 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.590
 will notice the thin sickle of the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.139
 our natural satellite in the vicinity 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.209
 of the couple jupiter venus the second 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.250
 on the night of 26 July with Saturn 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.680
 moon that will be full twice this 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.680
 month 2 and 31 is new on the 16th
