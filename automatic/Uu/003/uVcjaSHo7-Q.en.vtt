a<00:00:00.329> real<00:00:01.050> quick<00:00:01.410> look<00:00:01.740> at<00:00:02.010> my<00:00:02.430> new<00:00:03.120> Android

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
a real quick look at my new Android

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.170 
a real quick look at my new Android
radio<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.960> got<00:00:04.140> for<00:00:04.559> the<00:00:04.620> car<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:05.069> had<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.789> Windows

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
radio I got for the car I had a Windows

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.829 
radio I got for the car I had a Windows
radio<00:00:06.539> before<00:00:06.809> which<00:00:07.470> was<00:00:07.680> fine<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.759> I<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.330> used

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:09.839 
radio before which was fine but I I used

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.409 
radio before which was fine but I I used
so<00:00:10.049> many<00:00:10.200> Google<00:00:10.950> services<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.179> really

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:12.419 
so many Google services that it really

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.089 
so many Google services that it really
makes<00:00:12.719> sense<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.249> go<00:00:14.249> with<00:00:14.549> an<00:00:15.389> Android<00:00:15.780> based

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
makes sense to go with an Android based

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.220 
makes sense to go with an Android based
system<00:00:17.099> so<00:00:17.369> everything<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.420> native<00:00:18.810> syncs

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
system so everything is native syncs

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.460 
system so everything is native syncs
right<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.619> you'll<00:00:20.400> see<00:00:20.490> here<00:00:20.849> automatically

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
right up you'll see here automatically

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
right up you'll see here automatically
just<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> starting<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> car<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.150> it'll

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
just on the starting the car up it'll

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.380 
just on the starting the car up it'll
automatically<00:00:24.900> boot<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.769> calendar

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
automatically boot into my calendar

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.890 
automatically boot into my calendar
which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.420> very<00:00:27.839> useful<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:29.539> what<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> can

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
which is very useful because what I can

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.430 
which is very useful because what I can
do<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.259> that<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.220> have<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.600> job<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:34.020> can

tablet and your radio combined but

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.150 
tablet and your radio combined but
because<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:04.239> Android<00:03:05.230> based<00:03:05.470> if<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:05.860> use<00:03:06.129> a

because it's Android based if you use a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.009 
because it's Android based if you use a
lot<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.610> Android<00:03:07.030> services<00:03:07.599> like<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.959> do

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
lot of the Android services like I do

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.500 
lot of the Android services like I do
it's<00:03:08.440> really<00:03:08.829> really<00:03:09.220> worth<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.610> the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
it's really really worth it the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.780 
it's really really worth it the
performance<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:12.010> know<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.250> Windows<00:03:12.549> Phone

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
performance you know the Windows Phone

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.660 
performance you know the Windows Phone
it<00:03:13.000> wasn't<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.390> bad<00:03:13.569> actually<00:03:14.670> considering

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
it wasn't that bad actually considering

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.879 
it wasn't that bad actually considering
its<00:03:15.849> age<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.450> performance<00:03:17.110> was<00:03:17.290> was<00:03:17.680> pretty

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
its age the performance was was pretty

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.430 
its age the performance was was pretty
decent<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:19.269> really<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.870> integration

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
decent it's really just the integration

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.580 
decent it's really just the integration
of<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.430> Android<00:03:21.790> content<00:03:22.359> being<00:03:23.049> able<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.380> run

the<00:03:30.730> phone<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.290> makes<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.680> lot<00:03:32.829> more

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
the phone it just makes it a lot more

built-in<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.020> slow<00:04:29.199> with<00:04:29.379> the<00:04:29.470> exception<00:04:29.919> of

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
built-in to slow with the exception of

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.189 
built-in to slow with the exception of
the<00:04:30.220> clock<00:04:30.819> for<00:04:31.120> some<00:04:31.330> reason<00:04:31.659> so<00:04:31.840> there's<00:04:32.050> the

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
the clock for some reason so there's the

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.640 
the clock for some reason so there's the
real<00:04:32.379> time<00:04:32.680> if<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.759> car<00:04:33.969> clock<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.449> off<00:04:34.810> I

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
real time if the car clock is off I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.350 
real time if the car clock is off I
haven't<00:04:36.219> had<00:04:36.310> time<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.669> look<00:04:36.759> into<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.180> it's

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
haven't had time to look into that it's

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.839 
haven't had time to look into that it's
a<00:04:37.479> minor<00:04:37.689> thing<00:04:37.990> but<00:04:38.919> all<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.460> other<00:04:39.610> features

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
a minor thing but all the other features

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.890 
a minor thing but all the other features
seem<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.449> work<00:04:40.629> it<00:04:40.810> sounds<00:04:41.110> great<00:04:41.319> play<00:04:41.879> music

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
seem to work it sounds great play music

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.270 
seem to work it sounds great play music
that<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:44.469> doesn't<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:44.949> full-blown

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
that it doesn't have a full-blown

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.760 
that it doesn't have a full-blown
equalizer<00:04:45.969> but<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.419> has<00:04:46.539> enough<00:04:47.110> control<00:04:47.530> did

you<00:04:48.580> know<00:04:48.699> you<00:04:48.759> can<00:04:48.909> probably<00:04:49.030> get<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.330> pretty

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
you know you can probably get it pretty

you know you can probably get it pretty
