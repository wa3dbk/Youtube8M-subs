on<00:00:08.780> a<00:00:09.910> tutorial<00:00:10.910> on<00:00:11.210> how<00:00:11.269> to<00:00:11.450> create<00:00:11.599> the

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
on a tutorial on how to create the

on a tutorial on how to create the
plasma<00:00:12.650> rifle<00:00:13.009> from<00:00:13.549> LA<00:00:13.820> halo<00:00:14.620> the<00:00:15.620> laser

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
plasma rifle from LA halo the laser

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.400 
plasma rifle from LA halo the laser
effect<00:00:16.280> now<00:00:17.470> because<00:00:18.470> it<00:00:18.619> is<00:00:18.740> not<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:18.950> UNSC<00:00:19.880> or

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
effect now because it is not a UNSC or

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.599 
effect now because it is not a UNSC or
gun<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:21.769> know<00:00:21.949> it<00:00:22.189> does<00:00:22.310> not<00:00:22.429> have<00:00:22.550> a

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
gun that we know it does not have a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.310 
gun that we know it does not have a
muzzle<00:00:22.939> flash<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:23.300> has<00:00:23.449> its<00:00:23.630> own<00:00:23.779> lasered

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
muzzle flash it has its own lasered

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.570 
muzzle flash it has its own lasered
effects<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:25.699> this<00:00:26.150> will<00:00:26.359> be<00:00:26.480> shown<00:00:26.750> via<00:00:27.619> this

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
effects so this will be shown via this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.040 
effects so this will be shown via this
picture<00:00:28.970> that<00:00:29.089> I<00:00:29.119> found<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:29.630> just<00:00:29.839> stripped

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
picture that I found and just stripped

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.409 
picture that I found and just stripped
of<00:00:30.230> its<00:00:30.349> background<00:00:30.589> image<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:31.640> will<00:00:32.000> go

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
of its background image and I will go

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.030 
of its background image and I will go
through<00:00:32.599> a<00:00:32.660> tutorial<00:00:32.960> guide<00:00:33.260> on<00:00:33.470> how<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.650> do

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
through a tutorial guide on how to do

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.490 
through a tutorial guide on how to do
this<00:00:34.130> now<00:00:34.700> most<00:00:34.970> of<00:00:35.090> you<00:00:35.270> noticed<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:36.320> my

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
this now most of you noticed it in my

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.700 
this now most of you noticed it in my
video<00:00:36.860> here<00:00:37.340> where<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.239> tested<00:00:39.200> it<00:00:39.289> for<00:00:39.500> my

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
video here where I tested it for my

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.959 
video here where I tested it for my
bleep<00:00:40.520> plasma<00:00:40.879> rifle<00:00:41.149> that<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.300> built<00:00:42.550> this<00:00:43.550> and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
bleep plasma rifle that I built this and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.450 
bleep plasma rifle that I built this and
you<00:00:44.750> asked<00:00:45.140> how<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.289> do<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.949> I<00:00:46.010> told<00:00:46.219> you

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
you asked how to do this and I told you

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.410 
you asked how to do this and I told you
but<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:48.559> make<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.770> tutorial<00:00:51.969> so<00:00:52.969> as<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:53.120> can<00:00:53.239> see

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
but to make a tutorial so as you can see

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.720 
but to make a tutorial so as you can see
it<00:00:53.539> looks<00:00:53.719> pretty<00:00:53.870> effective<00:00:54.410> but<00:00:55.219> it's<00:00:55.579> a

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
it looks pretty effective but it's a

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.490 
it looks pretty effective but it's a
very<00:00:55.760> simple<00:00:56.300> technique<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.199> let's<00:00:57.379> get

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
very simple technique so let's get

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.740 
very simple technique so let's get
straight<00:00:57.680> into<00:00:57.800> it<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.579> all<00:00:58.789> here<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.329> the

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
straight into it so all here is the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.849 
straight into it so all here is the
picture<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.199> i<00:01:00.379> found<00:01:00.620> on<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.800> internet

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
picture that i found on the internet

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.069 
picture that i found on the internet
like<00:01:01.670> i<00:01:01.730> said<00:01:01.969> strip<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.420> background<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:02.960> I

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
like i said strip the background and I

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.530 
like i said strip the background and I
just<00:01:03.260> have<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.410> black<00:01:03.730> solid<00:01:04.730> behind<00:01:05.059> as<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
just have a black solid behind as a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.539 
just have a black solid behind as a
composition<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.470> course<00:01:06.950> yours<00:01:07.220> will<00:01:07.400> be<00:01:07.430> a

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
composition of course yours will be a

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.030 
composition of course yours will be a
film<00:01:07.850> but<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.080> just<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.320> basic<00:01:09.500> tutorial

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
film but this is just a basic tutorial

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.429 
film but this is just a basic tutorial
so<00:01:10.580> we're<00:01:10.670> going<00:01:10.759> to<00:01:10.850> go<00:01:10.909> quickly<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:12.170> create

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
so we're going to go quickly and create

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.560 
so we're going to go quickly and create
a<00:01:12.500> new<00:01:12.530> solid<00:01:12.920> make<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> white<00:01:13.939> solid<00:01:16.570> now

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
a new solid make it a white solid now

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.590 
a new solid make it a white solid now
the<00:01:17.630> lasers<00:01:18.080> coming<00:01:18.470> out<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.979> gun<00:01:19.909> are<00:01:20.180> an

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
the lasers coming out of the gun are an

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.660 
the lasers coming out of the gun are an
ellipse<00:01:21.259> circle<00:01:21.740> oval<00:01:22.009> tool<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.520> we're<00:01:22.640> just

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
ellipse circle oval tool so we're just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.580 
ellipse circle oval tool so we're just
going<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.000> go<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.240> create<00:01:23.450> an<00:01:23.659> oval<00:01:24.020> roughly

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
going to go and create an oval roughly

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.700 
going to go and create an oval roughly
the<00:01:24.740> same<00:01:25.310> size<00:01:25.369> as<00:01:25.939> what<00:01:26.090> laser<00:01:26.329> should<00:01:26.600> be<00:01:26.750> so

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
the same size as what laser should be so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.830 
the same size as what laser should be so
about<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.890> just<00:01:31.100> position<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.840> so

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
about that so just position that in so

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.569 
about that so just position that in so
there<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.020> go<00:01:33.049> got<00:01:33.320> our<00:01:33.439> white<00:01:33.649> sword<00:01:34.040> now

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
there we go got our white sword now

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.520 
there we go got our white sword now
we're<00:01:34.790> going<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.000> go<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.420> create<00:01:35.780> an<00:01:36.140> effect

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
we're going to go and create an effect

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.100 
we're going to go and create an effect
so<00:01:37.070> going<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.310> affect<00:01:37.729> trapcode<00:01:38.329> shine<00:01:38.840> I

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
so going to affect trapcode shine I

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.139 
so going to affect trapcode shine I
repeat<00:01:39.670> effect<00:01:41.049> trapcode<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:42.350> shine<00:01:45.009> now<00:01:46.149> i'm

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
repeat effect trapcode and shine now i'm

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.649 
repeat effect trapcode and shine now i'm
pretty<00:01:47.780> sure<00:01:48.020> shine<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.649> a<00:01:49.540> standard<00:01:50.540> thing

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
pretty sure shine is a standard thing

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.469 
pretty sure shine is a standard thing
that<00:01:50.840> comes<00:01:51.049> with<00:01:51.290> after<00:01:52.159> effects<00:01:52.399> or<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:53.329> may

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
that comes with after effects or it may

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.109 
that comes with after effects or it may
be<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.689> plugin<00:01:54.110> i<00:01:54.229> am<00:01:54.439> not<00:01:54.619> sure<00:01:54.909> otherwise<00:01:55.909> you

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
be a plugin i am not sure otherwise you

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.770 
be a plugin i am not sure otherwise you
could<00:01:56.299> just<00:01:56.540> go<00:01:56.659> affect<00:01:57.939> glow<00:01:58.939> or<00:01:59.420> something

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
could just go affect glow or something

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.380 
could just go affect glow or something
like<00:01:59.869> that<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.770> we're<00:02:01.009> going<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.250> go<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.399> the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
like that so we're going to go to the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.130 
like that so we're going to go to the
properties<00:02:02.630> go<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.110> Shia<00:02:03.710> color<00:02:04.369> eyes<00:02:04.610> and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
properties go to Shia color eyes and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.300 
properties go to Shia color eyes and
change<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.320> from<00:02:06.439> Reds<00:02:06.829> which<00:02:07.100> are<00:02:07.219> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
change it from Reds which are the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.210 
change it from Reds which are the

is<00:02:11.120> effect<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.970> that's<00:02:14.150> me<00:02:14.330> about<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.600> lightish

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
is effect so that's me about a lightish

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.860 
is effect so that's me about a lightish
blue<00:02:15.410> color<00:02:15.770> like<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.100> now<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.390> stands<00:02:17.720> out

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
blue color like that now that stands out

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.710 
blue color like that now that stands out
is<00:02:17.990> quite<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.760> sharp<00:02:19.760> color<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.330> we're<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.569> to

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
is quite a sharp color so we're going to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.830 
is quite a sharp color so we're going to
go<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:24.190> dim<00:02:25.190> blur<00:02:25.610> going<00:02:26.060> down<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.420> affect

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
go in a dim blur going down to affect

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.320 
go in a dim blur going down to affect
blur<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.590> sharpen<00:02:28.100> scroll<00:02:28.760> down<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.060> fast

blur and sharpen scroll down to fast

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.600 
blur and sharpen scroll down to fast
blur<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.870> we'll<00:02:30.650> check<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:30.950> up<00:02:31.220> two<00:02:31.400> out<00:02:31.580> of

five<00:02:34.300> four<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.390> render<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.930> there<00:02:36.319> we<00:02:36.380> go<00:02:36.500> a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
five four to render and there we go a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.050 
five four to render and there we go a
blurry<00:02:37.069> image<00:02:37.840> now<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:40.040> are<00:02:40.100> going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.400> find

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
blurry image now we are going to find

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.960 
blurry image now we are going to find
the<00:02:41.420> location<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:41.989> when<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:43.340> recoil<00:02:43.550> is

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
the location of when the recoil is

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.479 
the location of when the recoil is
needed<00:02:44.269> for<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> shot<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.950> scroll<00:02:46.459> up

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
needed for the shot so just scroll up

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.060 
needed for the shot so just scroll up
here<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:49.340> go<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.209> can<00:02:50.300> see<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.769> gun<00:02:51.769> tilts

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
here we go as you can see the gun tilts

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.800 
here we go as you can see the gun tilts
up<00:02:52.190> as<00:02:52.400> if<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.850> was<00:02:52.940> being<00:02:53.239> shot<00:02:53.480> with<00:02:53.720> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
up as if it was being shot with the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.780 
up as if it was being shot with the
recall<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:54.260> we're<00:02:54.380> going<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.620> ctrl<00:02:55.220> shift<00:02:55.250> be

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
recall so we're going to ctrl shift be

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.850 
recall so we're going to ctrl shift be
the<00:02:55.940> top<00:02:56.150> layer<00:02:56.360> which<00:02:56.930> will<00:02:57.140> separate<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
the top layer which will separate the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.680 
the top layer which will separate the
solid<00:02:58.400> layer<00:02:58.550> so<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.760> can<00:02:58.940> delete<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.390> past

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
solid layer so I can delete the past

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.759 
solid layer so I can delete the past
which<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.200> do<00:03:00.260> not<00:03:00.380> need<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.670> now<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.000> starts

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
which I do not need so now it starts

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.420 
which I do not need so now it starts
when<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:03.800> ctrl<00:03:04.430> shift<00:03:04.459> D<00:03:05.150> data<00:03:06.080> item<00:03:06.440> now<00:03:07.130> we're

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
when I ctrl shift D data item now we're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.100 
when I ctrl shift D data item now we're
just<00:03:07.459> going<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.790> set<00:03:07.970> some<00:03:08.269> simple<00:03:08.660> position

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
just going to set some simple position

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.280 
just going to set some simple position
keyframes<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:10.610> allow<00:03:10.850> us<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.209> move<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.720> object

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
keyframes to allow us to move the object

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.150 
keyframes to allow us to move the object
and<00:03:12.850> roughly<00:03:13.850> about<00:03:13.940> three<00:03:14.680> key<00:03:15.680> frames<00:03:15.920> up

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
and roughly about three key frames up

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.270 
and roughly about three key frames up
just<00:03:16.880> pressing<00:03:17.180> page<00:03:17.390> down<00:03:17.690> three<00:03:18.049> times

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
just pressing page down three times

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.569 
just pressing page down three times
allow<00:03:19.280> us<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:20.320> jump<00:03:21.320> forward<00:03:21.650> three<00:03:22.400> key

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
allow us to jump forward three key

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.520 
allow us to jump forward three key
frames<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.090> move<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:23.450> off<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.570> screen<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.410> now

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
frames and move it off the screen so now

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.120 
frames and move it off the screen so now
we<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.739> test<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:26.709> there<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.829> go<00:03:29.950> now<00:03:30.950> let's

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
we can test that there you go now let's

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.039 
we can test that there you go now let's
maybe<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.459> bit<00:03:31.700> too<00:03:31.730> slow<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.390> will<00:03:32.510> speed<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.840> up

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
maybe a bit too slow so will speed it up

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.009 
maybe a bit too slow so will speed it up
maybe<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.980> two<00:03:34.130> keyframes<00:03:34.390> there<00:03:35.390> we<00:03:35.480> go<00:03:38.019> now

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
maybe to two keyframes there we go now

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.199 
maybe to two keyframes there we go now
of<00:03:39.560> course<00:03:39.769> this<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> laser<00:03:40.579> so<00:03:40.850> there<00:03:41.060> will

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
of course this is a laser so there will

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.120 
of course this is a laser so there will
be<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.390> muzzle<00:03:41.780> flash<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.140> some<00:03:42.350> sort<00:03:42.650> but<00:03:42.829> they

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
be a muzzle flash of some sort but they

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.000 
be a muzzle flash of some sort but they
use<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.609> glow<00:03:44.239> lens<00:03:44.780> flare<00:03:45.109> so<00:03:45.650> I'm<00:03:45.709> going<00:03:45.859> to<00:03:45.890> go

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
use a glow lens flare so I'm going to go

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.599 
use a glow lens flare so I'm going to go

by<00:04:01.970> default<00:04:02.030> it's<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.630> red<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.410> we're<00:04:03.500> going<00:04:03.590> to

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
by default it's a red so we're going to

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.970 
by default it's a red so we're going to
go<00:04:03.739> here<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.329> select<00:04:05.329> it<00:04:05.570> as<00:04:06.280> lens<00:04:07.280> type<00:04:08.980> 105

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
go here and select it as lens type 105

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.640 
go here and select it as lens type 105
prime<00:04:10.970> which<00:04:11.239> is<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.420> blue<00:04:11.660> car<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.410> we'll<00:04:12.530> just

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
prime which is a blue car and we'll just

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.360 
prime which is a blue car and we'll just
turn<00:04:12.769> down<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.130> brightness<00:04:13.220> just<00:04:13.670> attack

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
turn down the brightness just attack

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.410 
turn down the brightness just attack
there<00:04:16.370> we<00:04:16.430> go

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
there we go

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.700 
there we go
now<00:04:18.080> of<00:04:18.350> course<00:04:18.730> that's<00:04:19.730> going<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.120> be<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.210> nice

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:20.710 
now of course that's going to be a nice

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.990 
now of course that's going to be a nice
bluey<00:04:22.030> color<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.330> we<00:04:23.480> just<00:04:23.630> went<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.870> put

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
bluey color and we just went to put

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.330 
bluey color and we just went to put
might<00:04:26.000> think<00:04:26.390> back<00:04:26.570> of<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:28.040> that's<00:04:28.100> what

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
might think back of it so that's what

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.710 
might think back of it so that's what
should<00:04:28.520> look<00:04:28.640> like<00:04:28.670> when<00:04:28.850> it's<00:04:29.120> exiting<00:04:29.570> the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
should look like when it's exiting the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.660 
should look like when it's exiting the
gun<00:04:29.900> now<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.350> course<00:04:30.530> we<00:04:30.710> don't<00:04:31.220> need<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.490> lens

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
gun now of course we don't need the lens

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.670 
gun now of course we don't need the lens
flare<00:04:31.940> back<00:04:32.120> here<00:04:32.390> because<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.900> bullet

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
flare back here because the bullet

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.050 
flare back here because the bullet
blazer<00:04:34.010> hasn't<00:04:34.310> been<00:04:34.400> shot<00:04:34.580> yet<00:04:34.700> so<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:34.940> can

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
blazer hasn't been shot yet so you can

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.360 
blazer hasn't been shot yet so you can
just<00:04:35.090> control<00:04:35.480> chefs<00:04:35.900> d<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.800> destroy<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
just control chefs d and destroy the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.430 
just control chefs d and destroy the
rest<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.640> that<00:04:37.670> so<00:04:38.540> now<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:38.780> only<00:04:38.900> appears<00:04:39.290> when

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
rest of that so now it only appears when

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.760 
rest of that so now it only appears when
it<00:04:39.590> does<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.960> even<00:04:41.960> soup<00:04:42.140> it<00:04:42.230> there<00:04:42.380> for<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.590> bit

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
it does and even soup it there for a bit

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.750 
it does and even soup it there for a bit
more<00:04:43.480> so<00:04:44.480> now<00:04:44.630> if<00:04:44.720> we<00:04:44.780> watch<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.670> there<00:04:46.670> you

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
more so now if we watch that there you

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.970 
more so now if we watch that there you
go<00:04:46.880> an<00:04:47.750> ice<00:04:48.580> laser<00:04:49.580> effect<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.840> now<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:51.770> can

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
go an ice laser effect and now you can

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.080 
go an ice laser effect and now you can
simply<00:04:52.220> just<00:04:52.960> ctrl<00:04:53.960> shift<00:04:53.990> D<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.790> sort<00:04:56.030> of

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
simply just ctrl shift D that sort of

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.060 
simply just ctrl shift D that sort of
control<00:04:56.450> D<00:04:56.660> which<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.080> controlled<00:04:57.380> duplicate

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
control D which is controlled duplicate

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.240 
control D which is controlled duplicate
and<00:04:58.280> go<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.570> next<00:04:59.900> frame<00:05:00.590> where<00:05:00.890> he<00:05:00.980> ships

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
and go to the next frame where he ships

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:11.740 
and go to the next frame where he ships
which<00:05:01.610> is<00:05:01.880> here<00:05:03.580> move<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.790> bar<00:05:04.970> up

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.950 

and<00:05:12.080> do<00:05:12.520> just<00:05:13.520> copying<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.120> pasting<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.720> lens

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
and do just copying and pasting the lens

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.350 
and do just copying and pasting the lens
flare<00:05:15.230> as<00:05:15.380> well

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.119 

then<00:05:20.900> split<00:05:21.289> up<00:05:22.569> and<00:05:23.569> now<00:05:23.780> if<00:05:24.110> we<00:05:24.349> just<00:05:24.830> watch

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:25.129 
then split up and now if we just watch

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:31.629 
then split up and now if we just watch
the<00:05:25.430> video<00:05:27.610> no<00:05:28.610> loop<00:05:28.879> just<00:05:30.340> let<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.460> render

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
the video no loop just let it render

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.679 
the video no loop just let it render
first<00:05:33.280> there<00:05:34.280> you<00:05:34.370> go<00:05:34.490> get<00:05:35.150> an<00:05:35.270> ice<00:05:35.389> laser

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
first there you go get an ice laser

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.249 
first there you go get an ice laser
effect<00:05:36.139> as<00:05:36.349> if<00:05:36.409> it's<00:05:36.710> coming<00:05:36.800> from<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.430> gun<00:05:38.259> so

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
effect as if it's coming from the gun so

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.399 
effect as if it's coming from the gun so
