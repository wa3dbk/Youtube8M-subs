00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 girls today's theme is super special 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.899
 in something that you die of doubt 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.550
 party dresses and to talk to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.980
 you and me too 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.570
 the guest is the letícia brom leaves the name 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.230
 of party dresses when the subject is 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.230
 stay cat 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.250
 You will start paying you like 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.620
 with so the more girls conduct 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.050
 the main wedding year party 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.760
 ballad culture that you stop using then 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.680
 we are often invited 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.500
 stay here, what I'm going to do is a wedding and 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 night does not suit currently not 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.190
 more fragile in an invitation to 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.540
 Just married then count bleck time 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.210
 much more for men 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.920
 so let's start with the long dress 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.600
 which is the most chic of all I think 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.280
 depends a lot on the situation 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.690
 if you are godmother for example you 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.710
 could never wear a satin dress 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.050
 black 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.579
 just so that dress for example it 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.420
 You were invited to a black party. 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.880
 tie 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.010
 Do you want to make a mega copy of a jewel? 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.780
 You 're all super from this dress. 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.240
 had a lighter color it could 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.100
 be obtained by a beach wedding and 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.750
 Then you put on a more colorful earring. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.479
 perhaps a biblical scholar with the big hair 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.160
 sandal more open but in relation to 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.740
 neckline which is a doubt that 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.710
 everybody asks godmother can too 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.820
 People abuse is beautiful so it's more chic 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 what have you done? 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.770
 It's daytime wedding I think it's the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.140
 what I want is that every woman who 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.090
 likes fashion and it's also a party 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.650
 case the same day we are not a bug 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.979
 seven heads I even choose this one 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.790
 because one of the big doubts is 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.830
 can shine in the daytime wedding can but 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.920
 It has to be a discreet glow here for 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.899
 An example of a pearl is a pair of 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.320
 everything else does not have that thing of 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.940
 crystal that I really wear look on 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.210
 day wedding i think colors 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.020
 strong fit long dresses only was 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.240
 also or well-embossed things 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.310
 so and I do not think I carry too much 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.519
 in the hair I think the wedding day 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.950
 with a coke mega master and such sometimes 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.950
 looks like castanhal 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.600
 It's the question after all when you as a 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.850
 incredible destination a party can use 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.500
 again in another you can repeat you can use 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.700
 in another environment, how is this 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.790
 story 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.760
 So can we just have some good news on the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.500
 country and is the pocket in the pocket 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.590
 nowadays people have a ballad 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.930
 each time with more sophisticated dresses 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.520
 with shine so I chose this dress 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.250
 as an example that it is a dress that I 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.020
 I think it's fine this case is a dress if 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.180
 you are a wedding with him want a 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.880
 Coke put a super time the joyce 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.800
 most beloved and most incredible people 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.050
 marriage and if you were to use this 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.030
 even dressed for a ballad to 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.400
 something like that I would use him 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.680
 loose hair a nice babyliss 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.780
 black olhão and maybe a smaller earring 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.610
 It does not have to be a jewel, it's not just in the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.680
 It is true to change accessories but 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.630
 Nice to know that with a short dress 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.250
 which is amazingly sophisticated for the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.440
 wedding with the exchange of accessories 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.300
 Sure, he's going to party, he's going to 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.300
 birthday in your pocket the head 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.230
 a great tip so work and look at yourself 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.250
 in the mirror, I'm going to the party that has to 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.700
 pass on the head 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.620
 good sense people and please look at 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.180
 mirror speaks if you were looking at another 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.580
 person dressed like this I think 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.190
 Cool, I think it's the best. 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.450
 tip of the world I can not think of a 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.650
 another person 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.520
 the reason people are connected and look at many 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.520
 parties for you
