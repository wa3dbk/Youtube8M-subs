minutes<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.640> yeah<00:01:20.640> before<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> event

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.380 
reflection I mean look a wipe someone
did<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.829> impact<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> whole<00:01:39.000> point<00:01:39.180> at

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
did to impact in the whole point at

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.560 
did to impact in the whole point at
least<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.280> any<00:01:42.150> team<00:01:42.420> would

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
least so I think I think any team would

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.149 
least so I think I think any team would
definitely<00:01:42.869> ratings<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.259> awful<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.770> me<00:01:43.799> do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
definitely ratings it's awful for me do

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.410 
definitely ratings it's awful for me do

watching Americans to help you know do
you<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> dab<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.390> place<00:01:51.689> L<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
you kind of a dab your place L or do you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.319 
you kind of a dab your place L or do you
just<00:01:52.320> play<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:53.130> example<00:01:53.430> prophecy<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
just play for example prophecy and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060 
just play for example prophecy and
epsilon<00:01:54.720> II<00:01:54.750> went<00:01:54.960> MLG<00:01:55.350> play<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.920> try

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
epsilon II went MLG play them and try

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.340 
epsilon II went MLG play them and try
and<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.490> learn<00:01:56.790> from<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:58.290> we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and you learn from there I think we

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.569 
and you learn from there I think we
really<00:01:58.560> trying<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> take<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:58.979> from<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
really trying to take it from like the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.340 
really trying to take it from like the
core<00:01:59.790> which<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.240> Americans<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.930> think

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
core which is like the Americans I think

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.480 
core which is like the Americans I think
