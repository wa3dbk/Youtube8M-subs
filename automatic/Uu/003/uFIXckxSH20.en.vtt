00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
what you can create here but what I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.860 
what you can create here but what I
would<00:02:22.370> recommend<00:02:22.459> is<00:02:22.970> when<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.300> are<00:02:23.450> juicing

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
would recommend is when you are juicing

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.240 
would recommend is when you are juicing
some<00:02:24.110> sort<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.380> bitter<00:02:24.530> greens<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:25.100> your

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
scales or your collard greens then you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190 
scales or your collard greens then you
want<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.610> add<00:02:28.790> maybe<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.300> little<00:02:29.480> sweetness<00:02:30.050> to

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200

that<00:02:30.410> as<00:02:30.620> well<00:02:30.920> or<00:02:31.220> tartness<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:32.209> that's<00:02:32.390> where

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
that as well or tartness so that's where

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.449 
that as well or tartness so that's where
maybe<00:02:33.200> your<00:02:33.380> carrots<00:02:33.740> come<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.070> or<00:02:34.310> your

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
but that's always a nice little kind of

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.370 
but that's always a nice little kind of
rule<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> thumb<00:02:43.459> now<00:02:44.000> when<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.540> juice<00:02:44.870> just

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
rule of thumb now when you juice just

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.350 
rule of thumb now when you juice just
keep<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.739> mind<00:02:45.770> it's<00:02:46.340> not<00:02:46.489> like<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.940> juices

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
keep in mind it's not like the juices

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.449 
keep in mind it's not like the juices
that<00:02:47.390> you're<00:02:47.630> buying<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.350> your<00:02:48.739> supermarket

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
that you're buying in your supermarket

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.160 
that you're buying in your supermarket
which<00:02:49.670> are<00:02:49.880> gonna<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.239> pasteurized<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.080> when

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
which are gonna be pasteurized and when

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.150 
which are gonna be pasteurized and when
I<00:02:51.230> say<00:02:51.380> pasteurized

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
I say pasteurized

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.030 
I say pasteurized
you're<00:02:52.520> talking<00:02:52.970> about<00:02:53.560> heating<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:54.800> and

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
you're talking about heating it up and

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.100 
you're talking about heating it up and
pretty<00:02:55.730> much<00:02:55.880> destroying<00:02:56.300> all<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.600> active

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
pretty much destroying all the active

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.430 
pretty much destroying all the active
enzymes<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.820> bottle<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.019> you're

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
enzymes in that in that bottle so you're

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.900 
enzymes in that in that bottle so you're
not<00:03:00.560> really<00:03:00.769> getting<00:03:00.920> any<00:03:01.190> health<00:03:01.430> benefits

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
not really getting any health benefits

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.440 
not really getting any health benefits
from<00:03:02.150> that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
from that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.320 
from that
so<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.900> recommend<00:03:03.470> go<00:03:04.160> ahead<00:03:04.459> get<00:03:05.060> your<00:03:05.209> own

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
so I recommend go ahead get your own

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.020 
so I recommend go ahead get your own
