00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.000
 wow 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.860
 what was this thing a hologram the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.660
 friends and if you too want to 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.610
 to learn to make it home nothing 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.680
 simpler with four pieces of 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.630
 plastic more exactly leaves 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.340
 acetate is a little bit more 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.779
 material you will see that in a few 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.850
 steps you will be able to design a 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.220
 hologram for your mobile for your 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.900
 tablet reports in any case it will do 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.300
 effect it will not leave indifferent your 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 friends to do our grain market 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.140
 we will need the following equipment 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:49.129
 of a ruler of a scissors pen of a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.200
 notepad pad of a scotch smartphone and 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.579
 of stats sheet ie of 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.579
 transparent plastic sheets 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:05.869
 let's start by drawing a trapeze with 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:07.880
 the dimensions displayed on the screen a 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.500
 Once completed, we check the dimensions 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.500
 and cut the figure with scissors 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:27.230
 we put the trapeze of paper on 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:28.790
 acetate and we mark the contours on 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.110
 only has to cut the sheet of 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.110
 stats by following the path 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.880
 we will reuse this trapeze for 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.710
 cut out the other three that are assembled 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.710
 with tiny pieces of scotch 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.240
 think about leaving a square opening to 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.240
 the bass 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.060
 to finish look for a special video 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.210
 hologram in description are you in 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.640
 leave an example put the video in 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.030
 full screen mode and place the figure at 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.030
 center 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.640
 let's see now the rendering is everything 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.640
 simply magical 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319
 no 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.569
 no 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 Oh
