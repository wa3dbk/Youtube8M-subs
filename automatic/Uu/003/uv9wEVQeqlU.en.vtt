00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
people don't even care about quality

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749

that<00:01:37.530> much<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.700> about

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that much it was kind of more just about

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
that much it was kind of more just about
gameplay<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.810> commentary<00:01:40.290> itself<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
gameplay in the commentary itself you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
gameplay in the commentary itself you
know<00:01:41.009> yeah<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.270> quality<00:01:42.600> wasn't<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
know yeah the quality wasn't the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.210 
know yeah the quality wasn't the
greatest<00:01:43.049> back<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> day<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
greatest back in the day and you know I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.910 
greatest back in the day and you know I
kind<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.520> feel<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.740> don't<00:01:46.740> know

kind of feel like you know I don't know

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.649 
kind of feel like you know I don't know
it<00:01:47.009> wasn't<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> big<00:01:47.700> deal<00:01:47.909> people<00:01:48.479> didn't

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
it wasn't just a big deal people didn't

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.120 
it wasn't just a big deal people didn't
seem<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> care<00:01:48.899> about<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> too<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

area i'm using a hard line i'm not sure

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.540 
area i'm using a hard line i'm not sure
why<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.140> was<00:04:53.530> i<00:04:53.680> probably<00:04:54.070> could<00:04:54.340> have<00:04:54.370> been

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
why that was i probably could have been

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.550 
why that was i probably could have been

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
something like that and I know why you

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.420 
something like that and I know why you
tired<00:05:05.110> line<00:05:05.350> there's<00:05:05.650> no<00:05:05.740> need<00:05:05.919> for<00:05:05.950> stopping

power<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:07.000> probably<00:05:07.480> should<00:05:07.660> have<00:05:07.870> used<00:05:07.930> either

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230

cold-blooded or lightweight lightweight
the<00:05:10.300> only<00:05:10.510> reason<00:05:10.780> I'd<00:05:10.930> say<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:11.320> was<00:05:11.470> just

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
the only reason I'd say that was just

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.140 
the only reason I'd say that was just
like<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.950> run<00:05:12.100> around<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.460> bit<00:05:12.610> faster<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.120> I

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
like to run around a bit faster so I

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.900 
like to run around a bit faster so I
could<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.960> know<00:05:13.990> reach<00:05:14.350> people<00:05:14.740> quicker<00:05:14.950> but

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
could you know reach people quicker but

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.090 
could you know reach people quicker but
I<00:05:15.970> did<00:05:16.510> have<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.810> trustee<00:05:17.140> commando<00:05:17.560> /<00:05:17.740> back

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
I did have the trustee commando / back

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.370 
I did have the trustee commando / back
