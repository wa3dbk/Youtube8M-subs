00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
it actually to be honest seemed kind of

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.250 
it actually to be honest seemed kind of
silly<00:04:20.970> when<00:04:21.120> we<00:04:21.330> started<00:04:21.750> but<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:24.020> think<00:04:25.020> we

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
silly when we started but I think we

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.680 
silly when we started but I think we
wrecked<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.680> lot<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.920> it<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.760> felt<00:04:27.210> very

wrecked a lot of it and it felt very
good<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:32.000> didn't<00:04:33.000> expect<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.630> actually<00:04:36.770> think

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
good I I didn't expect to actually think

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.460 
good I I didn't expect to actually think
that<00:04:37.980> it<00:04:38.100> would<00:04:38.190> have<00:04:38.400> any<00:04:38.580> impact<00:04:38.760> but<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.480> it

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
that it would have any impact but it it

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.940 
that it would have any impact but it it
felt<00:04:40.710> really<00:04:40.890> good<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.190> be<00:04:41.430> able<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.790> do<00:04:41.940> that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
neat too like first I thought maybe he

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.900 
neat too like first I thought maybe he
was<00:04:48.690> just<00:04:49.020> doing<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.980> because<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:52.730> took<00:04:53.730> him

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.740 
was just doing it because I took him
there<00:04:54.090> but<00:04:54.780> he<00:04:55.200> started<00:04:55.710> actually<00:04:56.270> it<00:04:57.270> sounded

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
there but he started actually it sounded

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.210 
there but he started actually it sounded
like<00:04:57.780> he<00:04:58.020> was<00:04:58.170> doing<00:04:58.350> things<00:04:58.650> even<00:04:58.860> when<00:04:59.190> I

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
like he was doing things even when I

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.630 
like he was doing things even when I
wasn't<00:04:59.640> leading<00:05:00.680> it's<00:05:01.680> interesting<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.460> he

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
wasn't leading it's interesting that he

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.250 
wasn't leading it's interesting that he
