PEGI 18 when you think about bioshock

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.340 
PEGI 18 when you think about bioshock
infinite's<00:00:17.380> characters<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:19.150> in<00:00:20.150> embark<00:00:20.840> one<00:00:21.080> in

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
infinite's characters I in embark one in

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.630 
infinite's characters I in embark one in
the<00:00:21.439> biggest<00:00:21.800> character<00:00:22.130> in<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:22.250> world<00:00:22.460> was

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
the biggest character in the world was

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.800 
the biggest character in the world was
actually<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.060> world<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:23.600> world<00:00:23.689> of

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
actually the world of the world of

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.720 
actually the world of the world of
rapture<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:24.350> I<00:00:24.410> think<00:00:24.560> with<00:00:24.619> infinite<00:00:25.160> we're

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
rapture and I think with infinite we're

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.950 
rapture and I think with infinite we're
continuing<00:00:26.150> that<00:00:26.240> tradition<00:00:26.390> as<00:00:26.779> well

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
continuing that tradition as well

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.720 
continuing that tradition as well
there's<00:00:27.349> a<00:00:27.410> lot<00:00:27.710> of<00:00:27.769> narratives<00:00:28.279> hold<00:00:28.460> in<00:00:28.609> the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
there's a lot of narratives hold in the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.519 
there's a lot of narratives hold in the
world<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.240> no<00:00:29.420> very<00:00:29.630> much<00:00:29.810> probably<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.470> same

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
world and no very much probably the same

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.250 
world and no very much probably the same
scale<00:00:30.980> as<00:00:31.010> there<00:00:31.519> was<00:00:31.670> with<00:00:31.699> bioshock<00:00:32.180> 1<00:00:32.449> but

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
scale as there was with bioshock 1 but

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.569 
scale as there was with bioshock 1 but
we<00:00:33.380> also<00:00:33.590> saw<00:00:34.070> an<00:00:34.190> opportunity<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:35.320> bring<00:00:36.579> the

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
we also saw an opportunity to bring the

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.840 
we also saw an opportunity to bring the
dynamic<00:00:38.030> element<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:39.460> story<00:00:40.460> talked<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.760> the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
dynamic element to story talked to the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.869 
dynamic element to story talked to the
characters<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.100> our<00:00:43.100> challenge<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:43.640> of

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
characters and our challenge is of

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.299 
characters and our challenge is of
course<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:44.239> that<00:00:44.270> we<00:00:44.420> don't<00:00:44.600> have<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:45.350> really

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
course is that we don't have a really

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.279 
course is that we don't have a really
very<00:00:46.730> presentational<00:00:47.300> medium<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.110> think

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
very presentational medium and you think

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.900 
very presentational medium and you think
about<00:00:48.350> storytelling<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:49.219> lot<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.489> games<00:00:49.670> you're

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
about storytelling a lot of games you're

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.160 
about storytelling a lot of games you're
thinking<00:00:50.120> about<00:00:50.149> going<00:00:50.360> to<00:00:50.480> a<00:00:50.570> cutscene<00:00:50.989> or

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
thinking about going to a cutscene or

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.779 
thinking about going to a cutscene or
being<00:00:51.350> locked<00:00:51.500> into<00:00:51.710> place<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.219> that's<00:00:52.670> not

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
being locked into place and that's not

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.560 
being locked into place and that's not
something<00:00:52.910> we<00:00:53.180> really<00:00:53.329> like<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.809> do<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:54.879> so<00:00:55.879> we

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
something we really like to do and so we

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.240 
um that's where i think his journey
starts<00:02:02.929> not<00:02:03.110> just<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.500> literal<00:02:03.740> sense<00:02:04.009> but

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
starts not just in a literal sense but

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.950 
starts not just in a literal sense but
more<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.640> metaphorical<00:02:05.390> sense<00:02:05.570> as<00:02:05.780> well

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
more of a metaphorical sense as well

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.199 
more of a metaphorical sense as well
looks<00:02:06.649> as<00:02:06.800> if<00:02:06.830> some<00:02:07.190> desperate<00:02:07.729> fella<00:02:07.970> called

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
looks as if some desperate fella called

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.949 
looks as if some desperate fella called
this<00:02:08.479> place<00:02:08.660> home<00:02:09.220> what<00:02:10.220> does<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.369> make<00:02:10.610> us

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
this place home what does that make us

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.080 
this place home what does that make us
this<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:12.110> interesting<00:02:12.620> because<00:02:12.739> she<00:02:13.610> is

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
this is interesting because she is

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.620 
this is interesting because she is
really<00:02:14.630> coming<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.019> age<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.800> story<00:02:16.190> and

really coming of age in this story and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.420 
really coming of age in this story and
she's<00:02:17.630> figuring<00:02:18.170> out<00:02:18.260> what<00:02:19.040> kind<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.280> woman

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
she's figuring out what kind of woman

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.820 
she's figuring out what kind of woman
she<00:02:19.580> wants<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.330> kind<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.319> getting<00:02:21.590> out<00:02:21.800> of

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
she wants to be kind of getting out of

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
that little girl thing which has been

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.360 
that little girl thing which has been
even<00:02:24.500> though<00:02:24.560> she's<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.800> little<00:02:24.920> bit<00:02:25.069> older<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
even though she's a little bit older I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.660 
even though she's a little bit older I
think<00:02:25.640> being<00:02:25.880> held<00:02:26.299> captive<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:27.260> mean<00:02:27.829> I<00:02:28.130> would

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
think being held captive I mean I would

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.550 
think being held captive I mean I would
assume<00:02:29.000> her<00:02:29.239> whole<00:02:29.420> life<00:02:29.630> or<00:02:30.170> however<00:02:30.320> long

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
assume her whole life or however long

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
in a voice actor I look for somebody who

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.000 
in a voice actor I look for somebody who
can<00:03:10.160> inhabit<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.579> role<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:12.230> sometimes

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
can inhabit the role and sometimes

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.860 
can inhabit the role and sometimes

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.250 
basics of what I saw in the character
but<00:03:23.329> they're<00:03:23.420> also<00:03:23.570> very<00:03:23.720> good<00:03:23.959> at<00:03:24.019> taking

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
but they're also very good at taking

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.540
