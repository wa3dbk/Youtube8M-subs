change the setting of the car so to put
it<00:01:35.600> into<00:01:35.690> eco<00:01:36.050> mode<00:01:36.200> there's<00:01:36.590> definitely<00:01:36.950> a

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
it into eco mode there's definitely a

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.260 
it into eco mode there's definitely a
difference<00:01:37.039> in<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.610> steering<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.179> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
difference in the steering in the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.940 
difference in the steering in the
throttle<00:01:38.630> response<00:01:38.750> yeah<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:39.560> what<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.830> will

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
throttle response yeah so what that will

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.130 
throttle response yeah so what that will
do<00:01:40.069> is<00:01:40.250> make<00:01:40.520> your<00:01:40.729> total<00:01:41.270> response<00:01:41.720> softer

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
do is make your total response softer

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.960 
do is make your total response softer
and<00:01:42.289> it<00:01:42.500> also<00:01:42.619> tell<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.039> gearbox<00:01:43.459> to<00:01:43.610> change

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
and it also tell the gearbox to change

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.940 
and it also tell the gearbox to change
up<00:01:44.149> sooner<00:01:44.539> and<00:01:44.690> as<00:01:45.229> well<00:01:45.440> as<00:01:45.470> doing<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.800> it

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
up sooner and as well as doing that it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.889 
up sooner and as well as doing that it
will<00:01:46.069> make<00:01:46.369> your<00:01:46.489> aircon<00:01:46.910> kind<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.360> limit<00:01:47.660> so

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
will make your aircon kind of limit so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.300 
will make your aircon kind of limit so
that<00:01:48.140> doesn't<00:01:48.470> use<00:01:48.560> too<00:01:48.709> much<00:01:48.770> fuel<00:01:48.920> economy

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
that doesn't use too much fuel economy

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.770 
that doesn't use too much fuel economy
