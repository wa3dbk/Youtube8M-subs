constructed I'm going to show you in a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
constructed I'm going to show you in a
second<00:00:57.989> by<00:00:58.800> comparing<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> two<00:00:59.910> 130s<00:01:01.460> it's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
second by comparing the two 130s it's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
second by comparing the two 130s it's
got<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> removable<00:01:03.260> bumper<00:01:04.260> strip<00:01:06.860> so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
got a removable bumper strip so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
got a removable bumper strip so
apparently<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.750> removable<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.049> take<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
apparently this is removable to take a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.340 
apparently this is removable to take a
little<00:01:10.530> bit<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.909> weight<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> head<00:01:12.479> but

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
little bit of weight out of the head but

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.160 
little bit of weight out of the head but
it<00:01:13.530> doesn't<00:01:13.890> feel<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.299> flimsy<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:15.930> weird

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
it doesn't feel you know flimsy or weird

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.390 
it doesn't feel you know flimsy or weird
at<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.619> wondering<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.100> would

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
at all I was wondering how that would

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.789 
at all I was wondering how that would
kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> feel<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.750> looks<00:01:19.170> normal<00:01:19.650> but

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
kind of feel it just looks normal but

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.020 
kind of feel it just looks normal but
apparently<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.400> take<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
apparently you can take it out when you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.070 
apparently you can take it out when you
restring<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:22.159> as<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.520> played<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.180> was
