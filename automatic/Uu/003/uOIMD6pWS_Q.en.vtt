00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.860
 well I come to teach you my aquarium 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.760
 practically my main subject would be 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.410
 the albino frogs 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.410
 and that there is me 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 it's one to talk about her 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.800
 well this branch is called xenopus laevis 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.450
 is originally from South America and all that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 we already know 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.800
 good god can you give for my 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.930
 experience that are very easy to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 look after 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.480
 because they are very resistant in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.480
 both water and space 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.310
 they are very peaceful 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.200
 can coexist with fish eyes that do not 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.190
 fit in your mouth because if you do not 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.780
 eat a step that has finished them already good 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.540
 my other aquarium that is bigger is 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.720
 he had them with zebras and they swallowed 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.590
 the miserable ones ate some guppies 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.860
 etc 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.150
 and they are very good and they are very buttons 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.760
 well here I have you in this aquarium 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.700
 40 liters 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 it's perfect for them it's not very little 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.000
 not very big is very good 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.229
 and how can you be seeing the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.229
 I have three golf and yes 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.320
 as they say golf balls I think or 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.390
 pearl flake that the other comet that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 sealed are common I bought them in the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.320
 market do not judge me 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.520
 and I'm realistic for the positions 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.479
 showy 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.829
 and good in the coming to absorb this 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.619
 temperature and all that world and the 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.560
 temperature since you know I have them 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.170
 to the climate the weather climate 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.280
 It has a heater or nothing 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.990
 depending on where they live good here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.539
 where I live because it is not so 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.530
 normal good you see the temperature but 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.330
 right now it 's in 21 22 that is the climate of 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.180
 right now 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.300
 the water, because practically the water 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.240
 deal for the blows 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.730
 it is obvious then from tap water or the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.370
 key as you want to tell 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.480
 I was already chlorinated with a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.460
 good conditioner I used you this 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.440
 it's neutral stressing suppose like this is 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.040
 this is very good 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.270
 and already protect the mucosa of the fish etc 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.270
 eliminates chlorine and heavy metals 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.440
 already opens the space the water is now its 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.850
 good food 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.670
 Well, as I said, it's the most animals 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.000
 gluttons so at least I the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.850
 food with pure live food 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.800
 that could be good I started giving them 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.260
 from tiny cockroaches and flies yes 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.230
 this one eating them in my hand or the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.160
 it was good here is that tele having 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.700
 a 56-liter fish tank 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.580
 and what I was doing is alive, that is, still 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.100
 could move or the fly when the fly 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.880
 not because the marks with the mate 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:36.740
 I threw them here here to the surface 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.420
 and moved here and the beach life branches 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.940
 and fishing 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.730
 and so he ate it and as they went 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.050
 growing his appetite was more senior 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.230
 good high are not so great can 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.659
 see but if they eat enough 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.450
 as I was seeing that there is more 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.909
 elements and well then from there it happens to me 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.370
 the worm to be fex that is a small 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.940
 Worm quote that I also give to my 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.360
 wifis the Japanese love it and it's 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.379
 very nutritious I also give them brine shrimp 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.250
 Equally high in protein is many 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.250
 nutrients etc 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.620
 and so it has been growing high are 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.120
 you remember being in your flame mode 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.920
 that they love hide very well there 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.350
 in case it expands I do not know 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.350
 and it is already 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.150
 Well that is basically your food 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.620
 but they never sink with fish from 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.029
 good estate until I have others 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.169
 with cereals because in fact already 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:47.240
 they ate the most missing and like 494 yes 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.090
 are the y 4 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.630
 They will not believe me but in this aquarium I put 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.240
 20 corals so there's no 4 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.150
 they have been eating them I never see 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.710
 consult eat because at night and 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.430
 Well, this aquarium, I have it 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.790
 with a filter 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.070
 I feel like I'm going to change 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.180
 I do not dirty either, I think it's because of the coal 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.729
 because I barely change it 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.150
 because then let's say I do not have much 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.060
 money 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.280
 and already but because my blows live well 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.960
 food well and something to the changes 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.169
 partial water that is with smith and 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.169
 font 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:31.000
 symphony and gravel 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:34.240
 and these broadly that's it 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.720
 Well, I would tell you that it is very easy 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.720
 keep these nice rents by the way 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:57.070
 in the can you feed them I tell them 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:06:00.040
 names ex wellness fish 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.400
 good to roughly its access this 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.400
 it is this 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.880
 some doubt then leave comments not 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.900
 I know what they want 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.900
 it would be everything
