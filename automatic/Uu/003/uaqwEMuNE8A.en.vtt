00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.370
 good day and welcome to one again 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.540
 delivery of alpha audio disappointment 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.849
 the desk 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.950
 the build-up pm one and the on oh haha one 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.529
 headphones and headphones 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.240
 amplifier though the ha is actually one 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.250
 something more it is also a day and the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.779
 previous stronger switchable but go 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.279
 later on in 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.340
 let's start with the headphones 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.930
 that is a bit of a separate story 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.780
 op al has not opted for normal 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.430
 driver's dynamic drivers just ahead 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.790
 a brand to planner 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.800
 driver and if I have the story it must 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.260
 understood on both gang mÃ¼nchen and on the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.760
 website then has its own design with 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.070
 both at the rear and at the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.299
 front magnets around a foil 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.610
 seven layers thick checked and tight 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.350
 to be able to move up and down 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.500
 well we have a very long time with 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.680
 Powers played Pense was excellent 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.049
 with the only drawback that a magnet is there 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.299
 is not very deeply felt 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.930
 can produce low unless of course the 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.310
 very big boys grab that aside 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.049
 with these headphones have one 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.820
 being able to play along for a day is something 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.960
 otherwise it really feels like one 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.850
 magnets state 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.829
 we have fallen in love with my instant 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.979
 on the pm one 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.479
 but you can read that in review everyone 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.799
 case beautiful model 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.560
 around fourteen hundred euros 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.960
 the netherlands finish is may i love 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.450
 fourteen hundred euros very well 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.869
 there is a nice long cable with one 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.249
 fantastically beautiful box here well see that 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.829
 because of that he goes naturally not 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:45.280
 by sounding but just experience 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.749
 if you purchase the device there are two 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.380
 types of physical pain 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:53.619
 female yes it is very studying now 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.299
 much finer than the standard leather 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.259
 vista plastic leather or whatever 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.999
 may be 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.189
 this is going to sweat a bit this is 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.960
 feels good and feels good to them 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.479
 our idea about something a little better but that is possible 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.539
 a feeling are of course two of them 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.160
 table for mobile use 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.030
 the long one is about a meter or three 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.830
 gamble 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.410
 this one is 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 break and of course one 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.150
 adapter plug 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.860
 stone is something then but just 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.510
 we just put out your debt here 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.120
 can see 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.280
 but as far as this jacket 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.620
 kind of magnet how static 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.790
 headphones from on oh now go a step 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.920
 on the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.160
 haha an a fully class a 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.630
 headphone amplifier and 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.300
 preamplifier because there is just there 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.250
 normal volume control with which he 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.580
 can steer strongly 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.900
 on the back you also see he is really bad 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:54.240
 heavy and analogue input 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.810
 analog output is 4 digital inputs hi 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.070
 coach would optically and usb usb goes up to 24 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.780
 bit 384 kilo art bluetooth and one 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.580
 return and old to natural 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.980
 switch on and off automatically 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.830
 it is in the blood or so by intent 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.530
 more tested name or belongings and USB 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.030
 it sounds absolutely excellent 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.070
 there is an ess saber chip that can be dsd 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.310
 on and also says that the idea is 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.890
 my guess is incompatible because the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.370
 chip both pcm and dsd come that he 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.330
 internally still switches to pcm 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.550
 because this day also just accepts pcm 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.470
 then it may also be that the pcm is over 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.140
 sample to the is theme that seems to me 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.300
 very strong but the harm a late 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.360
 many allow you to set a game 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.130
 you can have one 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.440
 link the fourth processes behind it 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.300
 so that just as you let through 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.680
 Switch display between normal 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.480
 information or equalizer are fire meters 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.830
 too many to mention we leave it 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.830
 all see in the review 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.640
 long remains for us to say he 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.310
 accepts headphones up to around 600 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.310
 ohm unbalanced and balanced 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.500
 that is very nice and the price of 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.350
 this thing is about sixteen hundred 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.150
 euro from my head is all under 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.609
 this video or image what the prices are 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.620
 where you can purchase it from thank you 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.160
 very cordial for watching and to the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.160
 next time
