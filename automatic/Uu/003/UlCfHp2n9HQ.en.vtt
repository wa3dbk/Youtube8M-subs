00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
my opinion I feel like the the support

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
my opinion I feel like the the support
was<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.160> unnecessary<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> deck<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.690> I'm

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
was just unnecessary to the deck now I'm

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
was just unnecessary to the deck now I'm
not<00:00:45.809> saying<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.550> unnecessary<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
not saying it's unnecessary as in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.700 
not saying it's unnecessary as in
putting<00:00:48.510> lightsworn<00:00:48.870> back<00:00:49.110> into<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> tier

putting lightsworn back into a tier

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
putting lightsworn back into a tier
position<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.520> unnecessary<00:00:51.180> no<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.840> saying

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079

you<00:03:32.310> might<00:03:32.459> mill<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.170> doesn't

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
you might mill the it just doesn't

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.410 
you might mill the it just doesn't
appeal<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.430> me<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.730> apparently<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.269> doesn't

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
appeal to other people as well because

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.120 
appeal to other people as well because
we<00:03:39.239> don't<00:03:39.420> see<00:03:39.510> lightsworn<00:03:40.079> topping<00:03:40.709> anything

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
we don't see lightsworn topping anything

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.319 
we don't see lightsworn topping anything
and<00:03:41.280> there's<00:03:41.400> several<00:03:41.670> reasons<00:03:41.820> for<00:03:42.269> that

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
and there's several reasons for that

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.699 
and there's several reasons for that
because<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.750> look<00:03:42.900> at<00:03:42.989> other<00:03:43.200> decks<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.590> are

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
because you look at other decks that are

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.860 
because you look at other decks that are
about<00:03:43.920> 10<00:03:44.280> times<00:03:44.549> more<00:03:44.760> consistent<00:03:45.299> don't

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
about 10 times more consistent don't

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.660 
about 10 times more consistent don't
have<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.230> problem<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.709> milling<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.340> one

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
have the problem of milling that one

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.520 
have the problem of milling that one
monster<00:03:48.329> wind<00:03:48.570> condition<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.230> that's<00:03:49.380> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
monster wind condition and that's the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.259 
monster wind condition and that's the
reason<00:03:49.650> these<00:03:49.950> decks<00:03:50.220> are<00:03:50.400> being<00:03:50.579> better<00:03:51.180> than

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
reason these decks are being better than

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.050 
reason these decks are being better than
lightsworn<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:52.200> back<00:03:52.440> at<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.709> real<00:03:52.890> quick
