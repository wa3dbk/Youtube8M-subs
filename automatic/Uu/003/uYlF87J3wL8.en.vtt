beast
we<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.569> BMWs<00:00:07.230> all-new<00:00:07.740> 4.4<00:00:08.610> liter

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
we have BMWs all-new 4.4 liter

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.120 
we have BMWs all-new 4.4 liter
twin-turbo<00:00:09.210> v8<00:00:10.050> now<00:00:10.650> we'll<00:00:10.769> take<00:00:10.860> off<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
twin-turbo v8 now we'll take off the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.890 
twin-turbo v8 now we'll take off the
vanity<00:00:11.490> cover<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:11.969> can<00:00:12.120> see<00:00:12.300> under<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:12.570> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
vanity cover so you can see under here I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.839 
vanity cover so you can see under here I
won't<00:00:13.469> touch<00:00:13.650> anything<00:00:13.920> because<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.519> but

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
won't touch anything because it's on but

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.760 
won't touch anything because it's on but
basically<00:00:14.969> here<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> innovative<00:00:16.529> thing

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
basically here the innovative thing

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.310 
basically here the innovative thing
about<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.430> 650<00:00:18.000> eyes<00:00:18.150> engine<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
about the 650 eyes engine is that the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.050 
about the 650 eyes engine is that the
twin<00:00:19.650> turbos<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.460> valley<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
twin turbos are in the valley of the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.150 
twin turbos are in the valley of the
engine<00:00:21.539> rather<00:00:21.750> than<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> sides<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.830> that

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
engine rather than on the sides so that

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.130 
engine rather than on the sides so that
means<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.550> exhaust<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.240> intake<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.750> reversed

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
means the exhaust and intake is reversed

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.170 
means the exhaust and intake is reversed
from<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> normal<00:00:25.769> viet<00:00:26.039> engine<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.029> you're

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
from a normal viet engine so if you're

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
from a normal viet engine so if you're
looking<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.750> 652<00:00:28.439> if<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> choice

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
looking for a 652 if you have the choice

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
looking for a 652 if you have the choice
now<00:00:29.369> between<00:00:29.699> three<00:00:30.060> engines<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
now between three engines you have the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.100 
now between three engines you have the
single<00:00:31.740> twin<00:00:32.189> scroll<00:00:32.520> turbo<00:00:32.579> inline<00:00:33.390> six<00:00:33.750> good

horsepower and 450 pound feet of torque
and<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.140> course<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> all-new<00:00:44.219> BMW

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and of course you have the all-new BMW

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029 
and of course you have the all-new BMW
m6<00:00:45.239> engine<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.680> been<00:00:46.860> announced

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
m6 engine which is just been announced

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.900 
m6 engine which is just been announced
and<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.960> 560<00:00:48.960> horsepower<00:00:49.219> now<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and that's 560 horsepower now in this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.520 
and that's 560 horsepower now in this
particular<00:00:51.420> model<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> drive<00:00:52.320> is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
particular model all the drive is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.319 
particular model all the drive is
available<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> inline<00:00:53.969> six

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
available as this with the inline six

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.720 
available as this with the inline six
and<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.140> makes<00:00:55.320> handling<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:56.129> more<00:00:56.340> secure

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and that makes handling much more secure

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.250 
and that makes handling much more secure
than<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> would<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> m6<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> wet

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
than it would be in the m6 in the wet

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.979 
than it would be in the m6 in the wet
weather<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.649> course<00:00:58.710> although<00:00:59.690> dm-6<00:01:00.690> probably

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
weather of course although dm-6 probably

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.100 
weather of course although dm-6 probably
does<00:01:01.109> sound<00:01:01.320> more<00:01:01.469> exciting

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.320 

so<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.800> said<00:01:07.980> 400<00:01:08.280> horsepower<00:01:08.910> but<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
so now as I said 400 horsepower but the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.000 
so now as I said 400 horsepower but the
big<00:01:09.510> thing<00:01:09.720> about<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.050> engine<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
big thing about this engine is that it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
big thing about this engine is that it
deliver<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.700> 400<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.330> those<00:01:12.450> horsepower

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
deliver is all 400 of those horsepower

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.820 
deliver is all 400 of those horsepower
from<00:01:13.430> 5,500<00:01:14.430> rpm<00:01:14.730> to<00:01:14.970> 6,400<00:01:15.780> rpm<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
from 5,500 rpm to 6,400 rpm and it

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.250 
from 5,500 rpm to 6,400 rpm and it
delivers<00:01:17.150> 450<00:01:18.150> pounds<00:01:18.480> of<00:01:18.570> torque<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:19.020> just

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
delivers 450 pounds of torque from just

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.570 
delivers 450 pounds of torque from just
barely<00:01:19.500> over<00:01:19.650> idle<00:01:20.180> 1750<00:01:21.180> rpm<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
barely over idle 1750 rpm all with the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
barely over idle 1750 rpm all with the
4500<00:01:23.580> rpm<00:01:23.910> so<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.510> broad<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:25.260> broad<00:01:25.590> torque

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
4500 rpm so the broad very broad torque

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
4500 rpm so the broad very broad torque
range<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.370> helps<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:26.880> acceleration<00:01:27.570> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
range really helps the acceleration in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.520 
range really helps the acceleration in
this<00:01:27.720> park<00:01:28.020> BMW<00:01:28.860> claims<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.630> 4.9<00:01:30.630> second<00:01:31.200> 0-60

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this park BMW claims a 4.9 second 0-60

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.910 
this park BMW claims a 4.9 second 0-60
times<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.640> achieved<00:01:32.970> 4.23<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.740> back

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
times but we achieved 4.23 back to back

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
times but we achieved 4.23 back to back
without<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.310> problem<00:01:35.760> in<00:01:35.910> this<00:01:36.000> model<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.720> that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
without a problem in this model and that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
without a problem in this model and that
actually<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.410> just<00:01:37.770> about<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.130> good<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
actually is just about as good as the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.350 
actually is just about as good as the
Jaguar<00:01:39.090> XKR<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> Mercedes<00:01:41.370> CL<00:01:41.700> 550

all-wheel<00:01:42.690> drive<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.440> we<00:01:43.500> should<00:01:43.800> note<00:01:44.010> that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
all-wheel drive now we should note that

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980 
all-wheel drive now we should note that
the<00:01:44.250> steel<00:01:44.460> 550<00:01:45.090> off<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.390> drive<00:01:45.600> will<00:01:45.840> do

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the steel 550 off for the drive will do

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.280 
the steel 550 off for the drive will do
that<00:01:46.170> rain<00:01:46.410> or<00:01:46.650> shine<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.970> 650<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:49.110> the

thing<00:02:19.040> about<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.340> 650<00:02:19.879> eye<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
thing about the 650 eye is that the

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.289 
thing about the 650 eye is that the
handling<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.769> not<00:02:21.799> exactly<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.819> best<00:02:22.849> in<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
handling is not exactly the best in the

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.759 
handling is not exactly the best in the
world<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.720> mean<00:02:23.870> there<00:02:24.019> are<00:02:24.049> cars<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.530> handle

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
world I mean there are cars that handle

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.229 
world I mean there are cars that handle
way<00:02:24.890> better<00:02:25.099> than<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> 650<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:25.970> what<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.209> is

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
way better than the 650 but what it is

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.229 
way better than the 650 but what it is
is<00:02:26.569> very<00:02:26.810> confident<00:02:27.530> feels<00:02:28.069> very<00:02:28.340> good<00:02:28.580> even

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239

it has very similar look and feel to
your<00:05:35.550> iPhone<00:05:35.940> if<00:05:36.270> we<00:05:36.360> continue<00:05:36.660> scrolling

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
your iPhone if we continue scrolling

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.050 
your iPhone if we continue scrolling
down<00:05:37.050> we<00:05:37.110> get<00:05:37.319> the<00:05:37.440> letter<00:05:37.880> selection<00:05:38.880> there

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
down we get the letter selection there

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.870 
down we get the letter selection there
and<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.270> can<00:05:39.449> go<00:05:40.410> through<00:05:40.740> now<00:05:41.220> I'm<00:05:41.430> not<00:05:41.610> quite

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
and you can go through now I'm not quite

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.309 
and you can go through now I'm not quite
clear<00:05:42.030> why<00:05:42.240> you'd<00:05:42.419> want<00:05:42.630> this<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:43.020> actually

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 
clear why you'd want this I actually

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.170 
clear why you'd want this I actually
found<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:43.979> be<00:05:44.069> less<00:05:44.280> useful<00:05:44.610> than<00:05:44.880> the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
found it to be less useful than the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.570 
found it to be less useful than the
regular<00:05:45.660> iPod<00:05:46.259> interface<00:05:46.560> for<00:05:47.130> me

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
regular iPod interface for me

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.040 
regular iPod interface for me
because<00:05:47.849> I<00:05:47.940> don't<00:05:48.000> care<00:05:48.270> about<00:05:48.360> accessing<00:05:48.930> my

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
because I don't care about accessing my

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.469 
because I don't care about accessing my
genius<00:05:49.380> list<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:50.130> also<00:05:50.310> because<00:05:50.819> if<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.360> use

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
genius list but also because if you use

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.960 
genius list but also because if you use
the<00:05:51.720> steering<00:05:52.110> wheel<00:05:52.259> control<00:05:52.650> here<00:05:53.039> you

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
the steering wheel control here you

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.120 
the steering wheel control here you
actually<00:05:54.270> can't<00:05:54.840> see<00:05:55.169> your<00:05:55.380> playlist<00:05:55.860> in<00:05:56.069> the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
actually can't see your playlist in the

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.700 
actually can't see your playlist in the
gauge<00:05:56.880> cluster<00:05:56.910> here<00:05:57.630> which<00:05:57.900> you<00:05:58.080> can<00:05:58.289> if<00:05:58.590> you

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
gauge cluster here which you can if you

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.800 
gauge cluster here which you can if you
plug<00:05:58.949> it<00:05:59.069> and<00:05:59.190> regularly<00:05:59.580> via<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.150> USB<00:06:00.630> cable

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
plug it and regularly via the USB cable

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.360 
plug it and regularly via the USB cable
you'd<00:06:01.139> actually<00:06:01.440> get<00:06:01.560> a<00:06:01.590> track<00:06:01.830> listing<00:06:02.220> there

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
you'd actually get a track listing there

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.059 
you'd actually get a track listing there
so<00:06:02.520> if<00:06:02.580> use<00:06:02.780> BMWs<00:06:03.780> interface<00:06:04.169> you<00:06:04.680> get<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.830> few

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
so if use BMWs interface you get a few

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:06.260 
so if use BMWs interface you get a few
more<00:06:05.190> features<00:06:05.370> but<00:06:05.729> you<00:06:05.789> don't<00:06:05.970> get<00:06:06.090> access

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
more features but you don't get access

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.379 
more features but you don't get access

now the high beltline high dashboard and

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.740 
now the high beltline high dashboard and
large<00:06:24.610> center<00:06:24.910> console<00:06:25.360> really<00:06:25.570> make<00:06:25.720> a

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
large center console really make a

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.170 
large center console really make a
6-series<00:06:26.290> feel<00:06:26.710> like<00:06:26.950> a<00:06:26.980> big<00:06:27.280> car<00:06:27.520> it<00:06:28.000> is

6-series feel like a big car it is

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.690 
6-series feel like a big car it is
actually<00:06:28.690> quite<00:06:28.840> a<00:06:28.960> big<00:06:29.290> car<00:06:29.590> it's<00:06:30.520> based

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
actually quite a big car it's based

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.690 
actually quite a big car it's based
really<00:06:31.030> on<00:06:31.150> a<00:06:31.690> five<00:06:32.110> series<00:06:32.530> 7<00:06:32.860> Series<00:06:33.220> hybrid

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
really on a five series 7 Series hybrid

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.040 
really on a five series 7 Series hybrid
I<00:06:33.820> mean<00:06:33.970> it's<00:06:34.090> neither<00:06:34.390> one<00:06:34.660> nor<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:34.990> other

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
I mean it's neither one nor the other

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.370 
I mean it's neither one nor the other
but<00:06:35.650> it's<00:06:35.770> also<00:06:35.950> both<00:06:36.370> as<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.450> 7<00:06:37.720> Series<00:06:38.020> and<00:06:38.200> 5

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
but it's also both as the 7 Series and 5

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.350 
but it's also both as the 7 Series and 5
series<00:06:38.800> share<00:06:38.980> an<00:06:39.130> awful<00:06:39.400> lot<00:06:39.520> of<00:06:39.550> parts<00:06:39.940> but

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
series share an awful lot of parts but

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.150 
series share an awful lot of parts but
that's<00:06:40.510> a<00:06:40.630> good<00:06:40.810> thing<00:06:41.050> for<00:06:41.080> the<00:06:41.320> 6<00:06:41.560> Series<00:06:41.920> the

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
that's a good thing for the 6 Series the

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.980 
that's a good thing for the 6 Series the
build<00:06:42.400> quality<00:06:42.640> is<00:06:42.880> extremely<00:06:43.270> high<00:06:43.630> inside

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.690

also<00:07:41.470> whether<00:07:41.650> it<00:07:41.830> actually<00:07:42.190> improves<00:07:42.520> the
