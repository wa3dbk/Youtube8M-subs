00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.280
 hello with you egor and today guys from 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.320
 gameplay released game new 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.660
 spiderman 2 based on widely 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.580
 famous franchise premiere second 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.099
 parts of which will be held in Russia in 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.169
 Ukraine next week and you know 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.750
 if we talk about the film that I personally well 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.099
 To put it mildly , I didnâ€™t really like the first one 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.700
 part of amazing spider-man 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.619
 losing weight very much waiting really convinced 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.629
 what trilogy stupa maguire main 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.149
 the role definitely decides and I'm not up to 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.699
 the end is clear why this one happened 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.730
 here restart the series but what happened is 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.249
 happened and unfortunately with the game situation 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.129
 no better than a movie and everything seems to be 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.589
 started off well with price tags of 169 rubles 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.899
 or 5 dollars that basically should 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.329
 tells us about the absence of this given but 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.699
 Looking ahead, I will say that despite 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.710
 that he is there very sparing in the game for 5 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.809
 bucks he still present first 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.059
 the game makes an impression very well 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.070
 positive very decent for 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.350
 mobile devices graphics dynamic 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.900
 fights interesting scenes uncomplicated 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.270
 obedient management but after probably 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.130
 already 40 minutes of the game comes the absolute 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.440
 the realization that what is happening on 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.240
 the screen is in reality finish now 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.920
 clearly explain why with an example 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 real slicing 5 minutes of play 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.130
 but in reality despite 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.780
 that there is something remote in the game 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.790
 reminiscent of the plot probably in 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.980
 eighty percent of the time passing 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.470
 the current mission we will need to do 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.480
 one of three things is either attributed 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.490
 any poor guy to the hospital either 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.800
 hang on bad guys people who are like 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.870
 the rule is no more than three four and the very 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.580
 yourself autograph fans 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.200
 do the simple manner we will 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.330
 move slowly over some 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.310
 absolutely awkward countries 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.200
 probably the story line to collect gold 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.790
 with which we can pump 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.280
 skills of Spider-Man 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.050
 By the way about the skills and I do not know, maybe I 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.910
 they are not enough lots are opened well 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.280
 who managed to open somehow here on 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.840
 gameplay in reality didn't affect 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.750
 that some of them are required for 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.970
 the passage of the missions so I will immediately say 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.280
 those who still decide to buy the game is not 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.590
 rush with pumping and wait for Messi 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.200
 where will make you do it differently 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.060
 will be a long time to wander around the city trying to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.280
 collect the necessary amount of gold 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.350
 there is also a shop where you can 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.510
 buy costumes for your spider man 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.430
 and naturally either for the ruble or the bases 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.250
 Talc earned in the game which 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.690
 In addition to appearance, it also affects 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.000
 proper character strength 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.040
 there is some vague arena mode 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.690
 where you can endlessly in my 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.000
 fight bandits earning 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.000
 actually achivki and new costumes and 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.130
 skills I personally did not understand nafig in men 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.690
 but there is good as you go 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.460
 storyline levels 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.770
 you will meet the boss with whom 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.620
 fighting is really as boring as 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.190
 and do the rest 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.710
 the only thing I really do 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.630
 pleased for three full hours of gameplay 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.460
 this is this one 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.610
 looks like a legitimate 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.100
 President of the whole I do not know everything 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.230
 quite nice and jump around the city 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.660
 cool comic character one of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.840
 loved ones and fights dynamic well, that's it 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.790
 very boring right here I don't know 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.800
 can someone disagree with me or 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.810
 I'm too old for such games 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.180
 write your opinion on what you think about it 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.250
 about who bought the game maybe something 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.020
 not driven and in something wrong 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.150
 everything else the game manages 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.220
 slows down on the iphone 5s what 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.380
 really can not but surprise at least 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.570
 play itself quite comfortably 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.210
 new spiderman 2 works on everyone 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.670
 iphone and ipad and ipod touch board circuits 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.440
 above whist one and a half gigabyte and translated 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.870
 into Russian for subtitles 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.120
 the original broke off to buy the game well 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.280
 guys fuse shadow quickly drove 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.620
 promotional code to become a separate 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.450
 thanks because but I would feel sorry 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.300
 these five bucks were better in 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.340
 McDonald's is not blocked, I bought a whole 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.380
 I can not recommend the game 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.080
 to convince that and not buy at all 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.570
 worth it I won't be really convinced 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.010
 that the game has its audience sure 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.380
 many will really get 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.030
 pleasure is just what can clinging 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.000
 It turned out to jump over the sky in New York 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.130
