00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.770
 how are you doing, I'm Carlos, family, because 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.299
 we started a new carlo kitchen today 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.040
 we want to talk about the benefits of 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.290
 paprika note that this vegetable is the 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.610
 that has more vitamin C contribution what 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.230
 better than mixing it with a good 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.880
 protein like the protein of quinoa 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.880
 wolf already here in carlo kitchen 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.640
 well what are we going to do first is 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.739
 cut the lid I'm playing a knife 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.770
 velosa to cut vegetables always 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.570
 It works very well if the metal envelopes do not 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.640
 they are transferred to the vegetables we have 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.820
 all the seeds and we are going to reserve the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 tapas also there we are going to do it with 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.720
 the three piles of three colors 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.160
 remember that in the plain or in 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.170
 markets today are achieved I 'm not 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.150
 difficult to find these peppers 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.040
 colors we are going to put on a 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.110
 source and to do it a little more 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.940
 fun to take it to the table like this 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.250
 let's put them all mixed 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.030
 different colors and that do not match 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.580
 so little tapas 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.590
 now we have cooked quinoa that has 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.220
 known with a little carrot for 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.299
 give a touch of flavor I'll put 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.190
 an aromatic herb to which you 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.720
 want it can be a bit of chives or 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:21.790
 parsley we're also going to add onion 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.790
 a clove of garlic that I will make 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.009
 corn and frozen artists 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.510
 we mix everything 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.410
 I'm going to add salt because the quinoa already 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.830
 fonsal cooking and add a little sauce 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.830
 tomato 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.300
 we mix everything and we're going to fill in now 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.810
 these peppers that will give a lot 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.270
 flavor let's start filling them there 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.190
 we put them enough and it is very important 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.050
 eat top because it has a balance 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.730
 perfect between omega 3 and omega 6 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.980
 that makes our body what 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.230
 absorb much better we find it 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.420
 you know the nuts and in the 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.550
 fruits of the sea and here we are 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.250
 together in l'aquila 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.290
 and now it's time to cover it and I 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.200
 I recommend that you do not agree to do it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.400
 so a little more playful we end up with 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 a little olive oil over 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.250
 baked 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.109
 and our peppers are ready 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.090
 stuffed with kim an entertaining recipe 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.090
 playful he saw here in Carlos
