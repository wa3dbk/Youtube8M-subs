00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
the other two you find that there's only

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.010 
the other two you find that there's only
one<00:01:23.229> move<00:01:23.560> difference<00:01:24.100> between<00:01:24.579> each<00:01:25.149> spec<00:01:25.750> as

one move difference between each spec as
it<00:01:26.259> were<00:01:26.409> obviously<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.490> gameplay<00:01:27.939> is<00:01:28.000> very

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
it were obviously the gameplay is very

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.410 
it were obviously the gameplay is very
varied<00:01:29.229> and<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.530> will<00:01:29.799> change<00:01:30.189> but<00:01:31.090> there's

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
varied and it will change but there's

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.169 
varied and it will change but there's
only<00:01:31.509> one<00:01:31.659> main<00:01:32.109> move<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:32.950> get<00:01:33.369> bill<00:01:33.640> walk<00:01:33.909> if

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
here the man with the two-hand sword and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.360 
here the man with the two-hand sword and
it's<00:05:04.520> like<00:05:04.670> a<00:05:04.700> dojo<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:06.130> finally<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.220> very

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
it's like a dojo and finally the very

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.270 
it's like a dojo and finally the very
obvious<00:05:07.610> one<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:08.420> isn't<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.870> apparently<00:05:09.280> the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
obvious one this isn't it apparently the

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.160 
obvious one this isn't it apparently the
mage<00:05:10.460> one<00:05:10.700> of<00:05:10.910> for<00:05:11.210> some<00:05:11.360> reason<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.720> my<00:05:11.870> spawn

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
mage one of for some reason on my spawn

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.100 
mage one of for some reason on my spawn
isn't<00:05:12.920> in<00:05:13.010> fact<00:05:13.280> in<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:14.060> venture<00:05:14.420> district<00:05:14.960> but

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
isn't in fact in a venture district but

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.740 
isn't in fact in a venture district but
it's<00:05:15.230> in<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.650> pet<00:05:15.860> districts<00:05:16.310> I<00:05:16.430> believe<00:05:16.790> just

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
it's in the pet districts I believe just

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.480 
it's in the pet districts I believe just
barely<00:05:17.990> or<00:05:18.320> traitors<00:05:18.710> take<00:05:18.860> water<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.370> this

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
barely or traitors take water and this

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.950 
barely or traitors take water and this
is<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.730> mage<00:05:19.910> one<00:05:20.150> so<00:05:20.330> that's<00:05:20.450> what<00:05:20.660> they<00:05:20.780> look

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
very simple system but you know pay

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.150 
very simple system but you know pay
attention<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.570> it<00:05:26.750> read<00:05:27.170> what<00:05:27.380> your<00:05:27.530> spells<00:05:27.890> do

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
attention to it read what your spells do

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.310 
attention to it read what your spells do
and<00:05:28.400> see<00:05:28.610> what<00:05:29.300> seems<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.690> most<00:05:29.840> efficient

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
and see what seems the most efficient

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.140 
and see what seems the most efficient
and<00:05:30.410> effective<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:31.010> you<00:05:31.190> as<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.760> level<00:05:31.970> up

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
and effective to you as you level up

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.520 
and effective to you as you level up
remember<00:05:32.660> a<00:05:32.690> leveling<00:05:33.050> your<00:05:33.140> character

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
remember a leveling your character

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.410 
remember a leveling your character
priority<00:05:34.070> means<00:05:34.490> your<00:05:34.640> level<00:05:34.850> faster<00:05:35.300> cause

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
priority means your level faster cause

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.760 
priority means your level faster cause
you're<00:05:35.540> doing<00:05:35.720> more<00:05:35.810> damage<00:05:35.990> and<00:05:36.350> then<00:05:36.680> you

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
you're doing more damage and then you

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.860 
you're doing more damage and then you
can<00:05:36.950> get<00:05:37.100> to<00:05:37.280> these<00:05:37.430> more<00:05:38.030> efficiently<00:05:38.600> I'd

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
can get to these more efficiently I'd

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.460 
can get to these more efficiently I'd
