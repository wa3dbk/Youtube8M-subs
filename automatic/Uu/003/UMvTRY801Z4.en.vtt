00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.470
 a greeting to all the people who see 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.500
 this YouTube channel today 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.450
 I'm going to teach how to make an animation and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.070
 well it's pretty simple first let's go 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.070
 to open in our flash 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.270
 the kind of animation that I'm going to 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.220
 teach today is going to be box 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.640
 That is, we are going to create many 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.970
 images followed to make it look 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.779
 how the animation moves first 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.670
 let's have a layer nothing else we 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.320
 let's position right in the box 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.660
 frame 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 and well let's name it thoroughly 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.770
 let's draw I do not know what what is going to 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.590
 treat our animation is like the 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.590
 scenario I for example I'm going to put 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.190
 I dont know 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.190
 a tree 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.259
 is more or less now what I'm going to 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.270
 do is good let's close this fund 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.549
 this layer here is a small padlock 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.509
 we are going to go to the part of 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.909
 below and we are going to click on you 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.369
 blocked the layer that is to say we are not going to 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.890
 to write about it until it 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.409
 we unlocked it here with this little picture 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.189
 who is here who say they are player 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.700
 to press it and we will see that a 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:14.470
 new layer in this layer let's write 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.470
 I do not know character 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.440
 and good here obviously going to go what 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.269
 is going to be our character we 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.730
 we position precisely in the box 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.489
 white is blank because 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.099
 is because he still has nothing in him 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.440
 does not have any drawing is that we see from 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.960
 background is black because it is precisely because 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.630
 there is something about this one 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.690
 we are going to select a brush that 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.120
 we want 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.140
 I go grabbing thinner this by 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.780
 example and 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 and well let's start doing the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.980
 drawing that we want 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.350
 I'm going to draw a boy 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.860
 there are three types of flash frames that 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.730
 is the one of f 6 that I'm going to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.890
 press what it does is that copy leave 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.740
 leave the previous frame as it is 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.640
 it does not make any change in the drawing 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.830
 is the frame that is with efe 7 that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.260
 good pressing it we can see that the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.260
 animation is completely erased what 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.320
 we had and good standing is the technique 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.440
 that I'm going to use this time we're going to 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.400
 this little picture that is here that 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.870
 says onion skin or paper onion the paper 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.430
 onion allows us 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.739
 see the last image that was what 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.390
 what he did then good based on her 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.390
 continue to continue the animation 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 for example I will make this monkey 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 fall 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.680
 It is highly recommended that for each 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:32.110
 thing that we draw we create a 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.759
 different layer so that you do not know 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.509
 confuse because then there are animations 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.400
 that we got to do that has two layers 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.560
 but there is the background the character 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.680
 main and everything then when 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.139
 we want for example to put the character 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.860
 on the background how is the same layer not 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.740
 It can 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.620
 well I have my animation here now 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.900
 nothing else needs to be reproduced as not 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.419
 I have put no character of 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.400
 programming in the frame my 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.370
 animation will continue to travel is 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.319
 say is going to be done as a 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.400
 sequence ends and start over 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:11.810
 ends and then begins again 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.599
 later I will teach you more commands 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.129
 of programming animation sorry for 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.409
 that you can stop the animation 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.689
 just at the moment they want 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.139
 well let's try it with more control 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.139
 enter 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.530
 it looks pretty slow then what I'm going 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.290
 to do is go here where it says 12 fps 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.990
 that is, the number of frames that 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:41.200
 they are going to run for a second 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.960
 is then I'm going to put 18 for 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.210
 that the animation goes more fluid I 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.240
 I usually use 18 to 24 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.660
 frames per second and well let's go 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.660
 to play 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.580
 and well we will see that it is still 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.860
 watching the animation very square but 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.289
 Well, that's already because I did 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.029
 too much the animation I hope 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.639
 that this tutorial has been useful for 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:09.469
 create animations and any questions or 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.469
 comment write until later
