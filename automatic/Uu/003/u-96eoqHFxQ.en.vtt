00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 I 'm here again for another video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.240
 for our youtube channel today is me 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.219
 I'll show you a way of you. 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.309
 differentiate an original cell phone from a 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.510
 replica in just five seconds 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:23.699
 It's a very easy way to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 galaxy do not three models for 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:34.010
 behind does not work on galaxy s2 s2 light 3s 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:39.329
 3mins 4s four mini is galaxy note 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.399
 11,293 large galaxy using the two only 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.510
 it will not be the same thing this method 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.100
 for galaxy note four four grand 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 prix is â€‹â€‹a bit different but 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 basically looks like 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 so it's ok then I have three models 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.030
 of cell phones 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.109
 here I have it from 9 2 here I have 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.949
 a 4g galaxy here I have a galaxy 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.290
 Zoo Induta three appliances is who knows 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.619
 You must have already noticed 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.460
 Here, then, obviously, the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.020
 Replica is from here in 4 s only 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 picture quality 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.990
 You can already see that it is not here. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.090
 cool 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 the galaxy 2 2 thousand cats or else the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.470
 better picture quality now 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.360
 any simple way you will 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.140
 Find out five seconds here. 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 You hit the home button and hold it there. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.880
 You put this little ball here from the corner and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.210
 here you put memory already ram 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.140
 here he gives you the information of the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.560
 ram apparatus having 1:23 giga 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.659
 1.74 bar is what is using what has 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.689
 available has total that has the capital 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.619
 in use has total 2 gigs you make the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.399
 Same thing here on the bad galaxy here at 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.149
 cock you held put in the ball and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.670
 Taiwan 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.630
 even if it is in another place you 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.479
 places here ram 1 GB of memory 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.940
 for whom 79 averages used 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.600
 now if you do the same thing here 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.930
 mann 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.540
 if you do the same thing here in no 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.030
 s4 replica let's see where it goes 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 take with him or have a little button here 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.230
 O 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.150
 nor the little button he has for you 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.550
 to check if you have the option of 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.210
 closing the apps is the total that is 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.570
 a concierge here but he has not 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.520
 that ball in the field so that's it 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.300
 this is the simple way you discover 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.340
 in seconds your device was then 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.370
 Good, I'll do it one more time, you guys. 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.590
 not safe here the ball he has to 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.320
 option to close everything google and this 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.780
 here in the country he takes you to where 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.580
 Has ram information become boys? 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.520
 bad 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.860
 look the same thing right there in the 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.280
 formation of river state ram memory 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.500
 if you do on the replica that nor the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.060
 But some balls have balls. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.280
 that when you press she does not take you 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.260
 for this screen is that deforms ram 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.320
 because the reply, however good it may be, does not 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.170
 they can circumvent the memory of the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.480
 system ok so this is an easy way 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.340
 to discover in five seconds doing 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.910
 this way you will hardly be 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.910
 cheated ok
