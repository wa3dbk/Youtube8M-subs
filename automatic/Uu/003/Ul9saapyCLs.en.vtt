00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 because many of you like it again and again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.640
 ask which microphone back in 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 use the record for the recordings thought 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.450
 I'll just clarify the question 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.090
 a video on and not quite 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.590
 normal as yes that's it but the same 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.759
 as a test of the new micro what I think 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.170
 yourself just want to see if 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.039
 actually much better than that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.320
 we use otherwise 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.390
 So be curious, look in and out 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.359
 it works and that's about it 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 sennheiser mk a 40 in a beautiful suitcase 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.810
 the micro is not too delivered 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.310
 big the suitcase is actually a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.269
 little accessories thought and above all 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.009
 then probably more 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.630
 looks like is actually like a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.550
 Great is therefore s.meine me 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.790
 I just got it a bit bigger here 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.750
 and so maybe again illustration 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 you might just see a piece 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 far better what is included in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.879
 this case you have such a head protection 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.340
 The whole thing is called a man black 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.780
 even know that's just wind and Say Yeah 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.390
 I really sound something out of the mouth 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.320
 comes out a bit to hold out 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.610
 There are two different colors each 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.469
 if now I say myself bright or 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.430
 darker little trick normally 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.899
 now in my case you would go to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.550
 example, the white do not take so 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.020
 just have a hard time 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.270
 decreased and which both show 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.979
 can and what I find very nice yet 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.180
 as an accessory next to this usual clamp 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.159
 to assemble if for example one 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.700
 shirt is wearing here again in 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.259
 the instructions explained I look at the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.640
 Quick find in a folder exactly that 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.810
 there are also whole with magnets 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.340
 For example, if I say my t 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 wearing t- shirt or turtleneck 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 something like that in the same direction 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.060
 nadja magnet chain dennis just times 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.350
 to hang and you have him 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.700
 so to speak the t-shirt and then here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.020
 over it on one side the micro and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.390
 that it's also magnetic that doctor 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 so here, so to speak 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.850
 also a pretty cool stuff easy 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.900
 wear other things because that was 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.579
 so far with me for example with a 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.290
 problem in t-shirt to wear with that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.880
 a microphone - a pinch they have 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.619
 relatively awkward or looks years 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 stupid because it holds a kink in t 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.009
 shirt, and that somewhere , too 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.570
 it's not that easy to fix 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.100
 that was pretty cool in any case 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.290
 just have to be careful that you yes 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.299
 This white rubber does not tie here 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.549
 Maybe that needs to be awkward 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.909
 but yes the first time so far to 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 scope of delivery of sennheiser m40 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.299
 but the question and me now 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.710
 straight texts what else do we use then 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.270
 actually and I have it with me too 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.500
 off but also even four 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.940
 I should do it 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610
 have to show that right in front of the camera 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.110
 to be able to do that is the sennheiser me2 that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.760
 will call themselves with these radio links 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.190
 He's such a wireless audio system 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.750
 the standard has also included 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.180
 even a small protection on top 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.430
 looks so big so pretty small 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.020
 fairly inconspicuous increase in microphone 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.490
 I 'm both in it for the one 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.750
 Ton times can compare because for me 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.920
 was actually the main reason that now 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.750
 time to test I have considered whether one 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.760
 maybe m40 just for me 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.680
 the recording increases because some people 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.840
 have said that a noticeably better 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.700
 I have to say now to his 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.840
 certain advantages but the giant 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.580
 do not differentiate on there I have 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720
 unfortunately not heard there is the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.250
 difference for example whether it is in the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.450
 Camera capture or axes car 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.000
 recorder again but a bit far 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.739
 bigger what you notice the mkg 40 is a 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.530
 little neutral not so strong bass 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.150
 emphasizes like this and is also one 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.680
 bit sensitive so if now 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.600
 Sensibility problems have that it 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.739
 the mk ii 40 starts to rush early 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.110
 probably really better because of it 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.670
 now even a few decibels louder easy 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.290
 is what comes out at the same level 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.550
 if I speak right now for 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.630
 Of course I adapted the video 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.000
 so that you do not differ now 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.470
 volume levels but as I said when he 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.360
 since problems with sensitivity has is 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.860
 also that m40 a bit better otherwise 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.239
 the sound is not somehow now 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.890
 chosen differently between 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.110
 both were not a pity 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.010
 but they still differ 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.390
 all a little bit micro 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.280
 from each other and we also have it earlier 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.070
 a very different just the whole 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.780
 a bit different the mp4 looks 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.230
 a bit tattered dented out 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.370
 But what 's the point in getting a microphone? 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.700
 if it all the same class 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.829
 Formal is also still different 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.299
 Characteristics like them then, so to speak 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.370
 yes how should you say spatially record 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.799
 from where the audio signals come in relatively 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.720
 simply said here is completely 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.640
 classic ball characteristic at the 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.320
 it probably what we always use here 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.930
 that means it actually takes a lot 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.180
 neutral from all directions 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.070
 to every minimal smells after 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.780
 above but really quite discreet 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.610
 benefits for example we are 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.500
 for two on the couch also the now 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.850
 one and a half meters can sit next to it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.110
 talk relatively normal or I can too 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.420
 my head to one or the other 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.310
 turn side and the sound level drops 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.410
 not too strong off a little bit differently 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.269
 already with the mk ii 40 that is already one 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.160
 a bit further upwards though 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.810
 with a relatively wide funnel say 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.880
 I think that I can still head 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.840
 in the usual areas of the always when I 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.190
 quite blatantly turn him since then 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.830
 you just take differences 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.760
 or yes, other situations say where 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.169
 maybe it's really too 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.930
 stretches far upward or such 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.389
 stories for the first time otherwise 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.160
 we would just have the mp4 here 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.080
 and that has a very big turn 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.870
 crass directivity upwards 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.370
 So if you build the whole thing 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.260
 you really have a very, very 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.270
 narrow funnel and if he same time 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.440
 head and turn as far as you can already hear 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.180
 not much anymore so that 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.250
 audio signal is extremely strong up 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.270
 Markets help first why 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.580
 you buy something like that 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.660
 imagine you 5 for example 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.010
 in very noisy place we have to 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.810
 example at the festival of lights in 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.610
 Berlin filmed that's a year 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.770
 Everything was illuminated by city 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.389
 at night and walk under the linden tree 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.520
 is the name of a four-lane street at that time 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.169
 not yet cultivated everything is open so 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.910
 extremely loud and if very much 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.080
 strong right so micro has one 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.060
 very strong smells too 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.950
 really spatially very centered then 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.300
 you just have the noise from the left and 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.770
 right off the street and can not 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.470
 or does not have to scream but can 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.030
 relatively normal to continue talking loud and has 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.590
 Still not much of this car noise 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.580
 that actually pretty cool it 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.110
 you have to say somehow 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.150
 watch as spectator left and right 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.470
 should not turn there but not for 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.669
 such special things are 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.979
 really, really, very, very, very 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.780
 nice story above not too much 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.669
 ambient sound on it so 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.289
 even if that all three now increased 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.360
 Microphones are alone because of this 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.250
 they have all other characteristics 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.050
 other uses if you just 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.520
 This mp4 use with this very narrow 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.020
 a funnel and someone is standing next to you 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.760
 and would still talk to you now 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.349
 you would hardly hear any more about it 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.010
 So I'm going to say a smile 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.139
 parry 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.940
 a very cool thing, therefore , takes everything 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.590
 your advantages and disadvantages if he like thanks 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.150
 advice to also wanted to join 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.500
 We look in the forum over there 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.880
 also another two experts in the 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.440
 area audio guarantees the judge 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.050
 a little something to explain 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.330
 otherwise it was the first video now 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.889
 on the subject of video accessories in the case 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.690
 next to ton and me is now easy 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.130
 Let's see what you would be interested 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.160
 We want to see you then in autumn 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.690
 and winter also a lot 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.010
 area video accessories do that 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.810
 Now just keep asking the question
