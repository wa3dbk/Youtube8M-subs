I'm<00:01:58.970> thinking<00:01:59.390> very<00:01:59.630> very<00:02:00.020> clearly<00:02:00.350> there's

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
I'm thinking very very clearly there's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.309 
I'm thinking very very clearly there's
no<00:02:00.860> brain<00:02:01.159> farm<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.509> that's<00:02:02.690> probably<00:02:02.990> what<00:02:03.289> I

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
no brain farm so that's probably what I

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.469 
no brain farm so that's probably what I
love<00:02:03.590> most<00:02:03.799> about<00:02:04.009> actually<00:02:04.490> starting<00:02:05.360> out
