my my eaves I think I'm going 20 inches

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.539 
my my eaves I think I'm going 20 inches
give<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> little<00:01:25.710> bit<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.979> depth<00:01:26.280> rather

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
give it a little bit of depth rather

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
give it a little bit of depth rather

truss<00:01:28.530> I'll<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.950> putting<00:01:29.159> extensions<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.780> all

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
truss I'll be putting extensions on all

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.679 
truss I'll be putting extensions on all
of<00:01:31.520> front<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> back<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.179> I<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.539> go

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
of front the back but I need to go

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.980 
of front the back but I need to go
around<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> back<00:01:34.459> and<00:01:35.459> work<00:01:35.819> just<00:01:36.179> last<00:01:36.450> trust

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
around the back and work just last trust

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
around the back and work just last trust
because<00:01:37.289> this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.560> different<00:01:38.039> stick<00:01:38.369> framing

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
because this is different stick framing

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.499 
because this is different stick framing
the<00:01:38.759> front<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.819> scab<00:01:41.819> it<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.390> the

the front I'm going to scab it on to the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.199 
the front I'm going to scab it on to the
gable<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.590> bet<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.950> mean<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> blast

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.370 
truss I'm going to scab all this bladder
framing<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.869> I'll<00:01:48.990> probably<00:01:49.109> just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
framing on there I'll probably just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.109 
framing on there I'll probably just
prefab<00:01:49.890> some<00:01:50.130> stuff<00:01:50.399> take<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.819> there<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
prefab some stuff take it up there and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.029 
prefab some stuff take it up there and
shoot<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> real<00:01:51.569> quick<00:01:51.869> versus<00:01:52.289> this<00:01:52.470> piecing

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
shoot it real quick versus this piecing

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.889 
shoot it real quick versus this piecing
it<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.310> piecing<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.819> on<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.209> I<00:01:54.239> wanted<00:01:54.569> to<00:01:54.659> have

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
it on piecing it on but I wanted to have

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.419 
it on piecing it on but I wanted to have
a<00:01:54.929> unique<00:01:55.969> bolder<00:01:56.969> look<00:01:57.890> out<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.130> front

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
a unique bolder look out in the front

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.410 
a unique bolder look out in the front
and<00:02:00.500> that's<00:02:01.500> what<00:02:01.739> I<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.129> for<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:03.030> it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and that's what I was going for but it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
and that's what I was going for but it
took<00:02:03.869> me<00:02:04.079> all<00:02:04.229> day<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:04.739> lip<00:02:04.979> didn't<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.429> here
