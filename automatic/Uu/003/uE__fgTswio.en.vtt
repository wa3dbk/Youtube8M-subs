00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 look at it and now what 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.259
 other if he plays football then there 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.610
 to fix it there to keep you yes 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.969
 and if that does not work then there's there 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 this here and so on 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 also in the european union the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 consists of the 27 countries here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.130
 do a lot in common and for that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.590
 they have very definite 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.359
 rules that apply to all for some 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
 But many people think that that will happen 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.510
 Land does not really care about this 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 rules 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.520
 we'll explain the problem to you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.710
 politicians in hungary have to say that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 were by their citizens 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 chosen as it is in the European 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.770
 should be union 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.870
 but since they are at power and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.850
 many say that they say that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 have always done things in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.680
 The European Union is not allowed 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.579
 are 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.289
 Journalists can go to Hungary for 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.600
 example not always free report 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.309
 there is, for example, the radio stations 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.590
 no permission to get permanently 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.750
 Send because the chefs are not good 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.739
 opinion of the government and that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 also say openly 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.030
 But the government wants to achieve that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.740
 the people in newspapers in the radio and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.530
 only good news on TV 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 they have noticed and now they have 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 Most politicians and quite a bit 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.320
 decided that your most important court 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.979
 have much less rights in the future 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.439
 should 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.729
 they do not do that with the court 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.040
 have more say and co-decision 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.570
 can 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.579
 whose main task is namely the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.159
 to control laws very closely 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.909
 that's what the politicians do it looks like 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.040
 quite like that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 The Hungarian politicians stick to it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.350
 sometimes not to the common rules 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.820
 The European Union 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 And that's why the European Union wants 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.590
 now check if hungarian still 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.270
 to the common rules holds if 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.659
 it could not punish the country 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.610
 give 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.399
 the european union could then hungary 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.680
 for example, give less money 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.509
 in leipzig there is just a huge one 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.369
 book fair so exciting for all the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.369
 like to read books or write
