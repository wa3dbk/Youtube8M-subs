so<00:00:10.940> we're<00:00:11.059> heading<00:00:11.240> up<00:00:11.299> to<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.420> center<00:00:11.750> tower

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
so we're heading up to the center tower

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.720 
so we're heading up to the center tower
area<00:00:12.440> to<00:00:12.530> take<00:00:12.709> some<00:00:12.920> shots<00:00:13.100> of<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.400> overall

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
area to take some shots of the overall

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.180 
area to take some shots of the overall
yard<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:14.570> we<00:00:14.930> always<00:00:15.080> have<00:00:15.709> so<00:00:15.740> many<00:00:15.920> shots

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
yard and we always have so many shots

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.340 
yard and we always have so many shots
around<00:00:16.490> here<00:00:16.640> you<00:00:16.940> know<00:00:16.970> that<00:00:17.300> we<00:00:18.110> kind<00:00:18.260> of

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
around here you know that we kind of

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.870 
around here you know that we kind of
spotted<00:00:18.710> this<00:00:18.770> little<00:00:19.039> window<00:00:19.160> on<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.490> way<00:00:19.699> up

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
spotted this little window on the way up

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.270 
spotted this little window on the way up
inside<00:00:20.060> to<00:00:20.449> stop<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:20.930> get<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:21.860> shot<00:00:22.100> of<00:00:22.130> this

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
inside to stop and get a shot of this

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.040 
inside to stop and get a shot of this
thing<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:23.000> real<00:00:23.180> nice<00:00:23.390> perspective<00:00:23.630> line

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
thing the real nice perspective line

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.570 
thing the real nice perspective line
through<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.500> frame<00:00:24.950> which<00:00:25.190> is<00:00:25.310> always<00:00:25.460> a

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
through the frame which is always a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.040 
through the frame which is always a
great<00:00:25.730> compositional<00:00:26.390> technique<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:26.930> know

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
great compositional technique you know

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.130 
great compositional technique you know
and<00:00:27.520> took<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.550> single<00:00:28.970> shot<00:00:29.150> just<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.810> check<00:00:29.990> it

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
and took a single shot just to check it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.830 
and took a single shot just to check it
out<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.880> first<00:00:32.090> part<00:00:32.329> was<00:00:32.450> fine<00:00:32.689> but

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
out and the the first part was fine but

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.569 
out and the the first part was fine but
the<00:00:32.989> inside<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.920> bright<00:00:34.160> part<00:00:34.430> which<00:00:34.550> is

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
the inside the bright part which is

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.189 
the inside the bright part which is
blown<00:00:34.850> out<00:00:35.030> white<00:00:35.270> just<00:00:35.600> completely<00:00:35.960> blown

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
blown out white just completely blown

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.490 
blown out white just completely blown
out<00:00:36.379> so<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:37.640> an<00:00:37.760> HDR<00:00:38.120> candidate<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.410> we're

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
out so this is an HDR candidate so we're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.350 
out so this is an HDR candidate so we're
going<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.680> go<00:00:39.739> ahead<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.370> fire<00:00:40.820> off<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.060> series

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
going to go ahead and fire off a series

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.780 
going to go ahead and fire off a series
of<00:00:41.540> shots<00:00:41.780> I'm<00:00:42.710> going<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:42.950> take<00:00:43.100> just<00:00:43.130> one<00:00:43.399> like

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
of shots I'm going to take just one like

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.520 
of shots I'm going to take just one like
I<00:00:43.880> normally<00:00:43.970> do<00:00:44.420> aperture<00:00:44.780> priority<00:00:44.960> matrix

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
I normally do aperture priority matrix

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.400 
I normally do aperture priority matrix
metering<00:00:45.950> on<00:00:46.310> meter<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.210> no<00:00:47.450> plus<00:00:47.750> no<00:00:48.020> mind<00:00:48.260> is

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
metering on meter so no plus no mind is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.049 
metering on meter so no plus no mind is
to<00:00:48.560> see<00:00:48.680> what<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.890> camera<00:00:49.100> thinks<00:00:49.520> average<00:00:49.880> is

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
to see what the camera thinks average is

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.940 
to see what the camera thinks average is
that's<00:00:50.780> kind<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.140> first<00:00:51.320> step<00:00:51.470> here<00:00:51.770> so

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
that's kind of the first step here so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.090 
that's kind of the first step here so
we're<00:00:52.070> going<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.250> fire<00:00:52.399> that<00:00:52.579> off<00:00:53.770> these<00:00:54.770> cable

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
we're going to fire that off these cable

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.660 
we're going to fire that off these cable
released<00:00:55.340> by<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.460> way<00:00:55.670> very<00:00:56.510> important<00:00:56.899> and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
released by the way very important and

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.479 
released by the way very important and
again<00:00:59.559> that's<00:01:00.559> what<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:00.800> had<00:01:00.890> before<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:01.399> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
again that's what I had before so the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.630 
again that's what I had before so the
histogram<00:01:01.910> says<00:01:02.270> that<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:03.250> spiking<00:01:04.250> up<00:01:04.489> the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
histogram says that it's spiking up the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.130 
histogram says that it's spiking up the
right<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.180> it's<00:01:05.299> kind<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:05.509> blown<00:01:05.719> out<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:05.960> little

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
right so it's kind of blown out a little

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.309 
right so it's kind of blown out a little
bit<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.210> it's<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.479> little<00:01:08.719> bit<00:01:08.840> dark<00:01:09.109> when<00:01:09.259> the

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:09.319 
bit and it's a little bit dark when the

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.539 
bit and it's a little bit dark when the
other<00:01:09.469> side<00:01:09.709> so<00:01:09.859> I'm<00:01:09.920> going<00:01:10.069> to<00:01:10.130> take<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.429> down

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
other side so I'm going to take it down

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.179 
other side so I'm going to take it down
a<00:01:10.609> couple<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:11.060> stops<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:12.100> bring<00:01:13.100> the

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
a couple of stops to bring the

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.219 
a couple of stops to bring the
highlights<00:01:13.609> down<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.030> i<00:01:14.090> have<00:01:14.450> like<00:01:15.020> i<00:01:15.109> said

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
highlights down so i have like i said

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.020 
highlights down so i have like i said
before<00:01:15.319> one<00:01:15.770> shot<00:01:16.069> with<00:01:16.399> all<00:01:16.609> of<00:01:16.939> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
before one shot with all of the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.010 
before one shot with all of the
highlights<00:01:17.209> inside<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.049> histogram<00:01:18.499> and

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
highlights inside the histogram and

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.260 
highlights inside the histogram and
we're<00:01:21.020> going<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.229> get<00:01:21.289> down<00:01:21.469> one<00:01:21.679> more<00:01:21.889> and

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
we're going to get down one more and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.449 
we're going to get down one more and
what<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.299> will<00:01:23.600> do<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:24.289> that<00:01:24.499> will<00:01:24.679> bring

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
what that will do is is that will bring

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.249 
what that will do is is that will bring
in<00:01:25.520> detail<00:01:26.060> in<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.299> distant<00:01:26.659> bright<00:01:26.899> part<00:01:27.170> of

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
in detail in that distant bright part of

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.330 
in detail in that distant bright part of
the<00:01:27.319> image<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:27.649> was<00:01:27.709> blown<00:01:27.920> out<00:01:27.950> with<00:01:28.279> a

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
the image that was blown out with a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.639 
the image that was blown out with a
single<00:01:28.549> shot<00:01:30.219> here<00:01:31.219> we<00:01:31.310> go<00:01:31.719> we<00:01:32.719> do<00:01:32.899> one<00:01:33.319> more
