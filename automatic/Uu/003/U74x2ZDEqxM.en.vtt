 biancazzurri started at a corner of 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.779
 nothing on which gianluca sports one 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.789
 twist of the past 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.919
 so it's the same vials to start 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.050
 the thrust of di livio but tempts us 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.140
 the advance in split but fails to 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.679
 avoid the own goal in the stands around 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720
 to boniperti 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.370
 we see the festive atmosphere of when i 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.309
 Juventus rejoiced like the Milan club 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.680

 show off the smiles of the advancing new 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.690
 after a quarter of an hour the Lazio already loses 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.179
 3 to 0 and only halfway through the race it gives 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.739
 the impression of returning to the game 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.260
 gentlemen on to welcome porrini e 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.449
 beats for use the scream of rattles 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.239
 twenty years on the bench is worth as one 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.920
 threat but rocchi launches vialli that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.980
 he finds a Marchese on his way 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.980
 uncertain shooting bypass lob e 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.140
 the second goal personal thing done 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.170
 top lazes the Lazio or e in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.190
 the juventus counterattack takes advantage of it 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.320
 torricelli replaces the falling one 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.640
 julio cesar and allows the avenues of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.700
 to rehearse the blow to the fly of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.890
 left for the future hairpin who knows who it is 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 the number 94 network in ten years of 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.280
 maximum division 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.050
 boniperti seems to give a suggestion to 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.970
 bags in the stands watching 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.670
 also pleased that thirty with the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.340
 shirt number 9 the goleada ends 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.890
 with two solos at no cue the first 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.170
 and of the excellent livio that may serve May 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.910
 the blue creates and nobody between bonoms 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.810
 excluding cravero and bacci is able to 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.240
 to destroy 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.070
 and the masterpiece goal of 6 to 1 that 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.610
 revisit through the microphone of 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.610
 free on the coast 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.390
 second goal bags in the grandstand a 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.570
 The applauded moment was a highlight 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.380
 maybe of this party but it was nice 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:17.530
 and I believe that bags at gestures prices 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.810
 so technicians of a certain type is 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.930
 normal that I produced but not 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.370
 I believe that applause can determine 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.850
 in the future choices rather than 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.850
 other choices
