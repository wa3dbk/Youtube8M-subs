depends<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> want<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.830> date<00:00:29.010> these

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
depends on where you want to date these

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.999 
depends on where you want to date these
all<00:00:29.970> these<00:00:30.179> various<00:00:30.539> Gospels<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
all these various Gospels as you as you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.090 
all these various Gospels as you as you
rightly<00:00:32.340> say<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.800> more<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.950> more

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
rightly say there are more and more

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.690 
rightly say there are more and more
people<00:00:35.540> focusing<00:00:36.540> attention<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:37.700> non

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
people focusing attention on non

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.880 
people focusing attention on non
canonical<00:00:39.059> Gospels<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> question<00:00:41.370> is

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
canonical Gospels but the question is

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.610 
canonical Gospels but the question is
what<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> dating<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.579> these<00:00:44.700> Gospels<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
what is the dating of these Gospels and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.869 
what is the dating of these Gospels and
to<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.739> extent<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.280> dependent<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to what extent are they dependent on the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
to what extent are they dependent on the
canonical<00:00:48.360> Gospels<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.170> forth<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
canonical Gospels and so forth but I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
canonical Gospels and so forth but I
think<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.629> back<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
think here we have to go back to the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
think here we have to go back to the
fact<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> original<00:00:52.710> Gospels<00:00:53.430> better

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
fact that the original Gospels better

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.319 
fact that the original Gospels better
say<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> four<00:00:54.480> canonical<00:00:54.780> Gospels<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:56.329> in

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
say that four canonical Gospels are in

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.860 
say that four canonical Gospels are in
fact<00:00:58.190> closely<00:00:59.190> connected<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.300> Apostles

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
fact closely connected with the Apostles

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
fact closely connected with the Apostles
and<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:02.010> co-workers<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.699> Apostles<00:01:03.239> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and the co-workers of the Apostles so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.109 
and the co-workers of the Apostles so
you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.460> Matthew<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.670> example<00:01:07.939> one<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you know Matthew for example one of the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.000 
you know Matthew for example one of the
Apostles<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.900> John<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> the

Apostles now that doesn't necessarily

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.060 
Apostles now that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.049> gospel<00:01:13.409> says<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.920> them

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
mean that the gospel says we have them

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
would not be there and you have them

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
would not be there and you have them
mark<00:01:21.960> relying<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> authority<00:01:23.460> of

mark relying on the on the authority of
Peter<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.080> Luke<00:01:26.090> associated

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
Peter and then you have Luke associated

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
Peter and then you have Luke associated
with<00:01:27.210> Paul<00:01:27.509> by<00:01:28.049> virtue<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> traveling<00:01:28.829> with

Paul<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.340> his<00:01:29.490> companion<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.110> the

centuries<00:01:58.189> you're<00:01:59.189> saying<00:01:59.520> looked<00:01:59.939> back

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
centuries you're saying looked back

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.170 
centuries you're saying looked back
beyond<00:02:01.469> these<00:02:01.710> other<00:02:01.979> Gospels<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
beyond these other Gospels to the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.179 
beyond these other Gospels to the
earliest<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.350> most<00:02:04.530> primitive<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
earliest the most primitive and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.940 
earliest the most primitive and
therefore<00:02:05.820> authoritative<00:02:06.329> Gospels<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
therefore authoritative Gospels is that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.650 
therefore authoritative Gospels is that
is<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.399> accurate<00:02:08.670> account<00:02:09.030> yes<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.599> think

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
is that an accurate account yes I think

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.540 
is that an accurate account yes I think
that's<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.200> that's<00:02:10.500> correct<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
that's right that's correct and the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.240 
that's right that's correct and the

apostolic Authority or the authority of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.250 
an of a co-worker or an associate of the
Apostles<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:55.970> would<00:02:56.330> say<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.140> case

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
Apostles so I would say that in the case

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.300 
Apostles so I would say that in the case
of<00:02:57.440> documents<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:57.920> don't<00:02:58.100> know<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
of documents we don't know the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.180 
of documents we don't know the
authorship<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:58.910> for<00:02:59.060> example<00:02:59.150> Hebrews

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
authorship but for example Hebrews

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.500 
authorship but for example Hebrews
whoever<00:03:01.190> wrote<00:03:01.459> Hebrews<00:03:01.670> was<00:03:02.060> either<00:03:02.239> an

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
whoever wrote Hebrews was either an

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.930 
whoever wrote Hebrews was either an
apostle<00:03:03.050> or<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.320> co-worker<00:03:04.160> an<00:03:04.459> apostle

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
apostle or a co-worker an apostle

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.610 
apostle or a co-worker an apostle
because<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.239> think<00:03:05.480> that's<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.440> main

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
because I think that's the the main

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.190 
because I think that's the the main
criterion<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.340> canonicity<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.870> this

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
criterion of canonicity is this

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.460 
criterion of canonicity is this
apostolic<00:03:09.790> Authority<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.570> so<00:03:11.930> how<00:03:12.080> accurate

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
apostolic Authority so so how accurate

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.310 
apostolic Authority so so how accurate
is<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.739> story<00:03:13.100> that<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.540> Canon<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.110> New

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
is the story that the the Canon the New

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.199 
is the story that the the Canon the New
Testament<00:03:15.739> books<00:03:16.160> will<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:16.940> put<00:03:17.090> together

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
Testament books will just put together

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.560 
Testament books will just put together
in<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.959> 4th<00:03:18.140> century<00:03:18.350> man<00:03:19.250> made<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.940> political

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
in the 4th century man made a political

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.590 
in the 4th century man made a political
agenda<00:03:20.660> behind<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.060> formation<00:03:23.540> of

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
agenda behind it the the formation of

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.539 
agenda behind it the the formation of
the<00:03:23.690> Canon<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.170> long<00:03:24.470> historical<00:03:24.860> process

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
the Canon is a long historical process

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.240 
the Canon is a long historical process
and<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:26.360> already<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.830> Canon

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and you already have the Canon

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.670 
and you already have the Canon
information<00:03:29.080> at<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> end<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.470> first

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
information at the end of the first

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.229 
information at the end of the first
century<00:03:30.920> for<00:03:31.190> example<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.670> think<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.120> the

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
century for example I think that the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.360 
century for example I think that the
letters<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.660> Paul<00:03:32.870> are<00:03:33.530> collected<00:03:34.040> quite

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
letters of Paul are collected quite

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.690 
letters of Paul are collected quite
early<00:03:34.549> already<00:03:34.910> in<00:03:35.299> 80<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.500> year<00:03:36.830> 80<00:03:37.250> 85

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
early already in 80 in the year 80 85

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.289 
early already in 80 in the year 80 85
before<00:03:38.420> first<00:03:38.690> Clement<00:03:40.030> palling<00:03:41.030> letters

of the Pauline letters and regarded it
was<00:05:16.669> just<00:05:16.849> this<00:05:17.710> characteristic<00:05:18.710> idea<00:05:19.250> that

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
was just this characteristic idea that

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.420 
was just this characteristic idea that
that<00:05:20.599> the<00:05:20.779> Gnostics<00:05:21.199> had<00:05:21.440> that<00:05:22.069> the<00:05:22.219> god<00:05:22.400> of

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
the Old Testament was a different god

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.610 
the Old Testament was a different god
from<00:05:24.139> the<00:05:24.199> god<00:05:24.409> of<00:05:24.439> the<00:05:24.620> New<00:05:24.770> Testament<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:26.620> so

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
from the god of the New Testament and so

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.100 
from the god of the New Testament and so
you<00:05:27.680> have<00:05:28.150> something<00:05:29.150> quite<00:05:29.449> different<00:05:29.659> going

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
you have something quite different going
