because<00:00:47.850> i<00:00:48.059> don't<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.230> looks<00:00:49.410> but

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
because i don't like how it looks but

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.580 
because i don't like how it looks but
the<00:00:49.860> concept<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.879> very<00:00:51.270> nice<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.289> would

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the concept is very nice so I would

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.010 
the concept is very nice so I would
probably<00:00:53.780> order<00:00:55.129> another<00:00:56.210> another<00:00:57.210> mold<00:00:57.660> but

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
probably order another another mold but

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
probably order another another mold but
just<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.820> how<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.329> look

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
just not this one this is how they look

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.369 
just not this one this is how they look
from<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> side<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.760> tell<00:01:03.019> this<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
from the side so as you can tell this is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.750 
from the side so as you can tell this is
not<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:05.810> puffy<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.130> don't<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.640> are

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
not very puffy I don't think they are

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.500 
not very puffy I don't think they are
ugly<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.450> anything<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.680> not

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
ugly or anything but they are just not

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.010 
ugly or anything but they are just not
the<00:01:12.510> ones<00:01:12.689> i<00:01:12.990> expected<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.330> next<00:01:15.630> item

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
set if you asks me if I could do more 3d

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.500 
set if you asks me if I could do more 3d
nail<00:01:56.210> designs<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:59.150> more

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
nail designs so I have to have more

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.950 
nail designs so I have to have more
acrylics<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.830> have<00:02:01.340> some<00:02:01.640> colors<00:02:02.090> but<00:02:02.420> they

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
acrylics and I have some colors but they

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.490 
acrylics and I have some colors but they
are<00:02:03.520> more<00:02:04.520> sheer<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.990> think<00:02:06.260> those<00:02:06.470> are

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
are more sheer and I think those are

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.400 
are more sheer and I think those are
opaque<00:02:07.160> I<00:02:07.490> saw<00:02:07.910> them<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.209> lot<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.690> internet

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
opaque I saw them a lot in the internet

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.730 
opaque I saw them a lot in the internet
and<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:10.280> think<00:02:10.820> they<00:02:11.030> are<00:02:11.240> good<00:02:11.630> because<00:02:11.930> there

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
and I think they are good because there

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.300 
and I think they are good because there
were<00:02:12.920> many<00:02:13.220> positive<00:02:14.000> reviews<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.780> them<00:02:15.310> so

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
were many positive reviews of them so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.030 
were many positive reviews of them so
I'm<00:02:16.490> looking<00:02:16.730> very<00:02:17.390> forward<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.410> use<00:02:18.680> those

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
