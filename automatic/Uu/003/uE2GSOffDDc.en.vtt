was first developed and used in Italy so
there's<00:01:25.200> still<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> few<00:01:25.619> things<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.159> Italian

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there's still a few things in Italian

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
there's still a few things in Italian
which<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.049> knew<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> Italian<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.130> card

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
which if I knew the Italian for one card

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.260 
which if I knew the Italian for one card
I<00:01:29.490> guess<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.700> could<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.909> said<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.119> instead

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
I guess I could have said that instead

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
I guess I could have said that instead
of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> French<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.560> don't<00:01:31.740> speak<00:01:31.950> any

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of the French but if you don't speak any

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.260 
of the French but if you don't speak any
italian<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:32.790> speak<00:01:33.030> another

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
italian or if you don't speak another

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.359 
italian or if you don't speak another
language<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.380> french<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
language like we do with french you

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.410 
language like we do with french you
might<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:35.820> difficulty<00:01:36.299> getting

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
through some of the menus you know some

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.950 
through some of the menus you know some
of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> things<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.119> adding<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> new<00:01:39.540> car<00:01:39.810> to

some<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> developers<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.890> expanded<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
some of the developers have expanded it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.740 
some of the developers have expanded it
to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> United<00:01:44.970> States<00:01:45.180> they've<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> new

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
office in San Francisco which is very

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
office in San Francisco which is very
exciting<00:01:47.460> especially<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> developers

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
exciting especially for the developers

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
exciting especially for the developers
and<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.590> time<00:01:49.829> progresses<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.790> hope<00:01:50.970> that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and so as time progresses we hope that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
and so as time progresses we hope that
we'll<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.750> English<00:01:52.470> support<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> full

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
we'll see more English support a full

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
we'll see more English support a full
translation<00:01:53.490> would<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.880> nice<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.720> wouldn't

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
translation would be nice that wouldn't

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
translation would be nice that wouldn't
take<00:01:55.079> long<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> developers<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> sit

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
take long to the developers just to sit

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
take long to the developers just to sit
down<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.210> native<00:01:57.360> speaker<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.049> iron<00:01:58.320> some

this<00:02:13.709> in<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> UK<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.459> hope<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.180> future

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
this in the UK I hope is in the future

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.199 
this in the UK I hope is in the future
and<00:02:15.990> maybe<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.380> not<00:02:16.560> I'd<00:02:16.770> /<00:02:17.069> they<00:02:17.160> know<00:02:17.340> but

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
and maybe it's not I'd / they know but

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.870 
and maybe it's not I'd / they know but
if<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.810> were<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:18.990> case<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.770> get<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> map

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
if that were the case you can get a map

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.430 
if that were the case you can get a map
of<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> area<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.540> then<00:02:21.690> all<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.840> these<00:02:22.050> offers

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
of the area and then all of these offers

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
of the area and then all of these offers
will<00:02:22.650> appear<00:02:22.980> here<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:24.060> map<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.569> you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
will appear here on the map and so you

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.330 
will appear here on the map and so you
can<00:02:24.780> simply<00:02:25.080> go<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.620> location<00:02:26.160> that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
can simply go to the location that

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.100 
can simply go to the location that
you're<00:02:26.790> looking<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.750> show<00:02:27.990> them

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
you're looking for and go in show them

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.600 
you're looking for and go in show them
the<00:02:28.200> coupon<00:02:28.319> etc<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.520> have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the coupon etc so you have to have

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.580 
the coupon etc so you have to have
participating<00:02:30.330> partners<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.319> lot<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.530> this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
participating partners for a lot of this

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.320 
participating partners for a lot of this
application<00:02:31.739> which<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.280> again<00:02:32.700> something

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
application which is again something

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.180 
application which is again something
that's<00:02:33.630> not<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> United

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
that's not really here in the United

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.710 
that's not really here in the United
States<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.670> yet<00:02:35.880> not<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.300> ground<00:02:36.510> we

the<00:02:42.150> card<00:02:42.510> aspect<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.470> walk<00:02:43.709> because

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the card aspect of this walk because

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.680 
the card aspect of this walk because
despite<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.580> fact<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.850> these<00:02:45.060> these<00:02:45.450> items

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
despite the fact that these these items

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.180 
despite the fact that these these items
are<00:02:45.870> really<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.800> they<00:02:46.980> are<00:02:47.040> really

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
are really you know they are really

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.160 
are really you know they are really
functioning<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.750> rest<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.110> this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
functioning but the rest of this

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
functioning but the rest of this
application<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.800> still<00:02:50.160> worth<00:02:50.370> looking<00:02:50.790> into

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
application is still worth looking into

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.759 
application is still worth looking into
