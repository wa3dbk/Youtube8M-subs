healthy<00:00:19.119> wheels<00:00:20.289> just<00:00:21.289> take<00:00:21.500> your<00:00:21.649> wheels<00:00:21.859> and

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
healthy wheels just take your wheels and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.400 
healthy wheels just take your wheels and
check<00:00:22.550> if<00:00:22.759> they<00:00:22.910> are<00:00:22.939> aligned<00:00:23.359> because<00:00:24.079> if

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
check if they are aligned because if

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.810 
check if they are aligned because if
wheels<00:00:24.619> are<00:00:24.739> not<00:00:24.800> aligned<00:00:25.160> they<00:00:25.489> will<00:00:25.609> wear

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
wheels are not aligned they will wear

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.929 
wheels are not aligned they will wear
out<00:00:26.059> and<00:00:26.269> stress<00:00:26.719> on<00:00:26.989> the<00:00:27.109> engine<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.250> just<00:00:28.730> go

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
out and stress on the engine so just go

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.549 
out and stress on the engine so just go
ahead<00:00:28.969> take<00:00:29.599> a<00:00:29.630> look<00:00:29.899> at<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.079> wheels<00:00:30.289> and

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.559 
ahead take a look at the wheels and

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.139 
ahead take a look at the wheels and
check<00:00:31.070> if<00:00:31.250> they<00:00:31.369> are<00:00:31.399> parallel<00:00:31.759> to<00:00:31.820> each<00:00:32.059> other

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
check if they are parallel to each other

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.299 
check if they are parallel to each other
and<00:00:32.390> perpendicular<00:00:32.809> from<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.409> ground<00:00:33.649> if

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
and perpendicular from the ground if

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:43.500 
and perpendicular from the ground if
they<00:00:34.579> are<00:00:34.699> you're<00:00:35.149> good<00:00:35.269> to<00:00:35.360> go

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.850

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
sometimes it's a simple thing that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.220 
sometimes it's a simple thing that
matters<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.300> like<00:00:47.300> when<00:00:47.630> you're<00:00:47.750> going<00:00:48.080> out

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
matters you like when you're going out

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.870

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
of the road and you're stuck at signal

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.420 
of the road and you're stuck at signal
just<00:00:50.750> turn<00:00:50.930> off<00:00:51.050> your<00:00:51.140> engine<00:00:51.470> if<00:00:52.130> this

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
just turn off your engine if this

duration of the signals around 120

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.170 
duration of the signals around 120
seconds<00:00:54.710> or<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:54.920> just<00:00:55.580> turn<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:55.820> off

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
seconds or so just turn it off

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.330 
seconds or so just turn it off
there's<00:00:56.690> no<00:00:56.810> use<00:00:57.080> in<00:00:57.350> keep<00:00:57.620> your<00:00:57.650> engine<00:00:57.950> idle

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.960 

you<00:01:39.770> want<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.040> make<00:01:40.190> sure<00:01:40.400> that<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.729> have<00:01:40.880> to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
you want to make sure that you have to

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.910 
you want to make sure that you have to
stop<00:01:41.210> using<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.690> clutch<00:01:41.900> while<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:42.740> write

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
stop using the clutch while you write

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.730 
stop using the clutch while you write
because<00:01:43.700> when<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.630> overuse<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.140> clutch<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
because when you overuse the clutch the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.410 
because when you overuse the clutch the
engine<00:01:45.950> overheats<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.580> when<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.000> happens

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
engine overheats and when that happens

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.640 
engine overheats and when that happens
you'll<00:01:47.750> be<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.020> guy<00:01:48.110> on<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.259> side<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
you'll be the guy on the side of the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.289 
you'll be the guy on the side of the
road<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:49.100> don't<00:01:49.670> want<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.850> be<00:01:49.940> that<00:01:50.119> guy

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
road and you don't want to be that guy

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.170 
road and you don't want to be that guy
so<00:01:51.140> from<00:01:51.320> now<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:51.650> avoid<00:01:52.220> using<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.759> clutch<00:01:53.000> as

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
so from now on avoid using the clutch as

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.639 
so from now on avoid using the clutch as
much<00:01:53.330> as<00:01:53.479> possible<00:01:53.659> while<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.380> write<00:01:59.649> I'm

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
much as possible while you write I'm

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.230 
much as possible while you write I'm
