00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 More a tip for you guys there. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.780
 scania engine brake is 440 pt pt cruiser 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:15.890
 here as I said in previous videos 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 the engine brake off on 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.689
 there it stays connected constantly or 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.890
 whether it will be combined with the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.250
 brake 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.010
 Are you going to take an initial internship here? 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.760
 ally mechanical brake of the Frei 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.329
 motor 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.710
 If you press it, you'll start the brake. 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.420
 in the zone 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.420
 here only the engine brake 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.309
 the mow will get here, it will stay 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.039
 driving the brake-motor for this you 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.520
 to believe 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.520
 The button 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.699
 another detail there is enough the villain is 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 next to pec and I made a cut of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.840
 Team gets softer Maria Vian 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:09.510
 capital to the valley on that valve there 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 it drives the engine brake if you also 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.220
 Do you have to be a saw? 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.970
 I think I'll let it hold the brake. 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 motor 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.950
 just click on that sensor there I 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.590
 I said stay here on the side of the pedal. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.030
 where would be the clutch pedal you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.310
 step here 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.970
 the noice he automatically goes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.780
 to choose a gear the brake-motor 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 insured you have there not the tenth 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.240
 want to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 who is infected at 15 o'clock does not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.100
 sensor it will change the gear goes down 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.310
 one march and two or three whatever 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.979
 necessary up here for him to have 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.490
 more efficient engine braking or not 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:04.930
 need to change the gear that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.660
 on the lever had that would be in the case 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.110
 here you could manually download or 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.610
 then there is no need to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.170
 If you are going down the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.830
 way down very fast 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.150
 you only have to turn that side 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.540
 right foot nipple came up then just 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.180
 dust is enough to trigger your grandmother 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.720
 there it will automatically reduce 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.019
 the march and will choose a march 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.790
 for lowering the engine brake 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.549
 you drowsiness can take you can 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 hold on if you give a single touch 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.739
 it will reduce the gait it will stay 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.049
 that march until he passed the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.730
 account turns when he sees that he goes 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.819
 pass here will jump off machico that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.019
 it 's going from extreme rotation 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.269
 of the vehicle that will happen when it 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.030
 you see that the engine is forcing too much 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.099
 It has passed the limit it will turn out 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.860
 have a seventh of a clothes goes 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.680
 go through the 8th to the 9th and turning will 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.380
 down here is coming down a lot 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.049
 new naval visa floor and jup 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.370
 goes here in the blue strip where the 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:22.579
 engine brake efficiency then lowered side 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.690
 to the 9th below with the basket with the fifth and 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:30.200
 came here will honor and you can use the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.100
 brake mechanical brake also with 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.099
 the motor brake 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.299
 if you remain holding the valve 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.049
 zinho 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:41.599
 he will stay in that gear there until 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.489
 you finish the descent but if you just 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.130
 He tapped on the valve 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.069
 he goes as if he had lowered the march 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.799
 will go down a gear and will vim come 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.889
 up here because the engine brake it 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.169
 works efficiently the higher 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.900
 had the most efficient turning of the brake 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.459
 engine will be correct so it goes 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.010
 come over here on ikea will be the 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.230
 safety to hold the engine brake 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.440
 stepped on the ball it will reduce a 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.209
 two or three males to call if it is 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.570
 suitable for brake efficiency 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.960
 and you can also use it here. 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.380
 only what is he 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.610
 change the case to the march it goes alone 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.660
 the engine brake and you can also 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.640
 download a lever 0 so that he 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.540
 may have greater brake efficiency 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:40.980
 engine then arriving arriving and 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:43.350
 raining here so you come in 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.000
 you just step down if naval there that 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:51.920
 he will find the correct gear for the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.420
 engine braking efficiency and seeing there O 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.030
 will also have an exhaust type 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.450
 engineer will lock oo occurred was 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.880
 motor beauty may not be much 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.640
 technically explained but it is basically 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.710
 leave if anyone has any advice 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.740
 something to clarify the most may 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:15.020
 post to comments anthony something 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.020
 and add more beauty guys
