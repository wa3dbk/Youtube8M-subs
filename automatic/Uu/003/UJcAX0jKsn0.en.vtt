okay so we have a Samsung Refrigerator

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.000 
okay so we have a Samsung Refrigerator
here<00:00:04.290> it's<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.859> Rs<00:00:05.480> 265<00:00:06.480> model<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.560> issue<00:00:07.740> we

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
here it's a Rs 265 model the issue we

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.190 
here it's a Rs 265 model the issue we
were<00:00:08.099> having<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:08.730> we<00:00:09.269> were<00:00:09.389> down<00:00:09.570> here<00:00:09.599> we

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
were having is that we were down here we

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.039 
were having is that we were down here we
were<00:00:10.320> reading<00:00:11.179> 36<00:00:12.179> degrees<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
were reading 36 degrees on the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.079 
were reading 36 degrees on the
refrigerator<00:00:13.410> itself<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.700> when<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:14.910> came

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
refrigerator itself but when we came

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.590 
refrigerator itself but when we came
inside<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.850> thermometer<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.150> there<00:00:18.300> we

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
inside we have a thermometer in there we

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.720 
inside we have a thermometer in there we
were<00:00:18.690> reading<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.320> 57<00:00:20.039> degrees<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.670> were

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
were reading about 57 degrees so we were

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.630 
were reading about 57 degrees so we were
losing<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> food<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.160> started<00:00:23.460> doing

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
losing a lot of food so we started doing

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.250 
losing a lot of food so we started doing
a<00:00:23.670> little<00:00:23.789> research<00:00:23.910> online<00:00:24.390> figured<00:00:25.109> out

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
a little research online figured out

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.900 
a little research online figured out
that<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.680> evaporative<00:00:26.340> system<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
that the evaporative system for the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.670 
that the evaporative system for the
refrigerator<00:00:27.480> side<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> likely<00:00:28.470> cause

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
refrigerator side was to likely cause

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
refrigerator side was to likely cause
the<00:00:28.890> problem<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.210> back<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.689> there<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the problem and it's back in there and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
the problem and it's back in there and
behind<00:00:31.349> where<00:00:31.650> your<00:00:31.769> crisper<00:00:32.130> shelves

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
behind where your crisper shelves

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.650 
behind where your crisper shelves
usually<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.420> I've

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
usually are so as you can see I've

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840 
usually are so as you can see I've
already<00:00:36.750> removed<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.380> shelves<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.489> there

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
already removed my shelves from in there

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.220 
already removed my shelves from in there
and<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.079> your

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and if you're going to do this on your

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.400 
and if you're going to do this on your
own<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.620> doesn't<00:00:40.649> require<00:00:41.070> an<00:00:41.370> awful<00:00:41.579> lot<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
own it doesn't require an awful lot of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.040 
own it doesn't require an awful lot of
technical<00:00:43.410> know-how<00:00:44.149> but<00:00:45.149> someone<00:00:45.870> who's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
technical know-how but someone who's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.900 
technical know-how but someone who's
reasonably<00:00:47.039> good<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.309> hand<00:00:47.550> tools<00:00:47.670> could

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
reasonably good with hand tools could

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.150 
reasonably good with hand tools could
probably<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.510> their<00:00:48.629> own<00:00:48.980> most<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
probably do it on their own most of the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
probably do it on their own most of the
time<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> issue<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:51.180> running<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
time the issue I was running into is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.790 
time the issue I was running into is
that<00:00:52.289> people<00:00:52.530> were<00:00:52.620> having<00:00:52.770> their<00:00:53.070> zeiss<00:00:53.370> up

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
that people were having their zeiss up

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
that people were having their zeiss up
which<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:55.920> keep<00:00:56.129> air<00:00:56.579> flow<00:00:56.850> from<00:00:57.629> going

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
which would keep air flow from going

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.599 
which would keep air flow from going
past<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> coils<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.770> cause<00:00:58.980> everything<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
past the coils and cause everything to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
past the coils and cause everything to
freeze<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.600> don't<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.500> was<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
freeze up I don't think that was the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.959 
freeze up I don't think that was the
issue<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.219> buil<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.609> into<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
issue with my buil get into that in a

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.549 
issue with my buil get into that in a
minute

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
minute

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.620 
minute
so<00:01:04.559> once<00:01:04.799> you've<00:01:05.010> removed<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.970> crisper

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
so once you've removed your crisper

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.910 
so once you've removed your crisper
shelves<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.619> pulled<00:01:07.799> all

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
shelves all down here and pulled all

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.260 
shelves all down here and pulled all
this<00:01:08.070> stuff<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> fairly<00:01:08.970> simple

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this stuff out which is fairly simple

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.179 
this stuff out which is fairly simple
there<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.110> two<00:01:10.350> screws<00:01:10.619> down<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
there are two screws down here in the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.050 
there are two screws down here in the
bottom<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:13.860> two<00:01:14.100> screws<00:01:14.369> Midway<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.880> in

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
bottom and then two screws Midway up in

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.219 
bottom and then two screws Midway up in
these<00:01:15.210> holes<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.049> they're

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
these holes right in here they're

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.450 
these holes right in here they're
recessed<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:16.950> you'll<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
recessed in so you'll have to get the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
recessed in so you'll have to get the
phillips<00:01:18.000> screwdriver<00:01:18.270> room<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> fairly

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
phillips screwdriver room with a fairly

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.550 
phillips screwdriver room with a fairly
long<00:01:19.350> bit<00:01:20.090> then<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:21.960> light<00:01:22.200> covers

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
long bit then there are two light covers

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
long bit then there are two light covers
that<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.189> over<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.549> LEDs<00:01:23.909> i've<00:01:24.630> already

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
that go here over your LEDs i've already

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.609 
that go here over your LEDs i've already
completed<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.290> repair<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.759> those<00:01:26.939> are<00:01:27.030> off

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
completed my repair so those are off

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
completed my repair so those are off
already<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.909> up<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> corners<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
already but up here in the corners you

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.330 
already but up here in the corners you
can<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.590> hand<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.920> there's<00:01:32.189> another

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
can see where my hand is there's another

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.719 
can see where my hand is there's another
set<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.640> screw<00:01:32.820> holes<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.240> either<00:01:33.329> side<00:01:33.630> here

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
set of screw holes on either side here

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.429 
set of screw holes on either side here
you<00:01:35.729> should<00:01:36.060> probably<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.840> best<00:01:37.020> practice

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you should probably for best practice

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.410 
you should probably for best practice
unplug<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.310> refrigerator<00:01:38.820> before<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> do

problems it's been having on its own and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.510 
problems it's been having on its own and
second<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.860> will<00:01:49.860> probably<00:01:50.159> be<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
second of all will probably be the

second of all will probably be the
safest<00:01:50.909> thing<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.659> are

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
safest thing to do because there are

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.200 
safest thing to do because there are
electric<00:01:52.079> components<00:01:52.409> behind<00:01:52.909> once<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.000> open

will shut itself down and does take a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.080 
will shut itself down and does take a
little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> force<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.060> of

likely culprit you can see I've got a

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.929 
likely culprit you can see I've got a
little<00:03:02.599> bit<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.840> frost<00:03:03.470> down<00:03:03.709> here<00:03:03.980> that's

blocking a drain hole let's make sure

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.580 
blocking a drain hole let's make sure
out<00:03:08.060> from<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.569> refrigerator<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.349> you<00:03:09.379> may

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
out from the refrigerator so you may

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.229 
out from the refrigerator so you may
want<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.799> manually<00:03:10.310> defrost<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:10.909> if<00:03:11.060> it's<00:03:11.180> a

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
want to manually defrost that if it's a

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.030 
want to manually defrost that if it's a
continual<00:03:11.659> problem<00:03:11.840> may<00:03:12.590> want<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.799> look<00:03:12.920> into

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
continual problem may want to look into

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.430 
continual problem may want to look into
replacing<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.180> defrost<00:03:14.629> circuit<00:03:14.959> here<00:03:15.139> but

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.619 

okay<00:03:48.400> now<00:03:49.400> notice<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.819> didn't<00:03:50.000> unhook<00:03:50.239> any<00:03:50.480> of

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
okay now notice I didn't unhook any of

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.839 
okay now notice I didn't unhook any of
the<00:03:50.750> wiring<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.859> you<00:03:51.920> want<00:03:52.159> to<00:03:52.340> be<00:03:52.640> careful

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
the wiring so you want to be careful

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.940 
the wiring so you want to be careful
when<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.120> pull<00:03:53.329> this<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:53.689> and<00:03:53.900> not<00:03:54.049> get<00:03:54.799> too

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
when you pull this up and not get too

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.289 
when you pull this up and not get too
crazy<00:03:55.189> with<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.609> or<00:03:55.730> else<00:03:55.849> you'll<00:03:55.969> damage<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
crazy with it or else you'll damage the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.380 
crazy with it or else you'll damage the
wiring<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.890> then<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.219> whole<00:03:58.370> thing<00:03:58.430> kind<00:03:59.299> of

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
wiring so then this whole thing kind of

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.119 
wiring so then this whole thing kind of
rocks<00:03:59.659> up<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.140> away<00:04:00.349> from<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.680> board

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
rocks up and away from the board

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.660 
rocks up and away from the board
if<00:04:02.090> we<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:02.359> flip<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.629> over<00:04:03.159> now<00:04:04.159> your<00:04:04.340> fan

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
if we just flip it over now your fan

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.420 
if we just flip it over now your fan
itself<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.239> exposed<00:04:05.739> now<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.829> issue<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.129> was

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
itself is exposed now the issue I was

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.979 
itself is exposed now the issue I was
having<00:04:07.790> wasn't<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.420> there<00:04:08.689> was<00:04:08.810> ice

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
having wasn't that there was ice

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.300 
having wasn't that there was ice
anywhere<00:04:09.319> built<00:04:09.560> up<00:04:09.680> on<00:04:09.799> this<00:04:10.010> there<00:04:10.159> was<00:04:10.280> a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
anywhere built up on this there was a

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.399 
anywhere built up on this there was a
little<00:04:10.400> bit<00:04:10.519> of<00:04:10.639> moisture<00:04:10.989> but<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.109> fan

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
little bit of moisture but this fan

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.280 
little bit of moisture but this fan
wasn't<00:04:12.859> free<00:04:13.159> turning<00:04:13.519> as<00:04:13.609> it<00:04:13.700> is<00:04:13.790> now<00:04:14.290> what

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
wasn't free turning as it is now what

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.339 
wasn't free turning as it is now what
happened<00:04:15.650> in<00:04:15.829> our<00:04:16.430> case<00:04:16.810> was<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.079> fan

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
happened in our case was that this fan

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.789 
happened in our case was that this fan
had<00:04:18.829> pressed<00:04:19.130> down<00:04:19.340> too<00:04:19.549> hard<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:21.530> can<00:04:21.650> hear

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
had pressed down too hard you can hear

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.230 
had pressed down too hard you can hear
it<00:04:21.889> snap<00:04:22.009> there<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.729> now<00:04:23.479> it's<00:04:23.630> not<00:04:23.750> turning

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
it snap there and now it's not turning

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.010 
it snap there and now it's not turning
because<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:26.389> sitting<00:04:26.509> up<00:04:26.690> against<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
because it's sitting up against the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.430 
because it's sitting up against the
housing<00:04:27.199> so<00:04:27.590> what<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.740> did<00:04:27.860> was<00:04:28.160> just<00:04:29.440> actually

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
housing so what I did was just actually

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.689 
housing so what I did was just actually
put<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.860> little<00:04:31.009> bit<00:04:31.099> of<00:04:31.190> pressure<00:04:31.340> on<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.550> just

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
put a little bit of pressure on it just

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.150 
put a little bit of pressure on it just
pull<00:04:31.849> it<00:04:31.970> up<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.120> little<00:04:32.210> bit<00:04:32.389> now<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.599> can<00:04:32.750> see

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
pull it up a little bit now you can see

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.810 
pull it up a little bit now you can see
spins<00:04:34.160> just<00:04:34.400> fine

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.820 

so<00:04:38.020> basically<00:04:39.020> just<00:04:39.139> put<00:04:39.289> everything<00:04:39.710> all

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
so basically just put everything all

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.469 
so basically just put everything all
back<00:04:40.039> together<00:04:40.190> being<00:04:40.610> nice<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:40.849> careful<00:04:41.360> not

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
back together being nice and careful not

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:42.850 
back together being nice and careful not
to<00:04:41.599> put<00:04:41.870> too<00:04:41.990> much<00:04:42.080> tension<00:04:42.320> on<00:04:42.470> your<00:04:42.680> wiring

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
to put too much tension on your wiring

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.980 
to put too much tension on your wiring
or<00:04:43.070> anything<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.909> magnet<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.300> bit<00:04:50.479> is<00:04:50.720> not

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
or anything and a magnet it bit is not

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:12.260 
or anything and a magnet it bit is not
easy<00:04:51.199> to<00:04:51.320> use<00:04:51.409> one-handed

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.280 

that<00:05:13.270> sound<00:05:13.510> you're<00:05:13.570> hearing<00:05:13.630> is<00:05:13.990> just<00:05:14.110> a

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
that sound you're hearing is just a

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.230 
that sound you're hearing is just a
clutch<00:05:14.980> like<00:05:15.160> that<00:05:15.280> set<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.550> my<00:05:15.640> drill<00:05:15.940> keeps

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
clutch like that set of my drill keeps

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.560 
clutch like that set of my drill keeps
it<00:05:16.330> from<00:05:16.420> over<00:05:16.660> torquing<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.050> screws<00:05:18.570> it's

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
it from over torquing the screws it's

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.030 
it from over torquing the screws it's
all<00:05:19.780> plastic<00:05:20.260> they<00:05:20.410> don't<00:05:20.590> want<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.770> put<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.890> lot

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
all plastic they don't want to put a lot

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.230 
all plastic they don't want to put a lot
of<00:05:21.130> torque<00:05:21.340> on<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.670> just<00:05:21.700> really<00:05:21.970> want<00:05:22.150> to

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
of torque on it you just really want to

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.880 
of torque on it you just really want to
see<00:05:22.360> those<00:05:22.510> screws<00:05:22.780> down<00:05:22.930> enough<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.260> hold

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
see those screws down enough to hold

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.420 
see those screws down enough to hold
everything<00:05:24.130> together<00:05:24.340> nice<00:05:24.730> and<00:05:24.910> firm<00:05:26.430> okay

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
everything together nice and firm okay

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.750 
everything together nice and firm okay
so<00:05:27.850> now<00:05:27.970> that's<00:05:28.210> all<00:05:28.450> in<00:05:29.340> well<00:05:30.340> open<00:05:30.640> our

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
so now that's all in well open our

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.700 
so now that's all in well open our
refrigerator<00:05:31.270> back<00:05:31.450> up<00:05:33.990> as<00:05:34.990> you<00:05:35.470> put<00:05:35.620> this

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
refrigerator back up as you put this

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.530 
refrigerator back up as you put this
back<00:05:35.890> in<00:05:36.070> here<00:05:36.220> you'll<00:05:36.340> notice<00:05:36.490> that<00:05:36.610> saw

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
back in here you'll notice that saw

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.240 
back in here you'll notice that saw
lined<00:05:37.900> with<00:05:38.080> foam<00:05:38.320> so<00:05:38.770> we<00:05:38.860> don't<00:05:38.980> want<00:05:39.100> to<00:05:39.160> put

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
lined with foam so we don't want to put

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.530 
lined with foam so we don't want to put
a<00:05:39.280> lot<00:05:39.400> of<00:05:39.490> force<00:05:39.640> into<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.030> we<00:05:40.240> just<00:05:40.360> kind<00:05:40.510> of

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
a lot of force into it we just kind of

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.360 
a lot of force into it we just kind of
want<00:05:40.690> to<00:05:40.750> line<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:40.960> up<00:05:41.170> you<00:05:41.410> get<00:05:41.980> the<00:05:42.070> bottom

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
want to line it up you get the bottom

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.300 
want to line it up you get the bottom
set<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.640> there<00:05:42.760> first<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:44.710> way<00:05:44.860> we<00:05:45.010> can<00:05:45.160> reach

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
set in there first that way we can reach

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.330 
set in there first that way we can reach
over<00:05:45.640> and<00:05:45.820> these<00:05:46.390> two<00:05:47.010> connections<00:05:48.010> here<00:05:48.190> are

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
over and these two connections here are

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.570 
over and these two connections here are
keyed<00:05:48.640> so<00:05:49.680> they<00:05:50.680> will<00:05:50.800> only<00:05:50.920> fit<00:05:51.190> in<00:05:51.220> one

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
keyed so they will only fit in one

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.810 
keyed so they will only fit in one
direction<00:05:53.100> reseat<00:05:54.100> both<00:05:54.250> of<00:05:54.430> those<00:05:54.550> you'll

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
direction reseat both of those you'll

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.070 
direction reseat both of those you'll
notice<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.180> bottom<00:05:55.300> ones<00:05:55.540> probably<00:05:55.720> for<00:05:56.020> the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
notice the bottom ones probably for the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.420 
notice the bottom ones probably for the
fan<00:05:56.320> since<00:05:56.680> nothing<00:05:56.920> happened<00:05:57.310> when<00:05:57.400> I

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
fan since nothing happened when I

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.520 
fan since nothing happened when I
plugged<00:05:57.640> it<00:05:57.760> in<00:05:57.880> but<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:58.690> top<00:05:58.870> ones<00:05:59.110> for<00:05:59.410> the

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
plugged it in but the top ones for the

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.600 
plugged it in but the top ones for the
LEDs<00:05:59.890> because<00:06:00.010> they<00:06:00.160> come<00:06:00.310> out<00:06:00.430> immediately

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
LEDs because they come out immediately

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.390 
LEDs because they come out immediately
so<00:06:01.090> then<00:06:01.960> once<00:06:02.140> you<00:06:02.200> have<00:06:02.380> it<00:06:02.410> in<00:06:02.590> there<00:06:02.770> you

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
so then once you have it in there you

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.730 
so then once you have it in there you
can<00:06:03.520> all<00:06:03.670> kind<00:06:04.330> of<00:06:04.390> line<00:06:04.600> back<00:06:04.780> up<00:06:04.810> and<00:06:05.470> just

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
can all kind of line back up and just

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.830 
can all kind of line back up and just
give<00:06:05.890> it<00:06:05.920> a<00:06:06.220> little<00:06:06.910> bit<00:06:07.090> of<00:06:07.180> a<00:06:07.270> shove<00:06:07.510> in<00:06:07.660> there

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
give it a little bit of a shove in there

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.870 
give it a little bit of a shove in there
and<00:06:08.680> now<00:06:08.770> it's<00:06:08.920> kind<00:06:09.130> of<00:06:09.160> holding<00:06:09.430> itself<00:06:09.640> back

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
and now it's kind of holding itself back

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.020 
and now it's kind of holding itself back
up<00:06:10.950> obviously<00:06:11.950> put<00:06:12.100> all<00:06:12.190> your<00:06:12.310> screws<00:06:12.610> back<00:06:12.790> in

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
up obviously put all your screws back in

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.050 
up obviously put all your screws back in
and<00:06:14.020> put<00:06:14.350> your<00:06:14.380> light<00:06:14.620> covers<00:06:14.920> back<00:06:15.100> on<00:06:15.130> and

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
and put your light covers back on and

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.730 
and put your light covers back on and
that's<00:06:16.690> probably<00:06:16.960> a<00:06:17.110> good<00:06:17.230> idea<00:06:17.290> to<00:06:17.590> go<00:06:17.710> ahead

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
that's probably a good idea to go ahead

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.590 
that's probably a good idea to go ahead
and<00:06:18.040> close<00:06:18.190> your<00:06:18.400> refrigerator<00:06:18.880> plug<00:06:19.450> it<00:06:19.570> back

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
and close your refrigerator plug it back

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.160 
and close your refrigerator plug it back
in<00:06:19.900> and<00:06:20.110> then<00:06:20.890> set<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.310> to<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:22.510> power<00:06:22.840> cool

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
in and then set it to the power cool

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.050 
in and then set it to the power cool
mode<00:06:23.380> you'll<00:06:23.890> see<00:06:24.100> this<00:06:24.280> right<00:06:24.490> here<00:06:24.550> means

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
mode you'll see this right here means

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.180 
mode you'll see this right here means
power<00:06:25.390> cooling<00:06:25.540> refrigerator<00:06:26.110> side<00:06:26.320> by

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
power cooling refrigerator side by

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.440 
power cooling refrigerator side by
pressing<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:27.610> holding<00:06:27.670> this<00:06:28.060> for<00:06:28.300> three

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
pressing and holding this for three

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.140 
pressing and holding this for three
seconds<00:06:28.870> it<00:06:29.080> toggles<00:06:29.530> that<00:06:29.560> on<00:06:29.860> and<00:06:30.640> off<00:06:30.730> we

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
seconds it toggles that on and off we

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.090 
seconds it toggles that on and off we
have<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.360> do<00:06:31.450> that<00:06:31.600> with<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.170> group<00:06:32.350> the<00:06:32.770> door

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
have to do that with the group the door

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.750 
have to do that with the group the door
closed<00:06:37.110> there<00:06:38.110> we<00:06:38.200> go

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
closed there we go

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.250 
closed there we go
you<00:06:39.760> see<00:06:39.940> mine<00:06:40.120> came<00:06:40.300> back<00:06:40.390> up<00:06:40.510> to<00:06:40.600> 39<00:06:40.960> degrees

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
you see mine came back up to 39 degrees

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.770 
you see mine came back up to 39 degrees
I<00:06:41.550> think<00:06:42.550> what<00:06:42.670> was<00:06:42.760> happening<00:06:43.120> was<00:06:43.300> mine<00:06:43.570> was

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
I think what was happening was mine was

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.020 
I think what was happening was mine was
not<00:06:43.900> reading<00:06:44.140> any<00:06:44.320> airflow<00:06:44.680> past<00:06:44.950> the<00:06:45.460> sensor

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
not reading any airflow past the sensor

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.640 
not reading any airflow past the sensor
so<00:06:46.600> the<00:06:46.690> sensor<00:06:46.960> thought<00:06:47.140> it<00:06:47.260> was<00:06:47.350> nice<00:06:47.470> and

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
so the sensor thought it was nice and

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.550 
so the sensor thought it was nice and
cool<00:06:48.060> when<00:06:49.060> in<00:06:49.120> fact<00:06:49.240> it<00:06:49.390> was<00:06:49.420> not<00:06:49.720> so<00:06:50.290> put<00:06:50.470> it

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
cool when in fact it was not so put it

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.630 
cool when in fact it was not so put it
back<00:06:50.680> into<00:06:51.010> power<00:06:51.400> cool<00:06:51.670> mode<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:53.610> then<00:06:54.610> you

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640 
back into power cool mode and then you

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.310 
back into power cool mode and then you
can<00:06:54.820> see<00:06:54.940> after<00:06:55.150> being<00:06:55.330> in<00:06:55.390> line<00:06:55.510> for<00:06:55.690> about<00:06:55.780> 45

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
can see after being in line for about 45

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.050 
can see after being in line for about 45
minutes<00:06:56.350> and<00:06:57.010> of<00:06:57.160> course<00:06:57.460> it's<00:06:57.580> been<00:06:57.670> open<00:06:57.910> for

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
minutes and of course it's been open for

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.430 
minutes and of course it's been open for
a<00:06:58.120> few<00:06:58.270> minutes<00:06:58.450> now<00:06:58.510> mine<00:06:58.840> was<00:06:59.020> reading<00:06:59.320> in

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
a few minutes now mine was reading in

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.920 
a few minutes now mine was reading in
the<00:06:59.800> upper<00:07:00.010> 30s<00:07:00.370> again<00:07:00.480> so<00:07:01.480> it<00:07:01.570> seems<00:07:01.750> to<00:07:01.810> be

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
the upper 30s again so it seems to be

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.870 
the upper 30s again so it seems to be
operating<00:07:02.320> fine<00:07:03.360> hope<00:07:04.360> this<00:07:04.570> helps
