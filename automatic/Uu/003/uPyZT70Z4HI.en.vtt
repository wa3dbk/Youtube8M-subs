today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.100 
today I'm going to show you how to make
some<00:00:26.010> simple<00:00:26.280> elevators<00:00:27.030> now<00:00:27.780> if<00:00:27.870> you<00:00:27.990> guys

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
some simple elevators now if you guys

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.620 
some simple elevators now if you guys
seen<00:00:28.410> my<00:00:28.530> bumper<00:00:28.920> head<00:00:29.160> video<00:00:30.030> you<00:00:30.240> might<00:00:30.450> not

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
seen my bumper head video you might not

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.840 
seen my bumper head video you might not
need<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.200> this<00:00:31.440> because<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.950> is<00:00:32.160> basically

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
need to see this because it is basically

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
need to see this because it is basically
the<00:00:32.970> same<00:00:33.090> principle<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.900> if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.230> seen

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the same principle but if you have seen

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530 
the same principle but if you have seen
that<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.489> might<00:00:35.670> remember<00:00:35.820> me<00:00:36.270> saying

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that one you might remember me saying

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
that one you might remember me saying
how<00:00:37.110> me<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.800> my<00:00:37.950> friend<00:00:38.220> were<00:00:38.280> messing<00:00:38.610> around

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
how me and my friend were messing around

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.080 
how me and my friend were messing around
with<00:00:39.150> these<00:00:39.270> one-way<00:00:39.630> shields<00:00:40.080> and<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:41.850> fake

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
with these one-way shields and you fake

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.490 
with these one-way shields and you fake
figured<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.440> getting

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
figured out that when I was getting

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.229 
figured out that when I was getting
really<00:00:43.739> close<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> shoved<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> through

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
really close to it shoved you through

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.729 
really close to it shoved you through
even<00:00:45.510> though<00:00:45.630> your<00:00:45.809> gun<00:00:45.989> wasn't<00:00:46.230> playing

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
even though your gun wasn't playing

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.799 
even though your gun wasn't playing
through<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.130> anything<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
through or anything like that and so

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
through or anything like that and so
we're<00:00:49.070> messing<00:00:50.070> around<00:00:50.220> with<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:50.519> and<00:00:50.760> my

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
we're messing around with that and my

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.630 
we're messing around with that and my
friends<00:00:51.180> said<00:00:51.420> well<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.470> it<00:00:52.620> pushes<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.160> when

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
friends said well if it pushes you when

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.119 
friends said well if it pushes you when
you're<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.150> way<00:00:54.559> what<00:00:55.559> happens<00:00:55.920> if

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
you're going that way what happens if

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.640 
you're going that way what happens if
you're<00:00:56.519> going<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.600> straight<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
you're going you know straight up and

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.299 
you're going you know straight up and
down<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.570> messed<00:01:01.500> around<00:01:01.650> with<00:01:01.860> that<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> we

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
down so I messed around with that and we

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.080 
down so I messed around with that and we
said<00:01:02.519> oh<00:01:02.550> wait<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.089> pushes<00:01:03.659> you<00:01:03.780> upwards<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:05.090> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
said oh wait it pushes you upwards to so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.680 
said oh wait it pushes you upwards to so
we<00:01:06.810> made<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.260> basic<00:01:08.120> elevator<00:01:09.120> using<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
we made a very basic elevator using that

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.750 
we made a very basic elevator using that
exact<00:01:10.200> principle<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.220> hard<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> do

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
exact principle it's not that hard to do

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
exact principle it's not that hard to do
and<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.180> add<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.480> in<00:01:12.570> any<00:01:12.780> map<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and you can add it in any map if you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
and you can add it in any map if you
have<00:01:13.620> multiple<00:01:13.830> floors<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:15.030> does<00:01:15.240> add<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> cold

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
have multiple floors it does add a cold

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
have multiple floors it does add a cold
touch<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.380> does<00:01:16.590> cost<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.159> lot<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:17.610> money<00:01:17.760> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
touch it does cost a lot of money it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.540 
touch it does cost a lot of money it's
two<00:01:18.270> hundred<00:01:18.420> dollars<00:01:18.900> per<00:01:19.140> shield<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.430> it

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
two hundred dollars per shield but it

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.750 
two hundred dollars per shield but it
does<00:01:20.700> look<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:21.270> cool<00:01:21.770> now<00:01:22.770> I'm<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
decorative in the second one because the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.180 
decorative in the second one because the
first<00:01:29.730> one<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.240> there<00:01:30.480> it<00:01:31.140> looks<00:01:31.800> really

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
first one you see there it looks really

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.790 
first one you see there it looks really
plain<00:01:32.760> but<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.720> comparison<00:01:33.870> to<00:01:34.440> this<00:01:34.560> other

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
plain but in comparison to this other

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.280 
plain but in comparison to this other
one<00:01:35.160> that<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.370> have<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.630> store<00:01:37.080> around

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
one that I have with this store around

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.670 
one that I have with this store around
it<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:38.490> door<00:01:38.730> looks<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:40.440> only

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it that door looks really not only

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.860 
it that door looks really not only
visually<00:01:40.800> appealing<00:01:41.370> but<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.210> also<00:01:42.330> see

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
visually appealing but you can also see

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.390 
visually appealing but you can also see
it<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.230> lot<00:01:43.380> better<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:43.920> one's<00:01:44.160> kind<00:01:44.340> of

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
it a lot better like this one's kind of

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400 
it a lot better like this one's kind of
hard<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.660> only<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
hard to see you can only really see the

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.100 
hard to see you can only really see the
little<00:01:46.560> line<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.450> if<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> jump<00:01:48.870> up<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
little line there and if you jump up and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.720 
little line there and if you jump up and
down<00:01:49.230> you<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.770> completely<00:01:50.160> disappears

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
down you see it completely disappears

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.420 
down you see it completely disappears
because<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.450> thin<00:01:51.900> plane<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:53.160> one<00:01:53.340> on

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
because it's a thin plane this one on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.250 
because it's a thin plane this one on
the<00:01:53.550> other<00:01:53.700> hand<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.150> can<00:01:54.330> visually<00:01:54.870> notice

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
the other hand you can visually notice

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.210 
the other hand you can visually notice
it<00:01:55.410> while<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:55.620> walking<00:01:55.800> around<00:01:56.070> you're

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
it while you're walking around you're

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.520 
it while you're walking around you're
like<00:01:56.400> oh<00:01:56.580> hey<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.660> stand<00:01:57.870> underneath<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
like oh hey then we stand underneath it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.790 
like oh hey then we stand underneath it
you're<00:01:59.400> like<00:01:59.580> oh<00:01:59.790> jump<00:02:00.300> oh<00:02:00.450> okay<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:01.470> even

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
those who don't really play halo at all

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.700 
those who don't really play halo at all
can<00:02:05.160> figure<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.060> out<00:02:06.210> relatively<00:02:06.960> quickly<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
can figure it out relatively quickly and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.270 
can figure it out relatively quickly and
you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.550> add<00:02:08.729> more<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.560> top<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> each

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you can add more of these on top of each

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.670 
you can add more of these on top of each
other<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.300> want<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:13.019> make<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.349> even<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
other if you want to make it even a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.420 
other if you want to make it even a
taller<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:15.170> because<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.920> fact<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.250> it's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
taller one because of the fact that it's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.740 
taller one because of the fact that it's
pushing<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.910> through<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.599> close

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
pushing you through if you get close

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.540 
pushing you through if you get close
enough<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.140> another<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.160> will<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.280> keep

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
enough to another one it will just keep

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.570 
enough to another one it will just keep
pushing<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.150> up<00:02:21.209> until<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.830> run<00:02:23.370> out<00:02:23.430> of

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
pushing you up until you run out of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.860 
pushing you up until you run out of
one-way<00:02:23.940> shields<00:02:24.470> yes

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
one-way shields yes

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.460 
one-way shields yes
another<00:02:26.049> one<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:29.610> here<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.730> go<00:02:30.989> now<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.019> third

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
another one here here we go now a third

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.339 
another one here here we go now a third
way<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.920> doing<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.340> which<00:02:34.299> some<00:02:34.840> people<00:02:34.989> do<00:02:35.319> I

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
way of doing this which some people do I

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.369 
way of doing this which some people do I
don't<00:02:35.799> like<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.099> at<00:02:36.220> all<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.540> some<00:02:37.989> people

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
don't like it at all but some people

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.390 
don't like it at all but some people
prefer<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:39.250> method<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:40.920> if<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.069> push<00:02:42.280> it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
prefer this method is if you push it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.369 
prefer this method is if you push it
really<00:02:42.909> close<00:02:43.120> because<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.840> pushing

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
really close because of that pushing

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.920 
really close because of that pushing
effect<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:46.120> gives<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.510> when<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.780> get

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
effect that it gives you when you get

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.869 
effect that it gives you when you get
close<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:48.190> pushing<00:02:48.489> effect<00:02:48.730> will

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
close to it that pushing effect will

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.190 
close to it that pushing effect will
still<00:02:49.030> happen<00:02:49.239> even<00:02:49.569> if<00:02:49.780> it's<00:02:49.900> at<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.049> very

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
still happen even if it's at the very

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.710 
still happen even if it's at the very
edge<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.909> only<00:02:52.150> problem<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.599> have

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
edge of it the only problem is you have

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.630 
edge of it the only problem is you have
to<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:52.900> hugging<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.379> wall<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:54.099> get<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.430> to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
to be hugging the wall to get that to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.569 
to be hugging the wall to get that to
work<00:02:54.670> for<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.299> because<00:02:56.049> for<00:02:56.950> me<00:02:57.099> when<00:02:57.340> I'm<00:02:57.459> in

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.580 
work for you because for me when I'm in
a<00:02:57.610> battle<00:02:58.150> attacking<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.900> invisible<00:02:59.410> goes

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
a battle attacking this invisible goes

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.110

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
invisible ghost run away run away run

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.710 
invisible ghost run away run away run
away<00:03:02.829> okay<00:03:03.549> where's<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.849> shield<00:03:04.150> whereas<00:03:04.599> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
away okay where's the shield whereas the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.089 
away okay where's the shield whereas the
door<00:03:04.900> whereas<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.470> door<00:03:05.620> okay<00:03:05.890> I'm<00:03:05.950> dead

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
door whereas the door okay I'm dead

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.110 
door whereas the door okay I'm dead
that's<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:07.060> nuisance<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.370> even<00:03:09.790> this

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
that's a nuisance this and even this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.809 
that's a nuisance this and even this
method<00:03:10.690> it's<00:03:11.230> really<00:03:11.620> large<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.280> even<00:03:12.549> if<00:03:12.640> I'm

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
method it's really large so even if I'm

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.479 
method it's really large so even if I'm
running<00:03:13.569> away<00:03:13.690> if<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.349> remember<00:03:14.379> where<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.159> is<00:03:15.250> I

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
running away if I remember where it is I

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.210 
running away if I remember where it is I
don't<00:03:15.760> need<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:16.650> visually<00:03:17.650> see<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.829> just<00:03:17.920> need
