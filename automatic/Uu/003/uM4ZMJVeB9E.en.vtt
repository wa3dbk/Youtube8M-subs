00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430 

I<00:00:00.030> just<00:00:00.299> think<00:00:00.420> of<00:00:00.510> it<00:00:00.599> as<00:00:00.659> ice<00:00:00.870> climbers<00:00:01.290> oh<00:00:01.639> so

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.440 
I just think of it as ice climbers oh so

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.440 
I just think of it as ice climbers oh so
nobody<00:00:04.440> can<00:00:04.830> just<00:00:05.339> attack<00:00:05.790> from<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.240> range

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
nobody can just attack from that range

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.049 
nobody can just attack from that range
she<00:00:06.899> has<00:00:06.990> got<00:00:07.200> so<00:00:07.470> much<00:00:07.680> range<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:10.849> guess<00:00:11.849> if<00:00:12.000> you

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
she has got so much range I guess if you
