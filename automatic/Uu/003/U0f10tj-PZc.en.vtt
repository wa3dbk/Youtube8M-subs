 also i use chocolate which i 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.850
 chopped nuts and nuts and I again on 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.250
 your discretion you can use 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.050
 walnut almond i have this hazelnut 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.350
 which i am a little bit 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.739
 ground so let's start cooking 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.880
 Preheat oven to 180 degrees now 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.869
 we take butter add to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.970
 100 grams of sugar are added to it 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:18.200
 lush homogeneous mass or we can 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.200
 use mixer 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.900
 you should get this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.140
 homogeneous mass now we need 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140
 eggs 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:45.299
 do we add but slightly to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:54.560
 our oil mixture and careful plan 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.560
 meat turns out such a lush mass 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.100
 next we need our bananas 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.840
 which we will develop with a fork it is very 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.780
 easy to do is it like this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.979
 banana puree 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.610
 Basically, instead of a girl, you can 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.610
 use blender 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:24.780
 add our mashed potatoes mixture of butter and 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:24.780
 eggs and again mix thoroughly 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.230
 members need flour do not add 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.010
 Immediately leave all the flour 50 grams 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:42.110
 we will look at natal goals they tell us about 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.110
 heal our flour so that the dough is more magnificent 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.349
 add baking powder 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.720
 and some vanilla all carefully 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.720
 mix 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.730
 should get this consistency 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.600
 if you have it too liquid add 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.500
 more flour and 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.720
 I basically had enough with 220 grams Now 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:38.120
 it's time to add our chopped 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:39.890
 chocolate and nuts I have hazelnuts you can 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.640
 to dream with nuts 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:51.200
 come to us others and again everything is fine 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:53.680
 we mix such beauty here 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.680
 it turns out 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.599
 lubricate our form with my oil form 26 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.849
 centimeters at 12 centimeters high 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.319
 if you have a smaller form that is 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.180
 use less quantity 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.840
 ingredients and lay out our dough 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.840
 form 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:28.099
 It looks like our future cupcake 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.910
 and also on top we can decorate it 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.479
 nuts 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.610
 I it will Walnuts that have been 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.379
 we are beautiful and send our cupcake to 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.940
 oven for at least 30 minutes 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.710
 consider the features of your oven 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.569
 because you he can get ready 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.569
 much more up to an hour 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.280
 and so your whole hour went by 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.470
 the cupcake was prepared periodically I 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.470
 checked it with a finished toothpick here 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.500
 so we have a banana cake you 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.110
 can decorate it with powdered sugar or 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.830
