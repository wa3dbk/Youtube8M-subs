00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:24.860
The First Christmas

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:36.900
Retold by Eliane Pinheiro and Maura Hurley

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.080
Around the month of December,

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:42.000
children like to imagine

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.167
what happened

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:47.000
on the very first Christmas ever,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.667
even before Santa Claus.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.000
I know the story well,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.417
for I was watching it all from above ,

00:00:57.417 --> 00:00:59.833
in the dark sky on the evening

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.500
of December 24th,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.917
oh so many years ago.

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:12.583
I am the Star of Bethlehem.

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:17.583
I was requested by angels

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:20.833
to shine brighter than

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:24.750
all the other stars that night,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.000
to tell the whole world

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500
to tell the whole world

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.667
that a very special child

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.917
had been born

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:38.500
to spread goodwill and peace.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:47.250
And this is the story of the first Christmas.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.667
All was quiet that night

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.750
as I watched the Three Kings

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.417
traveling slowly on camelback

00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:59.333
through desert lands.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.583
Just then, I beamed brightly,

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.000
as the angels had told me to.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.917
The Kings noticed me in the East.

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:12.083
They couldn’t resist my brilliance.

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:15.667
Perhaps they had heard

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.583
that a star like me was going to show the way

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:21.583
to the son of God.

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:23.333
Traveling through the night,

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.250
the Kings met shepherds

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.417
watching over their flock.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.167
“We are following that incredibly beautiful star

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:37.250
there in the East, to find the place

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.583
where the son of God

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:44.333
has just been born.”

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:45.750
From there,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.333
they all traveled together,

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:49.417
watching me,

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:56.750
the brightest star in the sky!

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.417
Finally, they arrived at a small town,

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:05.167
called Bethlehem,

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:07.000
and saw that I was gleaming

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.667
radiantly above the barnyard

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:13.833
of an Inn.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:19.750
All was quiet and peaceful.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.500
Their caravan entered the barnyard,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.250
to see the tender little baby

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.250
lying in a simple manger fluffed with hay.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.833
Next to the baby

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:39.833
were Mary and Joseph,

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:45.167
his mother and father, and many farm animals.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:48.750
The Kings offered the precious gifts

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.750
they’d carried from afar

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.750
for baby Jesus:

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.750
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.500
The shepherds kneeled on the ground to pray;

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.583
they were grateful for the gift of love :

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:14.250
and the purity the baby brought.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.667
Many people offered gifts after that :

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:21.417
I suppose this is

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:24.500
why, on Christmas Day,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.917
people around the world

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:33.000
enjoy offering gifts as a sign of love and hope.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.083
And they try their best

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:38.333
to bring happiness to others,

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:44.167
as Jesus did all his life.

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:47.833
Now, I’d like to wish you a holiday season

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:50.833
that shines as brightly

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:55.917
as the Star of Bethlehem!
