tricks here today I'm gonna show you one
of<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.770> things<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.189> used<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.700> beat<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> game<00:00:09.480> on

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
of the things I used to beat the game on

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.140 
of the things I used to beat the game on
hard<00:00:09.809> mode<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.650> feel<00:00:10.889> like<00:00:11.040> it's<00:00:11.490> just<00:00:11.940> not

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
hard mode and I feel like it's just not

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.759 
hard mode and I feel like it's just not
that<00:00:12.179> obvious<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.900> I'm<00:00:12.990> gonna<00:00:13.230> go<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.469> put<00:00:13.679> it

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
that obvious so I'm gonna go and put it

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.680 
that obvious so I'm gonna go and put it
out<00:00:13.920> there<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.280> everybody<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.330> maybe<00:00:15.509> they

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
out there for everybody so maybe they

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.330 
out there for everybody so maybe they
can<00:00:15.839> use<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.109> once<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.470> get<00:00:16.650> access<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.310> it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
can use it once they get access to it

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.670 
can use it once they get access to it
about<00:00:18.300> thirty<00:00:18.570> forty<00:00:18.960> percent<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> game

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
about thirty forty percent of the game

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.029 
about thirty forty percent of the game
you<00:00:19.920> get<00:00:20.100> access<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> ability<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.740> looks

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
you get access to a ability that looks

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.910 
you get access to a ability that looks
kind<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.460> an<00:00:23.730> octopus<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.830> little<00:00:25.830> bit

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
kind of like an octopus a little bit

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.099 
kind of like an octopus a little bit
longer<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> game<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.480> unlock<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
longer in the game you get to unlock a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.560 
longer in the game you get to unlock a
second<00:00:28.439> ability<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:29.340> allows<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.300> main

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
second ability that allows the main

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.350 
second ability that allows the main
ability<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:33.270> they're

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
ability of this of this I think they're

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.459 
ability of this of this I think they're
called<00:00:33.480> vigor<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:35.329> unleash<00:00:36.329> itself<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.290> let's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
called vigor to unleash itself so let's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.920 
called vigor to unleash itself so let's
go<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.739> show<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.160> key<00:00:38.579> footage<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.239> this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
go and show you some key footage of this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
go and show you some key footage of this
vigor<00:00:40.200> unleashing<00:00:41.129> itself<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
vigor unleashing itself and how you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.360 
vigor unleashing itself and how you
could<00:00:42.329> work<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> first<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
could work it when you first get this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740 
could work it when you first get this
thing<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:44.730> only<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> try<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> pull

and if you have a really strong powered
up<00:01:22.110> shotgun<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:23.790> easily<00:01:23.850> pull<00:01:24.479> two

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
up shotgun you can very easily pull two

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.620 
up shotgun you can very easily pull two
to<00:01:25.500> three<00:01:25.770> people<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.520> every<00:01:26.820> time<00:01:27.000> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to three people to you every time this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.899 
to three people to you every time this
allows<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.229> use<00:01:28.409> cover<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.040> basically

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
allows you to use cover and basically

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
allows you to use cover and basically
pan<00:01:30.360> over<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> entire<00:01:30.990> stage<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.890> makes<00:01:32.130> most

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
pan over the entire stage it makes most

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859 
pan over the entire stage it makes most
of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> game<00:01:32.700> video<00:01:33.000> kerr<00:01:33.240> after<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.689> point

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
of the game video kerr after that point

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.429 
of the game video kerr after that point
the<00:01:34.590> skill<00:01:34.829> level<00:01:35.159> drops<00:01:35.479> dramatically<00:01:36.479> just

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the skill level drops dramatically just

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
the skill level drops dramatically just
using<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.340> tactic<00:01:41.390> but<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.540> if

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
using this to this tactic but what if

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
using this to this tactic but what if
you<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.780> caught<00:01:42.840> off<00:01:43.140> guard<00:01:43.460> what<00:01:44.460> other

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you get caught off guard what other

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.740 
you get caught off guard what other
Biggers<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.180> you're<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.659> some

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
Biggers that you're there with some

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.240 
Biggers that you're there with some
