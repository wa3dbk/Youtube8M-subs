00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.800
 or the youtube community or greet them 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.730
 the art and development manager 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.590
 android in this opportunity I find myself 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.230
 showing them the rune review 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.360
 lollipop we can see that it has a 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.360
 framework and a system very similar to 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.910
 of the unoriginal anglo li to clarify 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.920
 One doubt is that it is not a single 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.420
 appearance because our the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.970
 update I do not think it's not going to 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.640
 voting assumed something like that already 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.340
 that mobile telephony does not allow such 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.980
 thing in our mobile devices in 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.860
 the adjustment session we can find 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.899
 which has its interface is very similar to 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.699
 the android one and you in information of the 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.360
 phone we could see the model of 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.820
 phone and the android version 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.450
 we have to see that we have the different 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.420
 Android settings the tools the screen 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.490
 the status bar and the framework and something that 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.590
 I really like instagram is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.229
 battery drain and optimization 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.290
 in terms of ram consumption we can see 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.330
 that with various processes and in cache and in 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.080
 services we can see that it has a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.330
 excellent ram consumption 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.250
 we had a book last week for 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.510
 that we had not been able to upload the i's in 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.110
 how much to the camera in this opportunity 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:46.420
 we can see that the camera works 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.430
 normally the gallery is lollipop in 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.350
 something that played to make him the rom is that he plays 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.730
 rootear the giacchino and the router but 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.190
 I took the trouble to make a simple 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.620
 cable to root the as for the 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.680
 bucs is free of bugs or what I 'm going 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.240
 to show the solution to them 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.009
 the rom as such had no sound or had 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.920
 camera available then what are we going 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.170
 to do is in the description of the video 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.020
 I will leave the links so that 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.310
 replace by those of the rumba lollipop 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.860
 and the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.380
 I tried 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.050
 those lips are going to put us in the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:33.150
 next route let's look at the root of 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.150
 system let's find the system folder 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.860
 what a pity guys for the noise but 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.520
 I'm doing my best because 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.520
 up I'm the rom and those things then 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.330
 we are located in the live subfolder 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.330
 we copy the modules 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 and we replace them 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.530
 once the modules have been replaced 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.160
 we restart 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.180
 and we would have our lollipop 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.010
 correctly installed and without any 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.020
 book class then this is all 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.050
 boys remember to join our 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.640

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.050
