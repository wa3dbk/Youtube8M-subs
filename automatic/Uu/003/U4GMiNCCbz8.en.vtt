urban feel to it this leads me to

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.179 
urban feel to it this leads me to
believe<00:05:50.719> that<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.259> action<00:05:51.560> sequences<00:05:52.039> they

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:52.189 
believe that the action sequences they

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:54.040 
believe that the action sequences they
are<00:05:52.310> filming<00:05:52.669> are<00:05:52.999> definitely<00:05:53.659> something

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
are filming are definitely something

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.080 
are filming are definitely something
that<00:05:54.080> could<00:05:54.409> be<00:05:54.439> possibly<00:05:55.189> part<00:05:55.490> of<00:05:55.639> the<00:05:55.729> final

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
that could be possibly part of the final

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.999 
that could be possibly part of the final
battle<00:05:56.210> maybe<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:57.289> reason<00:05:57.469> why<00:05:57.800> is<00:05:57.860> because

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
battle maybe the reason why is because

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.890 
battle maybe the reason why is because
Airmen<00:05:58.699> are<00:05:58.819> usually<00:05:59.210> wearing<00:05:59.449> the<00:05:59.629> three
