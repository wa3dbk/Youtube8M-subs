00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.480
 this is the new microsoft surface 3 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.990
 microsofts first consumer tablet since 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.330
 long 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.830
 it's a bit bigger than an ipad 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.020
 10 8 inches diagonal and here we have 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.410
 even the biggest one 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.150
 I benefit from the microsoft sees 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.619
 here is a full-fledged pc in it and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 If you want you can also here 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 a complete keyboard that is very thin 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.780
 and easy 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.629
 to buy and magnetically infected and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 then has practically from the keyboard up 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.539
 to the mouse pad trackpad complete 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.770
 So windows-pc subvert all 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.280
 programs on it too 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.949
 normal windows 8 1 pc run and if 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.559
 man's slimming says lard keyboard away 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.600
 you also have a tablet and that one 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.519
 quite powerful there runs the new 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 intel atom x7 processor on it should 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.850
 and for the achievement of 80 percent of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 Core i3 devices achieve the cheapest 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.780
 if we see in the test if that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.540
 really the case here is still running because 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.020
 a very early test software on it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.150
 but then windows 8 11 is the first 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.439
 enter two devices whether German ground 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.229
 have and you see 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.540
 we have full windows 8 1 then 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.470
 of course also with with update 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:39.299
 windows 10 and with the desktop mode for 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.670
 the normal apps what else is there 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.880
 Of course, important to say as a pc user 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.100
 if you pc Peripherals uses here has 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.640
 a normal usb 3 socket 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.619
 bitter display port for monitors and here 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.329
 we have micro-usb that of smartphones 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.979
 know and it will be with the same 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.439
 Power charged about like this 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.439
 fast charger, for example, when samsung 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.770
 13 watts should take two and a half hours 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.590
 the people to load 10 10 hours 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.030
 movie playback should be possible 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.080
 on the other side we have none 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.780
 connection but the fold and above 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.190
 Can you do the thing in up to then 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.680
 to three different positions on the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.410
 Place the table and fold it 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.269
 Here is something hidden like some 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 surface models have been the same before 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.110
 micro usb extensions the one there 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.599
 So you can plug in up to 128 GB 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.170
 then in addition there 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.329
 the factory comes with 64 or 128 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.799
 gb memory really all sorts 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.790
 Windows programs run on it 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.650
 he sure wants a bit 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.530
 more and optionally there is one more 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.640
 Trivia here this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.819
 screen pens 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.579
 this is an accessory and with it you can 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.010
 then shorter and shorter on the whole 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.130
 notes on documents pdf documents 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.660
 or leave screenshots that is 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.549
 So the surface 3 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.980
 that will be coming to germany soon 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.920
 Price range starts approximately for 600 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.019
 euro in the cheaper version and then 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.769
 with lte and more memory will be 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.769
 correspondingly more expensive
