 counter strike 1 6 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:15.490
 for this you need to download a special 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:19.000
 archive with such files go to the folder 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:23.199

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 files here in this folder if required 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.589
 when replacement need them to leave 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.450
 copy replacement after which we 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:37.300
 We are releasing a strike strike 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.090
 Here is such a multicolored menu here 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.760
 it is written that someone did there thanks 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:52.150
 thank you well there and so on it 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:52.780
 well let's go to the server at all in what 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.560
 composed 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.840
 antiban that is, it changes constantly 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.560

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.390
 registered team what the team all show 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 kl team 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:17.409
 thread t so here sheet 1 we write now as 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:25.210
 see we automatically start 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:27.310

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.579

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.600
 natale verga we have no other 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.409
 nothing about will happen here 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.039
 but if the server is protected 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.990
 some kind of example that here each of them 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.310
 You can not change this series at all 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.200
 only if it came out and changed it then 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.170
 if you are banned by admin you are shorter 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 disconnect the queue was written by him 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:05.259
 banned then you write kt take them set 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.369
 shafts and write any value Steam 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:19.510
 like it should be so 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:19.510
 the values ​​were known here on such that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 view all 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:49.040
 find that there is on the server, we 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:52.370
 prescribe kpsh u go go she show it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.569
 we here and why we can not nothing 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.200
 look at them there just a coin to 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.200
 disable 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:10.579
 you simply attribute this to the sheet 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:22.150
 0 more interesting function when there is it t 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:22.150
 t t m attributed 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.120
 but I have some kind of error light 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:33.069
 if you don't have 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.629
 then you can just days away from your no 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.220
 like the players on the terere only 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.190
 the end will be described at the point that is 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:45.169
 In general, the letters do not noticeable to 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:51.680
 administrators they can do it 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:56.290
 Click and banned to another gives I am so well 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.500
 sort of even wanted to say 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.799
 kotex ban is shorter such a thing she 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.810
 blocks the user so that he could not 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.549
 speak yes how could he speak but 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.120
 you won't hear anything microphone then 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.989
 have he say 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.090
 microphone there hi blocked it 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.449
 happens in the north it comes in there 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.090
 starts some music to turn on the players 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:26.050
 begin you prescribe gt 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:32.169
 in x ban and 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:35.139
 for example ah books 1 1 2 3 4 and all and 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.360
 now this player can't do anything to you 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.870
 speak and you will not have any account heard 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:46.620
 To unban him you need a boat navy 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:52.060
 an-2 and prescribe one two three four 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:55.180
 Now how to make some 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.500
 changed to your which you want on 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.540
 go to the counter strike folder 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.530
 here here when you transferred files 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:11.320
 where there will be no folder nick list here all 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:15.010
 nicknames that are generally in the sense of general 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.650
 all possible nicks practically let's 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:25.410
 now try to do two three four 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:30.850
 five six and try again this 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:33.490
 here the sheet does not change so much because u 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.180
 Us, too, loaded the setting often 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:46.000
 it's a chore to be this topic so manta all 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:57.220
 will be fine and we start us 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:04.690
 taught how to change the neck of the file so 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:09.130
 but it seems like this is all I wanted 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:13.200
 say you can break 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:15.760
 but this i'm shorter then the next lesson 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.700
