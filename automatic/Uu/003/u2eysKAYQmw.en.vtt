do here and there and I just kept
rocking<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.509> working<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.560> Jack<00:00:25.859> heard

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
rocking and working in but Jack heard

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.909 
rocking and working in but Jack heard
that<00:00:26.220> transmission<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.409> kept<00:00:28.409> going<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.739> and

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
that transmission and kept going up and

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.290 
that transmission and kept going up and
down<00:00:29.009> with<00:00:29.249> that<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.669> going<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.179> down

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
with the engine and finally got it lined

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.150 
with the engine and finally got it lined
up<00:00:31.919> so<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.600> input<00:00:33.600> shaft<00:00:34.079> uh<00:00:34.320> slid<00:00:34.860> into<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
up so that input shaft uh slid into the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.279 
up so that input shaft uh slid into the
pilot<00:00:35.489> bearing<00:00:35.640> him<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.149> got<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> long<00:00:36.930> bolt<00:00:37.199> in

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
pilot bearing him I got a long bolt in

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.410 
pilot bearing him I got a long bolt in
the<00:00:37.350> back<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.680> bell<00:00:38.640> housing<00:00:38.789> at<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> top

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the back of that bell housing at the top

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
the back of that bell housing at the top
and<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.379> kept<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.859> easing<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and it's kept kind of easing it on and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.779 
and it's kept kind of easing it on and
turning<00:00:42.359> the<00:00:42.559> crank<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:43.829> same<00:00:44.070> time<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
turning the crank at the same time and a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.669 
turning the crank at the same time and a
little<00:00:45.239> by<00:00:45.329> little<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.870> mean<00:00:46.019> at<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:46.289> same<00:00:46.350> time

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
little by little I mean at the same time

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.130 
little by little I mean at the same time
but<00:00:46.859> one<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.489> than<00:00:47.640> any<00:00:47.699> other<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.269> little

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.389 
but one more than any other and little
by<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.559> she<00:00:50.250> finally<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.289> fell<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.399> yeah

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
by little she finally just fell on yeah

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.739 
by little she finally just fell on yeah
that's<00:00:53.609> usually<00:00:53.789> how<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.030> works<00:00:54.089> one<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
that's usually how it works one time I

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.799 
that's usually how it works one time I
was<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.179> know<00:00:57.269> thirty<00:00:57.539> years

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
was you know I don't know thirty years

was you know I don't know thirty years
ago<00:00:58.019> I<00:00:58.050> guess<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.620> putting<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> clutch<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.249> a

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
ago I guess I was putting a clutch in a

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.130 
ago I guess I was putting a clutch in a
Dodge<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.879> time<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.390> did<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> same<00:01:00.960> way

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
Dodge one time and we did the same way

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.070 
Dodge one time and we did the same way
we<00:01:01.320> pulled<00:01:01.670> pull<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> engine<00:01:03.089> instead<00:01:03.989> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
we pulled pull the engine instead of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.730 
we pulled pull the engine instead of
that<00:01:05.030> big<00:01:06.030> transmission<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.020> transfer<00:01:07.470> case

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740

and<00:01:20.610> trying<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.300> it<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.660> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and trying to get it on there and it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.030 
and trying to get it on there and it
just<00:01:22.020> wasn't<00:01:22.230> going<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:24.530> we<00:01:25.530> walked<00:01:25.800> outside

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
just wasn't going and we walked outside

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240 
just wasn't going and we walked outside
and<00:01:26.520> let<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> cigarette<00:01:27.950> standing<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and let a cigarette standing there and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.390 
and let a cigarette standing there and
I'm<00:01:29.520> setting<00:01:29.850> her<00:01:29.910> tongue<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:31.440> went<00:01:32.100> backing

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
I'm setting her tongue and went backing

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.830 
I'm setting her tongue and went backing
and<00:01:32.520> looking<00:01:32.730> at<00:01:32.820> engine<00:01:33.120> just<00:01:33.180> fell<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.600> all

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and looking at engine just fell on all

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
and looking at engine just fell on all
by<00:01:34.110> itself<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.730> hoping<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
by itself so I was kind of hoping that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.600 
by itself so I was kind of hoping that
what<00:01:36.210> happened<00:01:36.480> but<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.290> don't<00:01:37.950> smoke<00:01:38.310> anymore

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
what happened but I don't smoke anymore

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.830 
what happened but I don't smoke anymore
so<00:01:39.090> maybe<00:01:39.690> that's<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.080> problem<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:42.030> anyway

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so maybe that's the problem but anyway

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.480 
so maybe that's the problem but anyway
that's<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.620> one<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.190> stories

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that's just one of the little stories

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
that's just one of the little stories
things<00:01:44.760> weird<00:01:45.000> things<00:01:45.240> happen<00:01:45.570> sometimes<00:01:45.810> but

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
things weird things happen sometimes but

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.770 
things weird things happen sometimes but
I'm<00:01:46.740> surprised<00:01:47.550> that<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.850> got<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.210> there<00:01:48.360> in

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I'm surprised that I got it on there in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
I'm surprised that I got it on there in
in<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.710> amount<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.010> time<00:01:50.190> I<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.700> figured<00:01:51.330> I'd

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
in the amount of time I was figured I'd

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.840 
in the amount of time I was figured I'd
have<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.690> call<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.080> neighbor<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:53.640> maybe

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
have to call in a neighbor and and maybe
