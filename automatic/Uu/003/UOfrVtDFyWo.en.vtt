00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
my little trick for preventing leaks

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.059 
my little trick for preventing leaks
under<00:00:06.240> your<00:00:06.359> pie<00:00:06.540> crust<00:00:06.620> go<00:00:07.620> ahead<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.919> show

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
under your pie crust go ahead and show

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:17.689 
under your pie crust go ahead and show
him<00:00:08.220> Jo<00:00:15.800> Jo<00:00:16.800> that's<00:00:17.010> not<00:00:17.160> exactly<00:00:17.369> what<00:00:17.670> I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
him Jo Jo that's not exactly what I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.920 
him Jo Jo that's not exactly what I
meant<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.060> said<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.330> wanted<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> show<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
meant when I said I wanted to show the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.019 
meant when I said I wanted to show the
leak<00:00:19.140> under<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> pastry<00:00:19.980> thing<00:00:20.220> but

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
leak under the pastry thing but

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.820 
leak under the pastry thing but
apparently<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> didn't<00:00:22.320> explain<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.650> well

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
apparently I didn't explain it well

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.820 
apparently I didn't explain it well
enough<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.130> don't<00:00:23.250> worry<00:00:23.400> about<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.119> okay

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
enough so don't worry about it it's okay

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.290 
enough so don't worry about it it's okay
actually<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.250> sort<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.519> leak<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:26.849> talking

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
actually the sort of leak I'm talking

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480 
actually the sort of leak I'm talking
about<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.500> kind<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.740> leak<00:00:28.949> where<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.400> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
about is the kind of leak where some of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070 
about is the kind of leak where some of
the<00:00:29.550> liquid<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.119> you're<00:00:30.210> filling<00:00:30.570> runs<00:00:30.840> out

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the liquid and you're filling runs out

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.110 
the liquid and you're filling runs out
the<00:00:31.260> holes<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.740> pastry<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.759> makes<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the holes in your pastry and makes a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
exactly the end of the world when this

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
exactly the end of the world when this
happens<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:38.280> mainly<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.730> embarrassing

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

filling<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> outside<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.629> your<00:00:45.719> crust

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
filling on the outside of your crust

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.889 
filling on the outside of your crust
when<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.649> supposed<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.899> let's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
when it's not supposed to be there let's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
when it's not supposed to be there let's
back<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.559> talk<00:00:49.620> about<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:50.100> those<00:00:50.250> holes

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
back up and talk about how those holes

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.760 
back up and talk about how those holes
got<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.239> first<00:00:51.300> place<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.530> put

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
got there in the first place you put

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
got there in the first place you put
them<00:00:52.860> there<00:00:53.010> remember<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.120> did<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
them there remember and you did that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.150 
them there remember and you did that
because<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.930> were<00:00:55.170> partially<00:00:55.710> pre-baking

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
because you were partially pre-baking

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.639 
because you were partially pre-baking
your<00:00:56.460> crust<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> pumpkin<00:00:57.930> pie<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
your crust for like a pumpkin pie or a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.069 
your crust for like a pumpkin pie or a
custard<00:00:59.129> pie<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.579> chess<00:00:59.789> pie<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
custard pie or a chess pie and if you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.599 
custard pie or a chess pie and if you
hadn't<00:01:01.379> made<00:01:01.469> those<00:01:01.680> holes<00:01:01.710> your<00:01:02.250> pastry

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
hadn't made those holes your pastry

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.920 
hadn't made those holes your pastry
would<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.879> ballooned<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.539> during<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
would have ballooned up during the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
would have ballooned up during the
second<00:01:04.290> half<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> pre<00:01:04.830> baking<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.400> then

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
second half of the pre baking and then

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
second half of the pre baking and then
you'd<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.119> real<00:01:06.330> problem<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.840> hands

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
you'd have a real problem on your hands

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
you'd have a real problem on your hands
so<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:09.960> you've<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> plug<00:01:10.560> those<00:01:10.740> holes<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so now you've got to plug those holes so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.039 
so now you've got to plug those holes so
you<00:01:11.400> don't<00:01:11.549> spring<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.939> leak<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.510> here's<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you don't spring a leak and here's the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.649 
you don't spring a leak and here's the
easiest<00:01:13.409> way<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.970> put<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.210> smidgen

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
easiest way to do it just put a smidgen

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
easiest way to do it just put a smidgen
of<00:01:15.930> cream<00:01:16.229> cheese<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> end<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.250> your

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
of cream cheese on the end of your

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.280 
of cream cheese on the end of your
finger<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.240> finger<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.720> dab<00:01:22.080> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
finger and with your finger and dab it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
finger and with your finger and dab it
into<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> holes<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> tiny<00:01:23.790> bit<00:01:24.030> will<00:01:24.210> do

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
into the holes just a tiny bit will do

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030 
into the holes just a tiny bit will do
you're<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.750> trying<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> ice<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> carrot<00:01:25.860> cake

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you're not trying to ice a carrot cake

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
you're not trying to ice a carrot cake
or<00:01:26.159> anything<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:27.090> smear<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
or anything like that just smear it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.780 
or anything like that just smear it
right<00:01:28.049> into<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> holes<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> it'll<00:01:29.340> seal<00:01:29.640> them

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
right into the holes and it'll seal them

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.050 
right into the holes and it'll seal them
right<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:31.250> now<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.700> any<00:01:32.850> cream

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
