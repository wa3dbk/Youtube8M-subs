00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.330
 with the meat pounder I go a little to pound it 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.480
 to beat it to make it a little more 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.780
 thin and to make it anyway more 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.990

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.910
 slip it in well enough inside the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.060
 flour so we make all the slices of 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.940
