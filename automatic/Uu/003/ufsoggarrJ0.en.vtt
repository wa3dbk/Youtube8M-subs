00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.180 

okay<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:41.989> what<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.379> see<00:00:42.530> is<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.710> new<00:00:42.860> variation

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
okay so what you see is a new variation

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.680 
okay so what you see is a new variation
of<00:00:43.430> pull<00:00:43.550> ups<00:00:43.580> are<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.180> I<00:00:44.210> was<00:00:44.300> experimenting

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
of pull ups are and I was experimenting

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.170 
of pull ups are and I was experimenting
yesterday<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:45.590> I<00:00:46.100> call<00:00:46.550> these<00:00:46.730> pull<00:00:46.879> ups<00:00:47.000> as

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
yesterday and I call these pull ups as

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.630 
yesterday and I call these pull ups as
one<00:00:47.690> two<00:00:47.900> three<00:00:48.140> pull<00:00:48.320> ups<00:00:48.550> purely<00:00:49.550> because

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
one two three pull ups purely because

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.479 
one two three pull ups purely because
you<00:00:49.879> doing<00:00:50.030> three<00:00:50.269> pull<00:00:50.480> ups<00:00:50.510> in<00:00:50.780> one<00:00:50.960> go<00:00:51.170> and

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
you doing three pull ups in one go and

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.340 
you doing three pull ups in one go and
believe<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.550> or<00:00:52.670> not<00:00:52.790> this<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.360> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
believe it or not this is the the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.960 
believe it or not this is the the
toughest<00:00:54.739> variation<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.280> pull<00:00:55.430> ups<00:00:55.460> I've<00:00:55.730> done

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
toughest variation of pull ups I've done

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.020 
toughest variation of pull ups I've done
so<00:00:56.150> far<00:00:56.920> it's<00:00:57.920> effective<00:00:58.340> because<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.699> it

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
so far it's effective because a it

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.210 
so far it's effective because a it
breaks<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.809> monotony<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.800> regular<00:01:01.070> pull

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
breaks the monotony of the regular pull

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.350 
breaks the monotony of the regular pull
up<00:01:01.339> because<00:01:01.640> it's<00:01:01.760> not<00:01:01.850> really<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.089> straight

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
up because it's not really a straight

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.960 
up because it's not really a straight
pull<00:01:02.540> up<00:01:02.799> and<00:01:03.799> be<00:01:04.309> because<00:01:04.549> you're<00:01:04.909> doing

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
pull up and be because you're doing

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.520 
pull up and be because you're doing
three<00:01:05.479> pull<00:01:05.659> ups<00:01:05.720> in<00:01:05.900> one<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.320> know<00:01:06.409> one

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
three pull ups in one you know one

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.560 
three pull ups in one you know one
towards<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.010> right<00:01:07.159> one<00:01:08.000> towards<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.360> left

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
towards the right one towards the left

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.110 
towards the right one towards the left
and<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:08.870> straight<00:01:09.140> up<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.100> like<00:01:10.940> I<00:01:11.000> said

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
and one straight up so like I said

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.280 
and one straight up so like I said
before<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:11.510> is<00:01:11.570> probably<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.049> most

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
before this is probably the most

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.469 
before this is probably the most
effective<00:01:12.920> form<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.159> pull<00:01:13.310> ups<00:01:13.340> they're<00:01:14.270> done

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
effective form of pull ups they're done

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.870 
effective form of pull ups they're done
so<00:01:14.659> far<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.799> let<00:01:15.920> me<00:01:15.979> tell<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.190> how<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.400> perform
