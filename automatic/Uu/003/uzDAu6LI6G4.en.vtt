00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.449
 and with the blender you thought that 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.149
 you could only make drinks or liquids 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.720
 we are not going to do something very rich in being 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.949
 some mini soufflÃ© pancakes 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.229
 incredible so you can try your 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.389
 blender in another way and not only this 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:33.149
 but also with this blender 

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:35.129
 light you can have a filter for juice 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.079
 where all the bits and pieces do not 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.149
 they like to stay in the filter and also 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.609
 It has a spectacular grinder in case 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 you want to grind coffee beans seeds or 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.859
 some dried fruits to use in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.859
 your meals 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.380
 let's place three eggs 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.960
 cool, of course, we're going to 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.400
 place in the glass of the blender I have 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.310
 here flour leavening no other we are going to 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.820
 place in the blender jar and you 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.670
 let's put this a little bit of salt 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.580
 I have here 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.620
 we will also put butter 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.110
 melted 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.880
 and we are going to put 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.439
 aerated water or soda 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.960
 so that this is super super 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.590
 spongy we cover very well we work the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.590
 blender 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.100
 we go back to zero 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.100
 and let's check 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.270
 how was our pasta for 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.250
 add the rest of the flour that 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.860
 we had left 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.530
 it's much better to incorporate it twice 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.390
 so that there are no lumps and so that 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.390
 pasta that is super fluffy 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.799
 very easy our pasta is ready not 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.750
 you need to let her rest so she does not 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.549
 is left to itch so what are we going to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.349
 to do is to heat a pan very well and 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.170
 Now let's prepare our lines 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.270
 we have the hot pan if it started 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.040
 much better because it has to be clean 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.520
 totally because the butter already has 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.370
 preparation we are going to put by spoonfuls 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.370
 the size of blind and what you want to do 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.610
 Once they are ready, do not let them 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.760
 burn for checking deviate super 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.850
 easy to see how easy this is look at what 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.770
 fast that is done this is ready the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.860
 let's place 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.860
 on a plate and now we're going to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.830
 present so you choose who you are going to 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.260
 eat and we do it ready to prepare 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.270
 the taste of each even to 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.730
 you can make warm sandwiches and 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.190
 cough with ham and cheese 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.140
 incredible I will prepare them as I 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.600

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.540

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.849
 I'm going to put some blueberries 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.849
 let's prepare another one with dulce de leche 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.280
 This is great and we are going to prepare 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.380
 another with jam 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.380
 let's put a heart of jam 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:30.750
 and we're going to put some strawberries 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.750
 or red fruits can also be 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.500
 and present them as you want, I swear
