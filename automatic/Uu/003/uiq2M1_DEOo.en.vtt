hey<00:00:03.120> Darryl<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:05.660> pouch<00:00:06.660> OOP<00:00:06.990> from

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
hey Darryl this is a a pouch OOP from

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.919 
hey Darryl this is a a pouch OOP from
watching<00:00:07.919> Watchmen<00:00:08.730> sensor<00:00:09.179> from<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.840> oil

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
watching Watchmen sensor from the oil

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.990 
watching Watchmen sensor from the oil
tank<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:11.250> battery's<00:00:11.730> gone<00:00:12.509> flatten<00:00:12.960> it

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
tank the battery's gone flatten it

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.470 
tank the battery's gone flatten it
that's<00:00:15.000> it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
that's it

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.390 
that's it
the<00:00:15.809> screwed<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.350> then<00:00:16.770> we'll<00:00:16.890> close<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.250> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the screwed and then we'll close on to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.640 
the screwed and then we'll close on to
the<00:00:17.460> tank<00:00:17.880> what's<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> sensor<00:00:18.869> loosely<00:00:19.490> and

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
the tank what's the sensor loosely and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.089 
the tank what's the sensor loosely and
and<00:00:22.650> add<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.949> cap<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:24.240> spring<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.980> these

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and add this cap and spring and these

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.080 
and add this cap and spring and these
four<00:00:26.369> batteries<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.599> triple<00:00:27.900> A's<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
four batteries the triple A's so the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.810 
four batteries the triple A's so the
tube<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.020> replace<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:35.130> about<00:00:35.370> twenty

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
tube to replace this it's about twenty

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.479 
tube to replace this it's about twenty
pound<00:00:36.059> plus<00:00:36.300> two<00:00:36.690> penny<00:00:36.930> where<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
pound plus two penny where you go and I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.270 
pound plus two penny where you go and I
thought<00:00:40.070> say<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.370> more<00:00:41.520> neon<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.879> one

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
thought say it a bit more neon this one

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
thought say it a bit more neon this one
so<00:00:44.930> adjustables<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> problem<00:00:49.110> common

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so adjustables this is a problem common

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.600 
so adjustables this is a problem common
parts<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:52.010> it's<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> 15<00:00:53.460> mil<00:00:53.760> Bend<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
parts you see it's a 15 mil Bend so to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.209 
parts you see it's a 15 mil Bend so to
to<00:00:57.239> take<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.449> cap<00:00:57.809> off<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> job

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
to take that cap off it's a bit of a job

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.020 
to take that cap off it's a bit of a job
doing<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:01.219> we<00:01:02.219> had<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> sticky<00:01:02.640> label

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
doing this but we had the sticky label

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.969 
doing this but we had the sticky label
over<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.359> try<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.780> take<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> off<00:01:04.229> first<00:01:04.439> cuz

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
over you try and take that off first cuz

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.310 
over you try and take that off first cuz
to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> passed<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> bit<00:01:07.110> awkward<00:01:07.320> so

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
to get this passed it's a bit awkward so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
to get this passed it's a bit awkward so
once<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.590> passed<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
once you get that passed there so you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.060 
once you get that passed there so you
can<00:01:12.659> put<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> other<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
can put it the other way because the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.300 
can put it the other way because the
caps<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.719 

so<00:01:19.850> that's<00:01:20.299> perfectly<00:01:21.190> don't<00:01:22.190> try<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.520> twist

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
so that's perfectly don't try and twist

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.060 
so that's perfectly don't try and twist
this<00:01:22.940> off<00:01:23.119> because<00:01:23.600> if<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:23.990> if<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:27.040> shake<00:01:28.040> it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
this off because if you if you shake it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.090 
this off because if you if you shake it
like<00:01:28.580> an<00:01:28.700> egg<00:01:29.049> it's<00:01:30.049> gonna<00:01:30.229> be<00:01:30.440> problems<00:01:30.920> for

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
like an egg it's gonna be problems for

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.639 
like an egg it's gonna be problems for
yourself<00:01:31.509> so<00:01:32.509> then<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.890> say<00:01:34.759> some<00:01:34.970> just<00:01:35.210> Abel's

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
yourself so then I say some just Abel's

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.070 
yourself so then I say some just Abel's
heaviest<00:01:36.649> one<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.070> get<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:38.570> slide<00:01:38.899> up

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
heaviest one you can get and slide up

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.359 
heaviest one you can get and slide up
and<00:01:39.200> down<00:01:39.259> smacking<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.270> you'll<00:01:41.270> take<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.509> while

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
and down smacking it you'll take a while

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.010 
and down smacking it you'll take a while
what's<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.549> B<00:01:43.909> patients<00:01:46.149> don't<00:01:47.149> see<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:47.750> comes

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
what's a B patients don't see that comes

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:58.249 
what's a B patients don't see that comes
off<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.780> our<00:01:50.930> spring<00:01:51.259> was<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:51.649> there<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:55.670> so

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.670 

let's<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:58.890> grease<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.460> these<00:01:59.670> as<00:02:00.090> well<00:02:00.680> so

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
let's go grease on these as well so

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.749 
let's go grease on these as well so
that's<00:02:02.670> why<00:02:02.850> forcing<00:02:03.240> busan<00:02:04.460> be<00:02:05.460> good<00:02:05.640> idea

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that's why forcing busan be good idea

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.550 
that's why forcing busan be good idea
when<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.390> gets<00:02:06.539> a<00:02:06.630> new<00:02:06.780> batteries<00:02:07.200> because<00:02:07.469> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
when he gets a new batteries because I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.830 
when he gets a new batteries because I
bought<00:02:07.860> some<00:02:08.099> from<00:02:08.310> Amazon<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.179> exactly<00:02:09.720> the
