indirectly by the Soviet hidin serenity
and<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:38.580> they<00:02:38.730> begin<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.239> control<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.110> begin

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and then they begin to control and begin

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.440 
and then they begin to control and begin
to<00:02:40.500> disturb<00:02:41.010> lies<00:02:41.220> many<00:02:41.519> other<00:02:41.670> countries<00:02:41.910> do

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
to disturb lies many other countries do

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.600 
to disturb lies many other countries do
you<00:02:42.569> think<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> Western<00:02:43.650> will<00:02:43.860> will

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
you think that the Western will will

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.140 
you think that the Western will will
allow<00:02:44.970> them<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.510> control<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.290> route<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:47.150> vital

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
allow them to control the route of vital

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.320 
allow them to control the route of vital
route<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.630> Europe<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:50.580> united<00:02:51.060> states

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
route to Europe and to to united states

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.229 
route to Europe and to to united states
and<00:02:51.650> again<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.220> corner<00:02:53.519> street<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.940> bland

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
and again in a corner street is bland

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.600 
and again in a corner street is bland
even<00:02:54.959> our<00:02:55.110> abilities<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:55.950> others<00:02:56.220> will<00:02:56.430> be

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
even our abilities and others will be

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.180 
even our abilities and others will be
destabilized<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.959> random<00:02:58.440> certainly

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
destabilized on and random certainly

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.979 
destabilized on and random certainly
isn't<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.640> beginning<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:01.470> third<00:03:01.950> world<00:03:02.190> war

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
isn't the beginning of a third world war

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.140 
isn't the beginning of a third world war
with<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.170> west<00:03:04.799> brom<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:05.549> accept<00:03:05.849> this

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
with the west brom we will accept this

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150 
with the west brom we will accept this
certainly<00:03:06.510> no<00:03:06.750> although<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.620> will<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.950> true

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
certainly no although it will be true

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.740 
certainly no although it will be true
later<00:03:08.310> anyway<00:03:08.819> they<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:09.180> act<00:03:09.360> against

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
later anyway they will act against

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.170 
later anyway they will act against
Soviet<00:03:10.650> who<00:03:10.799> already<00:03:10.980> become<00:03:11.549> big<00:03:11.790> under

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
Soviet who already become big under

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940 
Soviet who already become big under
drone<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.720> area<00:03:13.049> certainly<00:03:13.769> we<00:03:13.859> will

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
drone of the area certainly we will

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.640 
drone of the area certainly we will
continue<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.600> then<00:03:15.810> want<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.530> be

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
continue this right you then want to be

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.729 
continue this right you then want to be
leading<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> third<00:03:18.480> world<00:03:18.510> war<00:03:18.810> yet

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
leading to a third world war yet

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.150 
leading to a third world war yet
certainly<00:03:20.250> far<00:03:20.579> as<00:03:20.700> my<00:03:20.880> belief
