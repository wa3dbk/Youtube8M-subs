00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 the bayern are literally wm deliver them 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.850
 how would you classify that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.109
 So I say no you are injured 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.550
 Damaged there really comes in the moment 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.380
 a lot together but this thing with 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.730
 the big tournaments where the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.200
 see bavaria and must afterwards 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.660
 not really come to the bundesliga 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.220
 that would actually have done in 2013 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.480
 because only remembrance so 2011 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.090
 became dortmund champion 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.109
 then the bavaria said that was due to the wm 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.730
 2010 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.980
 since everybody said okay now that comes 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.750
 The Empire strikes back in 2011/2012 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220
 david borussia dortmund best german 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 Masters of all times and it is yet to come 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.579
 the euro in turn stops seven bavaria in the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.280
 semi-final in the square stand against 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.920
 Italy and then Bavaria 2013 makes 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.160
 Munich sets a record for the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.230
 eternity with 91 points and therefore mine 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.360
 I actually 2013 that's the proof 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 was provided was that respect 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.930
 should stop by these tournaments too 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.329
 I just have the title 96 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.860
 won 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.469
 I do not stay with them after that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.850
 dragged so I was totally flat 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.109
 I must honestly say I had 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 I believe only two and a half weeks 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.420
 holiday that was definitely too little and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.220
 that's what happens, hopefully no 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.630
 will happen but I have to go here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.250
 hurting a month is crucial 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.329
 a bit of a head 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.229
 successful what have you just a short 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.670
 break comes back and then everything lasts 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.369
 moment and you are one hundred percent 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.810
 more vulnerable than you see now 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.960
 Just need a break and Thomas 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.539
 has said correctly if you do not 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.460
 itself there is then takes the body 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.530
 So I do not think it's that easy 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.000
 wipe away in the central player 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 especially the most important to the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.950
 positions on the top six 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.390
 bavaria now they can do it 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.610
 yes somehow to compensate for that 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.780
 have an order to play wolfsburg 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.770
 you actually open that up a bit 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.420
 the bill has as the this 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.740
 maybe get out or can and still 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.060
 then win the game with the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.640
 whole problems with this burden 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.220
 but that is the fear that the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.630
 bayern perhaps again 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.090
 still three hours the customer 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.950
 For Schweinsteiger it was on the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.590
 away to the first wm one hundred percent 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.330
 to get fit for the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 tournament was injured for a long time 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.179
 means he had a lot for himself 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.660
 alone invest around this 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.739
 tournament then be in this form 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.190
 to be there too 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.170
 together with khedira the same 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.730
 the same force clocked 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.160
 that's not a normal preparation for that 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.290
 been a world championship then 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.650
 Can you manage to profit for yourself? 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.760
 then America gets one and then 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.200
 thinks he has to play out of the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.750
 have schoolhouse and now he has again 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.970
 such an act caution to luca gaudino 17 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.470
 years old makes a very good game 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.910
 been rated great 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.950
 how did you see that how did you 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.690
 seen this debut quite brisk whole 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.900
 confidently the whole with 17 years 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.750
 as well as the daddy at that time so me 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 believe that he will be on time 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.460
 rather rare in the start formation 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.740
 but I think that also pep 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.180
 guardiola whenever he believes it 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.370
 even then to be able to allow himself 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.790
 will bring when the others are back 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.350
 are offensively also said we catch up 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.400
 in any case, a player at all 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.670
 necessary to think 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.670
 they have three healthy defenders 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.170
 financially as well as a defender 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.940
 but yes here is not bad 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.670
 if you get involved everywhere, from 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.900
 so it was high that she was after mine 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.880
 Maybe it should 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.880
 already have one
