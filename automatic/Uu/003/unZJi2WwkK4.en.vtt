00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
in at night put this up in July of last

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.310 
in at night put this up in July of last
year<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.239> am<00:00:42.270> overdue<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.020> doing

this<00:00:43.440> update<00:00:43.920> video<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> here's<00:00:45.360> our<00:00:45.480> light

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
this update video so here's our light

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.380 
this update video so here's our light
angel<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.590> did<00:00:46.800> work<00:00:47.039> there<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> light

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
angel now it did work there is a light

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
angel now it did work there is a light
sensor<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.230> keeps<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> turned<00:00:49.739> off<00:00:49.890> in

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
sensor in it that keeps it turned off in

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
sensor in it that keeps it turned off in
the<00:00:50.129> daytime<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.300> night<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.870> motion

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the daytime and then at night the motion

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170 
the daytime and then at night the motion
sensor<00:00:52.680> takes<00:00:52.890> over<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> large<00:00:53.940> object

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
sensor takes over and if a large object

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.600 
sensor takes over and if a large object
did<00:00:54.660> move<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:55.559> distance<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.460> did

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
did move some distance from this it did

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160 
did move some distance from this it did
turn<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> light<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.420> 30<00:00:57.600> seconds<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.109> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
turn the light on for 30 seconds or so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.529 
turn the light on for 30 seconds or so
the<00:00:58.949> thing<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.609> after<00:00:59.820> about<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> month

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the thing is that after about a month

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.900 
the thing is that after about a month
the<00:01:00.930> light<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:01.920> already<00:01:02.100> fairly<00:01:02.699> dim

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the light which was already fairly dim

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.820 
the light which was already fairly dim
because<00:01:03.090> again<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.690> LEDs<00:01:04.140> run<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> few

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
because again it's LEDs run by a few

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.240 
because again it's LEDs run by a few
batteries<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.630> dim<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.200> kept<00:01:07.860> on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
batteries got really dim now we kept on

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
batteries got really dim now we kept on
eking<00:01:09.000> out<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.720> light<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.229> still<00:01:10.500> turn

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
eking out some light it would still turn

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
eking out some light it would still turn
on<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.400> about<00:01:11.580> two<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.659> half<00:01:12.840> months

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
on for about two two and a half months

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
on for about two two and a half months
after<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> initially<00:01:13.979> set<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.670> put<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
after I initially set it up put the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
after I initially set it up put the
light<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> came<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.710> mean<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:16.979> even

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
light that came on was I mean not even

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
light that came on was I mean not even
as<00:01:17.280> bright<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.640> moonlight<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.390> after<00:01:19.259> about<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
as bright as moonlight so after about a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.200 
as bright as moonlight so after about a
month<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.670> didn't<00:01:20.909> provide<00:01:21.150> enough

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
month it really didn't provide enough

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.789 
month it really didn't provide enough
light<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.840> useful<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.619> really

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
light to be useful so if you're really

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.550 
light to be useful so if you're really
stuck<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.490> motion-activated<00:01:24.450> lighting<00:01:25.320> in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
stuck for motion-activated lighting in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
stuck for motion-activated lighting in
some<00:01:25.979> place<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.729> plain<00:01:27.030> can't<00:01:27.360> get

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
some place that you just plain can't get

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
some place that you just plain can't get
wires<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.229> it'll<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> job<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.340> plan<00:01:30.060> on

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
wires to it'll do the job but plan on

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.819 
wires to it'll do the job but plan on
being<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.780> every<00:01:31.020> month<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.530> replace

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
being out there every month to replace

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.370 
being out there every month to replace
batteries<00:01:32.270> also<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.479> terms<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> longer<00:01:34.350> term

batteries also in terms of longer term

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.039 
batteries also in terms of longer term
use<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.400> double-sided<00:01:35.880> tape<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> back

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
use this double-sided tape on the back

I<00:02:09.490> think<00:02:09.640> that's<00:02:09.790> what<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.000> would<00:02:10.180> say<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
I think that's what I would say in the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.390 
I think that's what I would say in the
end<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.990> if<00:02:11.230> you're<00:02:11.470> really<00:02:11.650> gonna<00:02:11.860> pinch<00:02:12.190> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
it's an okay choice for that but if

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.790
