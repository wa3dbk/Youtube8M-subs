when you bend down it looks as though

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.529 
when you bend down it looks as though

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
that you're turning your your arms in

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.349 
that you're turning your your arms in
your<00:01:38.710> shoulders<00:01:39.070> but<00:01:39.640> you're<00:01:39.789> not<00:01:40.000> turning

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
your shoulders but you're not turning

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.749 
your shoulders but you're not turning
your<00:01:40.719> head<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.219> just<00:01:42.340> looks<00:01:42.609> like

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
your head because it just looks like

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.840 
your head because it just looks like
you're<00:01:42.969> struggling<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:44.259> get<00:01:44.409> that<00:01:44.619> full<00:01:45.009> 180

the way that skateboarding made simple

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.199 
the way that skateboarding made simple
works<00:03:58.419> is<00:03:58.719> it's<00:03:58.900> unlike<00:03:59.349> any<00:03:59.620> other<00:04:00.209> tutorial

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
works is it's unlike any other tutorial

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.809 
works is it's unlike any other tutorial
video<00:04:01.540> or<00:04:01.989> step<00:04:02.859> by<00:04:03.040> step<00:04:03.280> thing<00:04:03.489> you've<00:04:03.729> ever

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
video or step by step thing you've ever

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.309 
video or step by step thing you've ever
done<00:04:03.969> because<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.540> breaks<00:04:04.719> it<00:04:04.930> down<00:04:05.079> so

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
done because it breaks it down so

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.439 
done because it breaks it down so
there's<00:04:05.500> always<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:06.099> step<00:04:06.639> you<00:04:06.849> can<00:04:06.879> be<00:04:07.180> working

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
there's always a step you can be working
