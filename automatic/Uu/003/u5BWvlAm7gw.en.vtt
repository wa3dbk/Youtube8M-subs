00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.279
 hello friends welcome today we are going to 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:24.140
 make an enzymatic drink called 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:27.020
 prejubilar is regular is a glue 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.630
 non-alcoholic liquid that can be made 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.770
 with any serial seed or legumes 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.860
 we can already use wheat we can use oats 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.620
 barley as Caesar by two worlds and in 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.230
 house let's use lentils 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.950
 It is also known as water of life or 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.960
 purifying water what are the uses 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.840
 that we can give you as you do not know what you are 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.450
 both hard and semi hard to rub a 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.040
 yogurt we can include it in the shakes 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.250
 of every day always a good 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.320
 amount of tomorrow cooperate and also 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.050
 for those who being a drink 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.670
 enzyme obviously has that on top 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.470
 is one of its properties that are going to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.340
 do the enzymes are going to help us 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.340
 our digestion 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.020
 just like other we have other super 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.820
 friends that are the probiotics this 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.090
 Apart from pre defer the food that 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.740
 will do is help the assimilation and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.760
 helps the balance of the flora 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.980
 intestinal so we have two friends 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.530
 on the one hand the enzymes and on the other 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.780
 side of probiotics remember that 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.360
 to make this recover have to 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.700
 keep in mind is how to make a 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.340
 activation of a seed a legume and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.260
 you finish but those are the two steps 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.720
 that we need first activation and 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.980
 after germination of the seed that 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.130
 Now we have chosen to do in 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.130
 reality 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.700
 there we have in activating the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.100
 seed and here we have is germination 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.490
 of the seed so we already know not 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.750
 we have an excuse we are already trained 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.360
 good romay how is the process for 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.039
 making this retiree is super easy what 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.560
 only thing we are going to do is have the water 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.709
 and have finished in this case the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.050
 lentil we're going is in a bottle or in 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.290
 a jar what you have we are going to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.480
 put a liter of water for 60 grams of 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 sprouted lentils so these 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.190
 about half a cup let him 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.470
 let's go they'll see that the water at 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.780
 start until the crystalline or almost 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.850
 crystalline and with the running of the hours 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.650
 and in the days it's going to start putting 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.680
 more white back or is going to put 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.830
 cloudy, that process that begins 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.630
 pass the lentil enzymes go to 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.350
 be transferred to the water that what 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.720
 we want the times which are between 1 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.840
 and 2 days 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.330
 and we are going to experiment and 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.210
 see that we like this cow more is more 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.190
 cloudy or not so cloudy, remember that 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.100
 this process can be repeated until 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.560
 three times more the first time with a 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.360
 liter of water the second time with half 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.610
 liter of water we can reuse the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.100
 We germinated and the third time and we will 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.100
 finish - pump a quarter liter of 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.890
 water has already gone a day and a half and we have 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.400
 as summer the water is much more cloudy 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.400
 of the teeth 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.680
 and it has a yeasty aroma 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.600
 quite already lentils finished in the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.000
 lentil finished remember that you have 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.490
 that having a rich smell does not have to be 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.040
 Well, if you already have ugly the puntanos that 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.709
 it was rotted you have to do it back follows 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.709
 close attention to eye with that 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.100
 the lemon we are going to use if we are going to use 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.800
 made the same colander and let's avoid 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.350
 that the seeds enter the measure is 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.310
 for a liter of juve the average of 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.140
 lemon 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.140
 remember that these products 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.800
 they are organic lentils the best 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.480
 nutrition without pesticides and neurochemicals 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.810
 every organism must be passed if I want 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.760
 make a second batch as soon as we get 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.950
 the lentil roads 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.870
 we must hunt a new reason we can not 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.210
 wait between crop cultivation because 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.729
 the two people are going to dry and it's so 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.570
 easy to put water in and leave it and 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.490
 is 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.200
 advance less amount of water how much 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.150
 We can have it on the slope of 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.270
 prejubilar watches I recommend between 2 and 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.430
 4 days up to 5 days equally if the 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.650
 have a week usually do well 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.500
 alimonados can also do it with 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.780
 this we finished the recipe easy and fast 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.370
 of the rejuvenal start activating the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.070
 enzymes that we lack in the 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.790
 feeding and on a back a lot 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.860
 as is 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.160
 so if you liked this regular video 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.050
 give a like comment and share 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.350
 thank you very much for continuing on the other side 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.350
 forever 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.669
 and the cheeses 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.380
 for the properties that we are going to have 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:21.560
 do not 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.560
 we do not have agreed on the direct game 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.669
 peace 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.219
 good 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.219
 no no
