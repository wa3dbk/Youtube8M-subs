00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.519 

okay<00:00:02.480> I'm<00:00:03.480> first<00:00:03.840> going<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.110> show<00:00:04.200> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
okay I'm first going to show the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.030 
okay I'm first going to show the
complete<00:00:04.890> operation<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.990> our<00:00:06.990> trailing<00:00:07.649> point

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
complete operation of our trailing point

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.299 
complete operation of our trailing point
signal<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.940> East<00:00:09.150> End<00:00:09.420> loop<00:00:10.170> interlocking

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.120 

and<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.400> will<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:15.500> pretty<00:00:16.500> much<00:00:16.590> you'll<00:00:16.890> see

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
and you will see pretty much you'll see

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970 
and you will see pretty much you'll see
how<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.670> signals<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> operate<00:00:18.980> based

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
how the signals going to operate based

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:42.760 
how the signals going to operate based
on<00:00:20.189> train<00:00:20.789> movement<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:23.600> here<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.720> go

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.710 

as<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.400> can<00:00:43.490> see<00:00:43.700> once<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.000> train<00:00:44.240> passes

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
as you can see once the train passes

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.680 
as you can see once the train passes
that<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:44.990> switches<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> red<00:00:46.630> this<00:00:47.630> is

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
that it switches to a red this is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.540 
that it switches to a red this is
because<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:48.380> Train<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.830> in<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.010> detector

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
because the Train is in the detector

00:00:49.550 --> 00:01:06.030 
because the Train is in the detector
circuit

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.120 

now<00:01:06.610> once<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.240> train<00:01:07.540> leaves<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.620> immediate

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
now once the train leaves the immediate

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.980 
now once the train leaves the immediate
detector<00:01:09.670> circuit<00:01:10.120> that<00:01:10.330> signal<00:01:10.780> will

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
detector circuit that signal will

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:20.910 
detector circuit that signal will
upgrade<00:01:11.980> to<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.250> approach<00:01:13.030> indication

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.770 

there<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.580> goes<00:01:21.760> right<00:01:21.880> there<00:01:22.210> upgrading<00:01:22.660> to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
there it goes right there upgrading to

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.820 
there it goes right there upgrading to
an<00:01:22.900> approach<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:26.010> once<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.220> train<00:01:28.530> exits<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
an approach and once the train exits the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.830 
an approach and once the train exits the
proceeding<00:01:30.760> block<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:33.580> second<00:01:34.090> block<00:01:34.270> ahead

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
proceeding block the second block ahead

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.350 
proceeding block the second block ahead
it<00:01:35.710> will<00:01:35.920> upgrade<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.670> clear

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:53.080 

and<00:01:43.540> here<00:01:43.870> we<00:01:43.990> see<00:01:44.020> upgrade<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.770> clear

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.420 

and<00:01:53.270> that's<00:01:54.049> our<00:01:54.229> basic<00:01:54.440> operation<00:01:55.130> for<00:01:55.310> that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
and that's our basic operation for that

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.520 
and that's our basic operation for that
signal<00:01:57.040> for<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.070> westbound<00:01:59.000> movement<00:01:59.530> now

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
signal for a westbound movement now

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.170 
signal for a westbound movement now
let's<00:02:00.710> take<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.920> look<00:02:01.130> at<00:02:01.430> an<00:02:01.759> eastbound

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
let's take a look at an eastbound

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.870 
let's take a look at an eastbound
movement<00:02:04.180> okay<00:02:05.770> here's<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.920> basic<00:02:07.250> operation

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
movement okay here's the basic operation

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.160 
movement okay here's the basic operation
of<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.920> eastbound<00:02:09.920> movement<00:02:10.870> for<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
of a eastbound movement for the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.130 
of a eastbound movement for the
westbound<00:02:12.560> East<00:02:13.370> end<00:02:13.640> loop<00:02:13.880> mainline<00:02:14.600> signal

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
westbound East end loop mainline signal

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.840 
westbound East end loop mainline signal
the<00:02:16.069> trailing<00:02:16.489> point<00:02:16.730> signal<00:02:18.069> now<00:02:19.069> basic

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
the trailing point signal now basic

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.500 
the trailing point signal now basic
operation<00:02:20.450> here<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.819> as<00:02:22.819> soon<00:02:23.000> as<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.209> give<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
operation here is as soon as I give the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.900 
operation here is as soon as I give the
train<00:02:23.750> throttle<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:25.280> immediately<00:02:25.730> goes<00:02:25.880> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
train throttle it immediately goes to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.540 
train throttle it immediately goes to
red<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.680> because<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> detector

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
red and this is because the detector

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.380 
red and this is because the detector
circuit<00:02:29.410> preceding<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.530> signal<00:02:31.269> detects<00:02:32.269> a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
circuit preceding the signal detects a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.070 
circuit preceding the signal detects a
reverse<00:02:32.750> current<00:02:33.370> which<00:02:34.370> opposes<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
reverse current which opposes the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.920 
reverse current which opposes the
governing<00:02:36.080> signal<00:02:36.790> therefore<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.540> signal

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
governing signal therefore the signal

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.830 
governing signal therefore the signal
goes<00:02:39.080> red

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.020 

and<00:02:45.410> we'll<00:02:45.620> be<00:02:45.739> back<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.220> train<00:02:46.430> shows<00:02:46.700> up

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.270 

our<00:02:50.030> eastbound<00:02:50.930> stone<00:02:51.530> train<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.130> now

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
our eastbound stone train is now

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.680 
our eastbound stone train is now
approaching<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:55.970> see<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.180> signal<00:02:56.540> still

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
approaching you can see the signal still

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.300 
approaching you can see the signal still
red<00:02:57.190> becomes<00:02:58.190> our<00:02:58.400> eastbound<00:02:58.819> a<00:03:00.190> signal<00:03:01.190> will

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
red becomes our eastbound a signal will

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.190 
red becomes our eastbound a signal will
remain<00:03:01.640> red<00:03:01.940> until<00:03:04.360> pretty<00:03:05.360> much<00:03:05.450> until<00:03:05.989> I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
remain red until pretty much until I

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.070 
remain red until pretty much until I
take<00:03:07.069> away<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.430> throttle<00:03:07.819> power<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.870> never

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
take away the throttle power it never

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.910 
take away the throttle power it never
changes

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
changes

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:48.280 
changes
it<00:03:10.069> never<00:03:10.250> upgrades<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.030> clear<00:03:11.390> or<00:03:11.540> anything

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.640 

and<00:03:49.290> once<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.920> de<00:03:50.519> throttle<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.090> train<00:03:51.650> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
and once I de throttle the train the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.059 
and once I de throttle the train the
signal<00:03:53.780> returns<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.019> yell<00:03:55.290> then<00:03:55.560> returns<00:03:55.950> to

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
signal returns to a yell then returns to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.059 
signal returns to a yell then returns to
green<00:03:58.189> and<00:03:59.959> once<00:04:00.959> again<00:04:01.110> we<00:04:01.470> are<00:04:01.500> back<00:04:01.860> in

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
green and once again we are back in

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.339 
green and once again we are back in
standby<00:04:02.730> mode<00:04:02.939> at<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.810> interlocking<00:04:06.349> now

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
standby mode at the interlocking now

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.490 
standby mode at the interlocking now
let's<00:04:07.620> take<00:04:07.859> a<00:04:07.890> little<00:04:08.099> look<00:04:08.430> at<00:04:08.670> our<00:04:09.500> Wharf

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
let's take a little look at our Wharf

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.149 
let's take a little look at our Wharf
signals<00:04:11.569> as<00:04:12.569> I<00:04:12.810> said<00:04:13.049> before<00:04:13.230> these<00:04:13.739> are<00:04:13.799> at

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
signals as I said before these are at

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.440 
signals as I said before these are at
the<00:04:14.310> interlockings<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.299> they're

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
the interlockings and they're

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.150 
the interlockings and they're
interlocked<00:04:15.870> with<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.289> switch<00:04:16.620> system<00:04:19.160> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
interlocked with the switch system the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.710 
interlocked with the switch system the
reason<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.579> this<00:04:20.729> one<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.090> showing<00:04:21.299> your<00:04:21.510> red

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
reason that this one is showing your red

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.469 
reason that this one is showing your red
is<00:04:21.930> because<00:04:22.289> like<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.500> said<00:04:22.800> before<00:04:23.300> switch<00:04:24.300> is

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
is because like I said before switch is

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.820 
is because like I said before switch is
throwing<00:04:24.780> against<00:04:25.139> this<00:04:25.639> against<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.729> branch

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
throwing against this against the branch

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.100 
throwing against this against the branch
I'm<00:04:28.830> also<00:04:29.130> working<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.880> installing<00:04:30.360> some

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
I'm also working on installing some

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.159 
I'm also working on installing some
circuitry<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.270> when<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.419> train<00:04:33.630> goes<00:04:33.840> across

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
circuitry so when the train goes across

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.990 
circuitry so when the train goes across
the<00:04:34.380> diamond<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:34.979> signal<00:04:35.370> will<00:04:35.490> also<00:04:35.880> switch

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
the diamond this signal will also switch

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.300 
the diamond this signal will also switch
to<00:04:36.150> red<00:04:36.510> as<00:04:36.630> well<00:04:37.699> now<00:04:38.699> we're<00:04:39.660> going<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.810> do<00:04:40.310> is

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
to red as well now we're going to do is

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.210 
to red as well now we're going to do is
we<00:04:41.610> are<00:04:41.699> going<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:41.970> throw<00:04:42.419> switches<00:04:43.789> at<00:04:46.220> East

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
we are going to throw switches at East

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.640 
we are going to throw switches at East
End<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.759> West<00:04:48.090> End<00:04:48.300> loop<00:04:48.479> as<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.349> can<00:04:49.470> see

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
End and West End loop as you can see

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.760 
End and West End loop as you can see
once<00:04:49.919> I<00:04:50.099> threw<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.490> switch<00:04:50.610> at<00:04:50.940> East<00:04:51.240> End<00:04:51.389> loop

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
once I threw the switch at East End loop

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.980 
once I threw the switch at East End loop
the<00:04:52.770> signal<00:04:53.190> upgrades<00:04:53.729> from<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.150> stop

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
the signal upgrades from a stop

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.310 
the signal upgrades from a stop
indication<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.740> flashing<00:04:56.430> green<00:04:56.990> now<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.020> low

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
indication to a flashing green now a low

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.540 
indication to a flashing green now a low
flashing<00:04:59.039> green<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.699> a<00:05:00.240> medium<00:05:00.840> clear<00:05:01.550> modeled

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
flashing green is a medium clear modeled

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.140 
flashing green is a medium clear modeled
after<00:05:02.669> CNO<00:05:04.789> signal<00:05:05.789> aspects<00:05:07.699> now<00:05:08.699> let's<00:05:08.940> take

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
after CNO signal aspects now let's take

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:23.680 
after CNO signal aspects now let's take
a<00:05:09.180> look<00:05:09.419> at<00:05:09.539> this<00:05:09.690> guy<00:05:09.930> in<00:05:10.139> action

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.580 

as<00:05:24.290> you<00:05:24.410> can<00:05:24.500> see<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:24.950> has<00:05:25.220> downgraded<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:26.150> a

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
as you can see it has downgraded to a

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.190 
as you can see it has downgraded to a
approached<00:05:28.150> this<00:05:29.150> is<00:05:29.300> because<00:05:29.690> of<00:05:29.930> the

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
approached this is because of the

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.060 
approached this is because of the
reverse<00:05:31.130> loop<00:05:31.430> wiring<00:05:31.880> now<00:05:32.030> once<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:32.890> throw<00:05:33.890> the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
reverse loop wiring now once I throw the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.640 
reverse loop wiring now once I throw the
reverse<00:05:34.340> little<00:05:34.730> bit<00:05:34.850> will<00:05:34.970> go<00:05:35.060> back<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.270> a

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
reverse little bit will go back to a

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.560 
reverse little bit will go back to a
flashing<00:05:36.650> green<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.190> then<00:05:37.850> to<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.060> red<00:05:38.330> as<00:05:38.540> the

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
flashing green and then to a red as the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:51.090 
flashing green and then to a red as the
train<00:05:38.870> passes<00:05:39.140> it

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.290 

this<00:05:51.670> signal<00:05:52.120> will<00:05:52.240> also<00:05:53.400> upgrade<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:55.270> a

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
this signal will also upgrade to a

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.110 
this signal will also upgrade to a
approach<00:05:56.170> once<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.280> train<00:05:57.550> enters<00:05:57.970> the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
approach once the train enters the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:07.390 
approach once the train enters the
second<00:05:58.510> block<00:05:58.660> preceding<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.470> signal

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.430 

we'll<00:06:07.850> zoom<00:06:08.120> in<00:06:08.389> so<00:06:08.600> you<00:06:08.690> can<00:06:08.810> see<00:06:08.840> the<00:06:09.200> light<00:06:09.410> a

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
we'll zoom in so you can see the light a

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.030 
we'll zoom in so you can see the light a
little<00:06:09.770> better<00:06:11.020> as<00:06:12.020> you<00:06:12.260> can<00:06:12.410> tell<00:06:12.590> I<00:06:12.620> have<00:06:12.770> to

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
little better as you can tell I have to

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.379 
little better as you can tell I have to
paint<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.430> backs<00:06:13.610> of<00:06:13.820> these<00:06:14.000> signals<00:06:16.389> but

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
paint the backs of these signals but

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.950 
paint the backs of these signals but
here<00:06:17.600> it<00:06:17.690> is<00:06:17.810> showing<00:06:18.169> a<00:06:18.470> medium<00:06:19.310> approach

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
here it is showing a medium approach
