00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
same thing just to secure that little

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.030 
same thing just to secure that little
loop<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.830> there<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.730> have<00:03:11.880> or<00:03:12.150> not<00:03:12.769> now<00:03:13.769> some

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
loop and there you have or not now some

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.009 
loop and there you have or not now some
people<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.030> loop<00:03:15.209> first<00:03:15.600> and

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
people like to do the loop first and

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.610 
people like to do the loop first and
then<00:03:16.709> go<00:03:16.920> back<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.190> take<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.610> same<00:03:18.090> hair<00:03:18.620> and
