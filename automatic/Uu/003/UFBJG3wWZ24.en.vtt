00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.800
 the shopping centers are spaces 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.300
 open to the public as schedules 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.910
 extended that allow the visitor 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.010
 live a comfortable and healthy experience 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.230
 entertainment from the entrance in 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.849
 validity of decree 602 the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.360
 operation of this has been seen 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.360
 affected 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.950
 you imagine that they stop existing one 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.910
 as a user of the shopping center that 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.430
 comes and does not find what you want 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.230
 of many empty stores and especially 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.420
 why good malls 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.390
 here in acarigua it is a place 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.730
 entertainment where most of the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.200
 people because we are frequent in a 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.730
 mall was a place where no 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.140
 came to be distracted came to bring the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.850
 family came as to hang out 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.710
 nice now you are watching 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.930
 lately the facilities first 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.970
 empty practically because most 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.580
 of businesses do not have merchandise or they 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.660
 have been forced to close 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.720
 unfortunately it is a place where one in 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.000
 Instead of being when you are looking down 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.460
 sometimes entertain one until a 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 little depressed by the situation that that 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 it is noted 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.530
 the shopping centers in venezuela are 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.000
 practically the only place of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.370
 Recreation that the family has 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 Venezuelan and are the places where one 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.080
 good generally what one visits 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 for us it really is still sad 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.950
 the situation because we see how it has 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.990
 decayed the maintenance in some 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.939
 shopping centers 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.600
 what is happening at the level 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.040
 national and affects all projects 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.409
 and investments that are going to be the center 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.479
 unfortunately, many have 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.330
 paralyzed by waiting for this 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.189
 situation ends and as a visitor 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 because we see that many services 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.420
 basic as bathrooms have had to 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.100
 close and other things trying to 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.590
 stretch the supplies because they do not 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.049
 get so expensive affects us 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.030
 quite with this crisis that we are 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.899
 living, we had to reduce 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.299
 some things 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.519
 is affecting operations both the 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.780
 parking as nothing else 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.379
 personally but of all the centers 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.500
 commercial and this because of all this 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.750
 We can prepare services that we want 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.790
 giving this work affects me because 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.310
 we arrive the visitors the users the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
 tenants complaining that the center 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.579
 commercial is the bathrooms are dirty 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.220
 the corridors we do not have do not have no 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.400
 they equip the bathrooms with paper towel 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.709
 garbage bags we will not have the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.389
 resources needed to feed all 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.090
 the facilities of a shopping center 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.769
 as such and that's why we do not see so much 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.450
 affected of it and we also 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.450
 because we lower the quality of services 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.350
 nowadays there is some concern already 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 that it's not just us who 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.900
 we can stay unemployed but a lot 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.340
 this work the premises there are thousands 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.010
 of people and who can stay 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810
 unemployed from the worry that today 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.150
 everything does not bother me 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.270
 part of this company this 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.630
 organization are affected us in the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.510
 sense that and to lower a level of dénia 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.750
 and lower the income level of the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.700
 butt company would not be limiting by 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.250
 course the benefits all the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.700
 contractual socio-economic benefits 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.980
 that the company offered us the film 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.830
 organizational is no longer the same as 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.630
 who works more attention waiting for 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.160
 what I will have more ahead 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.330
 I see that my work is going 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.100
 down because nothing else I do not know being 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.380
 affected everything all all are new 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.580
 accept object I'm scared because this is 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.130
 the sustenance of my family my children 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.390
 is the most serious thing for us as 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.220
 merchants was the low income of 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.490
 goods mostly for the part of 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.140
 replacement that we have come from one of 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.770
 the end of the year season that is 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.810
 where sales increase and this the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.310
 replenishment this year has been very slow 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.000
 and of course our inventories 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.650
 they are affected because it is sad to see 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.510
 this then stores empty shops that 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.510
 they are closed because they can not meet 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.610
 with your sales goals or just do not 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.170
 they have to sell that habits this 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.820
 commercial version for example already 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.040
 we have few visits from the 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.200
 people and very few actions that 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.990
 they find us open here 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.810
 we are staying alone and we have to 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.060
 sales we have not received merchandise 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.820
 we found stores with few 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.730
 resources for sale with stores that 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.580
 they are closing much earlier because 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.340
 really do not have much to offer the 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.770
 public and good also as a user 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.300
 I say that we do not have functioning 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.500
 law stairs 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.990
 unfortunately, yes, it has gone 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.420
 decaying what the mall 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.950
 or what he had been doing for a while 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.470
 time ago 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.450
 we work in the marketing part 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.160
 we work from Monday to Friday 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.530
 to generate the wind the three 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.800
 Good weeks obviously if it affects me 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.949
 make it a Sunday and a holiday 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.560
 it's the day we get older 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.360
 emphasis on the events for the saint 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.760
 tomás no longer have base do not have 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.220

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.960
 the events for families so that 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.550
 also the families here before not 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.460
 there was a shopping center here in 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.640
 acarigua and one took the option to go 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.200

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.880

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.900
 both the workers of the center 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.490
 commercial as we are affected by 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.320
 users that in cities like acarigua 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.910
 that there are not many places to visit that 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.320
 They frequent a shopping mall and 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.510
 quite important because it's for the 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.360

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.090

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.100
 ally 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.949
 excellent because it has opened the 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.080
 ropes for all events and 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.990
 We were even participating on the 6th 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.790
 January the day of kings in several 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.160
 opportunities are going to open all the 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.960
 doors just like we celebrated the 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.370
 World Day of Autism in the center 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.199
 commercial is an example of 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.910
 solidarity because it has not been 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.530
 simply the regular foundation of 2 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.810
 silva friends killed cancer which has 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.000
 benefited from you but other 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.130
 non-profit institutions that 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.820
 they also do the same work that 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.820
 we perform 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.190
 the good thing we have to preserve it 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.160
 we have always worked with the slogan 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.970
 we are people no longer molt we are people who 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.980
 he dreams that he works day after day 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.740
 give your best so that this center 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.900
 commercial be the mall number 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.310
 one of the city currently of 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.290
 shortage of foreign currency has been felt 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.240
 about inventories of stores without 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.470
 inventory there are no trade centers 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.420
 commercial are a space of 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.520
 favorite living and recreation 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.800
 by citizens among other things 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.720
 because they feel protected without recourse 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.970
 of the shopping center can not guarantee 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.100
 security the shopping centers are 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.040
 large employment centers without centers 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:24.100
 commercial 586 thousand families look 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.240
 threatened in the end without solutions 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.240
 there are only reductions
