called cyber blast and there was very
little<00:01:56.040> blasting<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> fact<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
little blasting in it it's the fact that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
little blasting in it it's the fact that
aiming<00:01:58.469> isn't<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.920> great<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.399> game<00:01:59.640> it's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
