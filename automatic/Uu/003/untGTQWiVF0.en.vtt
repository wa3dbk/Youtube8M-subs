00:01:17.539 --> 00:02:07.180 
rear-engine all-wheel drive let's see
how<00:01:17.750> they<00:01:17.869> do<00:01:17.929> across<00:01:18.789> 1320<00:01:19.789> feet<00:01:19.970> asphalt

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.160 

well<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.400> interesting<00:02:08.780> let's<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:10.020> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
well that's interesting let's see that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.760 
well that's interesting let's see that
again<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.720> seven<00:02:16.050> pounds<00:02:16.200> per<00:02:16.440> horsepower

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
again the seven pounds per horsepower

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.590 
again the seven pounds per horsepower
compared<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.490> Corvette<00:02:17.880> significantly

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
lighter 5.2 pounds per horsepower why

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.910 
lighter 5.2 pounds per horsepower why
does<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> 911<00:02:21.870> jump<00:02:22.050> out<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.200> such<00:02:22.470> an<00:02:22.590> early

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
does the 911 jump out to such an early

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.240 
does the 911 jump out to such an early
lead<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.910> answer<00:02:24.240> traction<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.740> Corvette<00:02:26.130> is

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
lead the answer traction the Corvette is
