00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.169 
special weapon and i wanted to talk
about<00:00:12.330> them<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> little<00:00:13.440> more<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.490> firstly<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
about them a little more so firstly the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.859 
about them a little more so firstly the
good<00:00:15.360> things<00:00:15.690> well<00:00:16.350> first<00:00:16.949> thing<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.580> that

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
good things well first thing is that

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
good things well first thing is that
they<00:00:18.869> usually<00:00:19.170> are<00:00:19.770> bound<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.670> hit<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.090> least<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
they usually are bound to hit at least a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.290 
they usually are bound to hit at least a
little<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.529> they<00:00:22.710> pretty<00:00:23.189> much<00:00:23.310> never<00:00:23.730> hit

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
little bit so they pretty much never hit

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.130 
little bit so they pretty much never hit
never<00:00:24.710> misses<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:26.550> that's<00:00:27.539> pretty<00:00:27.960> much

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
never misses but that's pretty much

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.380 
never misses but that's pretty much
about<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.890> another<00:00:29.310> thing<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.179> they

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
about that another thing is that they

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.740 
about that another thing is that they
are<00:00:30.420> fast<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.439> strike<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
are fast and they can strike you with a

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.080 
are fast and they can strike you with a
declaw<00:00:33.750> spec<00:00:34.230> much<00:00:34.739> faster<00:00:35.280> than<00:00:35.460> most<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
declaw spec much faster than most of the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.040 
declaw spec much faster than most of the
weapons<00:00:36.239> such<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:37.620> GS<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.719> strike

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
weapons such as a GS and you can strike

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.100 
weapons such as a GS and you can strike
twice<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.070> row<00:00:41.280> quite<00:00:41.700> fastly<00:00:42.570> also<00:00:42.960> at

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
twice in a row quite fastly also at

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.290 
twice in a row quite fastly also at
least<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:43.829> they're<00:00:44.370> cheap<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.090> that's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
least right now they're cheap so that's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.779 
least right now they're cheap so that's
another<00:00:45.600> good<00:00:45.870> thing<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.489> anyways<00:00:47.489> that's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
another good thing but anyways that's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
another good thing but anyways that's
pretty<00:00:48.210> much<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.809> good<00:00:48.989> things<00:00:49.170> they

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pretty much all the good things they

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250 
pretty much all the good things they
have<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> bad<00:00:50.610> things<00:00:50.940> first<00:00:51.570> obviously

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
have now the bad things first obviously

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.459 
have now the bad things first obviously
they<00:00:53.010> don't<00:00:53.219> hit<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.879> high<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:55.050> used<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
they don't hit as high as they used to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.150 
they don't hit as high as they used to
before<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.980> EOC<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> all<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> other

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
before the EOC and all of the other

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
before the EOC and all of the other
updates<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.609> seem<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.210> much<00:01:00.510> weaker

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
updates so they seem to be much weaker

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.250 
updates so they seem to be much weaker
and<00:01:01.170> their<00:01:02.010> mock<00:01:02.370> Max's<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.989> like

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and their mock Max's pretty much like

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.510 
and their mock Max's pretty much like
150<00:01:05.040> now<00:01:05.489> days<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.780> used<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.430> 450<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
150 now days when it used to be 450 and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.020 
150 now days when it used to be 450 and
stuff<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.170> incredibly<00:01:11.030> lower

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
stuff like that so it's incredibly lower

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
stuff like that so it's incredibly lower
also<00:01:12.510> obviously<00:01:13.110> dragon<00:01:13.590> claws<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.220> dual

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
also obviously dragon claws are now dual

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.090 
also obviously dragon claws are now dual
wield<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> need<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.170> reel<00:01:16.350> two<00:01:16.710> items

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
wield so you need to reel two items

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.280 
wield so you need to reel two items
instead<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.299> takes<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.930> time

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
instead of one which takes more time

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.219 
instead of one which takes more time
takes<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.430> space<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.119> your<00:01:21.150> inventory<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
takes more space in your inventory and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.289 
takes more space in your inventory and
sit<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:25.020> uncommon

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
sit so on you know it's really uncommon

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.600 
sit so on you know it's really uncommon
you<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.810> items<00:01:28.020> instead<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> if

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you have two items instead of one and if

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.640 
you have two items instead of one and if
you're<00:01:29.759> protecting<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you're protecting one of them so you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.649 
you're protecting one of them so you
will<00:01:32.130> lose<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> other<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.119> or<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.509> will

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
will lose the other one or you will

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.749 
will lose the other one or you will
protect<00:01:34.110> both<00:01:34.350> losing<00:01:34.920> something<00:01:35.189> else

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
protect both losing something else

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.999 
protect both losing something else
valuable<00:01:36.600> that's<00:01:36.840> pretty<00:01:37.409> much<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
valuable that's pretty much all that I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.179 
valuable that's pretty much all that I
noticed<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:39.060> king<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.159> actually<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
noticed be king but actually that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.880 
noticed be king but actually that
there's<00:01:41.939> only<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.570> cliff<00:01:43.320> where<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> actually

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
there's only one cliff where I actually

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.940 
there's only one cliff where I actually
got<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> kill<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:45.060> dragon<00:01:45.540> claws<00:01:45.950> others

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
got the kill with dragon claws others

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.319 
got the kill with dragon claws others
were<00:01:47.460> only<00:01:48.590> dragon<00:01:49.590> claw<00:01:49.829> specs<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:51.119> them

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
were only dragon claw specs get them

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.050 
were only dragon claw specs get them
down<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:52.049> below<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.100> my<00:01:53.369> chaotic

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
down really below and then my chaotic

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.450 
down really below and then my chaotic
spare<00:01:54.479> finishes<00:01:54.960> them<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.590> i<00:01:55.829> really

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
spare finishes them off so i really

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.149 
spare finishes them off so i really
really<00:01:56.729> need<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.240> thing<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.740> something

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
really need a thing is to have something

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520 
really need a thing is to have something
to<00:01:59.369> finish<00:01:59.850> them<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.210> after<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.899> spec<00:02:01.229> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to finish them off after the spec so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
to finish them off after the spec so
because<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> specs<00:02:02.759> don't<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.299> kill

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
because the specs don't really kill

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.200 
because the specs don't really kill
people<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.320> much<00:02:04.649> nowadays<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.000> you're

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
people that much nowadays so if you're
