amounts<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.320> damage<00:03:26.090> that's<00:03:27.090> okay<00:03:27.480> we're

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
amounts of damage that's okay we're

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.660 
amounts of damage that's okay we're
looking<00:03:28.560> there<00:03:28.860> looking<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.160> killing<00:03:29.580> my
