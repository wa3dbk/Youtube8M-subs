this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.180> kalam<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:48.540> very<00:01:48.750> sensitive

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:37.730 

let's<00:02:09.300> try<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.890> through<00:02:11.070> one<00:02:11.220> base<00:02:11.400> one

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.710 

because<00:02:38.740> as<00:02:38.920> ila<00:02:39.220> phone<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.360> don't<00:02:40.420> know<00:02:40.660> if

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
because as ila phone and I don't know if

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.820 
because as ila phone and I don't know if
you<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:40.930> see<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.770> kind

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
you can see this in this but it's kind

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:51.090 
you can see this in this but it's kind
of<00:02:42.040> divided<00:02:42.550> into<00:02:42.760> little<00:02:42.970> segments<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.920> also

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
of divided into little segments it also

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.830 
of divided into little segments it also
has<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:52.350> delay<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.710> can<00:02:53.860> apply<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:55.180> it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
has a delay that you can apply so it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.170 
has a delay that you can apply so it
sounds<00:02:56.170> nice<00:02:56.350> what's<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.740> sounds<00:02:57.580> on<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
sounds nice what's it sounds on the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.610 
sounds nice what's it sounds on the
phone<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.690> turn<00:02:58.870> up<00:02:58.960> this<00:02:59.080> little<00:02:59.380> mix

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
phone so we just turn up this little mix

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.760 
phone so we just turn up this little mix
button<00:02:59.890> here<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.820> we<00:03:03.910> can<00:03:04.060> adjust<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.420> time

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:51.240 

feedback<00:03:24.240> next<00:03:25.240> kit<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:49.800> just<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.890> face<00:03:51.070> when

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
feedback next kit is just the face when

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.180 
feedback next kit is just the face when
I<00:03:51.340> previewed<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.660> we<00:03:52.780> have<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:53.640> IDM<00:03:54.640> which<00:03:54.880> is

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
I previewed and we have a IDM which is

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:57.279 
I previewed and we have a IDM which is
kind<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.280> like<00:03:57.459> your

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.089 

anyway<00:04:58.289> that's<00:04:58.469> a<00:05:00.050> great<00:05:01.050> program<00:05:01.349> very<00:05:01.889> very

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
anyway that's a great program very very

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:11.270 
anyway that's a great program very very
