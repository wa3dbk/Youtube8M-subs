00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
finger printing decently well but you'll

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
finger printing decently well but you'll
still<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.240> certain<00:01:36.450> light<00:01:36.750> if

still see them in certain light if

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
still see them in certain light if

you've got darker colors of this case

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
you've got darker colors of this case
you<00:01:39.299> will<00:01:39.540> definitely<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.140> finger<00:01:40.560> printing

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you will definitely see finger printing

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.249 
you will definitely see finger printing
and<00:01:41.100> scratching<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.689> these<00:01:42.869> raised

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and scratching it's got these raised

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
and scratching it's got these raised
areas<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.159> rubber<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:45.030> provide<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.750> great

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
areas of rubber that provide a great

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.249 
areas of rubber that provide a great
level<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> grip<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> pro<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
level of grip now that is a pro and that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.280 
level of grip now that is a pro and that
can<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> con<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.509> when

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
can for some be a con because when

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.899 
can for some be a con because when
you're<00:01:52.439> sliding<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.670> pocket

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you're sliding it in and out of a pocket

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.690 
you're sliding it in and out of a pocket
you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.020> still<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.340> certainly

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you can still do that but you certainly

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
you can still do that but you certainly
feel<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> ridges<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.350> sliding<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
feel the ridges when it's sliding in and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.580 
feel the ridges when it's sliding in and
out<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> pocket<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.750> some<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.200> you're

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
out of the pocket and for some if you're

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.039 
out of the pocket and for some if you're
wearing<00:02:01.799> let's<00:02:02.219> say<00:02:02.430> tight<00:02:02.880> skinny<00:02:03.479> jeans<00:02:03.869> or

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
wearing let's say tight skinny jeans or

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.569 
wearing let's say tight skinny jeans or
something<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.829> could<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> little

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
something like that it could be a little

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.069 
something like that it could be a little
bit<00:02:05.670> more<00:02:05.820> difficult<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.479> haven't<00:02:06.810> run<00:02:06.930> into

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
bit more difficult I haven't run into

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.839 
bit more difficult I haven't run into
that<00:02:07.200> problem<00:02:07.469> yet<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:08.759> bit

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that problem yet but it's a little bit

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.210 
that problem yet but it's a little bit
more<00:02:08.970> challenging<00:02:09.479> also<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.170> you've<00:02:10.649> got<00:02:10.920> a

printing on this one and it is very easy

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.320 
printing on this one and it is very easy
to<00:02:40.230> slide<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.250> pocket<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.850> as

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you can see here I can certainly use it

you can see here I can certainly use it
with<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.110> sleeve<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.370> one<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.570> in<00:02:48.780> my

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
with a sleeve like this one so in my

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.340 
with a sleeve like this one so in my
opinion<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.040> advantage<00:02:50.550> goes<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.600> grip

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
opinion the advantage goes to the grip

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.370 
opinion the advantage goes to the grip

candy shear by Belkin now let's talk
about<00:02:55.440> protection<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.770> extremely<00:02:58.770> close

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
about protection this is extremely close

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.800 
about protection this is extremely close
in<00:02:59.070> this<00:02:59.400> area<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.850> will<00:03:00.060> tell<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.540> right<00:03:00.570> now

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
in this area I will tell you right now

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.160 
in this area I will tell you right now
that<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:02.250> mixture<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.210> heart<00:03:03.570> plastic

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that the mixture of the heart plastic

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.530 
that the mixture of the heart plastic
with<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.440> TPU<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.820> speck<00:03:06.330> CandyShell

with the TPU of the speck CandyShell
grip<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.320> probably<00:03:07.740> going<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.950> give<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.160> an

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
grip is probably going to give it an

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.660 
grip is probably going to give it an
advantage<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.480> drop<00:03:09.810> where<00:03:10.560> your<00:03:11.070> TPU

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
advantage here and a drop where your TPU

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.990 
advantage here and a drop where your TPU
material<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.990> Belkin<00:03:13.470> grip<00:03:14.160> candy<00:03:14.610> shear

is<00:03:15.240> a<00:03:15.480> little<00:03:15.780> bit<00:03:15.870> more<00:03:16.020> softer<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.340> not

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
is a little bit more softer so it's not

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.700 
is a little bit more softer so it's not
as<00:03:17.670> hard<00:03:17.910> as<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.240> back<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.810> one<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.500> in

as hard as the back of this one so in

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.670 
as hard as the back of this one so in
that<00:03:20.160> instance<00:03:20.520> I<00:03:21.060> am<00:03:21.120> going<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.810> give<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.440> nod

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that instance I am going to give the nod

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.190 
that instance I am going to give the nod
to<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:23.340> speck<00:03:23.640> CandyShell<00:03:23.880> grip<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.960> think

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
to the speck CandyShell grip I think

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.920 
to the speck CandyShell grip I think
these<00:03:25.620> would<00:03:25.800> both<00:03:26.040> survive<00:03:26.600> moderate<00:03:27.600> level

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
these would both survive moderate level

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.410 
these would both survive moderate level
drops<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:29.130> we're<00:03:29.610> really<00:03:29.820> splitting<00:03:30.300> hairs

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
drops but we're really splitting hairs

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.450 
drops but we're really splitting hairs
here<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.290> still<00:03:31.620> think<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.190> speck

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
here but I still think that the speck

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.310 
here but I still think that the speck
CandyShell<00:03:32.670> grip<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.390> going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.600> provide<00:03:33.960> just

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
CandyShell grip is going to provide just

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.440 
CandyShell grip is going to provide just
a<00:03:34.530> little<00:03:35.250> bit<00:03:35.370> more<00:03:35.520> protection<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.300> this

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
a little bit more protection in this

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.500 
a little bit more protection in this
area<00:03:36.900> ease<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:38.100> removal<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.820> bring<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.300> up

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
area ease of removal I bring this up

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.170 
area ease of removal I bring this up
because<00:03:39.630> as<00:03:40.020> we<00:03:40.170> know<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.500> iPhone<00:03:40.860> 5<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.430> lot<00:03:42.090> of

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
because as we know the iPhone 5 a lot of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.820 
because as we know the iPhone 5 a lot of
people<00:03:42.420> concerned<00:03:42.780> about<00:03:42.870> scratching<00:03:43.320> on<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
people concerned about scratching on it

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.560 
people concerned about scratching on it
and<00:03:44.010> especially<00:03:44.550> if<00:03:44.820> you've<00:03:44.940> got<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.240> slate

and especially if you've got the slate

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.140 
and especially if you've got the slate
version<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.260> phone<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.340> ease<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:48.030> removal

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
version of the phone so ease of removal

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.820 
version of the phone so ease of removal
is<00:03:48.540> important<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.140> got<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.380> take<00:03:49.500> your<00:03:49.620> time

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
you got to take it slow the Belkin is

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.060 
you got to take it slow the Belkin is
definitely<00:03:52.080> easier<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.500> remove<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.040> a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
definitely easier to remove it is a

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.580 
definitely easier to remove it is a
softer<00:03:53.520> plastic<00:03:53.690> versus<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.810> harder<00:03:55.140> it's<00:03:55.500> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
softer plastic versus the harder it's a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.350 
softer plastic versus the harder it's a
lot<00:03:55.830> easier<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.250> remove<00:03:56.520> this<00:03:56.730> case<00:03:57.000> than<00:03:57.270> it

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
lot easier to remove this case than it

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.240 
lot easier to remove this case than it
is<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.690> one<00:03:57.960> neither<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.740> an<00:03:58.860> extreme

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
is this one neither is an extreme

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.880 
is this one neither is an extreme
challenge<00:03:59.720> but<00:04:00.720> ease<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.080> removal<00:04:01.230> definitely

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
splitting time between them

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.910 
splitting time between them
flip-flopping<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:13.290> hard<00:04:13.560> for<00:04:13.710> me<00:04:13.830> to
