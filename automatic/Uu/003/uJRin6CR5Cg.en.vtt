00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.359 
regardless if they already have us be it
sucks<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.090> be<00:01:19.209> us<00:01:19.359> and<00:01:20.079> if<00:01:20.950> they<00:01:21.130> have

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369

something<00:01:21.819> like<00:01:22.149> a<00:01:22.359> gut<00:01:22.600> shot<00:01:22.630> well<00:01:23.499> if<00:01:23.709> I

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
something like a gut shot well if I

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.959 
something like a gut shot well if I
three<00:01:24.069> bet<00:01:24.219> they're<00:01:24.399> probably<00:01:24.579> gonna<00:01:24.759> play

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
three bet they're probably gonna play

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.749 
three bet they're probably gonna play
closer<00:01:25.209> to<00:01:25.389> perfect<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.560> flat<00:01:26.920> yes<00:01:27.609> they

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
closer to perfect and if I flat yes they

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.279 
closer to perfect and if I flat yes they
have<00:01:27.880> some<00:01:28.090> equity<00:01:28.509> but<00:01:28.810> they're<00:01:29.049> not<00:01:29.170> gonna

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
have some equity but they're not gonna

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.019 
have some equity but they're not gonna
actualize<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.920> very<00:01:30.100> often<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.670> we<00:01:30.729> give<00:01:30.880> them

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:31.029 
actualize it very often and we give them

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.149 
actualize it very often and we give them
a<00:01:31.149> chance<00:01:31.389> to<00:01:31.749> make<00:01:31.959> a<00:01:31.990> mistake<00:01:32.259> on<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:32.859> turn

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
a chance to make a mistake on the turn

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.899 
a chance to make a mistake on the turn
and<00:01:33.399> River<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:35.200> allows<00:01:35.499> Bluffs<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.340> maximum

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
and River so it allows Bluffs a maximum

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.149 
and River so it allows Bluffs a maximum
opportunity<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.719> make<00:01:38.380> mistakes<00:01:38.770> if<00:01:39.009> they

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
opportunity to make mistakes if they

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.399 
opportunity to make mistakes if they

the<00:02:00.340> turn<00:02:00.579> I<00:02:00.880> don't<00:02:01.599> see<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:01.929> reason<00:02:02.469> to<00:02:02.499> have<00:02:02.889> to

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
the turn I don't see a reason to have to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.859 
the turn I don't see a reason to have to
go<00:02:03.279> for<00:02:03.549> those<00:02:03.639> three<00:02:03.939> bet<00:02:04.149> here<00:02:04.419> cuz<00:02:04.630> if<00:02:04.749> they

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
go for those three bet here cuz if they

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.629 
go for those three bet here cuz if they
have<00:02:05.079> a<00:02:05.109> king<00:02:05.439> again<00:02:05.770> we're<00:02:06.219> gonna<00:02:06.279> hit<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
have a king again we're gonna hit the

have a king again we're gonna hit the
home<00:02:06.759> run<00:02:06.880> regardless<00:02:07.179> and<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:07.959> just<00:02:08.200> don't

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
home run regardless and I just don't

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.719 
home run regardless and I just don't
think<00:02:08.440> there's<00:02:08.679> much<00:02:08.860> reason<00:02:09.099> here<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.490> think

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
think there's much reason here I think

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.040 
think there's much reason here I think
we're<00:02:09.880> blowing<00:02:10.360> off<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.539> Bluffs<00:02:11.019> more<00:02:11.650> than

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
we're blowing off the Bluffs more than

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.660 
we're blowing off the Bluffs more than
anything<00:02:12.290> else<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:13.160> that's<00:02:13.310> something<00:02:13.580> that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
anything else and that's something that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.550 
anything else and that's something that
I<00:02:13.820> really<00:02:14.300> really<00:02:14.330> want<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> get<00:02:15.080> paid<00:02:15.290> from

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I really really want to get paid from

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.200 
I really really want to get paid from
and<00:02:15.740> those<00:02:15.830> Bluffs<00:02:16.160> give<00:02:16.610> them<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> chance<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
and those Bluffs give them the chance to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.390 
and those Bluffs give them the chance to
make<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> turn<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.960> River<00:02:18.140> mistake<00:02:18.620> as

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
make the turn and River mistake as

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.610 
make the turn and River mistake as
opposed<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.120> go<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.600> flop<00:02:20.810> 3bet<00:02:21.290> which<00:02:21.470> I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
opposed to go for the flop 3bet which I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.620 
opposed to go for the flop 3bet which I
think<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> long<00:02:22.400> run<00:02:22.460> is<00:02:22.730> gonna<00:02:22.910> allow<00:02:23.420> him

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
think in the long run is gonna allow him

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.860 
think in the long run is gonna allow him
to<00:02:23.780> play<00:02:23.870> too<00:02:24.110> close<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.560> perfect<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.630> they

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
to play too close to perfect so they

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.630 
to play too close to perfect so they
decided<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> go<00:02:27.380> for<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.770> for<00:02:27.980> bet<00:02:28.190> here<00:02:28.520> two

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
decided to go for the for bet here two

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.090 
decided to go for the for bet here two
cents<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.000> shove<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:30.020> at<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.710> point<00:02:30.980> they've

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
cents a shove and at this point they've

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.590 
cents a shove and at this point they've
already<00:02:31.220> put<00:02:31.490> in<00:02:31.580> two<00:02:31.760> thirds<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.180> their<00:02:32.330> stack

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
already put in two thirds of their stack

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.000 
already put in two thirds of their stack
on<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.840> flop<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.350> assume<00:02:33.650> they're<00:02:33.830> probably

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
on the flop I assume they're probably

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.430 
on the flop I assume they're probably
gonna<00:02:34.220> stack<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.700> rest<00:02:34.940> off<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.200> fine

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
gonna stack the rest off so all is fine

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.250 
gonna stack the rest off so all is fine
at<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.650> point<00:02:37.300> but<00:02:38.300> again<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.840> think<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
at that point but again I think in the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.110 
at that point but again I think in the
long<00:02:39.470> run<00:02:39.500> Hiro's<00:02:40.070> making<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.460> mistake<00:02:40.580> here

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
long run Hiro's making a mistake here

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.030 
long run Hiro's making a mistake here
obviously<00:02:41.840> against<00:02:42.230> king<00:02:42.440> five<00:02:42.680> we're<00:02:42.950> gonna

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
obviously against king five we're gonna

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.980 
obviously against king five we're gonna
hit<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.310> home<00:02:43.640> run<00:02:43.730> anyway<00:02:44.210> just<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.900> a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
hit that home run anyway just it's a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.600 
hit that home run anyway just it's a
foregone<00:02:45.230> conclusions<00:02:46.040> when<00:02:46.250> I'm<00:02:46.370> worried

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
foregone conclusions when I'm worried

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.700 
foregone conclusions when I'm worried
about<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.940> other<00:02:47.120> parts<00:02:47.570> Bluffs<00:02:48.050> are<00:02:48.470> there<00:02:48.680> a

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
about the other parts Bluffs are there a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.340 
about the other parts Bluffs are there a
lot<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:49.070> them<00:02:49.220> 9x<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> lot<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.930> or

lot of them 9x is there a lot of that or

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.320 
lot of them 9x is there a lot of that or
they're<00:02:52.010> more<00:02:52.160> Bluff<00:02:52.430> II<00:02:52.580> type<00:02:52.790> stuff<00:02:53.090> if

they're more Bluff II type stuff if
