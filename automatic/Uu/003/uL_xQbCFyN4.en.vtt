both the g3 here is displayed is a 5.5

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.310 
both the g3 here is displayed is a 5.5
inch<00:00:37.440> qhd<00:00:38.190> display<00:00:38.219> stands<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.300> quad<00:00:39.540> HD<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
hand to with the new floating arm curve

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
hand to with the new floating arm curve
design<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.240> LG<00:01:24.600> designed<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> gene<00:01:25.259> 3<00:01:25.530> with

design that LG designed the gene 3 with

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
design that LG designed the gene 3 with
so<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.400> Falls<00:01:26.909> right<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> hand

raised<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> keys<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
raised the keys up a little bit the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.969 
raised the keys up a little bit the
buttons<00:01:48.600> click<00:01:48.810> down<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.200> bit<00:01:49.320> nicer<00:01:49.560> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
buttons click down a little bit nicer so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
buttons click down a little bit nicer so
it<00:01:50.070> looks<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.549> design<00:01:51.000> maybe<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.689> little

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it looks like that design maybe a little

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.929 
it looks like that design maybe a little
bit<00:01:51.930> better<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.259> go<00:01:52.500> around<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.189> above<00:01:53.880> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
bit better this go around and above that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
bit better this go around and above that
you're<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> 13<00:01:55.439> megapixel

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
you're going to see the 13 megapixel

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.709 
you're going to see the 13 megapixel
camera<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.430> optical<00:01:56.759> image<00:01:57.119> stabilization

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
camera with optical image stabilization

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.340 
camera with optical image stabilization
of<00:01:58.110> 0<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.350> laser<00:01:59.340> autofocus<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.270> 4k<00:02:00.689> video

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
of 0 is laser autofocus and 4k video

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.039 
of 0 is laser autofocus and 4k video
recording<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.790> let's<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.420> back<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.780> laser

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
recording so let's go back to that laser

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.499 
recording so let's go back to that laser
autofocus<00:02:04.350> stick<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.549> basically<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
autofocus stick so basically with the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.330 
autofocus stick so basically with the
camera<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.829> able<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.250> you're

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
camera it's going to be able to you're

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
camera it's going to be able to you're
gonna<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.729> little<00:02:08.910> second<00:02:09.390> port<00:02:09.750> that's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
gonna see this little second port that's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.090 
gonna see this little second port that's
right<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> side

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
right on the side

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.370 
right on the side
the<00:02:11.220> camera<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.570> laser<00:02:12.840> port<00:02:13.230> right

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the camera that little laser port right

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.110 
the camera that little laser port right
there<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.830> going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> shoot<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> beam<00:02:14.700> every

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
there is going to shoot out a beam every

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.480 
there is going to shoot out a beam every
time<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.390> take<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.600> picture<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.290> autofocus<00:02:17.190> as

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
time you take a picture and autofocus as

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.980 
time you take a picture and autofocus as
fast<00:02:17.730> as<00:02:17.880> possible<00:02:17.910> that's<00:02:18.540> what<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.900> little

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
fast as possible that's what that little

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.810 
fast as possible that's what that little
lasers<00:02:19.410> day<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.650> four<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.580> supposed<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
lasers day of four and it's supposed to

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.910 
lasers day of four and it's supposed to
basically<00:02:21.090> allow<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.810> focus<00:02:22.050> quickly<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
basically allow you to focus quickly and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.860 
basically allow you to focus quickly and
take<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.130> shot<00:02:23.370> very<00:02:23.670> fast<00:02:24.000> compared<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
take the shot very fast compared to the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.390 
take the shot very fast compared to the
other<00:02:24.990> competitors<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.310> from

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
other competitors out there and from

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.950 
other competitors out there and from
what<00:02:26.550> we've<00:02:26.730> seen<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.120> some<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.360> demos<00:02:27.600> it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
what we've seen in some of the demos it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.100 
what we've seen in some of the demos it
does<00:02:28.200> look<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.620> LG<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.600> g3<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.870> laser

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
does look like LG is a g3 and that laser

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.930 
does look like LG is a g3 and that laser
autofocus<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.980> working<00:02:32.370> there<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.550> can't

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
autofocus it's working there I can't

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.700 
autofocus it's working there I can't
wait<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.720> test<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.140> out<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.560> how

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
wait to really test that out to see how

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.290 
wait to really test that out to see how
well<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.100> works<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.580> put<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.910> get<00:02:36.090> some<00:02:36.270> of

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
well that works and put to get some of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.450 
well that works and put to get some of
the<00:02:36.450> other<00:02:36.680> competition<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:37.950> year's<00:02:38.250> on

the other competition and this year's on

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.430 
the other competition and this year's on
top<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:39.030> flagship<00:02:39.540> smartphones<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.290> out

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
top of flagship smartphones are out

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.770 
top of flagship smartphones are out
there<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.250> also<00:02:41.400> has<00:02:41.640> 4k<00:02:41.880> video<00:02:42.240> recording<00:02:42.270> so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
there it also has 4k video recording so

exact name it's a new experience if you

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.110

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
exactly there now you'll notice that it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.880 
exactly there now you'll notice that it
has<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.670> much<00:03:02.970> flatter<00:03:03.210> look<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.080> they<00:03:04.500> put

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
has a much flatter look to it they put

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.130 
has a much flatter look to it they put
flatter<00:03:05.220> icons<00:03:05.490> on<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.300> remove<00:03:06.720> all<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.960> three

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
flatter icons on it remove all the three

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.230 
flatter icons on it remove all the three
elements<00:03:07.410> from<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.950> icons<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.700> sort<00:03:09.180> of

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
elements from the icons and sort of

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.290 
elements from the icons and sort of
design<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> UI<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.350> they<00:03:10.470> also<00:03:11.240> kind<00:03:12.240> of

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
design of the UI and they also kind of

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.360 
design of the UI and they also kind of
color-coded<00:03:12.630> things<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:14.010> sort<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
color-coded things so that is sort of a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.130 
color-coded things so that is sort of a
theme<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.060> with<00:03:15.180> more<00:03:15.420> mature<00:03:15.750> colors

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
theme with it with more mature colors

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.560 
theme with it with more mature colors
overall<00:03:16.590> now<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> reason<00:03:17.460> they<00:03:17.670> did<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.000> was

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
overall now the reason they did that was

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.270 
overall now the reason they did that was
for<00:03:18.870> one<00:03:19.110> it's<00:03:19.320> one<00:03:19.650> aesthetically<00:03:20.250> pleasing

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
for one it's one aesthetically pleasing

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.370 
for one it's one aesthetically pleasing
but<00:03:21.060> they<00:03:21.150> also<00:03:21.360> see<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> lot<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.020> storage<00:03:22.320> space

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
but they also see a lot of storage space

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.560 
but they also see a lot of storage space
when<00:03:23.130> speaking<00:03:23.310> with<00:03:23.460> LG<00:03:23.970> they<00:03:24.210> actually

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
when speaking with LG they actually

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.570 
when speaking with LG they actually
saved<00:03:24.780> about<00:03:24.930> thirty<00:03:25.260> percent<00:03:25.620> storage<00:03:26.190> space

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
saved about thirty percent storage space

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.270 
saved about thirty percent storage space
by<00:03:27.390> changing<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.200> Eloi<00:03:28.500> around<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.040> limits

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
by changing the Eloi around and limits

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.650 
by changing the Eloi around and limits
seeing<00:03:29.580> some<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.880> those<00:03:30.000> extra<00:03:30.240> things<00:03:30.330> that

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
seeing some of those extra things that

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.450 
seeing some of those extra things that
they<00:03:30.750> didn't<00:03:31.050> need<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.770> that's<00:03:31.920> more<00:03:32.190> storage

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
they didn't need so that's more storage

of<00:04:09.660> storage<00:04:09.780> but<00:04:10.170> i<00:04:10.200> believe<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.770> port<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
of storage but i believe the port in the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.430 
of storage but i believe the port in the
future<00:04:12.270> i<00:04:12.300> think<00:04:12.360> when<00:04:12.630> android<00:04:12.960> updates<00:04:13.320> is

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
future i think when android updates is

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.600 
future i think when android updates is
going<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:13.710> able<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.920> support<00:04:14.130> up<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.340> two

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
going to be able to support up the two

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.300 
going to be able to support up the two
terabytes<00:04:15.360> of

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
terabytes of

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.000 
terabytes of
micro<00:04:17.120> SD<00:04:17.329> card<00:04:17.630> storage<00:04:17.900> pretty<00:04:18.590> interesting
