called automotive I make it a little
simpler<00:02:01.200> let's<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:01.950> again<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.399> create

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
simpler let's go here again and create

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.240 
simpler let's go here again and create
one<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:02.939> class<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.780> i'm<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> put<00:02:04.860> here

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
break it down into individual modules so

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.390 
break it down into individual modules so
here<00:05:14.600> let's<00:05:14.870> just<00:05:14.930> put<00:05:15.290> some<00:05:15.590> ahead<00:05:15.980> and<00:05:16.280> what

right we're predefined now we have

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.560 
right we're predefined now we have
courses<00:05:32.870> that<00:05:33.650> are<00:05:33.680> already<00:05:34.160> filled<00:05:35.060> with

courses that are already filled with
modules<00:05:36.350> so<00:05:36.530> if<00:05:36.650> we<00:05:36.800> look<00:05:36.830> at<00:05:37.100> air<00:05:37.340> condition

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
modules so if we look at air condition

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.330

you'll notice that level two we go

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.490 
you'll notice that level two we go
