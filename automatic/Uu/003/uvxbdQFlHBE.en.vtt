also have a review on and you should

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.990 
also have a review on and you should
definitely<00:00:30.140> check<00:00:30.320> it<00:00:30.380> out

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
definitely check it out

the high-capacity batteries it's

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.930 
the high-capacity batteries it's
actually<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.620> newer<00:00:39.800> charger<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:40.489> recently

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
actually a newer charger that recently

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.880 
actually a newer charger that recently
came<00:00:41.030> out<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.600> has<00:00:41.960> many<00:00:42.350> differences

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
came out and has many differences

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.070 
came out and has many differences
compared<00:00:43.339> to<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.550> original<00:00:43.610> charger<00:00:44.330> model

DC<00:00:45.470> b101<00:00:46.460> i<00:00:47.019> know<00:00:48.019> in<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.350> video<00:00:48.650> it's<00:00:48.890> hard<00:00:49.100> to

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
DC b101 i know in the video it's hard to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.579 
DC b101 i know in the video it's hard to
see<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:49.850> it's<00:00:50.300> actually<00:00:50.690> pretty<00:00:50.870> small<00:00:51.260> I

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
see but it's actually pretty small I

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.240 
see but it's actually pretty small I
have<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.760> original<00:00:52.850> charger<00:00:53.510> right<00:00:53.629> here<00:00:53.900> the

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
have the original charger right here the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.350 
have the original charger right here the
DC<00:00:55.330> v10<00:00:56.330> one<00:00:56.570> for<00:00:56.930> comparison<00:00:57.589> as<00:00:57.970> you<00:00:58.970> can<00:00:59.120> see

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
DC v10 one for comparison as you can see

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.329 
DC v10 one for comparison as you can see
it's<00:00:59.629> it's<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.320> lot<00:01:00.500> smaller<00:01:00.890> than<00:01:01.159> the

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
it's it's a lot smaller than the

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.670 
it's it's a lot smaller than the
original<00:01:01.479> it's<00:01:02.479> actually<00:01:02.750> about<00:01:02.900> half<00:01:03.409> the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
original it's actually about half the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.870 
original it's actually about half the
size<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.510> slimmer<00:01:05.510> as<00:01:05.690> well<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:07.310> differences

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
size and slimmer as well the differences

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.440 
size and slimmer as well the differences
don't<00:01:08.119> end<00:01:08.450> there<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:09.380> DC<00:01:09.799> be<00:01:09.950> 106<00:01:10.610> can<00:01:11.119> only

don't end there the DC be 106 can only

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.690 
don't end there the DC be 106 can only

max batteries also the original charger

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.300 
max batteries also the original charger
has<00:01:23.420> several<00:01:23.750> features<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:25.130> one

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
has several features that this one

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.850 
has several features that this one
doesn't<00:01:25.550> have<00:01:25.700> such<00:01:26.570> as<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:27.260> one<00:01:27.500> will<00:01:27.650> tell

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
you if your batteries are too hot or too

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.920 
you if your batteries are too hot or too
cold<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.980> charge<00:01:31.220> or<00:01:31.670> if<00:01:32.300> there's<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.690> problem

powerline the DC b10 6 doesn't have any
of<00:01:40.820> those<00:01:40.970> features<00:01:41.420> all<00:01:42.080> it's<00:01:42.380> pretty<00:01:42.620> much

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
of those features all it's pretty much

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.280 
of those features all it's pretty much
going<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.070> do<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.480> charge<00:01:44.480> your<00:01:44.660> batteries<00:01:45.080> and

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
going to do is charge your batteries and

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.430 
going to do is charge your batteries and
tell<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.070> they're<00:01:46.220> done<00:01:46.460> charging<00:01:47.230> also<00:01:48.230> the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
tell you they're done charging also the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.350 
tell you they're done charging also the
original<00:01:48.800> charger<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.400> actually<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.090> pretty

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
original charger is actually a pretty

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.440 
original charger is actually a pretty
quick<00:01:50.600> charger<00:01:51.050> as<00:01:51.230> well<00:01:51.470> for<00:01:52.370> example<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:53.270> can

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
quick charger as well for example it can

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.480 
quick charger as well for example it can
charge<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.870> compact<00:01:54.380> 1.5<00:01:54.950> amp<00:01:55.190> hour<00:01:55.370> battery

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
charge a compact 1.5 amp hour battery

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.660 
charge a compact 1.5 amp hour battery
pack<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.240> about<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> half<00:01:57.290> hour<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.890> a

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
pack in about a half hour and a

high-capacity 3.0 amp hour battery pack
in<00:02:01.280> about<00:02:01.880> an<00:02:02.000> hour<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.560> DC<00:02:03.950> B<00:02:04.070> 106<00:02:04.760> is<00:02:04.970> much

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
in about an hour the DC B 106 is much

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.450 
in about an hour the DC B 106 is much
slower<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.690> charging<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.350> actually<00:02:07.190> takes

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
slower and charging it actually takes

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.059 
slower and charging it actually takes
roughly<00:02:07.729> about<00:02:08.050> twice<00:02:09.050> as<00:02:09.259> long<00:02:09.440> more<00:02:09.769> or<00:02:09.890> less

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
roughly about twice as long more or less

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.430 
roughly about twice as long more or less
to<00:02:10.729> tell<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.209> charge<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.629> same<00:02:11.810> battery<00:02:12.170> packs

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
to tell to charge the same battery packs

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.399 
to tell to charge the same battery packs
for<00:02:13.159> example<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.330> compact<00:02:14.810> battery<00:02:14.989> packs

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
for example the compact battery packs

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.770

thoughts for the newer Dewalt charger or

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.159 
thoughts for the newer Dewalt charger or
this<00:03:42.139> the<00:03:43.139> DC<00:03:43.349> be<00:03:43.709> 106<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:45.510> gets<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.900> job<00:03:46.109> done

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
this the DC be 106 it gets the job done

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.409 
this the DC be 106 it gets the job done
without<00:03:46.530> any<00:03:46.950> extra<00:03:47.430> bells<00:03:47.639> and<00:03:47.790> whistles<00:03:48.209> I

without any extra bells and whistles I

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.509 
without any extra bells and whistles I
think<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.530> great<00:03:49.739> way<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:49.980> get<00:03:50.190> started

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
think it's a great way to get started

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.849 
think it's a great way to get started

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
money for the original charger so there

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.860
