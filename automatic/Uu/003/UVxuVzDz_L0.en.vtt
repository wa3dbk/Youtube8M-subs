one right here you can see there's a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.309 
one right here you can see there's a
bunch<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.520> nice<00:01:42.759> hops<00:01:43.300> on<00:01:43.539> this<00:01:43.780> vine<00:01:44.020> right

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
bunch of nice hops on this vine right

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.460 
bunch of nice hops on this vine right
here<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> lateral<00:01:45.310> chute<00:01:46.440> when<00:01:47.440> I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
here this is a lateral chute when I

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.010 
here this is a lateral chute when I
harvest<00:01:48.069> I<00:01:48.280> just<00:01:48.729> actually<00:01:48.940> go<00:01:49.270> straight<00:01:49.330> in

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
harvest I just actually go straight in

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.219 
harvest I just actually go straight in
to<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:51.190> main<00:01:51.520> vine<00:01:51.849> and<00:01:52.209> I<00:01:52.569> cut<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:53.080> entire

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
to the main vine and I cut the entire

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.779 
to the main vine and I cut the entire
lateral<00:01:54.130> off<00:01:54.660> just<00:01:55.660> like<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.459> nice

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
lateral off just like that see that nice

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.089 
lateral off just like that see that nice
clean<00:01:58.090> cut<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.660> then<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.410> just<00:01:59.679> drop<00:01:59.920> these

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099 
clean cut and then I just drop these

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:01.499 
clean cut and then I just drop these
rights<00:02:00.399> down<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:00.940> ground<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.390> I'll

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
rights down to the ground and I'll

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.229 
rights down to the ground and I'll
harvest<00:02:01.810> them<00:02:02.140> by<00:02:02.289> picking<00:02:02.679> them<00:02:02.770> off<00:02:02.890> later<00:02:03.280> I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239

don't<00:02:04.539> bother<00:02:04.810> with<00:02:05.140> actually<00:02:05.800> pulling<00:02:06.160> them

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
don't bother with actually pulling them

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.029 
don't bother with actually pulling them
one<00:02:07.149> by<00:02:07.330> one<00:02:07.380> individually<00:02:08.380> off<00:02:08.619> because<00:02:09.009> I

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
one by one individually off because I

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.020 
one by one individually off because I
just<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.610> that's<00:02:09.819> way<00:02:10.000> too

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
just think that that's way too

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.080 
just think that that's way too
time-consuming<00:02:11.010> and<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.370> are<00:02:12.520> not<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:13.060> to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
time-consuming and you are not going to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.089 
time-consuming and you are not going to
get<00:02:13.300> any<00:02:13.540> more<00:02:13.750> hops<00:02:14.110> growing<00:02:14.680> out<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.860> this

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
get any more hops growing out of this

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.729 
get any more hops growing out of this
lateral<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.569> rest<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.989> year<00:02:17.230> usually

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
lateral for the rest of the year usually

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.190 
lateral for the rest of the year usually
once<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> laterals<00:02:18.489> form<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.989> we

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
once the laterals form that's it and we

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.640 
once the laterals form that's it and we
have<00:02:20.349> one<00:02:20.560> shot

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
have one shot

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.030 
have one shot
now<00:02:22.280> here's<00:02:22.580> another<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.269> here<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.830> can

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
now here's another one up here you can

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.770 
now here's another one up here you can
see<00:02:25.250> has<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.519> whole<00:02:25.760> bunch<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.150> hops<00:02:26.360> I'm<00:02:26.599> gonna

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
see has a whole bunch of hops I'm gonna

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.930 
see has a whole bunch of hops I'm gonna
go<00:02:26.959> right<00:02:27.170> in<00:02:27.319> there<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.680> my<00:02:27.799> scissors<00:02:28.099> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.000 
I'm gonna cut this one down to nice
beautiful<00:02:31.940> hops<00:02:32.299> right<00:02:32.659> there<00:02:32.959> I'm<00:02:33.860> gonna

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
beautiful hops right there I'm gonna

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
beautiful hops right there I'm gonna
finish<00:02:34.310> doing<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:34.909> with<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.269> rest<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.629> these

hops<00:02:36.080> up<00:02:36.319> here<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.980> then<00:02:37.670> I'm<00:02:37.790> going<00:02:37.940> to

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
hops up here and then I'm going to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.830 
hops up here and then I'm going to
explain<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.730> show<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.030> why<00:02:41.780> these

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
all right either some of the hops that I

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.880 
all right either some of the hops that I
just<00:02:52.760> harvested<00:02:53.170> see<00:02:54.170> there's<00:02:54.349> all<00:02:54.500> kinds<00:02:54.829> of

difference between a mature and an

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.729 
difference between a mature and an
immature<00:03:01.069> hop<00:03:01.579> let's<00:03:02.359> do<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:02.690> right<00:03:02.959> now

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
a little bit there's still a lot of

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.310 
a little bit there's still a lot of
moisture<00:04:28.210> in<00:04:28.630> there<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:29.500> can't<00:04:31.229> there's<00:04:32.229> a

moisture in there you can't there's a
little<00:04:32.620> papery<00:04:33.010> noise<00:04:33.310> but<00:04:33.639> it's<00:04:33.790> not<00:04:34.000> much

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
little papery noise but it's not much

you're checking your hops is you want to
check<00:04:38.889> out<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.400> loophole<00:04:39.790> in<00:04:39.940> glands<00:04:40.419> and

all<00:05:54.349> right<00:05:54.499> one<00:05:54.680> other<00:05:54.860> thing<00:05:55.159> that<00:05:55.189> is<00:05:55.460> very

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
all right one other thing that is very

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.629 
all right one other thing that is very
important<00:05:56.360> when<00:05:56.629> you're<00:05:56.809> harvesting<00:05:57.229> hops<00:05:57.860> is

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
important when you're harvesting hops is

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.040 
important when you're harvesting hops is
if<00:05:58.969> you<00:05:59.180> have<00:05:59.479> animals<00:06:00.400> specifically<00:06:01.400> dogs

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
if you have animals specifically dogs

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.249 
if you have animals specifically dogs
dogs<00:06:03.309> if<00:06:04.309> they<00:06:04.520> eat<00:06:04.759> hops<00:06:05.089> they<00:06:05.839> will<00:06:06.020> catch

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
dogs if they eat hops they will catch

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.540 
dogs if they eat hops they will catch
what<00:06:06.559> is<00:06:06.680> called<00:06:06.919> benign<00:06:07.990> hypothermia<00:06:08.990> and

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
what is called benign hypothermia and

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.860 
what is called benign hypothermia and
basically<00:06:10.550> what<00:06:10.699> that<00:06:10.729> does<00:06:10.909> is<00:06:11.389> they

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
basically what that does is they

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.110 
basically what that does is they
overheat<00:06:12.620> in<00:06:12.740> their<00:06:12.860> bodies<00:06:13.279> and<00:06:13.490> they<00:06:13.939> will

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
overheat in their bodies and they will

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.239 
overheat in their bodies and they will
just<00:06:14.300> pass<00:06:14.539> away<00:06:14.900> I<00:06:15.139> know<00:06:15.559> by<00:06:16.009> experience

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:16.249 
just pass away I know by experience

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.429 
just pass away I know by experience
because<00:06:17.120> it<00:06:17.270> actually<00:06:17.449> accidentally

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 
because it actually accidentally

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:20.980 
because it actually accidentally
happened<00:06:19.009> to<00:06:19.129> my<00:06:19.339> dog<00:06:19.610> and<00:06:19.879> I'm<00:06:20.449> not<00:06:20.629> kidding

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
happened to my dog and I'm not kidding

you're moving them around because all

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.300
