00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I put my bearings in and was really

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
I put my bearings in and was really
difficult<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:40.079> put<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:42.559> actually

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
difficult to put them in and actually

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
difficult to put them in and actually
had<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> hammer<00:00:44.309> them<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> hammer

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
had to hammer them in with a hammer

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170 
had to hammer them in with a hammer
because<00:00:46.340> which<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.460> didn't<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:47.789> want<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> do

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
because which I didn't really want to do

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.979 
because which I didn't really want to do

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
because I didn't want to break my

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.529 
because I didn't want to break my
bearings<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.190> had<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.239> there<00:00:51.449> was

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
bearings but I had to do it there was

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
bearings but I had to do it there was
like<00:00:51.870> no<00:00:52.140> other<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.680> him<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.920> that's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I've been skating these wheels for about

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.270 
I've been skating these wheels for about
three<00:01:23.520> weeks<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> website<00:01:25.770> claims

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
three weeks now and the website claims

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.710 
three weeks now and the website claims
that<00:01:26.460> they're<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.759> resistant<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> flats

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that they're really resistant to flats
