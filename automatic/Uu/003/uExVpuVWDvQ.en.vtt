00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
the deck they lose mole
Life<00:02:13.770> Points<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> game<00:02:15.300> is

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
Life Points so you see the game is

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.350 
Life Points so you see the game is
simply<00:02:15.840> memorizing<00:02:16.680> where<00:02:17.610> all<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.030> flowers

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
simply memorizing where all the flowers

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.940 
simply memorizing where all the flowers
are<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> game<00:02:19.020> ends<00:02:19.440> either<00:02:19.620> when<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
are so the game ends either when the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.530 
are so the game ends either when the
deck<00:02:20.130> runs<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.670> middle<00:02:20.820> or<00:02:21.030> more

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
deck runs out in the middle or more

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.750 
deck runs out in the middle or more
likely<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.890> someone<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.490> Life

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
likely when someone is out of Life

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.660 
likely when someone is out of Life
Points<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.780> point<00:02:25.590> whoever<00:02:26.250> has<00:02:26.490> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
Points and that point whoever has the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.300 
Points and that point whoever has the
most<00:02:26.850> life<00:02:27.180> points<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.020> winner<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:29.100> very

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
most life points is the winner it's very

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.870 
most life points is the winner it's very
easy<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:30.060> basically<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.870> memory<00:02:31.110> game

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
easy it's basically just a memory game

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.550 
easy it's basically just a memory game
all<00:02:32.880> right<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.450> go<00:02:33.570> that's<00:02:33.810> illusion

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
all right there we go that's illusion

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.000 
all right there we go that's illusion
illusion<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:36.150> game<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.570> memory<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
illusion the game of memory I like the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.860 
illusion the game of memory I like the
idea<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.460> finding<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.270> different<00:02:39.540> flowers

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
idea of finding the different flowers

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.090 
idea of finding the different flowers
the<00:02:39.990> flowers<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.470> close<00:02:40.680> enough<00:02:40.710> together

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
the flowers are close enough together

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.970 
the flowers are close enough together
that<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.060> confusing<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> bit

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that it can be confusing but it is a bit

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.140 
that it can be confusing but it is a bit
of<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.160> memory<00:02:44.370> game<00:02:44.580> let's<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.030> kids
