these would have been the fifty percent
off<00:01:09.270> ones<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:09.810> they're<00:01:09.900> cheaper<00:01:10.229> than

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
off ones because they're cheaper than

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.630 
off ones because they're cheaper than
the<00:01:10.380> other<00:01:10.530> ones<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:10.860> yeah<00:01:11.159> these<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.430> really

at pacsun which is like I know that's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
at pacsun which is like I know that's
not<00:01:46.140> big<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.490> i<00:01:47.520> usually<00:01:48.180> buy<00:01:48.420> my

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
not big at all but i usually buy my

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
not big at all but i usually buy my
jeans<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.049> american<00:01:49.380> eagle<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.759> i<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.030> buy<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
jeans for american eagle and i can buy a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.810 
jeans for american eagle and i can buy a
zero<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:52.070> because<00:01:53.070> their<00:01:53.220> genes<00:01:53.460> run<00:01:53.610> so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
zero there because their genes run so

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.709 
zero there because their genes run so
big<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.960> i<00:01:55.820> don't<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.180> kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.570> cool

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
big so i don't know it was kind of cool

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.730 
big so i don't know it was kind of cool
that's<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.320> probably<00:01:58.439> why<00:01:58.710> i

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that's think that's probably why i

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.230 
that's think that's probably why i
always<00:01:58.979> buy<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.369> jean<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> american<00:02:00.000> eagles

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
always buy my jean to american eagles

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.139 
always buy my jean to american eagles
because<00:02:00.630> i<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.860> buy<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> zero<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.820> i<00:02:02.850> can't<00:02:03.060> buy

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
because i can buy a zero and i can't buy

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.819 
because i can buy a zero and i can't buy
20<00:02:03.450> anywhere<00:02:03.750> else<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:04.290> i<00:02:04.320> had<00:02:04.469> my<00:02:04.619> three

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
