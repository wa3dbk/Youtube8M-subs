00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 I'm half sick or cold makes me but 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.700
 to the throat and as a symptom I get mad 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.429
 mother who tells me marco you have to take 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.740
 aspirin that bimbaminkia by now 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.199
 we all know that the only one 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.800
 panacea the only real remedy for 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.800
 any kind of sickness and beer 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 the angular direct of today is born as 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.610
 a kind of rib, a kind of spin 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 off stopped because despite having it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 already spoken at the end of the blog where 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 announced the presence of the angola 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.320
 mantova comics 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.899
 it seemed necessary to uncork the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 today's beer to meet the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.690
 numerous comments of you rabble that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.430
 in the previous broadcasts he asked you 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.809
 what did you think of by order 1886 a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 think back 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.400
 already the balls are spinning I'll be honest with 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 you for the umpteenth time and for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 yet again I have no problems with 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.140
 admit again that when to order 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.360
 was announced in 2013 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.520
 completely misrepresents the typology of 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 game does not ask me why because 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.290
 I can't answer but when I saw for the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.240
 first time this game 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 who knows what the fucking reason? 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.909
 convinced by the fact that it should be 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.310
 treat of an investigative to say the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.049
 truth but reading the few on the net 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.000
 at the time news immediately after the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.520
 presentation I was not the only one a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.290
 I don't know how to make that mistake 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.509
 been the setting will have been due 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.700
 of the protagonists who held roles 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.579
 that seemed similar to gods 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.829
 similar detective sherlock holmes 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.869
 or maybe it was just the presence of 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.079
 paranormal elements that made me 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.719
 hoping for a game in the is her noir in 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.000
 which, however, I had to learn 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:07.979
 looking for werewolf killers 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.899
 unbearable vampires or youtuber done 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.360
 that is when I realized 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.090
 definitively to have expelled 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.150
 full 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.930
 the mind the type of game a little me 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.269
 sorry but okay it's okay because of 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.430
 order as weeks go by and gods 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.310
 network video proves to be a 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.650
 a hybrid game a mixture that is between a third 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.500
 person and sheila the kind of shooter 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.780
 that I have always preferred and a game at 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.390
 heavy rain in which the interaction with 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.680
 the gamer is noticeably reduced 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.370
 but in favor of a narrative sector 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.560
 theoretically more profoundly studied and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.510
 probably more interesting 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.090
 in the months that followed the desire 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.160
 to play I'm blessed to order between 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.170
 the other one of the few exclusive from 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.690
 2015 parquet s4 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.629
 I do not say that it increased dramatically 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.459
 let's say that the curiosity of 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.879
 test the game for yourself to see if 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.590
 the plot would then be paid to 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.400
 what my expectations were 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.700
 until two three days before the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.670
 day one 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.920
 who already leaked information online 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.049
 news warning call them like fuck 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.030
 in short, of the articles that 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.470
 announced that the game would not be 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.480
 lasted a long time 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.850
 indeed there are those who said that it would last 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.750
 four hours there are those who said 8 fact is 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.370
 than on the internet 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.260
 I go out higher than the usual casino 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.450
 powered among other things by people who 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.040
 surely they had not yet played 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.819
 to the game but they had already begun 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.910
 with the classics but lasts too much park but 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.400
 there was no online but too little play 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.260
 but nasty bitch don't buy him a pig 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 hell why in front of these 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.430
 statements 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.109
 the possible reactions are these indeed 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.109
 they should be these 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.510
 with the fuck that I buy it instead not away 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.000
 we begin to write a flood of 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.519
 bullshit on this title when a 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.670
 in my opinion it was one of the cases 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.000
 more unjustifiable than the ship store on 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:32.200
 network motivated among other things by an excuse 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.020
 main to say the least ridiculous by order 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.020
 it does n't last long but when the fuck you would like to do 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.730
 last a game of the slutty bitch genre 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.960
 you want to play for 15 hours at the same time 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.850
 identical game but fuck 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.370
 think about playing a gears of war 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.620
 played for 15 hours straight when viewed 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.450
 it also remains a holy christ and a tears of 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.810
 war cannot be compared to order 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.000
 to the online then an infinite game e 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.890
 thanks to the sherlock holmes cock 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.690
 let's take the first uncharted because 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.610
 nobody at the time broke the cock for le 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.980
 its only six hours of play or 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.020
 we take vanquish because no one 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.600
 at the time he broke his balls for his 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.700
 only six hours of play 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.470
 maybe because no one will be dropped by 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.810
 smear despite its indisputable 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.970
 quality and that's exactly what makes me 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.370
 turn the balls open the mouth only 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.960
 to give the leaf air six hours to 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.850
 order are too few 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.050
 are too few for an investment of 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.330
 70 euros 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.940
 it's fine fucking apart from the fact that 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.800
 it doesn't last six hours but more and apart from the 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.050
 fact that I myself recommended 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.090
 spamming on twitter a way to 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.150
 pay a lot less for day one 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.150
 if you still believe that quality 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.419
 of a game should also be weighed based 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.090
 to its duration well you earn mine 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.580
 I hate eternal and of order simply not 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.210
 it's for you or pussy but letting it go i 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.060
 fegatelli at least 12 hours is a title that 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.130
 advice surely you know who you are 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.680
 fuck about the duration of a game but think 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.720
 to its actual quality especially 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.010
 His narrative of the sector 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.350
 I would recommend with your eyes closed 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.690
 maybe not at 70 euros maybe I recommend it 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.030
 to the first pres cat according to yours 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.390
 economic availability but above all 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.630
 basic advice to anyone of 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.730
 get better information 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.980
 before buying a closed box a 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.320
 game to avoid then going to 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.320
 break the balls on the net with 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:43.370
 apologies really unlistenable but 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:45.140
 still alive the pancake for everyone 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:49.820
 those who are masturbating 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:53.240
 wondering what you bought billboard 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.280
 do you think yes no I took advantage of the offer of 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.650
 which I spoke to you in the last live 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.480
 that of the unieuro with blog thorne and i 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.820
 three months of plus is the fact also 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.260
 as you can see , I picked it up yesterday but it is 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.330
 still beautiful incellophanato e 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:12.290
 frankly I have no idea when I will be able to 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.710
 start playing it mainly because 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.880
 in this weekend that comes 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.210
 I will begin to record the flop them 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.070
 so I won't have time to try it 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.930
 at least I do n't know maybe 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.940
 next week let's try to do one 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.420
 beer on blog forums based on how much 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.720
 I'll be able to play if I can play 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.720
 see you later
