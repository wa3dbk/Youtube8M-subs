but it's funny because this one has
three<00:02:03.689> holes<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.079> one<00:02:04.229> has<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> so

three holes in that one has to so

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.139 
three holes in that one has to so
technically<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:05.610> supposed<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
technically that's supposed to do the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.370 
technically that's supposed to do the
pepper<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.810> supposed<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pepper and that's supposed to be the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
pepper and that's supposed to be the
salt<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.819> don't<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.119> follow<00:02:09.390> that
