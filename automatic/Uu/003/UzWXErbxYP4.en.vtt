have<00:03:57.360> perhaps<00:03:57.810> III<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:59.370> this<00:04:00.090> green<00:04:00.810> edition

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
have perhaps III on this green edition

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.670 
have perhaps III on this green edition
you'd<00:04:01.800> be<00:04:02.010> happy<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.580> know<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.300> price

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
you'd be happy to know that the price

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.530 
you'd be happy to know that the price
remains<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.920> same<00:04:05.190> as<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.790> original<00:04:06.330> so

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
remains the same as the original so

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.199 
remains the same as the original so
there<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:06.959> no<00:04:07.170> premium<00:04:07.680> just<00:04:08.580> for<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.000> color

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
there is no premium just for the color

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.480 
there is no premium just for the color
option<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:09.900> that's<00:04:10.110> very<00:04:10.440> good<00:04:10.770> so<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.400> hope

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
option and that's very good so I hope

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.130 
option and that's very good so I hope

feature size things and we'll be doing a

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.550 
feature size things and we'll be doing a
showdown<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.420> see<00:04:31.660> which<00:04:31.900> one<00:04:32.140> is<00:04:32.170> better

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560
