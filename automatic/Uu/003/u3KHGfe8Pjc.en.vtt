 it is dangerous because it is poisonous here 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 spiders and because it rains frequently 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.380
 the children are often sick and we have to 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.420
 spend a lot of money on drugs around 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.190

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.400

 It is great to see how the children's eyes 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.860
 here the children light up for me 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.080

 so many kids in the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.210
 daycare as we thought 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.040
 that at the end of the project term 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.170
 Maybe children should be there over 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400
 500 children have been registered and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.290
 has worried that maybe 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.360
 only half would come 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.549
 to find a supplement to the project 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.400
