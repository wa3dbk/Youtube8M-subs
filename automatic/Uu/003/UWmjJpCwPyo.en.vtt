00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.820
 Hello, welcome to my chain of leisures, outings and unusual experiences. 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.900
 Today, I go to Châlon sur Saône to test a strong adrenaline activity 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.800
 It is an activity that remains in the spirit of the site, that You can practice also if you wish. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:39.100
 I'm going to go in the area of ​​planes, but not just any flying object, since I'm going to test an aerobatic plane 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.460
 Imagine doing spectacular aerial tricks like: the barrel or flying your head upside down 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 The device that is waiting for me is called the Pitts S2B very precisely. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 It is one of the best aerobatic aircraft that exists. 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:05.420
 He is here in the hangar, waiting for his pilot for an original adventure. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.580
 That's it, it's gone in a few minutes. The Pitts S2B is one of the few copies 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 ... that exists in France 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.400
 And I have the honor to fly with the champion of France 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.380
 It seems that she is a killer, well, so much the better because I too am ready! 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.260
 So here we are, we just finished this flight with Melanie 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.460
 As expected it is an experience that is truly original and worthwhile 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.360
 and there is this feeling of ... executing the big power of the plane, which is manly enough, there are 260 horses in the engine, 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.700
 it goes well enough, there is also all this artistic dimension: the fact of having almost cut gas 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.760
 to dive on the runway, it feels like dancing in the air 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:17.000
 So Melanie, thank you. We just finished this aerobatic session which I remind you, can be practiced by the general public (it is rather rare as hobbies) 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.060
 So melanie, you are French champion of aerobatics 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.700
 Yes since the year 2010 in promotion level 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.060
 and also in 2007 in the category "hopes" 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.580
 There are 3 level categories on this plane and I am titled in the second category 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.420
 In an aerobatic plane, we feel "G" (force of gravity) as in a standard plane, 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.980
 but in an aerobatic plane like the Pitts S2B, we take a lot more "G" still of course 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.320
 there are the "G +" (positive gravity force) and the "G-" (negative gravitational force) 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.880
 Sometimes you fly with beginners like me 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.000
 who have never flown in an aerobatic plane 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.420
 can you tell me a few stories about the audience you receive? 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.520
 I mean, are there people who faint? 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:05.600
 Then there are several things: I already had both extremes: I knew a person who felt bad in the first figure. It was an anxious person 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.440
 who was clinging to the straps of his belt 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.400
 In those cases, I do not insist and I took him for a leisurely stroll 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.720
 So I had to turn the flight into a normal flat flight 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.460
 and then I had recently, on the Pitts, a young man who, like you, 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.040
 which was really very resistant, and in this case we can do what we want 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.920
 No limits 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.000
 Ok, so it's not a matter of character that matters, but it's physiological, right? 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.060
 It is indeed physiological I think, but then there are people who prefer everything that is extreme 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.580
 and the young man we talked about was an amateur of extreme actions 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.760
 So basically, the way people apprehend theft is a very important factor 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.000
 I remind you, as Melanie said, that we work without anti-G suit (special garment that can better withstand the effects of the force of gravity) 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:59.160
 I say this because the fighter pilots wear an anti-G suit, which compresses the limbs to support very high gravity values 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 Thank you very much Melanie, 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.640
 But I beg you and it's a pleasure to have met you. 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.080
 It is the same for me
