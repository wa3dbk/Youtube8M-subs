00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello today my namesake is not 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.570
 sent me a message 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.840
 I died two years ago, the cat took it 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.519
 when was still in the first grade of school before 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 no one died of their own 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.109
 animals after his death stayed home 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.680
 one cannon and I decided to take 2 Jungar 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.039
 hamsters 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.740
 one dzungar hamster died today 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.369
 I took him to the village and buried nearby 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.279
 from cat 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.940
 Soon, probably the cat will die and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.610
 more than 14 years no longer 2 dzungar hamster 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.280
 which I took two years ago as 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.829
 treat the death of an animal and whether 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 take a new animal after 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 the hamster and the cat will die or be without 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.760
 of animals 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.640
 by themselves when there is some kind of home 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.000
 livestock is good but that's when they die 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.109
 extremely unpleasant sensations arise 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.789
 thank you not for your questions 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.729
 frankness you know everything in this life 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.330
 dying in the fall dying all green 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.939
 leaves 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 but if we plant corn or potatoes in 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.369
 earth and they will not die they give no fruit 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.659
 in the fall to pick the fruit you need to 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.000
 in the spring it or this died just as well 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.350
 Spring is making everything that has died 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.390
 autumn and winter 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 scribbled frozen with us constantly we 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.270
 cut your nails and that means they 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.130
 die off and need them or we itch when 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.220
 we itch optional mosquito bit 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.560
 just a man itches and dead tissue 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.200
 we no longer notice her almost 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.799
 by the way in the house the most dust from 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.009
 it is from these remnants of the skin let's say 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:01.189
 invisible constantly we eat something 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:06.390
 we catch fish we die we eat it 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:09.360
 greens all that is all in the world 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.470
 die in our bodies very many 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.690
 cells die 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.710
 in their place stands the other that is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.010
 the process of life is death he is so 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.740
 constant as for animals exactly 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.470
 the same process happens to them 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.450
 need to think about that during these two 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.860
 years years or a few years when 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.920
 the animal was with you 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:38.460
 she helped you to become better in what 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.880
 than helped well if you want your 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.330
 code or your dzungarian hamster lived with 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.959
 you 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.850
 keep remembering that thanks to him 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.320
 you become better understood better done and 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.130
 now when there are any problems 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.120
 remember these emotions these moments 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.120
 use them and so 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.880
 the memory will come to life and you will 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.280
 let them live on with you 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.880
 in this sense, the more you have 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.510
 animals i will not die then new 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.910
 animal 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.760
 but thanks to this new experience you 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.400
 you will be from a new side with a new one with a new one 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.709
 new from different perspectives look at this 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.950
 life responsibility in the face of death 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:31.470
 here is an important point to learn 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:36.840
 adoption to answer the question which 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.890
 sets death must always be answered 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.690
 in which life 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.720
 if we lose heart we get upset 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.769
 give up our arms lose the meaning of life because of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.019
 animal deaths like that death 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.560
 begins to govern us we begin 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.390
 to be afraid but if we say they 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:06.500
 there will live those recommendations that I 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:06.500
 you gave life in triumph in your memory
