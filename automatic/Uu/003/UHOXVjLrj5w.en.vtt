00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.290
 Rio, the beauty, what's up, John? 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.510
 all right with you and welcome to 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 one more video and number today 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 third episode of our series of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 architectures of arrive the colossus and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 Today's episode I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.300
 arena of curu amorim then no more 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.300
 Let's play the video right away 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.620
 the mori crown arena is quite 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.870
 interesting because it is divided into 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.390
 four parts the entrance of the place 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.450
 passing through a bridge with the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.970
 the outside of the weather with the camera 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.090
 part of the temple and finally the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.910
 Coliseum where the fight happens is an arena 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.119
 very complex and very intriguing logo 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.400
 face 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.100
 the architecture of this arena is one of the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.979
 more look like the real life sac 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.009
 in south-west Asia in question Cambodia 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.619
 We have two temples that are the ones that 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.020
 are appearing on the screen and that in the glue 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.490
 I do not even dare speak the name, anyway. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.290
 what a face, this is incredibly 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.020
 similar and it's the tip and by the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.420
 shadow is filming here and would be a 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.630
 Fucking good and faithful thing right 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.940
 moreover it is obvious that the interior of the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.780
 that a great inspiration in the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.780
 Coliseum in Rome 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.910
 the whole complex that surrounds the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.670
 Hi crown from your entrance to Karina 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.490
 itself is very beautiful and a 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.160
 small waterfall here at the entrance and with 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.170
 this beam of light entering through it alone 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.170
 leave her even more fucking 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.630
 and behold, we have come to the temple where 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.090
 occurred love is just that before 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.880
 to get into it has some things well 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.580
 interesting here in the outside as well 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.580
 to be an extremely fota place has 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.950
 several pillars throughout the area 1 without foot and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.070
 others in the central part also 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.560
 we have a lake full of eels and fish 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.940
 in which it is also nice that you pick up 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.940
 a ride with them 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.510
 already inside the temple we have 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.950
 face with two huge pillars with fire 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.680
 at its ends 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.290
 these pillars we use to gain access 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.750
 to a superior platform that takes us 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.940
 to the colossus was considered by many 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.070
 people a while back that if we 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.620
 we got that stick that 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.200
 used in the fight against the clock and if 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.290
 Let's get him to go up there. 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.510
 of these pillars and botafogo in that baton and 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.290
 was going to happen some secret is to be 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.510
 unlocked or something of the type but 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.790
 obviously that did not work at all. 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.700
 besides we can not get to the top 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.160
 of these pillars without a hack what 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.890
 totally break this theory and 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.860
 still with rack nothing happens 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.140
 the bat simply does not catch fire and 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.630
 description of this video here has a video 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.730
 there to the nomad channel where he went 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.800
 in this place that with that staff and he 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.870
 really shows that nothing happens 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.870
 For who has curiosity there? 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.310
 and finally we arrived at where the fight 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.620
 what seems to us to be a 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.690
 kind of coliseum is a good place 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.420
 strange at first sight but soon 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.730
 face we can perceive these species of 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.190
 windows that are all around the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.350
 arena and which is at first 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.630
 look at the center of the arena there 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.110
 underneath not decorated moore is 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.110
 initially 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.010
 perhaps this place was built in the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.230
 intention to arrest the colonel mori he 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.980
 would be chained down there and the 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.100
 people 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.960
 would see it as a kind of attraction 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.090
 this place would be basically a 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.810
 zoo I know this is a bit 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.120
 pizarro but if we think well it does more 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.060
 sense that if this place were a 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.760
 Coliseum in fact Conlutas and everything else 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.910
 because we witnessed the attack of curu 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.580
 brunette and climbing the walls and such 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.680
 he did it in a battle beyond 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.050
 It is very dangerous for him to 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.530
 walls with people watching him 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.560
 would also be shooting at viewers 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.250
 this place would be unsure of whether 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.080
 watch a battle 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.390
 taking these two possibilities 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.790
 I can not imagine anything else than 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.860
 this arena could be but finally 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:25.020
 tell us in the comments about what you 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.490
 They think about it then of course in 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.040
 I hope you guys have the 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.200
 I really like this episode here and I 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.390
 You liked it, you know how to let it fall. 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.640
 to help in the disclosure I commented that 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.130
 liked the video and also about the 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.470
 and is not on the channel yet. 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.840
 part social networks there are in 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.169

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:51.950
