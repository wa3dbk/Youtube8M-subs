00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
can tell the Opera dominantly mesh with

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.970 
can tell the Opera dominantly mesh with
some<00:00:53.570> synthetic<00:00:53.780> leather<00:00:54.290> here<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:54.800> see

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
between and then these black areas are

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.670 
between and then these black areas are
kind<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.899> a<00:01:01.750> rubber<00:01:02.750> material<00:01:02.899> with<00:01:03.469> mesh
