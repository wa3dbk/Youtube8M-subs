well with everything there is a learning
curve<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.820> don't<00:02:18.120> anticipate<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.780> our

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.520 
drivers will have a hard time with it
just<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.360> make<00:02:21.510> sure<00:02:21.540> we're<00:02:22.050> also<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.440> to

just to make sure we're also going to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.040 
just to make sure we're also going to
install<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> sign<00:02:23.220> beside<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.360> 4life<00:02:24.750> head

there<00:02:29.070> for<00:02:29.280> about<00:02:29.430> 30<00:02:29.730> days<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.240> then<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> will

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
there for about 30 days and then it will

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.810 
there for about 30 days and then it will
come<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:30.810> does<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.310> plans<00:02:32.550> to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
come down does we not have plans to

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.430 
come down does we not have plans to
install<00:02:32.970> more<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.540> these<00:02:33.660> types<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.080> signals

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
install more of these types of signals

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.860 
install more of these types of signals
we<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.910> reconstruct<00:02:36.780> our

intersections when they're needed we
will<00:02:39.120> certainly<00:02:39.330> put<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> flashing

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
will certainly put up the flashing

see<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.640> more<00:02:50.880> nationwide<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.900> certainly<00:02:52.680> in

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
see it more nationwide and certainly in

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.040 
see it more nationwide and certainly in
