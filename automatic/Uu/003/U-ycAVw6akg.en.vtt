one on the right you know if there's a

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.260 
one on the right you know if there's a
you<00:01:46.319> know<00:01:46.349> threaded<00:01:46.829> through<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.609> two<00:01:47.939> screws

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you know threaded through the two screws

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
you know threaded through the two screws
facing<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.749> other<00:01:48.810> side<00:01:49.069> that's<00:01:50.069> a<00:01:50.189> little

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
facing the other side that's a little

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
facing the other side that's a little
challenge<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> beginning<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.840> not

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
challenge in a beginning but it's not

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.620 
challenge in a beginning but it's not
hard<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.319> do<00:01:52.469> it<00:01:53.179> they<00:01:54.179> see<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.749> is<00:01:54.959> a

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
hard to do it they see there is a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.029 
hard to do it they see there is a
circumference<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.959> this<00:01:58.169> light<00:01:58.409> doesn't

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
circumference that this light doesn't

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.919 
circumference that this light doesn't
seem<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.579> completely<00:01:59.909> cover<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.569> it's<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
seem to completely cover because it's a

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.379 
seem to completely cover because it's a
square<00:02:01.549> compared<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> circular<00:02:04.459> oval<00:02:05.459> light

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
square compared to a circular oval light

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.620 
square compared to a circular oval light
was<00:02:06.599> in<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:06.959> before<00:02:07.139> so<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.740> had<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.630> put

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
was in there before so we had to put

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.210 
was in there before so we had to put
some<00:02:09.840> joint<00:02:10.709> compound<00:02:11.630> wall<00:02:12.630> compound<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.380> to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
some joint compound wall compound on to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.670 
some joint compound wall compound on to
finish<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.239> Machine<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:16.170> sanded

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
finish it up and the Machine is sanded

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.729 
finish it up and the Machine is sanded
and<00:02:16.830> I'm<00:02:17.790> painting<00:02:18.569> again<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.380> means<00:02:19.590> we

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
and I'm painting again so that means we

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.470 
and I'm painting again so that means we
have<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.099> another<00:02:20.340> removal<00:02:21.000> at<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> center

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
have to do another removal at the center

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.060 
have to do another removal at the center
light<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.230> basically<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.650> take<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.830> light

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
light so basically you take the light

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.010 
light so basically you take the light
pulse<00:02:23.280> off<00:02:23.460> unscrew<00:02:24.300> it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
pulse off unscrew it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.530 
pulse off unscrew it
at<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.680> same<00:02:25.860> time<00:02:26.040> take<00:02:26.280> out<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.270> glass

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
