00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.619 

hi<00:00:00.149> so<00:00:00.780> with<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.250> unconscious<00:00:02.250> okay<00:00:02.580> yes<00:00:03.389> and

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hi so with the unconscious okay yes and

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.470 
hi so with the unconscious okay yes and
this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.350> demonstration<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.480> new

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
this is the demonstration of the new

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.890 
this is the demonstration of the new
Marvel<00:00:06.960> Armada<00:00:07.319> XP<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:08.130> course<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.630> show

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
Marvel Armada XP for course that we show

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.339 
Marvel Armada XP for course that we show
how<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.410> run<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.920> parallel<00:00:11.360> what<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.509> doing<00:00:12.900> run

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
how we run in parallel what we doing run

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.550 
how we run in parallel what we doing run
fractals<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.940> wanted<00:00:15.240> with<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.599> cpu<00:00:16.109> 2

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
fractals and we wanted with one cpu 2

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.340 
fractals and we wanted with one cpu 2
CPUs<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.100> force<00:00:17.580> appears<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.270> we'll<00:00:18.810> see<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
CPUs and force appears and we'll see the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.370 
CPUs and force appears and we'll see the
difference<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.890> time<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:22.140> one

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
difference in time so this is with one

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.880 
difference in time so this is with one
cpu<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:24.390> we'll<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.869> also<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:25.619> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
cpu and what we'll see also here that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.509 
cpu and what we'll see also here that
the<00:00:26.880> cpu<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.359> fully<00:00:27.779> occupied<00:00:28.220> taking<00:00:29.220> quite<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the cpu is fully occupied taking quite a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.089 
the cpu is fully occupied taking quite a
bit<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> same<00:00:30.570> calculation<00:00:31.560> at

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
bit of time to the same calculation at

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.940 
bit of time to the same calculation at
almost<00:00:32.520> nine<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> half<00:00:33.030> seconds<00:00:33.890> now<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
almost nine and a half seconds now we

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.880 
almost nine and a half seconds now we
switch<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.670> run<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.000> 2<00:00:36.149> CPUs<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.710> here

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
switch and run with 2 CPUs we see here

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
switch and run with 2 CPUs we see here
that<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.340> superiors<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.940> fully<00:00:39.180> occupied

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that your superiors are fully occupied

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.060 
that your superiors are fully occupied
take<00:00:40.500> them<00:00:40.739> account<00:00:41.210> for<00:00:42.210> second<00:00:42.989> point<00:00:43.320> 75

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
take them account for second point 75

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.819 
take them account for second point 75
and<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.690> run<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.140> false<00:00:46.440> appearance

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and now we run with false appearance

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.910 
and now we run with false appearance
which<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:48.120> much<00:00:48.329> faster<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.590> four

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
which will be much much faster so four

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.310 
which will be much much faster so four
cpus<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.610> almost<00:00:50.969> boom<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.079> done<00:00:53.239> 2.4

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
cpus is almost boom and it's done 2.4

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
cpus is almost boom and it's done 2.4
eight<00:00:55.320> seconds<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.360> show<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
eight seconds and we will show the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.410 
eight seconds and we will show the
results<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:01:00.120> linear

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
results that you see pretty linear

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.520 
results that you see pretty linear
emails<00:01:01.699> SMP<00:01:02.699> machete<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
emails SMP machete so this is the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
emails SMP machete so this is the
development<00:01:05.100> board<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
development board that we have is it's a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.490 
development board that we have is it's a
standard<00:01:07.710> development<00:01:08.130> board<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.180> CPU<00:01:09.720> we

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
standard development board the CPU we

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.820 
standard development board the CPU we
have<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> graphical<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> memory<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
have a graphical of the memory and it's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.540 
have a graphical of the memory and it's

computer<00:01:47.480> right<00:01:47.690> now<00:01:47.920> have<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:49.310> different

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
computer right now have a different

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.050 
computer right now have a different
processor<00:01:50.540> inside<00:01:51.460> because<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.880> more

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
processor inside because this is more

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.790 
processor inside because this is more
enterprise<00:01:53.660> class<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.440> is<00:01:54.590> no

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
enterprise class and this is no

enterprise class and this is no
consumables<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.590> usually<00:01:57.590> we<00:01:57.770> have<00:01:57.800> reference

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
consumables so usually we have reference

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.790 
consumables so usually we have reference
designs<00:01:58.910> that<00:01:59.180> will<00:01:59.630> go<00:01:59.900> to<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.350> kind<00:02:00.620> of

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
designs that will go to this kind of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.180 
designs that will go to this kind of
reference<00:02:01.070> design<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:02.300> we<00:02:02.510> are<00:02:02.570> doing<00:02:02.810> and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
reference design that we are doing and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.310 
reference design that we are doing and
will<00:02:04.190> have<00:02:04.400> something<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:05.450> form<00:02:05.810> factor

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
will have something in this form factor

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.359 
will have something in this form factor
that<00:02:06.950> will<00:02:07.130> have<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.610> quad-core<00:02:08.450> all<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.369> nice

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that will have a quad-core all so nice

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.190 
that will have a quad-core all so nice
so<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.860> try<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.160> explain<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.630> positioning

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
so you try and explain the positioning

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.430 
so you try and explain the positioning
of<00:02:15.350> using<00:02:15.890> ARM<00:02:16.160> processors<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:16.940> servers<00:02:17.780> what

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
of using ARM processors and servers what

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.470 
of using ARM processors and servers what
is<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.650> advantage<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.520> advantage<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.210> their

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
is the advantage the advantage of their

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960 
is the advantage the advantage of their
own<00:02:20.660> process<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.170> all<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.440> servers<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.520> that

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
own process of all the servers is that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.680 
own process of all the servers is that
we<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:24.220> very<00:02:25.220> good<00:02:25.610> performance<00:02:25.940> at

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
we will have a very good performance at

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.270 
we will have a very good performance at
a<00:02:27.350> fraction<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.190> power<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:30.280> relatively

are you saying we will will come with

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.309 
are you saying we will will come with
performance<00:03:08.530> benchmarks<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:11.140> is

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
performance benchmarks and this is

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.920 
performance benchmarks and this is
ongoing<00:03:11.590> effort<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.519> will<00:03:12.700> come<00:03:13.030> later<00:03:13.060> it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
ongoing effort that will come later it

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.839 
ongoing effort that will come later it
becomes<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.349> cement<00:03:14.680> trucks<00:03:14.920> yes<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:15.549> will<00:03:15.640> come

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
becomes a cement trucks yes we will come

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.460 
becomes a cement trucks yes we will come
with<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> standard<00:03:16.690> benchmarks<00:03:17.290> for<00:03:17.319> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
with the standard benchmarks for the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.610 
with the standard benchmarks for the
industry<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.580> spec<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.209> expect<00:03:19.780> power<00:03:20.019> and

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
industry like spec we expect power and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.970 
industry like spec we expect power and
so<00:03:20.920> on<00:03:21.420> it's<00:03:22.420> ongoing<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:23.319> will<00:03:23.620> take<00:03:23.799> some

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
so on it's ongoing it will take some

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.400 
so on it's ongoing it will take some
time<00:03:24.040> but<00:03:25.000> will<00:03:25.209> come<00:03:25.480> very<00:03:25.660> soon<00:03:25.780> what<00:03:26.319> do

in<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.470> lot<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.740> bandwidth<00:05:52.730> for<00:05:52.940> this<00:05:53.260> so<00:05:54.260> this

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
in a lot of bandwidth for this so this

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.070 
in a lot of bandwidth for this so this
is<00:05:54.470> perfectly<00:05:55.190> device<00:05:55.730> for<00:05:56.060> this<00:05:56.270> project<00:05:56.630> and

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
is perfectly device for this project and

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.550 
is perfectly device for this project and
the<00:05:57.710> same<00:05:58.040> as<00:05:58.250> the<00:05:58.430> social<00:05:58.910> networks

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
youtube safe work so YouTube and

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.940 
youtube safe work so YouTube and
Facebook<00:06:03.350> should<00:06:03.800> use<00:06:03.950> this<00:06:05.110> i'm<00:06:06.110> not<00:06:06.530> i<00:06:06.830> mean

obvious<00:06:07.460> is<00:06:07.970> that<00:06:08.000> sites<00:06:08.510> like<00:06:08.720> that<00:06:08.750> size

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
obvious is that sites like that size

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.960 
obvious is that sites like that size
should<00:06:10.310> definitely<00:06:10.910> use<00:06:10.940> this<00:06:11.470> very<00:06:12.470> visual

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
should definitely use this very visual

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.970 
should definitely use this very visual
