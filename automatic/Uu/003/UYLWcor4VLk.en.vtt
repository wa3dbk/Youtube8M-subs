calyx I think people sometimes suspect

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.520 
calyx I think people sometimes suspect
that<00:02:27.090> professional<00:02:27.659> players<00:02:27.870> might<00:02:28.200> train

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
that professional players might train

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.360 
that professional players might train
and<00:02:28.769> in<00:02:28.890> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
and in a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.009 
and in a
you<00:02:29.459> know<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> real<00:02:29.940> complicated<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
you know on a real complicated and

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.410 
you know on a real complicated and
difficult<00:02:31.709> way<00:02:32.159> but<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.519> fact<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:32.970> not<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.360> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
difficult way but in fact it's not and I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.670 
difficult way but in fact it's not and I
think<00:02:33.629> it's<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:33.959> good<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.349> them<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.500> see

that we just trained the basics and we

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.509 
that we just trained the basics and we

do the simple skills and it's just a

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.979 
do the simple skills and it's just a
matter<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.790> getting<00:02:38.879> really<00:02:39.420> good<00:02:39.599> at<00:02:39.629> them<00:02:39.870> is

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
matter of getting really good at them is
