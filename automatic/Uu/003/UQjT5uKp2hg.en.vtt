skateboard and ride our bikes and we
don't<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.960> worry<00:00:19.109> about<00:00:19.199> squeaks

speaking<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> seasons<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.529> have

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
speaking of seasons you know we have

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
speaking of seasons you know we have
four<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.949> them<00:00:23.039> spring<00:00:23.519> summer<00:00:23.910> autumn<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
four of them spring summer autumn and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.230 
four of them spring summer autumn and
winter<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.350> know<00:00:25.529> why<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.090> more

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
winter but do you know why we have more

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
winter but do you know why we have more
than<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.539> season<00:00:27.930> well<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.560> seasons

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
than one season well we have seasons

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.950 
than one season well we have seasons
because<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.160> earth<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.519> tilted<00:00:29.869> instead<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
because the earth is tilted instead of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.870 
because the earth is tilted instead of
standing<00:00:31.230> straight<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.219> leans<00:00:32.669> a

standing straight up and down it leans a
little<00:00:33.120> bit<00:00:33.239> whoa<00:00:34.170> how'd<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.040> happen<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
little bit whoa how'd that happen a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.720 
little bit whoa how'd that happen a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

hit<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> earth<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.700> impact<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.210> strong

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
hit the earth the impact was so strong

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.450 
hit the earth the impact was so strong
that<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.140> knocked<00:00:43.350> our<00:00:43.500> planet<00:00:43.860> over<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.219> little

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
that it knocked our planet over a little

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
that it knocked our planet over a little
bit<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:45.059> earth<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.719> tilted<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.230> our

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bit so now earth is tilted and our

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
bit so now earth is tilted and our
tilted<00:00:47.100> planet<00:00:47.489> travels<00:00:47.969> around<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> Sun

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
tilted planet travels around the Sun

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
tilted planet travels around the Sun
completing<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.440> full<00:00:49.680> trip<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.460> way

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
completing one full trip all the way

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
completing one full trip all the way
around<00:00:50.820> every<00:00:51.360> year<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.719> mean<00:00:51.899> that's<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
around every year I mean that's what a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
around every year I mean that's what a
year<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.879> time<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.390> takes<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> earth

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
year is the time it takes for the earth

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.740 
year is the time it takes for the earth
to<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.320> around<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> Sun<00:00:55.980> once<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.879> depending

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to go around the Sun once and depending

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.029 
to go around the Sun once and depending
on<00:00:57.870> where<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> earth<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.649> its<00:00:58.800> journey

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
on where the earth is in its journey

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.830 
on where the earth is in its journey
around<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> Sun<00:00:59.640> our<00:00:59.820> exposure<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> sunlight

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
around the Sun our exposure to sunlight

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
around the Sun our exposure to sunlight
changes<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.800> means<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.190> seasons<00:01:02.879> change

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
changes that means the seasons change

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
changes that means the seasons change
that's<00:01:03.719> why<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.199> four<00:01:04.470> seasons<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that's why we have four seasons in one

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460 
that's why we have four seasons in one
year<00:01:05.640> sometimes<00:01:06.299> during<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> year<00:01:06.930> part<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
year sometimes during the year part of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.710 
year sometimes during the year part of
the<00:01:07.560> earth<00:01:07.680> tilts<00:01:08.010> toward<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.970> Sun<00:01:09.180> sometimes

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the earth tilts toward the Sun sometimes

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
the earth tilts toward the Sun sometimes
it<00:01:10.020> tilt<00:01:10.229> away<00:01:10.799> from<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.100> Sun<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> part

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
it tilt away from the Sun when the part

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
it tilt away from the Sun when the part
of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> planet<00:01:12.570> you're<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.110> tilted<00:01:13.530> toward

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the Sun it's you guessed it summer when

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.859 
it's tilted away from the Sun it's yep

that's when we have spring and autumn

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
that's when we have spring and autumn
they're<00:01:25.350> both<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.920> bit<00:01:26.040> warm<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> a

this season also depends on where on

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.140 
this season also depends on where on
earth<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.350> happen<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> live<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.640> means<00:01:32.939> that

earth you happen to live that means that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
earth you happen to live that means that
