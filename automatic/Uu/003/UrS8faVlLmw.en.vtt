cut<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.560> face<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.409> could<00:01:46.409> flop<00:01:46.740> over<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
cut you face the could flop over the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.800 
cut you face the could flop over the
terrible<00:01:48.329> flop

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
terrible flop

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.899 
terrible flop
you<00:01:49.320> can't<00:01:49.560> ever<00:01:49.770> cuff<00:01:50.040> anything<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.700> it's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you can't ever cuff anything that it's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.660 
you can't ever cuff anything that it's
not<00:01:51.119> gonna<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.600> nicely<00:01:52.020> fit<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.829> right<00:01:53.430> next

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
not gonna just nicely fit up right next

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
not gonna just nicely fit up right next
to<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> rest<00:01:53.970> okay<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.720> it'll<00:01:55.170> fall<00:01:55.470> over

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to the rest okay because it'll fall over

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.620 
to the rest okay because it'll fall over
it<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.040> looks<00:01:56.250> sloppy<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:56.969> good<00:01:57.180> so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it just looks sloppy that's good so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.810 
it just looks sloppy that's good so
where<00:01:57.810> should<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> cuff<00:01:58.350> where's<00:01:58.829> my<00:01:59.009> target

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
where should the cuff where's my target

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.539 
where should the cuff where's my target
for<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> actually<00:02:00.329> end<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.079> how<00:02:01.200> maybe<00:02:01.860> far

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
for it to actually end and how maybe far

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.240 
for it to actually end and how maybe far
up<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> leg<00:02:03.180> should<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.689> sorry<00:02:04.200> um<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
up the leg should it go sorry um the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
up the leg should it go sorry um the
safe<00:02:05.549> bet<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.210> always<00:02:06.509> hit<00:02:06.689> right<00:02:06.930> at<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
safe bet is to always hit right at the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.229 
safe bet is to always hit right at the
top<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.469> shoe<00:02:07.770> that's<00:02:08.729> always<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
top of your shoe that's always going to

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.960 
top of your shoe that's always going to
be<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.629> clean<00:02:09.929> cut<00:02:10.370> cuff<00:02:11.370> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
be a clean cut cuff and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.580 
be a clean cut cuff and
you<00:02:12.120> kind<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.690> mean<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.140> like<00:02:13.410> one

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you kind of I mean it's just like one

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.690 
you kind of I mean it's just like one
straight<00:02:13.890> line<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.520> straight

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
straight line so you have a straight

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.520 
straight line so you have a straight
line<00:02:14.880> for<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.240> gene<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.720> then<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.260> see<00:02:16.410> your

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
line for the gene and then you see your

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.770 
line for the gene and then you see your
shoe<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.520> higher<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.970> go<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> leg<00:02:18.570> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
shoe the higher you go up the leg is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.450 
shoe the higher you go up the leg is
kind<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.140> more<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> danger<00:02:19.980> zone<00:02:20.010> you're

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
kind of more into the danger zone you're

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.950 
kind of more into the danger zone you're
getting<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.820> little<00:02:20.970> bit<00:02:21.150> more<00:02:21.300> experimental

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
getting a little bit more experimental

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.380 
getting a little bit more experimental
but<00:02:22.890> let's<00:02:23.070> say<00:02:23.310> maybe<00:02:23.730> more<00:02:24.000> towards<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
but let's say maybe more towards the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.380 
but let's say maybe more towards the
capri<00:02:24.780> yes<00:02:25.230> then<00:02:25.470> again<00:02:25.740> yeah<00:02:26.190> okay<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.210> let's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
capri yes then again yeah okay but let's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.850 
capri yes then again yeah okay but let's
say<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.720> some<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.050> crazy<00:02:28.320> socks<00:02:28.590> you

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
say you have some like crazy socks you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.110 
say you have some like crazy socks you
really<00:02:29.070> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> show<00:02:29.340> off<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.910> could

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
really want to show off and you could

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.790 
really want to show off and you could
maybe<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.720> one<00:02:30.930> more<00:02:30.960> cup<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.650> have

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
maybe do it one more cup and if you have

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.710 
maybe do it one more cup and if you have
a<00:02:31.830> higher<00:02:32.070> shoe<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.460> boot<00:02:32.730> you'd<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.510> above

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
a higher shoe like a boot you'd go above

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.030 
a higher shoe like a boot you'd go above
to<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.380> top<00:02:34.850> okay<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.200> another<00:02:37.650> similar

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
to the top okay and then another similar

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.890 
to the top okay and then another similar
question<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.850> single<00:02:39.120> roll<00:02:39.480> versus

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
question is like the single roll versus

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.080 
question is like the single roll versus
the<00:02:40.020> double<00:02:40.350> roll<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:41.340> know<00:02:41.460> where<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.790> end<00:02:41.970> it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the double roll we know where to end it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.130 
the double roll we know where to end it
but<00:02:42.210> what's<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.480> difference<00:02:42.780> between<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
but what's the difference between the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.199 
but what's the difference between the
two<00:02:43.290> well<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.130> kind<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.459> go<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.730> tangent

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
two well they kind of go in tangent

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.570 
two well they kind of go in tangent
you're<00:02:45.540> gonna<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.050> roll<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.709> where<00:02:47.400> it

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
you're gonna want to roll it to where it

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.000 
you're gonna want to roll it to where it
lays<00:02:47.820> where<00:02:48.180> ends<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> best<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
lays where ends the best but with the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.800 
lays where ends the best but with the
same<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.850> double<00:02:51.180> roll<00:02:51.330> here<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
same like this is a double roll here and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.180 
same like this is a double roll here and
it<00:02:51.900> looks<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.470> sleeker<00:02:52.740> because

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
it looks a little bit sleeker because

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.090 
it looks a little bit sleeker because
you<00:02:53.340> can't<00:02:53.580> see<00:02:53.940> them<00:02:54.360> at<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.050> right<00:02:55.380> if<00:02:55.920> you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
you can't see them at all right if you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.550 
you can't see them at all right if you
go<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.550> single<00:02:57.240> rule<00:02:57.600> where<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.230> kind<00:02:58.500> of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
go for a single rule where you kind of

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.740 
go for a single rule where you kind of
see<00:02:58.740> this<00:02:58.890> hem<00:02:59.190> here<00:02:59.490> it's<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.030> little<00:03:00.390> bit<00:03:00.510> more

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
see this hem here it's a little bit more

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.980 
see this hem here it's a little bit more
slightly<00:03:01.500> casual<00:03:02.100> more<00:03:02.280> laid-back<00:03:02.490> look<00:03:03.090> you

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
slightly casual more laid-back look you

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.050 
slightly casual more laid-back look you
can<00:03:04.140> always<00:03:04.380> cheat<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:05.610> if<00:03:05.790> let's

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
can always cheat that if like if let's

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.400 
can always cheat that if like if let's
say<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.209> only<00:03:06.420> had<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.660> length<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.380> a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
say you only had the length to do a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.260 
say you only had the length to do a
single<00:03:07.709> roll<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.850> go<00:03:08.940> for<00:03:09.120> this

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
single roll but you want to go for this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.390 
single roll but you want to go for this
look<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.750> can<00:03:10.200> kind<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.560> tuck<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.160> home

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
look you can kind of just tuck this home

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.670 
look you can kind of just tuck this home
here<00:03:11.790> oh<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> top<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.620> a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
here oh just the top of it so it's a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.140 
here oh just the top of it so it's a
single<00:03:13.890> roll<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.400> you're<00:03:14.490> just<00:03:14.700> right

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
