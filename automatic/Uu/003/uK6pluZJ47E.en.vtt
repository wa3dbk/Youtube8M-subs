00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello everyone pavel shaker at the microphone and 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.400
 in view of the fact that lately I am very 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.380
 frequently asked questions with regards not to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.790
 how are they still confused and all 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.730
 the rest is how I need to make settings 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.609
 I'll explain it right now then 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.740
 have you go to settings you go 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.199
 in the ability tab carefully 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.449
 memorize abilities here you have 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.429
 auto application quick application 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.099
 auto use for some reason not 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.710
 work that is there goes the sound of fluff and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.870
 everything and nothing happens therefore you 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.210
 need to configure fast application 2 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.910
 abilities you can adjust it to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.700
 Mouse 5 for example, how I love it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.379
 additional mouse button if 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.820
 you don't have extra buttons on the mouse you 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.329
 can adjust to space 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.110
 for example, as I have now configured 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.300

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.150
 slow motion here we have 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.519
 the main non pan we press the tab that is 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.810
 more precisely, first it is best to press the poof 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.209
