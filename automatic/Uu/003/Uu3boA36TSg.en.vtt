00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.240
 a boy we are here at my desk 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.170
 we are not going to learn how to make a 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.790
 word server without hamas and it's a lot 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.480
 more advisable was that he does not have much 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.690
 lag but it is more difficult in this 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.000
 brainer video will be worth it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 first thing we have to do is 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.230
 important important to see my video that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 I'll leave it on the whole screen now 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.040
 same for how to take the ports if not 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 We open the ports I'm afraid we 're not going 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.399
 to be able to do 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.739
 you have to watch the video and when not 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.739
 you can see think about this video 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.810
 when you have already opened the shorts we 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.810
 we have to go to the server 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 I bought you here 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.560
 served content 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.340
 we will be game mine with your servers 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.460
 and this is important if not all if 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 you are host you need to go to 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.240
 cmd 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.740
 if we went in games in this 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.740
 case it was the concert 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.750
 then you should look for one that puts 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.800
 adapted and the wired network connection 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.970
 wireless 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.370
 and it describes the upv 4 that already said it if 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:27.110
 you are the host then you go to 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:32.020
 190 and 2,160 and 8.1 128 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.020
 that is mine that I have in me 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.549
 in that half 14 is worth now we come back with 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.900
 work so far 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.540
 see here we are a follower 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.819
 As you can see, everything is correct, no data 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.819
 easy 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 but 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.760
 now let's go again to our 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.940
 desktop and let's see let's go to 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.769
 teach how you have to connect a 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.590
 player that is not the host so far 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.379
 sea ​​guys we are here back in my 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.049
 desk and you will say ok and we have 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.909
 allowed to say how it has to be done 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.730
 for a guy who settings 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:21.010
 Mental temper is very easy 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.010
 have to go back to the browser 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.260
 but to our best 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.490
 and they are not 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.340
 I am is to eat 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.340
 I dont know 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.280
 a canon is pretty cool 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:58.940
 we're not going to be serious but it's that the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:01.580
 current is my point then up here 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.900
 we will get a card this is the ip 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.819
 public vale 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.860
 this is the ip with which they are going to have 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.230
 that connect our friends if it's that 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.910
 if they are not luxuries, for example, I have 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.580
 day that if you want to connect and the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.709
 server is never and then he is going 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.100
 to have to connect with this from where 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.980
 put with and be true you are instead of 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.610
 put the ip that we have of the cmd has 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.760
 that put this ip is worth and it's like that 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.750
 you're going to have the same server 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.750
 but with 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.810
 good as you see is very easy everything very 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.620
 easy you can be on a server 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:53.920
