00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:21.919
 21 and the personal pole firmness when alice 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.910
 and I got you two more the video of 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.279
 channel and 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.189
 good personal to you one more game 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.110
 play hardcore games after so much 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.599
 time without bringing or even know 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.219
 sorry for the lack of art videos 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.410
 we will do here in the channel but the cruise 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.910
 finally talking to me the biel 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.920
 unfortunately we could not bring the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.800
 from there commented in the match live 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.690
 in fact it is because the headset of the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.450
 bell got taller than mine in the middle 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.950
 the recording was very bad then I 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.899
 I have to comment from here on 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.640
 Up for this beauty fact but anyway 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.530
 You already saw there that it has already been more tricky. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.989
 and in the beginning of the match I was giving a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.790
 server and a civil james mvp with my 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.380
 friend drank people tava tank kit 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.940
 is a pair that has more time for those who 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.600
 Do not know the tank when you kill a 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.000
 player 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 basically blows everything up so much 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 good for destroying double threes and so 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.100
 What team is the team of four and so is it? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.569
 you're arrested early on and you've seen 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.759
 back there that I had died in the 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.770
 The beginning is unfortunately a 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.560
 face in the hole killed abel only like me 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.780
 vip is it reborn he appeared 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.609
 again I told him just for him 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.859
 We just kept pulling it. 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.719
 after he died right the first time 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.490
 I ended up taking two more than you 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.799
 I was wrong to use it so not so 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.590
 difficult but at last this may appear 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.450
 gladiator I took a little scare 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.159
 with that cry of his name I appeared 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.409
 I was a little desperate for the fact too 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.869
 I was playing the server and I almost 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.579
 I died there I took the blow of 1 leg 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.009
 because the server is right and who is not 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.289
 You know such Europe and it gets very wide 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.450
 not so far down a little flooded and 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.579
 The firefighter gets in trouble again. 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.020
 It's here for those who do not know the vip he has. 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.299
 up to five years to be reborn 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.909
 that is, while the match did not give five 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.130
 minutes and one for example it can 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.719
 reborn at will since the baby died 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.849
 I ended up killing a guy who killed him. 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.020
 I was a bit more tranquil point 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.330
 You are not missing more or less not 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.120
 the 30 carlos - this match still 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.680
 20 guys there are missing the 14 faces of the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.380
 line then the match was already a bit 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.970
 so let's say it's easier to 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.650
 we won not easy but it was 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.860
 so let's see let's go like this 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.840
 but finally to price in the florestinha 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.810
 Angolans and I almost fell in the lava in the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.459
 there in that part almost the inhalable m'boi 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.510
 all over there i almost she washes 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.220
 florestinha 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.989
 leaves the correct guy is that type 1 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.819
 said his coordinates to me I saw 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.560
 that the biota in the coordinates of this face 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.420
 So I ran away young I found it there. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 only this guy was after him and he 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 fell into a hole and Italy will 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.109
 will make finally appeared another guy was 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.390
 well frenetic point is this guy there 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.220
 appeared to have left it for 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.780
 hot more or less for him and we 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.090
 continue focusing by focusing on this face 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.620
 ended up killing him was that disney leaves 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.329
 we're a little slower then 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.709
 appeared to stay again as he left the 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.530
 cave missing but he went to do a 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.269
 finally decides he left the house we 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.889
 He's still running after him. 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.720
 a little bit a little bit right 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.250
 because it was not enough for him to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.909
 We were in a duet, right? 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.159
 anyway he ran there I 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.760
 I have busel libel it was that father and mother is 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.230
 the guy 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.540
 for those who do not know what to play for you 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.879
 snowball and only have you stay glued 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.579
 It's a very cool kit and we're done. 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.069
 killing him and he has a sword 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.389
 jairon and six more left then left 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.500
 This is very good, for we do more 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.180
 part of the money for me 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.099
 the bial took the daily sword he had 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.500
 and I made a good boot for me this 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.030
 height of mp already work with 6 that the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.400
 departure was already almost seven minutes 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.940
 of a tower is every match has to have 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.349
 a tower 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.569
 only before we came to be a 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.090
 Bullshit in the tower there seemed to be underneath. 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.310
 We came to kill him and for what I 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.859
 I know this so I can observe it 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.659
 only one enter maggi left in this tower that 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.010
 he stayed up there he did not jump naked 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.419
 did there he stayed there then we found 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.370
 This guy promises not to give so much work. 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.560
 So we'll leave it there, I think. 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.720
 maybe it will not make that much difference, huh? 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.000
 Wait, we expected this and I hope 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.680
 that at the end neither of the shows is 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.209
 as we continue to chase the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.650
 Our intention was to find a cave. 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.659
 was that we did find a 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.970
 cave to start to stay the will is 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.459
 because there mpl was already at a height 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.440
 I like you ten more and ten less than in play. 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.389
 I think it's already a moment so you already 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.630
 show enough and you 're time for yourself 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.940
 program cave and minerals or ten 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.430
 minutes of video that start more or 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.080
 less time I know there are 10 players eight 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.529
 plans depends on the sharing you have 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.849
 hour 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.169
 but anyway we find sky that is 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.789
 doing a v 1 with it right 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.110
 I like to date, I do not go 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.939
 lying to you is not because the guy 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.400
 played very well and there was already a 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.409
 a little too loose sometimes 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.900
 I tell the audience to give help to 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.969
 I put fire on it step was 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.370
 very basic thing even was at night I could 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.110
 And the good start with dancing madly I 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.849
 also then it was kind bell put fire 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.979
 It's so every once in a while 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.960
 kill the guy there he played very well me 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.400
 it was there forum is missing helmet 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.930
 For me, he had a breastplate and a boot. 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.569
 if I'm not mistaken then it was one thing was 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.490
 Well cool of the cool OCP but I was 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.419
 more advantage anyway anyway I 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.099
 I got here and was injected into beauty 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.629
 in this part fell swear to you that I 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.610
 I was thinking that from the finished only 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.580
 that there after I saw there dabbagh help 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.919
 I saw that tava missing another player case 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.479
 you will see that bizarre in morals was 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.889
 a very bizarre guy gives it to him 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.689
 that I told you not even him already 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.699
 I had died and I do not know how but he 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.229
 died in bonn we saw that the 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.150
 carnival in a cave is improving 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.879
 beauties from your side of your agent 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.479
 realized that the guy went up now rose and 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.250
 it does not lead to people running away because 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.479
 minecraft type walks very dark staff 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.759
 with a setting for 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.800
 you leave the blog neowin a boite more 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.139
 or less so you go in settings 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.430
 there and increase the range the minecraft only 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.839
 I do not do it so I'm very 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.490
 dark and it was very difficult to reach 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.740
 In that cave I even put a 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.360
 You did not give it to you in the video. 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.620
 to see nothing but at least we want 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.120
 we did not find the car for 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.219
 get away from us and can not 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.770
 swamp face appeared there I could and went 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:03.810
 behind him he does not like it continues 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.610
 happening he did not stop to take pvp 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.449
 he kept running and looks at it 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.580
 what will happen 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.099
 He'll run there and I'll get over him. 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.229
 he died or was a guy maybe 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.849
 he was starting in the arctic games not 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.439
 had so much experience in the game and maybe 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.569
 he had not taken them to the hospital he 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:20.460
 ended up dying and running away 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.969
 We were there only when I left for 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.129
 get the ultimate pvp from the right gameplay 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.110
 anyway this was the video you guys are going to stay 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.759
 with him until the end of there hardcore 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.589
 gamers I know it was time for 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.939

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.620
 I'm really sorry, but I 'm coming back to 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:35.969
 cut to games and we then left the 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.529

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.620

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.229
 cool, this is it, I'm staying there for 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.229
