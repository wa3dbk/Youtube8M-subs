we're<00:00:41.930> constantly<00:00:42.290> trying<00:00:42.559> to<00:00:43.070> figure<00:00:43.400> out

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
we're constantly trying to figure out

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.090 
we're constantly trying to figure out
ways<00:00:44.330> of<00:00:44.570> manipulating<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.350> water<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.950> be

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
ways of manipulating the water to be

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.760 
ways of manipulating the water to be
more<00:00:46.280> efficient<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.210> lot<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.809> times<00:00:48.020> we'll

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
more efficient so a lot of times we'll

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.450 
more efficient so a lot of times we'll
look<00:00:49.010> at<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.850> hydro<00:00:50.420> dynamics<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.890> dolphin

or<00:00:52.760> tuna<00:00:53.300> or<00:00:53.600> certain<00:00:53.989> fish<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.500> tries<00:00:54.710> and

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
or tuna or certain fish and tries and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.850 
or tuna or certain fish and tries and
learn<00:00:55.070> as<00:00:55.309> much<00:00:56.000> as<00:00:56.270> possible<00:00:56.600> from<00:00:57.260> nature<00:00:57.650> as

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
learn as much as possible from nature as

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.460 
learn as much as possible from nature as
we<00:00:58.100> can<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.550> apply<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.150> to<00:00:59.390> our<00:00:59.510> craft
