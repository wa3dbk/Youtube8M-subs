00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
makeup every day I think that is one of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.030 
makeup every day I think that is one of
our<00:01:47.130> biggest<00:01:47.369> problems<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.829> when<00:01:49.829> we're

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
our biggest problems is when we're

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030 
our biggest problems is when we're
trying<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.340> fight<00:01:50.610> blemishes<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.210> or<00:01:52.079> try<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
trying to fight blemishes or or try to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.959 
trying to fight blemishes or or try to
maintain<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.549> healthy<00:01:54.829> appearance<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.340> nice

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
maintain a healthy appearance of nice

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.630 
maintain a healthy appearance of nice
texturized<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.799> texture<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.310> but

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
texturized and one that texture is but

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.109 
texturized and one that texture is but
smooth<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.780> radiant<00:02:00.930> skin<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:03.030> we

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
smooth and radiant skin I think that we

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.730 
smooth and radiant skin I think that we
are<00:02:03.149> always<00:02:03.479> trying<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.899> cover<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.380> instead

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
are always trying to cover it up instead

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.350 
are always trying to cover it up instead
of<00:02:04.799> allowing<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> heal<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.329> its<00:02:06.360> own<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:08.360> I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
of allowing it to heal on its own so I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.089 
of allowing it to heal on its own so I
recommend<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.170> wearing<00:02:10.530> makeup<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
recommend not wearing makeup all the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.320 
recommend not wearing makeup all the
time<00:02:11.190> only<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.790> special<00:02:12.360> occasions

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
time only for special occasions

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.260 
time only for special occasions

lipstick whatever you know but the base
and<00:02:20.350> foundation<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:21.070> think<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.460> one<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
and foundation I think it's one of the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.010 
and foundation I think it's one of the
most<00:02:22.510> important<00:02:23.020> things<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:24.840> alleviate<00:02:25.840> in

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
most important things to alleviate in

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.070 
most important things to alleviate in
your<00:02:26.260> routine<00:02:26.680> every<00:02:27.010> day<00:02:27.600> because<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:29.050> is

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
your routine every day because it is

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
England obviously is some opposite side

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.920 
England obviously is some opposite side
but<00:03:35.820> just<00:03:36.820> put<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.000> little<00:03:37.209> lemon<00:03:37.450> juice<00:03:37.750> on

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
the Sun directly after you do it I

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.340 
the Sun directly after you do it I
recommend<00:03:42.580> doing<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:43.060> probably<00:03:43.360> an<00:03:43.989> hour

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
recommend doing it probably an hour

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.770 
recommend doing it probably an hour
before<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:44.890> go<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.070> sleep<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:46.330> can<00:03:46.510> leave<00:03:46.630> it

before you go to sleep you can leave it

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.449 
before you go to sleep you can leave it
on<00:03:46.870> or<00:03:47.080> you<00:03:47.140> can<00:03:47.290> just<00:03:47.440> wash<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.650> off<00:03:47.980> whatever

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.509 
on or you can just wash it off whatever
you<00:03:48.580> want<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.790> do<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.840> leave<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:54.310> just

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
you want to do I leave it on but it just

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.370 
you want to do I leave it on but it just
try<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.820> but<00:03:55.180> before<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.660> try<00:03:55.870> something<00:03:56.200> like

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
try it but before you try something like

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.420 
try it but before you try something like
that<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:56.800> make<00:03:56.950> sure<00:03:57.100> you're<00:03:57.280> not<00:03:57.340> allergic

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
that just make sure you're not allergic

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.030 
that just make sure you're not allergic
to<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.360> would<00:03:58.810> try<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.170> underneath<00:03:59.650> your

to it I would try it underneath your
chin<00:04:00.370> because<00:04:00.730> this<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.360> most<00:04:01.510> sensitive

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
chin because this is the most sensitive

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.070 
chin because this is the most sensitive
area<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.800> face<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:04.630> doesn't<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.050> that
