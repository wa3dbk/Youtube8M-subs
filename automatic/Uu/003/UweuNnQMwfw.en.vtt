00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
consideration now that the desert eagle

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
consideration now that the desert eagle
is<00:00:45.630> probably<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.770> go-to<00:00:47.100> sidearm<00:00:48.000> because

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
is probably the go-to sidearm because

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
is probably the go-to sidearm because

some people would disagree I think the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
some people would disagree I think the

m16a3

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.640 
m16a3
and<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.369> thinking<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> AEK<00:01:09.780> those<00:01:10.410> who

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and I'm thinking about the AEK those who

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
and I'm thinking about the AEK those who
are<00:01:10.710> weapons<00:01:10.920> available<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.760> everyone<00:01:12.030> even

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
are weapons available to everyone even

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
are weapons available to everyone even
though<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.960> they<00:01:13.110> were<00:01:13.380> largely<00:01:13.710> considered

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
though that they were largely considered

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
though that they were largely considered
the<00:01:14.340> best<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.030> battlefield<00:01:15.840> 4

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the best in battlefield 4

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
the best in battlefield 4
you<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> ACE<00:01:17.340> 23<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.270> available

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you have the ACE 23 which is available

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.720 
you have the ACE 23 which is available
to<00:01:18.930> everyone<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:19.560> could<00:01:19.680> argue<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
to everyone you could argue that that is

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.210 
to everyone you could argue that that is
possibly<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.630> best<00:01:21.750> assault<00:01:22.170> rifle<00:01:22.620> but<00:01:22.800> of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
possibly the best assault rifle but of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
possibly the best assault rifle but of
course<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.700> other<00:01:23.909> weapons<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.810> have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
course you have other weapons you have
as<00:01:25.260> i've<00:01:25.409> mentioned<00:01:25.440> already<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.640> bulldog

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
as i've mentioned already the bulldog

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.870 
as i've mentioned already the bulldog
that<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> eagle<00:01:28.560> those<00:01:29.340> sort<00:01:29.760> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that there's a eagle those sort of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.360 
that there's a eagle those sort of
powerful<00:01:30.360> weapons<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:31.370> possibly

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
powerful weapons are possibly

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.990 
powerful weapons are possibly
best-in-class<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.510> also<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.440> l85a2<00:01:35.430> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
best-in-class you also have the l85a2 of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.700 
best-in-class you also have the l85a2 of
course<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.750> premium<00:01:37.229> weapon<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.680> well

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
course that was a premium weapon as well

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
course that was a premium weapon as well
in<00:01:38.190> battlefield<00:01:38.670> 3<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.300> much

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
in battlefield 3 but it's a much

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.990 
in battlefield 3 but it's a much
different<00:01:39.650> weapon<00:01:40.650> had<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> much<00:01:41.340> lower<00:01:41.700> rate

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
different weapon had a much lower rate

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.780 
different weapon had a much lower rate
of<00:01:42.030> fire<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.750> lower<00:01:42.990> dps<00:01:43.710> damage<00:01:44.159> per<00:01:44.370> second

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
of fire much lower dps damage per second

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
of fire much lower dps damage per second
than<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.450> l85a2<00:01:46.440> does<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.490> battlefield<00:01:48.240> 4<00:01:48.590> so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
than the l85a2 does in battlefield 4 so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.899 
than the l85a2 does in battlefield 4 so
I<00:01:49.620> put<00:01:49.890> something<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.190> screen<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> little

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
I put something on screen now a little

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
I put something on screen now a little
graphic<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
graphic so we can actually see all the

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.910 
at everything
I<00:03:40.390> actually<00:03:40.570> think<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.200> excel<00:03:41.590> with<00:03:41.799> the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
I actually think to excel with the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.380 
I actually think to excel with the
Bulldog<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.459> takes<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.850> level<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.120> skill

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
Bulldog it takes a level of skill

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.360 
Bulldog it takes a level of skill
because<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.900> need<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.230> counteract<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:45.250> low

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
because you need to counteract the low

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.280 
because you need to counteract the low
magazine<00:03:45.910> count<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.750> amount<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.080> recoil

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
magazine count and the amount of recoil

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.259 
magazine count and the amount of recoil
with<00:03:47.620> increased<00:03:48.010> recoil<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.940> weapon

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
with increased recoil on that weapon

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.360 
with increased recoil on that weapon
there's<00:03:49.750> no<00:03:50.230> point<00:03:50.500> saying<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.040> Bulldog

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
there's no point saying that the Bulldog

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.979 
there's no point saying that the Bulldog
is<00:03:51.519> absolutely<00:03:52.000> fantastic<00:03:52.209> at<00:03:52.630> everything

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
is absolutely fantastic at everything

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.470 
is absolutely fantastic at everything
because<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.769> isn't<00:03:53.920> but<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.579> absolutely<00:03:54.790> kicks

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
because it isn't but it absolutely kicks

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.930 
because it isn't but it absolutely kicks
out<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.690> lot<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.170> damage<00:03:56.470> quickly<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.430> mean

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
out a lot of damage quickly I mean

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.120 
out a lot of damage quickly I mean
ultimately<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.780> has<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.320> same<00:03:59.500> damage<00:03:59.829> model

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
ultimately it has the same damage model

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.190 
ultimately it has the same damage model
as<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.340> scar-h<00:04:00.640> with<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.090> higher<00:04:01.450> rate<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.019> fire

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
as the scar-h with a higher rate of fire

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.560 
as the scar-h with a higher rate of fire
so<00:04:02.799> he's<00:04:03.130> going<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.640> be<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.820> powerful<00:04:04.239> weapon

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
so he's going to be a powerful weapon

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.690 
so he's going to be a powerful weapon
and<00:04:05.230> if<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.590> start<00:04:05.890> hitting<00:04:06.220> people<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.640> the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
and if you start hitting people in the

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.790 
and if you start hitting people in the
head<00:04:06.790> with<00:04:07.360> that<00:04:07.510> assault<00:04:07.900> rifle<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.440> drop

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
head with that assault rifle you drop

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.860 
head with that assault rifle you drop
them<00:04:09.010> double<00:04:09.400> quick<00:04:09.700> there<00:04:10.300> is<00:04:10.420> no<00:04:10.599> doubt

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
them double quick there is no doubt

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.600 
them double quick there is no doubt
about<00:04:11.050> that

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
about that

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.490 
about that
now<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.570> course<00:04:12.630> it's<00:04:12.930> also<00:04:13.110> worth<00:04:13.470> mentioning

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
now of course it's also worth mentioning

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.759 
now of course it's also worth mentioning
that<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.610> really<00:04:15.540> good<00:04:15.780> player<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.350> can<00:04:16.620> give

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
that a really good player you can give

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.229 
that a really good player you can give
them<00:04:16.920> any<00:04:17.070> weapon<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.459> could<00:04:17.670> pick<00:04:17.910> out<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
them any weapon you could pick out the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.699 
them any weapon you could pick out the
worst<00:04:18.510> weapon<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> game<00:04:19.170> and<00:04:19.440> they<00:04:19.560> will

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
worst weapon in the game and they will

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.039 
worst weapon in the game and they will
still<00:04:19.980> have<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> great<00:04:20.640> round<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.660> think

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
still have a great round but I think

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.170 
still have a great round but I think
that<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.320> average<00:04:22.740> player<00:04:23.070> or<00:04:23.340> newer<00:04:23.790> players

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
that the average player or newer players

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.300 
that the average player or newer players
to<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.630> game<00:04:24.660> those<00:04:25.560> are<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.860> people<00:04:26.040> that

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
to the game those are the people that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.070 
to the game those are the people that
really<00:04:26.550> benefit<00:04:27.210> from<00:04:27.240> playing<00:04:27.690> with<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
really benefit from playing with the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.290 
really benefit from playing with the
ace23<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.220> more<00:04:29.400> powerful<00:04:29.940> weapons

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
ace23 and the more powerful weapons

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.860 
ace23 and the more powerful weapons
because<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.530> them<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:32.210> really<00:04:33.210> good<00:04:33.360> weapon<00:04:33.720> can

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
because to them a really good weapon can

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.180 
because to them a really good weapon can
be<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> difference<00:04:34.350> between<00:04:34.410> winning<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.040> gun

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
be the difference between winning a gun

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.250 
be the difference between winning a gun
fire<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.580> not<00:04:35.760> it's<00:04:36.000> not<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.480> say<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.780> that's

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
fire and not it's not to say that that's

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.500 
fire and not it's not to say that that's
that<00:04:38.130> happens<00:04:38.520> for<00:04:38.730> all<00:04:38.850> players<00:04:39.150> but<00:04:39.480> a

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
that happens for all players but a

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.080 
that happens for all players but a
really<00:04:40.080> good<00:04:40.290> player<00:04:40.590> can<00:04:41.250> make<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.640> best<00:04:41.820> out

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
really good player can make the best out

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.140 
really good player can make the best out
of<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.450> less<00:04:43.050> below-average<00:04:43.920> weapon<00:04:44.820> shall<00:04:45.030> we

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
of a less below-average weapon shall we

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.990 
of a less below-average weapon shall we
say<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:46.350> what's<00:04:46.500> really<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:47.100> solution<00:04:47.370> here

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
say so what's really the solution here

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.390 
say so what's really the solution here
because<00:04:48.390> we<00:04:48.810> all<00:04:48.840> like<00:04:49.260> getting<00:04:49.680> these<00:04:49.800> DLC

I look forward to the weapons as much as
the<00:05:01.920> maps<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:02.520> think<00:05:02.730> a<00:05:02.820> lot<00:05:03.000> people<00:05:03.030> will

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
the maps and I think a lot people will

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.540 
the maps and I think a lot people will
feel<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.840> same<00:05:04.080> way<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:05.160> what<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
feel the same way so what is the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.730 
feel the same way so what is the
solution<00:05:05.850> here<00:05:06.060> because<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:06.900> must<00:05:07.140> admit<00:05:07.350> I

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
solution here because I must admit I

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.310 
solution here because I must admit I
don't<00:05:08.190> like<00:05:08.340> being<00:05:08.850> able<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.150> run<00:05:09.480> around<00:05:09.630> with

don't like being able to run around with

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
better weapons than people that have

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.590 
have sympathy for those people that will
say<00:05:16.650> look<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.130> bought<00:05:17.520> premium<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.120> bloody<00:05:18.419> well

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
say look I bought premium I bloody well

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.720 
say look I bought premium I bloody well
deserve<00:05:19.020> those<00:05:19.200> weapons<00:05:19.470> I'm<00:05:20.040> fair<00:05:20.310> enough<00:05:20.490> to

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
deserve those weapons I'm fair enough to

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.250 
deserve those weapons I'm fair enough to
you're<00:05:21.060> right<00:05:21.240> you've<00:05:21.419> bought<00:05:21.630> premium<00:05:22.140> and

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
you're right you've bought premium and

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.540 
you're right you've bought premium and
that's<00:05:22.380> just<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.680> way<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.980> world<00:05:23.280> the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
that's just the way of the world the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.820 
that's just the way of the world the
world<00:05:23.760> can<00:05:23.970> be<00:05:24.120> an<00:05:24.480> unfair<00:05:24.990> place<00:05:25.260> at<00:05:25.560> times

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
world can be an unfair place at times

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.680 
world can be an unfair place at times
but<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.550> think<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.850> solution<00:05:27.090> would<00:05:27.330> be<00:05:27.390> this

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
but I think the solution would be this

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.710 
but I think the solution would be this
to<00:05:28.560> have<00:05:28.770> premium<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.430> have<00:05:29.610> DLCs<00:05:30.180> but<00:05:30.540> do

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
to have premium and to have DLCs but do

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.260 
to have premium and to have DLCs but do
not<00:05:30.960> have<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.410> weapons<00:05:31.770> included<00:05:32.340> still<00:05:33.030> have

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
not have the weapons included still have

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.750 
not have the weapons included still have
the<00:05:33.450> weapons<00:05:33.780> released<00:05:34.260> when<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.100> DLCs<00:05:35.580> are

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
the weapons released when the DLCs are

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.040 
the weapons released when the DLCs are
released<00:05:36.060> but<00:05:36.540> have<00:05:36.660> those<00:05:36.840> weapons

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
released but have those weapons

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.560 
released but have those weapons
accessible<00:05:37.830> for<00:05:38.010> everyone<00:05:38.370> because<00:05:38.970> that<00:05:39.360> way

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
accessible for everyone because that way

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.270 
accessible for everyone because that way
you're<00:05:40.020> putting<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.320> bit<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.560> love<00:05:40.740> back<00:05:40.980> into

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
you're putting a bit of love back into

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.830 
you're putting a bit of love back into
the<00:05:41.370> community<00:05:41.850> you're<00:05:42.030> giving<00:05:42.360> everyone<00:05:42.600> the

the community you're giving everyone the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.420 
the community you're giving everyone the
same<00:05:43.110> weapons<00:05:43.530> because<00:05:43.710> you're<00:05:43.830> also<00:05:43.980> then

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430

the<00:05:56.010> Magnum<00:05:56.430> is<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.610> pretty<00:05:56.820> powerful<00:05:57.000> sight

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
the Magnum is a pretty powerful sight

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.409 
the Magnum is a pretty powerful sight

would<00:06:08.130> be<00:06:08.280> my<00:06:08.460> solution<00:06:08.820> you<00:06:09.479> pay<00:06:09.720> for<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:10.110> map

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
would be my solution you pay for the map

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.080 
would be my solution you pay for the map
packs<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:11.160> you<00:06:11.280> don't<00:06:11.550> pay<00:06:11.820> for<00:06:12.030> additional

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090

packs but you don't pay for additional
weapons<00:06:12.780> if<00:06:13.260> you<00:06:13.440> want<00:06:13.620> to<00:06:13.710> get<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:13.950> gold

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.800 
events that can all be for the premium
people<00:06:19.800> but<00:06:19.950> I<00:06:19.979> don't<00:06:20.280> like<00:06:20.850> the<00:06:21.210> idea<00:06:21.630> of

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
people but I don't like the idea of

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.810 
people but I don't like the idea of
premium<00:06:22.620> running<00:06:22.919> around<00:06:23.039> with

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820

potentially better weapons than those

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.280

that<00:06:26.490> perhaps<00:06:26.970> can't<00:06:27.360> afford<00:06:27.690> it<00:06:27.990> and<00:06:28.110> that's

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
that perhaps can't afford it and that's

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.400 
that perhaps can't afford it and that's
fair<00:06:28.710> not<00:06:28.860> everyone<00:06:29.250> can<00:06:29.400> afford<00:06:30.090> to<00:06:30.450> buy<00:06:30.720> as

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
to prioritize other things but you know

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.800 
to prioritize other things but you know
I<00:06:38.400> know<00:06:38.550> there<00:06:38.880> will<00:06:38.940> be<00:06:39.000> people<00:06:39.420> amongst<00:06:39.720> you

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
I know there will be people amongst you

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.790 
I know there will be people amongst you
in<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:39.990> comments<00:06:40.350> that<00:06:40.500> won't<00:06:40.680> be

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
in the comments that won't be

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.590 
in the comments that won't be
sympathetic<00:06:41.250> to<00:06:41.550> this<00:06:41.790> point<00:06:42.090> of<00:06:42.210> view<00:06:42.300> as<00:06:42.420> me

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
sympathetic to this point of view as me

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.840 
sympathetic to this point of view as me
but<00:06:42.810> that's<00:06:42.960> just<00:06:43.140> my<00:06:43.350> opinion<00:06:43.550> when<00:06:44.550> it<00:06:44.640> comes

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
but that's just my opinion when it comes

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.610 
but that's just my opinion when it comes
down<00:06:45.030> to<00:06:45.210> it<00:06:45.330> I<00:06:45.420> don't<00:06:45.450> think<00:06:45.990> that<00:06:46.170> this<00:06:46.350> would

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
down to it I don't think that this would

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.070 
down to it I don't think that this would
happen<00:06:46.890> because<00:06:47.370> it's<00:06:48.300> a<00:06:48.420> selling<00:06:48.750> point<00:06:48.990> for

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
happen because it's a selling point for

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.050 
happen because it's a selling point for
these<00:06:49.320> DLCs<00:06:49.890> and<00:06:50.040> I<00:06:50.070> have<00:06:50.310> these<00:06:50.550> weapons<00:06:50.730> in

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
these DLCs and I have these weapons in

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.460 
these DLCs and I have these weapons in
there<00:06:51.270> and<00:06:51.600> imagine<00:06:51.750> for<00:06:51.960> a<00:06:52.140> moment<00:06:52.230> you're
