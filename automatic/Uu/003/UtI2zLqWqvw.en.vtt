entire min well in my opinion they

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.870 
entire min well in my opinion they
haven't<00:03:53.090> practiced<00:03:53.359> lot<00:03:53.600> sure<00:03:54.100> either<00:03:55.100> sk<00:03:55.639> or

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
haven't practiced lot sure either sk or

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.180 
haven't practiced lot sure either sk or
my<00:03:56.299> am<00:03:56.420> they<00:03:56.690> haven't<00:03:56.870> practiced<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.500> lot<00:03:57.620> up<00:03:58.010> to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
my am they haven't practiced a lot up to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.009 
my am they haven't practiced a lot up to
this<00:03:58.310> event<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:58.910> when<00:03:59.090> it's<00:03:59.569> pretty<00:03:59.780> open

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
this event so when it's pretty open

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.440 
this event so when it's pretty open
match<00:04:00.200> as<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.739> see<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.519> think<00:04:01.609> mum<00:04:02.180> has

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
match as I see it but I think mum has

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.140 
match as I see it but I think mum has
the<00:04:02.599> upper<00:04:02.720> hand<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.519> being<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.730> better<00:04:04.880> team

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
the upper hand and being the better team

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.470 
the upper hand and being the better team
overall<00:04:05.420> I<00:04:05.480> think<00:04:05.690> at<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.079> moment<00:04:06.109> so<00:04:06.470> so

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
overall I think at the moment so so

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.660 
overall I think at the moment so so
members<00:04:08.480> good<00:04:08.959> going

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
members good going

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.920 
finals yeah we're right and we have the
same<00:04:16.600> matchup<00:04:16.840> as<00:04:17.230> yesterday<00:04:18.220> yeah<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.239> what

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
same matchup as yesterday yeah and what

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.479 
same matchup as yesterday yeah and what
do<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.049> think<00:04:20.260> they're<00:04:20.709> going<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.070> win<00:04:21.190> again

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.879 
do you think they're going to win again
I<00:04:21.730> think<00:04:22.180> it's<00:04:22.330> healthy<00:04:22.510> time<00:04:22.960> chaos<00:04:23.560> reign<00:04:23.710> is

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
I think it's healthy time chaos reign is

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.320 
I think it's healthy time chaos reign is
so<00:04:24.100> strong<00:04:24.430> at<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.730> moment<00:04:24.760> they're

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
so strong at the moment they're

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.300 
so strong at the moment they're
traveling<00:04:25.720> right<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:26.080> fig<00:04:26.230> pit<00:04:26.440> lord<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:26.950> don't

traveling right in fig pit lord I don't

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.840 
traveling right in fig pit lord I don't
know<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.970> used<00:04:28.270> well<00:04:29.200> as<00:04:29.800> our<00:04:30.280> thoughts<00:04:30.639> about

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
know is used well as our thoughts about

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.090 
know is used well as our thoughts about
kids<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.300> this<00:04:31.480> they<00:04:32.020> don't<00:04:32.230> like<00:04:32.770> being

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
kids in this they don't like being

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.800 
kids in this they don't like being
pushed<00:04:33.340> they<00:04:33.580> don't<00:04:33.730> like<00:04:33.880> with<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.540> moment

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
pushed they don't like with the moment

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.629 
pushed they don't like with the moment
we<00:04:35.080> had<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.290> strategy<00:04:35.530> going<00:04:36.040> against<00:04:36.310> them<00:04:36.490> and

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
we had a strategy going against them and

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.820 
we had a strategy going against them and
we<00:04:36.790> wanted<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.330> try<00:04:37.600> to<00:04:37.690> push<00:04:37.960> an<00:04:38.200> insanely

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
we wanted to try to push an insanely

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.220 
we wanted to try to push an insanely
much<00:04:39.070> going<00:04:39.790> on<00:04:39.880> them<00:04:40.030> all<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.660> time<00:04:40.960> because

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
much going on them all the time because

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.620 
much going on them all the time because
they're<00:04:41.950> not<00:04:42.040> familiar<00:04:42.280> with<00:04:42.729> that<00:04:42.760> then<00:04:43.300> they

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
they're not familiar with that then they

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.740 
they're not familiar with that then they
push<00:04:44.169> two<00:04:44.320> other<00:04:44.440> teams<00:04:44.650> all<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.010> time<00:04:45.630> so<00:04:46.630> we

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
push two other teams all the time so we

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.480 
push two other teams all the time so we
wanted<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.020> try<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.260> throw<00:04:48.010> them<00:04:48.220> out<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.310> their

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
wanted to try to throw them out of their

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.250 
wanted to try to throw them out of their
game<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:48.940> if<00:04:49.450> move<00:04:49.690> does<00:04:49.900> something<00:04:50.229> like

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
game and if move does something like

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.590 
game and if move does something like
that<00:04:50.350> they<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.770> probably<00:04:51.040> win<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.190> game<00:04:51.340> but<00:04:52.150> I

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
that they can probably win a game but I

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.540 
that they can probably win a game but I
don't<00:04:53.169> think<00:04:53.290> but<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.979> don't<00:04:54.070> think<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
don't think but I don't think the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.420 
don't think but I don't think the

big<00:05:06.490> screen<00:05:06.790> behind<00:05:07.450> us<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:08.550> we<00:05:09.550> didn't<00:05:09.729> really

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
big screen behind us so we didn't really

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.879 
big screen behind us so we didn't really
lose<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.450> lot<00:05:10.570> of<00:05:10.600> noise<00:05:10.900> but<00:05:11.020> but<00:05:11.500> we<00:05:11.680> didn't

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889

you did the first part that minute one
or<00:05:15.700> something<00:05:16.060> like<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:17.140> audience<00:05:17.620> was

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
or something like that the audience was

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.190 
or something like that the audience was
taught<00:05:18.070> not<00:05:18.250> to<00:05:18.310> be<00:05:18.580> out<00:05:18.760> yeah<00:05:19.720> I'm<00:05:19.960> couldn't

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
taught not to be out yeah I'm couldn't

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.380 
taught not to be out yeah I'm couldn't
hear<00:05:20.500> yeah<00:05:21.010> but<00:05:21.160> it's<00:05:21.430> like<00:05:21.460> we<00:05:21.789> want<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.180> psych

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
hear yeah but it's like we want to psych

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.700 
hear yeah but it's like we want to psych
the<00:05:22.570> other<00:05:22.600> team<00:05:22.840> as<00:05:22.960> well<00:05:23.080> so<00:05:23.320> we<00:05:23.440> would<00:05:23.590> yell

the other team as well so we would yell

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.870 
the other team as well so we would yell
as<00:05:23.830> well<00:05:24.039> so<00:05:24.280> i<00:05:25.110> think<00:05:26.110> was<00:05:26.260> called<00:05:26.880> audience
