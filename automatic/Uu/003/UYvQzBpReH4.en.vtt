00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.860 

here's<00:00:02.190> one<00:00:02.429> way<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.760> doing<00:00:02.909> invisible<00:00:03.629> cast

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
here's one way of doing invisible cast

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.369 
here's one way of doing invisible cast
on<00:00:05.000> this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.180> provisional<00:00:06.750> cast<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.140> that

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
on this is a provisional cast on that

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.459 
on this is a provisional cast on that
can<00:00:07.589> be<00:00:07.770> later<00:00:08.189> undone<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.000> then<00:00:09.690> knit<00:00:09.960> off<00:00:10.170> of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
can be later undone and then knit off of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.039 
can be later undone and then knit off of
that<00:00:10.740> edge<00:00:11.090> from<00:00:13.700> so<00:00:14.700> if<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.880> knit<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.509> from

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
that edge from so if you knit up on from

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.790 
that edge from so if you knit up on from
that<00:00:16.170> cast<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.650> originally<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.609> later

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
that cast on originally you can later

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.920 
that cast on originally you can later
undo<00:00:19.800> easily<00:00:20.189> undo<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.670> then<00:00:21.060> knit<00:00:21.300> down

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
undo easily undo it and then knit down

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.279 
undo easily undo it and then knit down
from<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.930> start<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.890> cannot<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.460> yarn

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
from it so to start you cannot the yarn

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.870 
from it so to start you cannot the yarn
with<00:00:28.289> along<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:30.140> auxilary<00:00:31.140> yarn<00:00:31.880> that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
with along with auxilary yarn that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630 
with along with auxilary yarn that
you'll<00:00:33.450> later<00:00:34.020> take<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.340> here's<00:00:35.550> our

yarn and pick it up in front behind
behind<00:01:40.040> behind<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.430> keep<00:01:44.360> doing<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.780> and

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
behind behind so you keep doing that and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.650 
behind behind so you keep doing that and
then<00:01:45.470> when<00:01:45.620> it's<00:01:45.740> time<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:46.100> knit

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.720 

make<00:01:53.660> sure<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> auxilary<00:01:54.350> yarn<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:55.670> firmly<00:01:56.570> in

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
make sure the auxilary yarn is firmly in

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.870 
make sure the auxilary yarn is firmly in
place<00:01:58.730> and<00:01:58.850> not<00:01:59.300> flopping<00:02:00.050> about<00:02:00.170> somewhere

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
keep the working yarn in place and then

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.480 
keep the working yarn in place and then
just<00:02:10.820> begin<00:02:11.000> knitting

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:24.020 

you<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.240> also<00:02:16.390> do<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.840> with<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:21.540> cable<00:02:22.540> needle

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you can also do this with a cable needle

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.000 
you can also do this with a cable needle
instead<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.270> your<00:02:25.420> auxilary<00:02:25.810> yarn<00:02:26.200> use<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
instead of your auxilary yarn use the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.960 
instead of your auxilary yarn use the
cable<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.520> if<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.850> was<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.180> auxiliary<00:02:28.510> yarn
