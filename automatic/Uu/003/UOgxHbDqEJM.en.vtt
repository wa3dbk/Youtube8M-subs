00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
think the fact that we have 42 inch i

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.550 
think the fact that we have 42 inch i
will<00:02:18.820> send<00:02:18.970> fifty<00:02:19.270> three<00:02:19.480> percent<00:02:19.540> was<00:02:19.990> you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
will send fifty three percent was you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.810 
will send fifty three percent was you
