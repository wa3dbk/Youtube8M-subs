skilled<00:00:16.070> in<00:00:16.279> this<00:00:16.460> technique<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:17.480> advantage

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
skilled in this technique the advantage

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.159 
skilled in this technique the advantage
of<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.380> sleeve<00:00:18.619> procedure<00:00:19.099> is<00:00:19.400> that<00:00:20.020> we<00:00:21.020> do

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
of the sleeve procedure is that we do

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.100 
of the sleeve procedure is that we do
not<00:00:21.489> we<00:00:22.489> do<00:00:22.640> not<00:00:22.669> bypass<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.599> proximal

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
not we do not bypass the proximal

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.400 
not we do not bypass the proximal
intestine<00:00:24.650> or<00:00:24.739> the<00:00:24.890> stomach<00:00:25.779> so<00:00:26.779> we<00:00:26.930> create<00:00:27.230> a

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
intestine or the stomach so we create a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.630 
intestine or the stomach so we create a
narrow<00:00:27.770> pouch<00:00:28.340> of<00:00:28.669> stomach<00:00:29.829> by<00:00:30.829> removing<00:00:31.130> part

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
narrow pouch of stomach by removing part

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.760 
narrow pouch of stomach by removing part
of<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.910> stomach<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.989> now<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.200> stomach

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
of the stomach so now the stomach

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.770 
of the stomach so now the stomach
instead<00:00:33.950> of<00:00:34.220> being<00:00:34.399> a<00:00:34.489> big<00:00:34.670> elastic<00:00:35.180> bag<00:00:35.450> is

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
instead of being a big elastic bag is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.910 
instead of being a big elastic bag is
more<00:00:36.590> like<00:00:36.770> a<00:00:36.800> like<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.550> narrow<00:00:37.910> tube<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:38.920> the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
more like a like a narrow tube and the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.160 
more like a like a narrow tube and the
advantage<00:00:40.400> is<00:00:40.610> that<00:00:41.030> patients<00:00:41.480> eat<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.900> lot

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
advantage is that patients eat a lot

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.340 
advantage is that patients eat a lot
less<00:00:42.470> and<00:00:42.800> they<00:00:42.950> feel<00:00:43.160> satisfied<00:00:43.790> and<00:00:44.350> they're

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
less and they feel satisfied and they're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.740 
less and they feel satisfied and they're
not<00:00:45.500> hungry<00:00:45.920> another<00:00:46.490> big<00:00:46.700> advantage<00:00:46.730> is<00:00:47.420> when

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
not hungry another big advantage is when

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.160 
not hungry another big advantage is when
we<00:00:47.870> remove<00:00:48.170> part<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.680> stomach<00:00:48.920> with<00:00:49.670> that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
we remove part of the stomach with that

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.330 
we remove part of the stomach with that
certain<00:00:51.170> hormones<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:51.710> are<00:00:51.830> being<00:00:52.040> secreted

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
certain hormones that are being secreted

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.760 
certain hormones that are being secreted
from<00:00:52.580> that<00:00:52.940> part<00:00:53.270> especially<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.440> hormone

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
from that part especially the hormone

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.140 
from that part especially the hormone
Berlin<00:00:55.720> we<00:00:56.720> find<00:00:56.990> that<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.800> it's<00:00:58.730> reduced

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
Berlin we find that that it's reduced

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.420 
Berlin we find that that it's reduced
dramatically<00:00:59.990> so<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.920> first<00:01:01.130> feeling

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
dramatically so the first feeling

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.340 
dramatically so the first feeling
patients<00:01:01.970> feel<00:01:02.180> after<00:01:02.690> they've<00:01:02.840> had<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:03.020> sleeve
