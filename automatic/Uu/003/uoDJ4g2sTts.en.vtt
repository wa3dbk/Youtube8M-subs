00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
circulation
it<00:01:10.670> was<00:01:12.370> uncirculated<00:01:13.370> I<00:01:13.910> mean<00:01:14.180> when<00:01:14.300> I<00:01:14.330> got<00:01:14.510> it

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.790 
it was uncirculated I mean when I got it
but<00:01:16.210> all<00:01:17.210> these<00:01:17.450> bills<00:01:17.750> have<00:01:17.870> been<00:01:18.020> shredded

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
but all these bills have been shredded

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.440 
but all these bills have been shredded
by<00:01:18.980> the<00:01:19.420> Swiss<00:01:21.490> government<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.880> guess<00:01:23.120> and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
by the Swiss government I guess and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.930 
by the Swiss government I guess and
being<00:01:24.230> recycled<00:01:24.680> into<00:01:25.160> making<00:01:25.400> new<00:01:25.700> money

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
being recycled into making new money

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.640 
being recycled into making new money
perhaps<00:01:26.470> but<00:01:27.470> as<00:01:28.370> far<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:28.730> I<00:01:28.850> know<00:01:29.350> all<00:01:30.350> these

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
perhaps but as far as I know all these

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.360 
perhaps but as far as I know all these

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
so I got my hands on some there you go

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.820 
so I got my hands on some there you go
note<00:01:40.580> how<00:01:40.820> small<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:41.750> goes<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.130> like<00:01:43.780> 1/4

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
note how small it goes this is like 1/4

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:54.610 
note how small it goes this is like 1/4
