00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.799
 Hello YouTube for a first tutorial alone, though today 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.459
 explain it 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.209
 how he conflicts the four best your Kil 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.570
 be able to record 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.320
 sometimes with a music and a lot because 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.420
 many already 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.560
 Tutorials also drew the Rixos July conflict 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.279
 but not really to Rainer Pottgüter four music and movie 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.729
 and 10 formally immediately 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.910
 Etc 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.970
 to recommend asylum to me for continuous Bubikon fit for Paradise 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.300
 on 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.270
 at beginner friendly 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.290
 and 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.520
 here are certain 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.520
 it was put on the set all the specific command entered 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.960
 for where we are concrete 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.130
 because of his part many because I have to clear you area 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.150
 f1 brighter because hot 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.500
 and the l 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.620
 XP display ammunition and show links around that had hid Rapid 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.710
 with f2 like now the music and movie 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.549
 So dictate one 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.570
 is started because the graphics is much better 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.520
 f3 fictitious value designed differently 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.070
 the color of the colors and the text below the textures 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.780
 no longer so accurate 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.670
 With the FIA ​​you can let the love of the sun and 60 degrees turn once 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.960
 with f5 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.440
 you can do it all 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.969
 to see in Prison 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.350
 f6 you can in ZiB 2 s mode purely out zoom 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 at the 87 times turn to the top right 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.470
 at 11 9 you can see the youngest highs 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.820
 Although the Smoke Matsuura hide other effect 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.560
 FCK been 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.670
 So blur nature 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.890
 Of course that's especially good if Norbert Kilzer Poll is out 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.120
 Aiming at the distance 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.660
 then you no longer see the opponent because of the blur 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.970
 and finally with 11 12 now but the clock added 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.670
 Per cent people know that just like Timo Kunert 20 is recorded 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.290
 You can find the link to it down here 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.879
 Medis whole Pedone Olmert has 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.879
 for the one per Rata choral piece four folders 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.939
 and he finds her 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.999
 so if you download it and unpack for the one in advance 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.419
 one as playoffs the other is called Men 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.099
 In the play-off Soir there is a buffer to make the movie 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.449
 Conflict PDS 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.989
 Peter just 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.989
 Ingolf Titi four folders Lea's incident 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.139
 and then the other folder 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.430
 is a huge part of it is Nuri 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.909
 PaaS Conficker part 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.909
 iqpc also includes the choral pieces melon 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.109
 his strategy completely 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.619
 in the window mode 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.749
 So not only does not save you forget to forget about your trick 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.009
 do not give it 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.999
 a trick was enough for Kinky to hit the console with Steuer and Westerfeld in 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.619
 the search window 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.089
 Full Screen 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.889
 keep searching 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.219
 and set this value from zero to one then he started in Full Volz window 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.939
 in fullscreen 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.609
 I go heavily rusted those in the month 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.539
 with a striker in Kiel 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.129
 then I just go 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.609
 with the Court Theater he raised 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.079
 It is also important to note that many are wrong 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.210
 NZ have the best if they have the 5 4 One 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.869
 Specify timp 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.889
 in spite of her four much better and it was just nicer in it 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.529
 take 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:35.849
 if you do not succeed 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.260
 that's just out 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.609
 Skitch also here 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.300
 alarmingly equal to Modrow fair 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.259
 Promoter firm but normal 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.759
 is just as good 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.749
 all right 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.029
 comes next again to the preparation program that needed 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:53.699
 that would be the call of the air Colak 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.299
 the compressed 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.749
 after the video 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:57.979
 around 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.839
 around 60 percent so it's really worth it 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.679
 to download the 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.949
 is still Feten choir 7 kilowatt big so worth it 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.209
 the other program she needs to create the seal is german 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.079
 DAPD 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.529
 also a score 6 MB big easy download 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:15.439
 and good 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.439
 so 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.549
 if he is now 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.439
 has recorded 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.959
 like me 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.969
 in the print four folders from the next shot or 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.169
 if not 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.010
 in Tampere he is in Menden im 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.020
 by putting in it tremendously 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.180
 so 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.449
 every time in the engine masks protection 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.349
 There is a bulkhead 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.480
 So a ZEB 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.480
 CG but part 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.300
 one is easy and calls 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.379
 launched 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.779
 pulls in the first screenshot animals 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.080
 and Porsche 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.180
 I said before that you record in Bruno 20 that it is important 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.039
 to know 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.139
 in the Giacomo video 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.870
 foreign world 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.620
 Spreen Red too 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.020
 or 20 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.300
 and Konrad FS 2 120 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.999
 the problem arises 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.409
 is like on video 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.570
 which arises welschen 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.469
 and becomes the HUF IAV Kulik 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.490
 very easily 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.629
 then you go free Seffer sorry 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.710
 there are Lawrence Lessig in a blog 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.449
 depending on how you want to see save 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.089
 and he starts 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.419
 Well, say that at this point 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.279
 close that 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:33.930
 so 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.189
 Now I have a little tip 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.289
 if you are in Sony Vegas 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.400
 the percent 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.710
 edited and edges want 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.090
 the percent is actually pretty good at knowing 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.939
 and without consequences 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.339
 where have i seen his i 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.199
 Here's another example 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.849
 sure of that at the brief one that there is a little like blessing again 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:02.389
 SU 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.389
 here it is tweaks man at the keel 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.800
 left and right Schwaz are both 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.800
 that of course not so good though 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:13.319
 just go 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.740
 and ultimately switch to the video 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.999
 Luck are retained for that 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.659
 that's not him 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.020
 Luca sometimes just like that 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.020
 next 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:29.770
 I also have in Kleinzell 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.729
 at the race 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.159
 are quite good attitude 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.009
 further shared 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.009
 - Media 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.110
 Funk foul as before marriage 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.029
 and easy on presentation 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:47.089
 HD 7am 20 to 30p video with 6 Ann Betts 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.009
 the race is in HD 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.689
 but it is not 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:54.039
 recent 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.309
 Percent to make the workgroup 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:57.090
 I have 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.539
 enormously kind three minutes video 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.520
 20 MB 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.839
 in Haiti 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.580
 for not so good 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.629
 JOC 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.149
 "That was my first 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:08.419
 Tutorial 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.649
 but Nils is something like that 

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:14.020
 See you I hope you like sweetheart 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.460
