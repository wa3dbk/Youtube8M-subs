00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
doing it I think it's super fun I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.339 
doing it I think it's super fun I
believe<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> last<00:00:27.539> time<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.900> kind<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.140> stopped

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
believe the last time we kind of stopped

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.990 
believe the last time we kind of stopped
doing<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.730> actually

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
doing it for a little bit is actually

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.450 
doing it for a little bit is actually
because<00:00:30.420> our<00:00:30.929> barracks<00:00:31.439> were<00:00:31.619> upgrading<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
because our barracks were upgrading and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100 
because our barracks were upgrading and
it<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.940> pain<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> make<00:00:33.510> troops<00:00:33.840> but
