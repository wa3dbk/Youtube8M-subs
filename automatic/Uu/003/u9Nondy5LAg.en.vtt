don't really think about it so you just
eat<00:04:10.519> away<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:10.910> meanwhile<00:04:11.510> most<00:04:11.780> pesticides

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
eat away and meanwhile most pesticides

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.800 
eat away and meanwhile most pesticides
are<00:04:12.650> fat<00:04:13.010> soluble<00:04:13.489> they're<00:04:14.030> storing<00:04:14.510> inside

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
are fat soluble they're storing inside

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.900 
are fat soluble they're storing inside
your<00:04:15.470> fat<00:04:15.650> cells<00:04:15.980> for<00:04:16.220> long<00:04:16.370> periods<00:04:16.790> of<00:04:16.850> time

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
your fat cells for long periods of time

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.360 
your fat cells for long periods of time
in<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.750> end<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.530> know<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:18.889> was<00:04:19.160> pre-diabetic

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
in the end you know I was pre-diabetic

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.750 
in the end you know I was pre-diabetic
when<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.030> was<00:04:20.150> 26<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.989> didn't<00:04:21.560> I<00:04:21.829> know<00:04:22.160> now<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.520> had

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
when I was 26 I didn't I know now I had

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.400 
when I was 26 I didn't I know now I had
a<00:04:22.790> lot<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.150> do<00:04:23.270> with<00:04:23.360> pesticide<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.930> lot<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.350> do

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
a lot to do with pesticide a lot to do

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.900 
a lot to do with pesticide a lot to do
with<00:04:24.440> additives<00:04:24.979> and<00:04:25.070> preservatives<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.790> so

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
with additives and preservatives and so

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.730 
with additives and preservatives and so
on<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.120> so<00:04:26.270> forth<00:04:26.510> so<00:04:27.050> I'm<00:04:27.199> not<00:04:27.320> saying<00:04:27.650> that

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
on and so forth so I'm not saying that

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.379 
on and so forth so I'm not saying that
you<00:04:27.889> should<00:04:28.100> buy<00:04:28.250> everything<00:04:28.669> organic<00:04:28.820> but

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
you should buy everything organic but

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.860 
you should buy everything organic but
just<00:04:29.660> being<00:04:29.900> aware<00:04:30.260> of<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.889> toxic<00:04:31.580> load<00:04:31.940> that

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
just being aware of the toxic load that

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.719 
just being aware of the toxic load that
is<00:04:32.990> starting<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.350> accumulate<00:04:33.830> within<00:04:34.130> that

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
is starting to accumulate within that

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.370 
is starting to accumulate within that
leads<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.180> cancer<00:04:35.570> diabetes<00:04:35.840> heart<00:04:36.139> disease

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
leads to cancer diabetes heart disease

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.550 
leads to cancer diabetes heart disease
and<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:36.889> on<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.040> so<00:04:37.160> forth<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.550> going<00:04:38.030> organic

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
and so on and so forth so going organic

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.150 
and so on and so forth so going organic
automatically<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.710> start<00:04:39.919> to<00:04:40.010> eliminate

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
automatically you start to eliminate

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.700 
automatically you start to eliminate
that<00:04:40.570> healthier<00:04:41.570> what's<00:04:41.960> another<00:04:42.169> way<00:04:44.560> eat<00:04:45.560> it

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
that healthier what's another way eat it

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.940 
that healthier what's another way eat it
raw<00:04:45.910> absolutely<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.120> not<00:04:47.150> all<00:04:47.600> foods<00:04:48.530> should

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
raw absolutely so not all foods should
