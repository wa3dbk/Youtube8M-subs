00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.739
 years 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.930

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.860
 staff brigadier to the unglued 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 panela it takes an average of 20 to 30 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.509
 minutes and you can not stop fiddling 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.030
 not to burn our Brazil 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.430

 30 minutes have passed and look how it is 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.070

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.959

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.450
 played a little bit here let's mix it up 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:47.570
 It was disconnected already and personal 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:52.520
 Watch out for this after mixing Let's go 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.820
 play a little bit over the top 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.820
 Brigadeiro 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.900
 and we are putting here gradually the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.910
 until we finish our 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.670

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.170
 fire to evaporate the album here not here 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.950
 It's a tequila brigadeiro, you can not call 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.920
 Let's get the taste of tequila and then 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.750
 you do the test is if you find 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.940
 first time you did you think 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.460

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.100
 a little bit of the tequila I made the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.450
 amount I always use here but I 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.500
 I'm a little suspicious because I like 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.390

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.140

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.160
 led to the freezer for about a 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.590
 Hours in the freezer for us to hold 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.510
 That we can roll the brigadeiro 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.590

 It's cold to help take off. 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.440
 I wrapped up that the first is that it stays 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.440

 And you can play with your friends and 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.500
 make the brigadeiros call the house 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.210

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.920
 For them, tequila. 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.870
 but only for those over 18 and if you go 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.170
 to be arrested for child molestation 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:42.600
 You'll only see the ball show and now 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.600
 Let's prove this wonder. 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.740
 the people already playing would 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.960
 Just kidding 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.729
 o the following very good sensational 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.229
 now let's just consider it here 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:14.270
 the brigadier tequila is every one of them goes 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.460
 depend on the taste you want is kind 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.960
 I do not know what the face of you is. 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.300
 I prefer to say it would be very strong and 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.720
 with strong and more or less if you just 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.370
 that essence then I put it here 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.099
 more or less two to three women of 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.870
 sound and mixing the very like to who 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.820
 you need only the finishing touch is felt 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.740
 well with both the brigadeiro and you 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.460
 feels not fight to the end to be 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.949
 here there 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.300
 Now I'm the protocol hacker . 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.139
 our very strong 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.110
 there you go there puts a 67 tablespoon of 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.490
 tequila but kept looking at the point of 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.919
 mass of the brigadeiro because she has to 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.320
 be consistent then you leave there not 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:54.080
 lets get stuck and left more or 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.330
 less hard will mix and then you 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.340
 let refrigerator screen stay consistent 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.669
 for you to mix how much the brigadier 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.169

 same time now different ex agent 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.400

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.630
