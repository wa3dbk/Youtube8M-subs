 would like to answer a few often 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.490
 asked questions the fact is that their 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.070
 come to me simply and answer them 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.509
 every day and this is basically the same type 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.700
 questions so i want to make this video 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.330
 so that finally with everything 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.380
 figure out and so my first name is Nina 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.609
 not bridge, but my nickname is him 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.710
 came up with herself 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.390
 what does it mean to me don't speak because 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.960
 what is a very personal next question 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.160
 this is my age I am 22 years old 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 I was born on January 11, 1992 like this 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.320
 here is the third where i live i was born in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.969
 city ​​of Evpatoria Crimea 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 at that time it was Ukraine now 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.190
 this is Russia for some time I lived in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.010
 Nizhny Novgorod then I lived in Kiev 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.870
 where I met my husband afterwards 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.480
 we moved back to evpatoria 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 where we live now, but we still plan 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.989
 return to cues 4 question yes yes I am 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.590
 married for a year in marriage and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 so 5 question is my hair 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.030
 the fact is that there are two camps 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.220
 some people who say that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.049
 oh what a beautiful hair what are you with 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 do them so that they become so want 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.600
 your poor planer themselves 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.759
 you know how their lifestyle because la la la la la la 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.100
 in general guys are poor here i am 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.100
 the fact is that if it were not for my skin color 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.540
 I would have thought that somewhere in my family 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.320
 there were people from the African continent but 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.890
 me really of rape if i'm not in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.430
 linen and I do not paint that here such 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.470
 the lengths they stand with me like that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.640
 due to the fact that they paint them weaken 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.219
 and I can already comb them more or less 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.140
 attach my head the way I follow them 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.799
 I take care I can make a separate video 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 so all the same many have asked and what can I 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.220
 say i don't hurt them all day long 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.129

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.640
 well groomed so the hair is not 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.700
 poor they are just very strange themselves 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.430
 by itself so stick out of not very difficult and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.280
 that is, just the same to lay and they 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.080
