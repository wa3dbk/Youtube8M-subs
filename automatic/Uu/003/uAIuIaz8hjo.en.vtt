from Tulsa bone and joining us here to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.950 
from Tulsa bone and joining us here to
tell<00:00:29.309> us<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.669> it's<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.509> got<00:00:30.660> its

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
tell us what it's about how it got its

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.259 
tell us what it's about how it got its

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
name and so on and so forth and I guess

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.079 
name and so on and so forth and I guess
we<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> start<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.019> what<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.159> weight

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
we can start with that what is weight

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:37.759 
we can start with that what is weight
lifter<00:00:36.390> shoulder<00:00:36.750> shoulder<00:00:37.079> well

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
lifter shoulder shoulder well

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.130 
lifter shoulder shoulder well
historically<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.850> did<00:00:39.120> get<00:00:39.329> its<00:00:39.510> name<00:00:39.600> from

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
historically it did get its name from

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.040 
historically it did get its name from
weight<00:00:40.409> lifters<00:00:41.120> because<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.540> we're<00:00:42.690> talking

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
weight lifters because and we're talking

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319 
weight lifters because and we're talking
about<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.829> necessarily<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> competitive

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
about not necessarily a competitive

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.979 
about not necessarily a competitive
bodybuilder<00:00:45.479> but<00:00:46.229> someone<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.159> is<00:00:47.909> a

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
bodybuilder but someone that is a

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.110 
bodybuilder but someone that is a
routine<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.710> gym<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.219> they'd<00:00:50.789> come<00:00:51.090> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
routine in the gym and they'd come in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479 
routine in the gym and they'd come in
with<00:00:51.480> shoulder<00:00:51.930> pain<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.320> typically<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
with shoulder pain and typically it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299 
with shoulder pain and typically it
would<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> very<00:00:54.960> top<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.829> shoulder

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
would be on the very top of the shoulder

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.900 
would be on the very top of the shoulder
okay<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.219> got<00:00:59.399> its<00:00:59.640> name<00:00:59.730> because

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
okay and and so it got its name because

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.079 
okay and and so it got its name because
then<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.079> course<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.000> examination<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
then in the course of the examination of

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.960 
then in the course of the examination of
the<00:01:03.149> patient<00:01:03.800> x-rays<00:01:04.800> many<00:01:05.160> times<00:01:05.489> we'll<00:01:05.759> give

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the patient x-rays many times we'll give

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
the patient x-rays many times we'll give
it<00:01:06.090> away<00:01:06.179> the<00:01:06.390> problem<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.800> they're

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it away the problem because they're

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.450 
it away the problem because they're
developing<00:01:08.670> x-ray<00:01:09.390> changes<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.830> bone<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
developing x-ray changes in the bone and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
developing x-ray changes in the bone and
the<00:01:11.580> bone<00:01:11.729> we're<00:01:12.060> talking<00:01:12.539> about<00:01:12.660> is<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.530> very

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the bone we're talking about is the very

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.820 
the bone we're talking about is the very
end<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.399> collarbone<00:01:15.119> near<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> shoulder

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
end of the collarbone near the shoulder

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.449 
end of the collarbone near the shoulder
cap<00:01:17.130> bone<00:01:17.429> so<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.179> not<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> break<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.950> strain

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
cap bone so it's not a break or a strain

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.600 
cap bone so it's not a break or a strain
it's<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.239> of<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.539> swelling<00:01:22.259> or<00:01:22.610> they

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it's just kind of is a swelling or they

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.029 
it's just kind of is a swelling or they
can<00:01:23.819> have<00:01:23.849> swelling<00:01:24.450> okay<00:01:24.899> actually<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.800> may

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
can have swelling okay actually they may

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.580 
can have swelling okay actually they may
actually<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.580> micro<00:01:27.420> fractures<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:28.349> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
actually have micro fractures there and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.040 
actually have micro fractures there and
that<00:01:29.099> can<00:01:29.369> lead<00:01:29.580> in<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.270> problem<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.899> the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
that can lead in to the problem with the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.449 
that can lead in to the problem with the
bone<00:01:32.000> necrosis<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.989> we<00:01:34.170> call<00:01:34.410> osteo<00:01:34.920> lysis

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
bone necrosis what we call osteo lysis

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.729 
bone necrosis what we call osteo lysis
or<00:01:35.610> osteonecrosis<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.899> those<00:01:37.349> are<00:01:37.500> fancy

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:37.739 
or osteonecrosis but those are fancy

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.710 
or osteonecrosis but those are fancy
words<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.369> mean<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.550> bone<00:01:38.910> can<00:01:39.209> get<00:01:39.420> rough

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
words that mean the bone can get rough

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960 
words that mean the bone can get rough
but<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.289> can<00:01:40.410> even<00:01:40.649> get<00:01:40.830> soft<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.819> very

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but it can even get soft but it's very

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.449 
but it can even get soft but it's very
painful<00:01:42.569> in<00:01:42.660> that<00:01:42.840> particular<00:01:43.470> region<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.369> I

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
painful in that particular region and I

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.339 
painful in that particular region and I
know<00:01:44.520> we've<00:01:45.000> talked<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.420> tennis<00:01:45.810> elbow<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.349 
know we've talked about tennis elbow and

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:47.990 
know we've talked about tennis elbow and
other<00:01:46.440> things<00:01:46.739> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.069> show<00:01:47.250> before<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:47.849> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
other things on the show before with the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.820 
other things on the show before with the
doctors<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.509> Tulsa<00:01:48.690> bone<00:01:48.989> and<00:01:49.140> joint<00:01:49.349> and<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
doctors at Tulsa bone and joint and I

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.199 
doctors at Tulsa bone and joint and I
imagine<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.550> get<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.789> other<00:01:50.910> ways

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
imagine you can get at other ways

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.479 
imagine you can get at other ways
besides<00:01:51.420> lifting<00:01:52.050> weights<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.220> can

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.489 
besides lifting weights actually you can

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.760 
besides lifting weights actually you can
we<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> people<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.989> construction

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
we see it in people that construction

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.930 
we see it in people that construction
workers<00:01:56.280> who<00:01:56.489> may<00:01:56.729> use<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:56.940> jackhammer<00:01:58.099> just<00:01:59.099> an

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
workers who may use a jackhammer just an

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.419 
workers who may use a jackhammer just an
individual<00:02:00.660> who<00:02:00.840> may<00:02:01.050> use<00:02:01.289> his<00:02:01.530> shoulders<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
individual who may use his shoulders in

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.949 
individual who may use his shoulders in
an<00:02:02.550> outstretched<00:02:03.030> overhead<00:02:03.690> manner

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
an outstretched overhead manner

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.499 
an outstretched overhead manner
repetitively<00:02:04.709> so<00:02:05.369> yes<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.819> don't<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.300> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
repetitively so yes you don't have to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.199 
repetitively so yes you don't have to
necessarily<00:02:06.720> be<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.200> weightlifter<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.759> develop

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
necessarily be a weightlifter to develop

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.720 
necessarily be a weightlifter to develop
this<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.780> basically<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.440> causes<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this so basically what causes is is that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.570 
this so basically what causes is is that
upward<00:02:12.150> motion<00:02:12.629> with<00:02:13.290> with<00:02:13.800> weight<00:02:14.040> bearing

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
upward motion with with weight bearing

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.460 
upward motion with with weight bearing
on<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.879> shoulder<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.840> stretching<00:02:16.349> your

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
on your shoulder and out stretching your

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.770 
on your shoulder and out stretching your
arms<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.950> basically<00:02:17.250> what<00:02:17.519> causes<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.300> it

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
arms is that basically what causes it it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
arms is that basically what causes it it
does<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.629> sometimes<00:02:22.099> individuals<00:02:23.099> will<00:02:23.250> go

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
does and sometimes individuals will go

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.940 
does and sometimes individuals will go
too<00:02:23.489> far<00:02:24.060> with<00:02:24.720> weight<00:02:25.020> lifting<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.770> that's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
too far with weight lifting and that's

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.860 
too far with weight lifting and that's
in<00:02:26.190> part<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> treatment<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:27.570> try<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
in part of the treatment that we try to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.610 
in part of the treatment that we try to
get<00:02:28.650> them<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.010> change<00:02:29.040> some

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
get them to change some

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.410 
get them to change some
their<00:02:29.769> techniques<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.519> they<00:02:30.549> don't<00:02:30.849> rub<00:02:31.150> that

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
their techniques so they don't rub that

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.930 
their techniques so they don't rub that
area<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.170> inflamed<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:33.549> are<00:02:33.670> some

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
area and get it inflamed what are some

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.699 
area and get it inflamed what are some
of<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.420> mentioned<00:02:34.629> treatment<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.650> know

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
of you mentioned treatment I know

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.110 
of you mentioned treatment I know
there's<00:02:36.099> different<00:02:36.489> ways<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.909> go<00:02:37.000> about

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
there's different ways you can go about

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.509 
there's different ways you can go about
it<00:02:37.269> depending<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.959> severity<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.680> a

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
it depending on the severity of a

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.550 
it depending on the severity of a
person's<00:02:40.000> injury<00:02:40.390> take<00:02:40.870> me<00:02:41.019> through<00:02:41.260> what<00:02:41.290> you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
person's injury take me through what you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.320 
person's injury take me through what you
guys<00:02:41.769> would<00:02:42.099> do<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.340> diagnose<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.209> then

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
guys would do to diagnose that and then

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.720 
guys would do to diagnose that and then
go<00:02:43.510> from<00:02:43.659> there<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:44.680> we<00:02:45.220> certainly<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.700> take

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
go from there we we certainly will take

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.119 
go from there we we certainly will take
the<00:02:46.030> history<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:47.049> how<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.349> came<00:02:47.590> about<00:02:47.769> we'll

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
the history and how it came about we'll

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.339 
the history and how it came about we'll
do<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> physical<00:02:48.579> examination<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.989> will<00:02:50.140> take

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
do a physical examination we will take

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.699 
do a physical examination we will take
x-rays<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.400> x-rays<00:02:51.430> may<00:02:52.180> not<00:02:52.840> look<00:02:53.140> too<00:02:53.409> bad

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
x-rays the x-rays may not look too bad

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.580 
x-rays the x-rays may not look too bad
so<00:02:54.579> we're<00:02:55.239> going<00:02:55.329> to<00:02:55.420> start<00:02:56.230> off<00:02:56.379> with

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
so we're going to start off with

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.350 
so we're going to start off with
conservative<00:02:57.280> treatment<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:58.000> would<00:02:58.150> be

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
conservative treatment that would be

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.860 
conservative treatment that would be
resting<00:02:58.659> it<00:02:59.019> icing<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:01.269> need<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.569> try<00:03:01.810> to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
resting it icing it we need to try to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.170 
resting it icing it we need to try to
back<00:03:02.140> off<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.680> some<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.190> exercises<00:03:03.730> and

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
back off on some of the exercises and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.869 
back off on some of the exercises and
techniques<00:03:04.959> they're<00:03:05.500> doing<00:03:05.829> in<00:03:06.069> part<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
techniques they're doing in part of the

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.119 
techniques they're doing in part of the
history<00:03:07.239> we<00:03:07.480> want<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.780> know<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.440> techniques

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
history we want to know what techniques

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.190 
history we want to know what techniques
they're<00:03:09.370> doing<00:03:09.970> such<00:03:10.209> as<00:03:10.359> their<00:03:10.540> bench<00:03:10.810> press

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
they're doing such as their bench press

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.979 
they're doing such as their bench press
or<00:03:11.440> flies<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.220> things<00:03:12.250> if<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.060> change<00:03:13.690> a

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
or flies and things if we can change a

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.920 
or flies and things if we can change a
little<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.890> technique<00:03:15.640> many<00:03:16.329> times<00:03:16.690> it

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
little of that technique many times it

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.069 
little of that technique many times it
will<00:03:17.079> help<00:03:17.489> usually<00:03:18.780> symptomatically<00:03:19.780> what

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
will help usually symptomatically what

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.569 
will help usually symptomatically what
does<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.290> feel<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.590> when<00:03:20.980> they<00:03:21.129> come<00:03:21.159> in

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
does it feel like when they come in

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.970 
does it feel like when they come in
someone<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.120> has<00:03:22.359> this<00:03:22.720> whether<00:03:23.620> it's<00:03:23.859> a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
someone that has this whether it's a

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.649 
someone that has this whether it's a
minor<00:03:24.280> pain<00:03:24.760> or<00:03:25.030> whether<00:03:25.209> it's<00:03:25.450> something

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
minor pain or whether it's something

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.000 
minor pain or whether it's something
that<00:03:25.900> they've<00:03:26.049> had<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.530> while<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.769> know

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
that they've had for a while I know

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.319 
that they've had for a while I know
sometimes<00:03:27.250> they<00:03:27.519> may<00:03:27.609> think<00:03:27.760> well<00:03:28.000> maybe<00:03:28.239> I

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
sometimes they may think well maybe I

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.390 
sometimes they may think well maybe I
pulled<00:03:29.019> my<00:03:29.140> rotator<00:03:29.560> cuff<00:03:29.650> or<00:03:30.040> maybe<00:03:30.190> I've

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
pulled my rotator cuff or maybe I've

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.559 
pulled my rotator cuff or maybe I've
injured<00:03:30.700> my<00:03:30.730> collarbone

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
injured my collarbone

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.780 
injured my collarbone
what<00:03:31.810> are<00:03:31.930> those<00:03:32.019> feelings<00:03:32.609> typically<00:03:33.609> the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
what are those feelings typically the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.089 
what are those feelings typically the
feelings<00:03:34.269> are<00:03:34.419> on<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:35.019> top<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.650> shoulder

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
feelings are on the top of the shoulder

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.409 
feelings are on the top of the shoulder
point<00:03:37.000> tender<00:03:37.980> they<00:03:38.980> may<00:03:39.250> not<00:03:39.790> have<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.269> much

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
point tender they may not have so much

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.960 
point tender they may not have so much
pain<00:03:40.810> at<00:03:41.049> rest<00:03:41.590> they<00:03:42.069> will<00:03:42.250> tend<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.579> have<00:03:42.819> it

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
pain at rest they will tend to have it

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.589 
pain at rest they will tend to have it
at<00:03:43.090> activity<00:03:43.780> interestingly<00:03:44.590> enough<00:03:45.599> very

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
at activity interestingly enough very

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.750 
at activity interestingly enough very
consistently<00:03:47.590> they<00:03:47.950> will<00:03:48.099> have<00:03:48.280> pain<00:03:48.549> when

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
consistently they will have pain when

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.180 
consistently they will have pain when
they<00:03:48.910> lie<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.510> side<00:03:50.079> that's<00:03:50.709> almost<00:03:51.010> a

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
they lie on that side that's almost a

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.849 
they lie on that side that's almost a
giveaway<00:03:51.840> certain<00:03:52.840> movements<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
giveaway certain movements of the

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.550 
giveaway certain movements of the
shoulder<00:03:54.430> may<00:03:55.090> cause<00:03:55.389> pain<00:03:55.780> there<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:56.410> they

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
shoulder may cause pain there so they

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.949 
shoulder may cause pain there so they
don't<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.400> be<00:03:57.579> lifting<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.329> heavy<00:03:58.540> weight

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
don't have to be lifting a heavy weight

those<00:04:04.349> problems<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.739> we<00:04:06.669> look<00:04:06.910> at<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.239> range

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
those problems so we look at the range

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.930 
those problems so we look at the range
of<00:04:07.660> motion<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.319> in<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:09.099> position<00:04:09.639> of<00:04:09.790> the
