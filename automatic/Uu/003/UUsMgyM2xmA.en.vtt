00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.280
 it's crazy I 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.309
 6 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.309
 vincent 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.779
 Furthermore 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.919
 20 August 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.619
 the return was robbed his ten years you announced a match won 3 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.270
 and as to accompany me since the two players were with me I was 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.270
 at the stadium dassa 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.220
 so 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.830
 in Sweden the player we see more and more rarely in France since my 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.660
 Mom, I'm going to leave without embarrassment 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.110
 e I will ask your first impression already so far in France 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 how how did your presentation go 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.210
 I was happy to come back it was a long time since I had not 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.060
 returned to the country and 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.060
 I found plenty of things that were missing 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.150
 especially of what ate 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
 but now I could play again a little bit 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280
 with French if it was a lot of time 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.460
 basket the pleasure of anyway a fairly homogeneous group map that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.610
 began 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.380
 haas turned in on warcraft 3 kids - his stooge I guess I'm going 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.150
 communicate by internet to see them in it is always a pleasure 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.820
 extra water is usually 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.500
 flight available in French 3d 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.320
 because of 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.770
 of the difference of two hours and all that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.960
 we are not connected to the same time alone 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.360
 and finally finally without sacrifice 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.170
 and so for a cnp insurance is it a while now in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.610
 a moment now that you started her hostesses to what you 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.160
 can me 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.410
 do not talk a little bit about your background 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.450
 barragiste the vast majority of internet matches that is taking shape so 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.670
 had a lot of theleme and that's not too bad and I lost 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.420
 only match so this eden scene 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.799
 so who took you point of the coup so it allows annecy to start the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.050
 round for first place went to second 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.220
 Yes, but 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.770
 it does not bother me as much as an agreement with its qualities - sas 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.840
 it's going to be good 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 so sada allowed to be present now 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.300
 by take away falls first match by a rocket yes and so there we end up 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.170
 in the grand finale of the middle of the milan ac is it's stupid against you tiko 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.459
 and stone are your impressions what psychosis do not know if you've followed a little 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.279
 its performance because it's still a fairly young choice that has shown 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.829
 that he had a lot of talent do you think that 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.019
 ben ali put the way it's not bad but me 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.449
 I played twice 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.549
 twice a previous blade recently a slight win without too much 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.819
 mental problems 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.649
 I find that there is a problem with a level difference between him and me 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.349
 it's my job to play while the facts are more or less 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.549
 half time 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.869
 to shoot according to you the huge seats 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.279
 baa would have a gap of which is still 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.439
 so that's good it obviously holidays 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.049
 for cantor china and europe which is still a level that is not 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.049
 no more here is my soul 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.369
 find 6 6 th for different competitions 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:00.740
 car 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.659
 how was the rest for the moment 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.870
 what we have with regard to her nose she's size I spent a lot of 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.959
 matches it's only one match in beauty what I won two games 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.479
 of chickens from c1 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.709
 nothing more a scientist is found that we will have at the level of both hands 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.060
 all fai makes your choice 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.060
 what we are going to see right after her the match that will start 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.549
 Ah yes 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.879
 we will start on 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.399
 it is true that it is clear that it 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:30.389
 awa when i took up so will reclaim that be introduced for the first but li 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.730
 echoed those passes then there last year in acetate valley 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.349
 this is the third part 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.409
 So you left with his blood rather confident voice for this match 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.309
 It will bleed 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.240
 My past 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.569
 I know that if the day 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.949
 to the best of my abilities in the heat should win 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.119
 rather easily 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.639
 this is the difficulty of russia always played 100% I was asked 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.489
 this talent is 6% and for this type of game in eemea how do you have tg not a 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.149
 game in lead length strategy is always developing sas always 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:00.949
 topical 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.169
 besides a fast counter during sales 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.499
 when I played just now for the problem to throw 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:06.659
 the cps 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.839
 I did a lot of armies I'm focused on making a big army 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.020
 won May 4 to 5 as agree so we're still in exhaustion 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.189
 for the opponent and prevent 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.620
 3- actual resources andalusia differences with the macro more or less 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.040
 here is what makes the difference 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.790
 against 20 the level difference because there I go that training 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.819
 classical 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:28.219
 stone puget revenue and units 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.239
 quÃ©bec is in any case very grateful for his intervention at 

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:34.239
 quillan found himself in the party and got passionate offered a nice show 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 I think about Quebec transportation 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.720
 5 you 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.310
