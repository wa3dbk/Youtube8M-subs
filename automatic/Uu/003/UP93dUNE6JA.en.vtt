00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:41.020 

same<00:01:29.229> again

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.160 

what's<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.120> max<00:01:42.300> number<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.600> minutes<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:43.020> can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
what's the max number of minutes we can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:54.740 
what's the max number of minutes we can
put<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.440> YouTube<00:01:44.240> there's<00:01:45.240> no<00:01:45.390> max<00:01:53.570> well<00:01:54.570> each

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
put on YouTube there's no max well each

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.390 
put on YouTube there's no max well each
match<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> less<00:01:55.290> than<00:01:55.410> 15<00:01:55.800> minutes<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:56.220> guess

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400
