00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.990
 video of daxas 2 where I will explain 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.500
 how to improve the weapon with the warrior 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 taint 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 and I think it's important to explain this 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.900
 before continuing with our adventure 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.240
 especially for people who have not 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.880
 played to give their previous 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.619
 well we are in the forest of 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.960
 fallen giants and this is the merchant 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.369
 that we will meet and which will 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.879
 sell a key that will allow us 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.560
 access the macula blacksmith who 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.970
 black flame 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.630
 This blacksmith is going to raise the gun 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.610
 using titan and you're 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.350
 We will raise the weapon and thus 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.020
 let's greatly increase our damage 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.470
 good as you see the key of denigration is 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.210
 opens the smithy of de nigris de macula 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.000
 It only costs to look more so I recommend 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.960
 to complete it as soon as possible as 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 I do here here okay then good 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.580
 then another I'm here on scale and 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.300
 I'm going to talk to this gentleman who is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.300
 here sitting 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.740
 good as you can see is a blacksmith who 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.140
 you need a key 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.750
 to open his smithy then he has 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.610
 open the key with I have opened the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.250
 door with the key that I bought the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.290
 merchant and step we find in this 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.530
 chest an object that can be very 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.369
 Useful in the short arch of this short arch 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.369
 It also serves to 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.730
 it is useful in our adventure 2 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.370
 good the blacksmith tells us to come back 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:56.270
 later and that we have to do or 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:01.580
 let's go teleported to another site 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.300
 we come back and here he is working hard 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.300
 we talk to him again 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.870
 well let's see what we can do with 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.870
 this challenge apart from talking 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.879
 we can buy objects and different 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.450
 weapons that fit our life and 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.370
 we can also buy you as you see here 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.379
 fragments of titanic and dust 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.540
 repair that restores the duration of 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.329
 our team 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.930
 good here the weapons that you have to look at 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.569
 the statistics with which they scale 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.459
 and if you do not have a good weapon that comes out 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.040
 how are the statistics of compress 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.829
 to the blacksmith then here are the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.920
 reinforcements that is what interests us 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:06.840
 as you see the reinforcement increases more or 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.329
 less 10% of the damage and to reinforce if 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.310
 you see we need a fragment of 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.139
 titan and this is to raise the gun 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.299
 plus one then to upload it plus two 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:19.139
 we will need two fragments of titan and 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.870
 is and to raise the weapon to more 33 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.329
 fragments of titan and is and then already if 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.250
 we want to continue raising the weapon to 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.389
 we will need another type of 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.030
 material that is titan and is large and 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:36.090
 that would be more 6 from masisa 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.500
 plus 9 are the pieces of titan and is and 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.570
 for rather it's the titan slab and it 's 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.100
 good as I do not have money I 'm going love 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.520
 to 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.560
 to get some money or souls 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.330
 rather, it is the money to give your 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.270
 two and I already come with these souls and with a 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.200
 fragment of ti tanito so you can see 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.420
 as 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.209
 how to raise the weapon 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.250
 good to repair the weapon this is when it 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.660
 it breaks us, it's worth it if you do not notice the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.420
 bonfire 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.390
 then we use the titanic fragment 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.420
 and the 440 souls and we already have 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.250
 the cramped booster to one is very 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.410
 important to improve the weapons whenever 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.190
 we can as we increase our damage and 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.750
 It will make the adventure much easier 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.680
 Y 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:34.190
 and well here you see as this club 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.670
 scale tail with strength and that's why 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:42.200
 they have blue that added damage that is very 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.880
 high 115 67 and you see that he puts the club 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.180
 plus one because we have improved it more 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.180
 single 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.479
 and well and here you have also power 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.550
 reinforce the armors with which 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.649
 they will improve a lot but like neither 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.559
 we have fragments to edit and it's 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:04.210
 I recommend that infinite 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:06.099
 armor are the best when I'm 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.949
 sure you're wearing good armor 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.399
 As you see the blacksmith only sells us 10 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:14.310
 remove and you're and well here because I'm 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.320
 going around the menu 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.870
 and I just wanted to show you again that the 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.210
 blacksmiths selling fragments of 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.940
 titanic and not infinite as in giving their 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.360
 1 so choose well the weapon that your 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.100
 vice then nothing guys this has been all 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.790
 I hope you have been helpful this 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.540
 video and I say goodbye to you a greeting 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.540
 and see you later 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.680
 Y
