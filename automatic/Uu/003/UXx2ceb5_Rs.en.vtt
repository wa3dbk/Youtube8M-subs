when I first bought it I didn't know

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
when I first bought it I didn't know
that<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.480> thought<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.260> funny

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that I just thought it was so funny

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
that I just thought it was so funny
looking<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> needed<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
looking so I needed to get it for the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000 
looking so I needed to get it for the
top<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.570> pillows<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.739> really

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
top of my pillows so it's not really

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.170 
top of my pillows so it's not really
meant<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> top<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:56.879> pillows

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
meant to go on the top of your pillows

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.639 
meant to go on the top of your pillows
but<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.840> she's<00:00:58.020> really<00:00:58.170> cute<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
but I think she's really cute and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
but I think she's really cute and
festive<00:00:58.800> she's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.460> snow<00:00:59.789> girl<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
festive she's a little snow girl and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.590 
festive she's a little snow girl and
then<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> matching<00:01:01.770> pillow<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.600> like

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.179 
then I got the matching pillow and like
I<00:01:03.719> said<00:01:03.930> these<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.110> from<00:01:04.379> last<00:01:04.619> year<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.010> last

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189

of requests to do like an in-depth tour
of<00:04:11.239> my<00:04:11.450> bookshelves<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.530> think<00:04:12.799> I'm

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
of my bookshelves so I think I'm

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.320 
of my bookshelves so I think I'm
actually<00:04:13.100> going<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.549> do<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:13.850> maybe<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.239> a

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
actually going to do that maybe in a

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.940 
actually going to do that maybe in a
vlogmas<00:04:14.570> video<00:04:15.049> because<00:04:15.320> it's<00:04:15.470> like<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.830> know

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
vlogmas video because it's like you know

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.740 
vlogmas video because it's like you know
it's<00:04:16.430> definitely<00:04:16.850> for<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.150> channel<00:04:17.570> because

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
it's definitely for this channel because

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.900 
it's definitely for this channel because
it's<00:04:17.900> kind<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.169> glitter<00:04:18.470> themed<00:04:19.010> so<00:04:19.640> maybe

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
it's kind of glitter themed so maybe

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.490 
it's kind of glitter themed so maybe
that<00:04:20.090> would<00:04:20.209> be<00:04:20.299> my<00:04:20.419> next<00:04:20.479> video<00:04:20.930> or<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.260> next

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
that would be my next video or the next

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.280 
that would be my next video or the next
one<00:04:21.680> in<00:04:21.890> my<00:04:22.010> bathroom<00:04:22.190> Ivy's<00:04:22.910> Chris

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.340 
is a little bit creepy looking because
she<00:05:03.400> doesn't<00:05:03.580> have<00:05:03.730> a<00:05:03.880> head<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:05.050> literally

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
she doesn't have a head so it literally

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.010 
she doesn't have a head so it literally
looks<00:05:05.770> like<00:05:05.920> she's<00:05:06.310> headless<00:05:06.850> which<00:05:07.180> you<00:05:07.870> know

she's<00:05:08.230> always<00:05:08.440> headless<00:05:09.070> but<00:05:09.370> at<00:05:09.790> least<00:05:09.970> she

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
she's always headless but at least she

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.120
