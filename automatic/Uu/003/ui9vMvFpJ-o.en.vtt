of the functionalities of this case it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.039 
of the functionalities of this case it
might<00:02:26.459> be<00:02:26.519> worth<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.810> do<00:02:28.019> have

this little nub that hangs off the edge

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.970 
this little nub that hangs off the edge
and<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.390> because<00:02:30.720> there<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> hinge

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and that is because there is a hinge

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
and that is because there is a hinge
here<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:33.150> smart<00:02:33.269> case<00:02:33.540> which<00:02:33.720> allows<00:02:33.989> the

keep it in landscape mode and then you

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.039

lay that down on its back you can use it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.569 
lay that down on its back you can use it
to<00:03:15.420> maybe<00:03:15.870> type<00:03:16.349> up<00:03:16.560> something<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.069> personally

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
to maybe type up something I personally

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.970 
to maybe type up something I personally
don't<00:03:17.819> prefer<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.269> angle<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:19.169> this<00:03:19.470> sits<00:03:19.799> at

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
don't prefer the angle that this sits at

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.099 
don't prefer the angle that this sits at
for<00:03:20.220> typing<00:03:20.579> but<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.000> could<00:03:21.449> be<00:03:21.629> useful<00:03:21.840> for

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
for typing but it could be useful for

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.650 
for typing but it could be useful for
you<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.160> that's<00:03:23.699> just<00:03:23.879> my<00:03:24.000> opinion<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.510> course

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
you and that's just my opinion of course

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.869 
you and that's just my opinion of course
but<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.199> don't<00:03:25.769> really<00:03:26.099> think<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.579> the

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
but I don't really think that the

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.089 
but I don't really think that the
functionality<00:03:27.389> that<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.959> iPad<00:03:28.440> smart<00:03:28.889> case

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
functionality that the iPad smart case

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.670 
functionality that the iPad smart case
gives<00:03:30.030> your<00:03:30.239> device<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.019> worth<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
gives your device is really worth the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.280 
gives your device is really worth the
$80<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.609> course<00:03:32.879> you<00:03:33.510> know<00:03:33.629> this<00:03:33.959> isn't

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
$80 but of course you know this isn't

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.949 
$80 but of course you know this isn't
anything<00:03:34.799> unusual<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:35.970> Apple<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.480> overcharge

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
you're into that then I definitely think

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.690 
you're into that then I definitely think
this<00:04:25.889> is<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.099> good<00:04:26.430> buy<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:26.729> for

this is a good buy but for

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.340 
this is a good buy but for
