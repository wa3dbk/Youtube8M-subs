00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.720
 Welcome to 31 and how's the week 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.669
 This week, I'll show you how to scratch a lot of files comfortably unnoticed 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.169
 For example, I have three parties here on my desktop relative 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.389
 have strange files 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.580
 Novartis that this part of the intestine only pity that they numbered by 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:20.349
 become 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.329
 because you have to do it manually 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.460
 that of course relatively complex as soon as there are many files 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.929
 but with Mac OS x there is a program 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.949
 That's what Automator calls automating these processes 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510
 if we're up here on the settlement 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.720
 that comes when moving in 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.250
 in this environment 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.250
 because so easy machine over 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.200
 fall under the victims 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.380
 she immediately introduces the program automaton 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.380
 that was the double 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.680
 now here you have Martha a template for the workflow 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.120
 to go 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.260
 in this case, it is a service 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.190
 when the stray is down on 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.880
 choose 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.390
 then captured her life 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
 Actions that organize libraries 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.170
 we absolutely want 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 So just for the kidnapped 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.880
 and for a long time only two entries possible 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 rename an object and pdf documents above 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.120
 we are dealing with files and folders and these are small objects 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.680
 So put this entry with the mouse in the window 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.000
 and let 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 into the skid automator 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.000
 the copying of the objects can be created 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.810
 so you get the originals unchanged 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.659
 that would not be the case in this case 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:51.690
 So we say 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.690
 Do not add 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.770
 Now we always have to say 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.820
 that the machine should not work on text 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.150
 and thus files and folders 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.730
 just open 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.730
 and select files and folders here 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.960
 then our little one should do that 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.070
 are not available in every program but have been falling 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.649
 So limits like that too 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.469
 now the automaton became 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.439
 to reduce the selected folders and files accordingly as every year 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.839
 to adjust 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.759
 since we might want something different every time we always want that 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.019
 rename 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.549
 we would like to 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.620
 that this dialog is displayed each time before a file is renamed 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.559
 that makes you the options too 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:42.899
 then you can tick this action when running the workflow 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.299
 Show 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.559
 in principle that's all 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.409
 it could still save with this action 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.229
 filing 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.529
 for sure 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.009
 Now we can award a title 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.399
 now the end is over 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.569
 for sure 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.569
 We can now finish the Wars on the machine as well 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.480
 and every time we want to rename files or folders as off 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.480
 to mark them with the mouse no matter how many they are 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.579
 then we can right-click or one 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.869
 perform constructive 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.309
 Notes there is the services menu 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.199
 and there we have the entry created by us 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.519
 rename 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.529
 select with these 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.849
 when he asked how much these files would like to rename 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.589
 For example, I just want that 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.409
 Add sequential numbers 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.409
 with one the new arms 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.739
 photo 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.949
 and below you can see an example 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.409
 Photo - on 1 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.449
 Point x 6 x 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.529
 this x stands for the Thai, which of course remains 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.760
 but I do not want a hyphen in between but a space 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:03.639
 now 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.149
 before questions select 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.499
 already the files were renamed 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.129
 yes finally moved a bit 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.259
 Matthias is not bad 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.259
 like already on the crossbar a nice name 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.859
 the prayer different options we can be here 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.729
 for example, date has been add rest time 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.419
 separated 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.419
 with a hyphen 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.919
 first her departure month then meets 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.120
 use leading roles 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.930
 the example is good 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.949
 Continue 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.990
 in this way can too 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 at any time rename files folder comfortably also in bulk 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.649
 and that without you having to lay a separate program for it 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.900
 I hope this guy will like us this week Dr 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.849
 Steinman could
