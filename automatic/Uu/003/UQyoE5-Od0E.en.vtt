00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.699
 paintball with a man or thirty will 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.640
 being able 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.199
 when but a course of next 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 week or so but i have birzman about 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.220
 a few practical questions for skis 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.140
 there is actually a group there 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.730
 and so re-run santa is key to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 play so wars and so know and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 then all must have a beach 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.050
 historically correct 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 for example the may for me off 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 already there in our own new forms 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 play ryo yes they go like someone 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.260
 shot is that corpse 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.879
 may they do that for a long time 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.300
 stay because because who are the night 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.190
 war and also natural that get there 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.840
 desk and paint only for that is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 actually that is all very well 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.250
 good news because we are playing night 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 world war two after the allies 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.549
 against the Germans and I then play the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.659
 leader of the allies that is then 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.790
 montgomery 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 and then we also have the Germans want in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 start at the beginning, he has both 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.210
 instructions certainly one to go 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 explain yes and they were in high demand 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.610
 then that in English or in taxis 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 ah yes and how would there how would that 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.579
 for example, sound in German than was 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.150
 then had the muscles say yes 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.530
 the old man on the feeders then the man 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.100
 that lin thought that sounds really whole 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.860
 good 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 tell me after my headache that citin asthma 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.960
 and who then plays the baets of the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.180
 Germans 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 He can now also pass that he 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.780
 pulled all sorts of ski from you him 2 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.710
 seconds through the massy anyway all 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.729
 red one 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 yo hello yes yes it's here it for very 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.130
 rust and we are going offensive 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.810
 tour with my snow vista 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.579
 and we have another question and if 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.290
 Germans we like that terrain 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.350
 maturing me is possible 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.750
 we stand up and have a choice 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.489
 how was kitchen man run though 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 great grinder so that everything 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.260
 sucks away afterwards 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 well how do i learn i'm awake i got there 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.569
 no problems with that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.890
 yes so with the sugar 2000 baby that yes 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.440
 which you can do that are specially made 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.819
 for such things but when 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.380
 been his job i'm blistering 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.470
 my feet around those balls 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.150
 flat stamps and whatever we thought like 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.530
 we would succeed in having another one 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.370
 piece called a First World War 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.720
 take it 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.190
 my trenches but that is something 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.430
 digging would then be just one 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:43.980
 excavator on arches on a battery 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:46.019

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:55.319

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:57.269
 vehicle on site no how can you 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.050
 to be that my voice note 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.360

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.630

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.519
 thanks so kindly child did that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.650
 to suspect that those are the kings 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.920
 who, among other things, also knocked over 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.079
 have such stuff but that man is not participating 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.970
 You get in the field to get certain 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.540

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.079
 where care so no problem though 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.079
