 of instagram for our guests 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:09.610
 for these 12 elect we are going to make a 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.919
 mass I was saying that the dough 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.169
 had a particularity apart from the 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.519
 mass given that it's like we're going to 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.950
 moisten the flour 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.080
 with which we are going to start the flour with 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.810
 the juice or rather with the water of 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.940
 cooking a potato starch bat and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.460
 sugars incorporated well firm 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.500
 then something very important where 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.600
 cook the potato of course in a 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.370
 excellent pot until it was cooked 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.350
 a potato that we are going to incorporate the dough 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.910
 and the cooking liquid that also 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.800
 let's put it in the dough so you 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.680

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.300
 They are of high quality and that quality and 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.670
 that the heat be instructed in 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 homogeneous throughout the piece cooking 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.440
 all meals evenly 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.269

 experts the thick 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.850
 and what corresponds to me if it weighs 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.860
 when we are going to measure by kilos of flour 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.450
 4 zeros per kilo of flour 40 when you 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.380
 I 'm sending many to see if it has 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.820
 lost memory 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 750 very crazy 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.710
 with 750 but there is enough humidity 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.710
 well of 600 and of 550 to 600 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.310

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.240
 hot warm was our head of the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.040
 warm each spoke to the deceased thing 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.660
 that started the starch well in the water 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.660
 exactly every one of us 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.180
 then we are the next we are going to 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.610
 do the following on this side I'm going to 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.000
 discover the family the yeast that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.000
 newly 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.550
 let's do a little while before yeast 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.979
 50 cm 50 grams one teaspoon 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.100
 sugar a teaspoon of flour and a 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.560
 little bit so that it dissolves better for 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.850
 so to be born and to not undermine 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.709
 so that it is born so that it starts 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.620
 play we are going to good this here 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.740
 in to accelerate the processes 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.090
 fermented on the center and this what 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.830
 I'm going to add this liquid, I'm not going to 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.070
 deny everything little by little bit by bit 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.360
