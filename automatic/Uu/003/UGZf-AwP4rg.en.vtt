00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.339
 live without evening 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.870
 develop a story of beginning 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.870
 vocal power where she lets go 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.160
 a presence that is emerging more and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.720
 more and it's very important to her 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.460
 that's what will make him regain 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.400
 ground because precisely locally 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.020
 she has a very clear signature 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.340
 in fourth position with an average 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.340
 14.5 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.050
 after eight weeks of work Lorraine 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.520
 will have to push his limits 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 nominated she has to shine more than 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.820
 never at the bonus of tonight 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 will she manage to surpass herself for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 win his place in the semi-finals and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.230
 almost again disappointed almost his 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.230
 fair 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.270
 I go to other but final and I 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.350
 not want to leave before 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.050
 considering what you are able to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.489
 to do it is still only 70% 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.649
 and be careful because if we do not 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.670
 not push the queen tends to come back 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.530
 backward 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.020
 in the final it is that it multiplies by 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.119
 two all she has after all this 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.860
 that she managed to unveil 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.990
 and it's on one of his favorite tracks 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.580
 videogames that lauren not have to get 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.979
 beat for a place in the semifinals 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.450
 when a title like that that sticks to us 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.310
 good and that we feel good with 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.810
 we have every chance of winning this 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.039
 trophy she's really different from 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.450
 what I could sing from the beginning 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.640
 from the adventurous me I am very 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.500
 different from the beginning of the adventurous 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.670
 I was just that thanks to 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.939
 this evolution I am able to 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.939
 sing that moment 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 I realize in fact that I have my 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.130
 place on stage and for me it's more 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130
 important 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.120
 things not very proud 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.920
 I really want to fight I 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.660
 will give the maximum of emotions and the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.320
 maximum of me even I can not partians 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.320
 in such a good way 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.660
 not good in the interface that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.820
