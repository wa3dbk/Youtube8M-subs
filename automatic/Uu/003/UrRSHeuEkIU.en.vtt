00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 so you i love quite a lot of girls 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.980
 that somehow go bent over or yourself 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.000
 so pull the shoulders so forward 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.349
 hang your head 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 I do not know if they are getting smaller 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.670
 Wish or not but definitely 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.710
 but should be self-confident and straight 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.109
 and walk upright through the area and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.090
 That's why I'm showing you three today 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.510
 exercises for the upright walk because 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.890
 quite often the back of the body 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.019
 is forgotten and we start now 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.449
 bottom with the rear thighs 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 we're cruising now but not that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.660
 regular but cross-raise with almost 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.660
 straight legs 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.190
 I've got two for that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.399
 Dumbbells taken you imagine 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.800
 a little wider than shoulder width then then 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.079
 take care that your tiptoes 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.449
 so do not point outwards to the front 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.520
 or turn your knees inside 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 not during the exercise anyway 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.620
 Show inside and then you take the short 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.649
 act and bring it to your body 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.070
 then the back is tense and you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.080
 slowly go down and for the the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.580
 Beginners are also slow 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.840
 back up and for the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.840
 they can do it too 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.140
 exclusively I try time first and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.880
 while she can still say so 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 called in front of the body and goes now 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.320
 rather slow down that is with 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.270
 almost stretched legs bend the knee 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.180
 a little, and you're just so 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.820
 far down like your back here no 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.909
 humps up but is in there and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 then it is slow for the beginners 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.030
 back up and then you do yours 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 second repetition again only so far 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.659
 so the back is not here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.729
 Again, always make sure to pay attention 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.740
 with every movement and then for the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.110
 advanced explosive upward 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 pull shoulder back then have 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.270
 her cross with almost stretched 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 legs 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.820
 on we go the same with the second 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.320
 Exercise I wanted to briefly 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.719
 say deadlift so here we have it 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.630
 the back thighs and also the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.299
 lower back very heavily used 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.719
 and now we continue with that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.550
 Prevented wholesale rowing and for that 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960
 you always take two codes 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.760
 hand 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.260
 The weight is not that heavy 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.060
 first try on the technology 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.940
 pay attention and then I'll show you now 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.750
 from the side is approximately hip-width 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.730
 and you just leave the poor on the body 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.440
 they will not hang somehow 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.090
 angled or forward or forward 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.830
 First they stay behind 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.170
 hang on and then you go into the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.820
 pre-built position and I think this 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.980
 position this hold 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.110
 in this position down here in the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.810
 back already is in it is already on 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.760
 the lower back again and that before 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.520
 bent oars in total then goes 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.890
 on the middle back and on the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.180
 paint and now I start first and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.220
 show you what they are all about 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.170
 So pay attention to foot position 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.310
 shoulder width 10 peak time not to 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.820
 side but outwards 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.020
 you go dumb forward you leave 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.850
 hang and now you pull this trade 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.560
 as in so a right angle 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.390
 at the back of your hips 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.920
 that is, it really let's also 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.560
 fully hanging in front again 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.970
 and he does not pull up here that is 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.680
 I do not want somehow that somebody 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.770
 pulls his belly button here in front 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.220
 but really important you are pulling 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.350
 back to the hips and then let it go 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.180
 you also always keep in mind 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.150
 Turn your back on your power here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.670
 no hump but the back is in 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.940
 your body forms a horizontal 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.370
 line to the ground and you 're rowing again 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.920
 At the back of the hips you can like that 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.320
 also show it from scratch again 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 See what my elbows do 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.960
 Hip-width is here to follow you 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.900
 Front knees are not acting inward 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.030
 Leave at the side of the body and you 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.550
 row back to the hips 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.530
 that means the elbows are on the body 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.570
 as close as possible to it rowing 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.600
 not somewhere here on the side but you 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.800
 let go and be as tight as your body 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.420
 that allows brother animal past him like that 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.460
 then we have the second one 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.070
 We only get three in practice 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.740
 They welcome to the advanced since 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.020
 I stand for that relatively tight that 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.000
 means touching my feet you can 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.190
 but a bit further I stand 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.489
 you can find a very good one here 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.590
 position around then 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.180
 the pre-bent position to come to the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.550
 back is in there you could now 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.680
 put a glass on it, so to speak, and 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.460
 now you are doing the movement since then 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.479
 by her bringing the dumbbell upward 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.250
 and you at the highest point, so to speak, here 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.169
 pretend your hand is in a glass 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.000
 and you pour some water 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.280
 does not make front here and now 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.930
 not here but it is 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.909
 really here on the sides and you 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.750
 pour out expensive glass always pay attention 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.300
 on the back of it is for whom that is for 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.120
 the lower back is too exhausting 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.919
 he can do the same on his knees 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.550
 that is, a leg will fall 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.680
 brought forward 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.780
 the other knee is on the ground and 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.419
 you have that leg what's up front 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.090
 no matter which one so far ahead that you 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.080
 with the dumbbells under your knee 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.720
 get through and in this position 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.120
 exactly the same happens 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.229
 laterally high and the glass becomes 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.659
 poured out 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.000
 again it is not up here and 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:35.190
 not back here but it is 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.449
 really sideways so we handle three 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.310
 exercises for the upright gear for you 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.320
 makes me try at the last 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.139
 Exercises really very little weight 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.550
 to use if at all weight 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.889
 needs but maybe try it 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.990
 first with your poor that is 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.699
 sometimes enough and very much 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.430
 exhausting when you get it right 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.380
 the back shoulder is so concentrated on her 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.180
 Love subscribes to my channel and gives

 and if you want video 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.289
