00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
League and I'm already discussed that I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.660 
League and I'm already discussed that I
don't<00:01:31.350> really<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.829> gonna<00:01:31.979> happen<00:01:32.250> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
don't really think it's gonna happen but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.550 
don't really think it's gonna happen but
there<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.270> decent<00:01:33.930> chance<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.470> will

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
there is a decent chance that it will

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
there is a decent chance that it will
since<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.610> sixth<00:01:36.000> League<00:01:36.210> he's

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
since this is the sixth League he's

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.499 
since this is the sixth League he's
competing<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.790> his<00:01:38.790> Pokemon<00:01:39.210> looked

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
competing in and his Pokemon looked

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.289 
competing in and his Pokemon looked
pretty<00:01:39.810> good<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.159> point<00:01:41.610> anyways<00:01:42.060> but

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
pretty good at this point anyways but

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.510 
pretty good at this point anyways but
anyways<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> theory<00:01:43.430> towards<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
anyways back to the theory towards the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670 
anyways back to the theory towards the
end<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.329> group's<00:01:45.540> turning<00:01:45.930> Kalos<00:01:46.320> Serena

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
end of the group's turning Kalos Serena

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.310 
end of the group's turning Kalos Serena
will<00:01:46.829> obviously<00:01:47.220> start<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> feel<00:01:47.850> pressure

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
will obviously start to feel pressure

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
will obviously start to feel pressure
and<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> kind<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.740> pressure<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and that kind of pressure is like to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
and that kind of pressure is like to
tell<00:01:51.299> ash<00:01:51.479> how<00:01:51.780> she<00:01:51.840> feels<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.380> him<00:01:52.710> because

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
tell ash how she feels about him because

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
tell ash how she feels about him because
I<00:01:53.430> mean<00:01:53.700> by<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> time<00:01:54.720> ash<00:01:55.049> goes<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
I mean by the time ash goes back to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.190 
I mean by the time ash goes back to
canto<00:01:56.219> after<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> league<00:01:56.969> she<00:01:57.479> isn't<00:01:57.630> she<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
canto after the league she isn't she I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
canto after the league she isn't she I
mean<00:01:58.860> there's<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> good<00:01:59.250> chance<00:01:59.490> you'll<00:01:59.700> never

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
mean there's a good chance you'll never

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.700 
mean there's a good chance you'll never
see<00:02:00.119> him<00:02:00.240> again<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> highly<00:02:01.049> doubt<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
see him again so I highly doubt the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.249 
see him again so I highly doubt the
writers<00:02:02.100> would<00:02:02.340> deliberately<00:02:03.030> leave<00:02:03.810> Serena

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
writers would deliberately leave Serena

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.010 
writers would deliberately leave Serena
heartbroken<00:02:04.920> over<00:02:05.280> ash

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
heartbroken over ash

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.559 
heartbroken over ash
I<00:02:06.049> mean<00:02:06.320> not<00:02:06.469> that<00:02:06.530> ash<00:02:06.859> would<00:02:07.159> reject<00:02:08.000> her<00:02:08.239> but

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
I mean not that ash would reject her but

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.809 
I mean not that ash would reject her but
she<00:02:09.229> just<00:02:09.259> didn't<00:02:09.979> build<00:02:10.190> up<00:02:10.310> enough<00:02:10.550> courage

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
she just didn't build up enough courage

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.280 
she just didn't build up enough courage
to<00:02:11.860> tell<00:02:12.860> him<00:02:13.069> how<00:02:13.190> she<00:02:13.220> feels<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:15.050> she

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
to tell him how she feels and then she

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.869 
to tell him how she feels and then she
was<00:02:15.410> kind<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.650> left<00:02:15.800> heartbroken<00:02:16.129> because<00:02:16.550> she

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
was kind of left heartbroken because she

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.460 
was kind of left heartbroken because she
knows<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.300> she'll<00:02:17.480> probably<00:02:17.660> never<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:18.290> him

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
knows that she'll probably never see him

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.660 
knows that she'll probably never see him
again<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> doubt<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.459> they<00:02:19.550> would

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
again so I doubt that they would

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.640 
again so I doubt that they would
deliberately<00:02:20.300> leave<00:02:20.660> Serena<00:02:21.110> heartbroken

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
deliberately leave Serena heartbroken

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.559 
deliberately leave Serena heartbroken
because<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.430> know<00:02:22.549> she<00:02:22.610> spent<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.299> many<00:02:23.480> years

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
because you know she spent so many years

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.180 
because you know she spent so many years
without<00:02:23.989> him<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.470> still<00:02:24.680> had<00:02:24.799> a<00:02:24.830> huge<00:02:25.129> crush

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
without him and still had a huge crush

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.369 
without him and still had a huge crush
on<00:02:25.640> him<00:02:25.790> afterwards<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.660> mean<00:02:27.080> she<00:02:27.200> wouldn't

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
on him afterwards I mean she wouldn't

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.559 
on him afterwards I mean she wouldn't
move<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.799> so<00:02:28.160> easily<00:02:28.370> if<00:02:28.819> she<00:02:29.060> just<00:02:29.299> if<00:02:29.420> you

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
move on so easily if she just if you

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.390 
move on so easily if she just if you
just<00:02:29.810> left<00:02:30.049> her<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:31.010> mean<00:02:31.280> unless

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
just left her like that I mean unless

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.610 
just left her like that I mean unless

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.420 
ending and leaving serena heartbroken i
think<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.680> something<00:03:10.040> else<00:03:10.160> will<00:03:10.400> happen

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
think that something else will happen

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.160 
think that something else will happen
that<00:03:10.819> will<00:03:10.880> leave<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> more<00:03:11.269> positive<00:03:11.540> effect

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
that will leave a more positive effect

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.809 
that will leave a more positive effect
on<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.410> audience<00:03:12.440> we<00:03:13.010> can<00:03:13.160> tell<00:03:13.310> by<00:03:13.459> ashes

on the audience we can tell by ashes

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.250 
on the audience we can tell by ashes
personality<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.569> series<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:14.930> isn't

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
personality in the series that isn't

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.140 
personality in the series that isn't
really<00:03:15.470> good<00:03:15.739> with<00:03:15.920> love<00:03:16.250> or<00:03:16.489> romance<00:03:16.670> so

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
really good with love or romance so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.240 
really good with love or romance so
chances<00:03:17.540> are<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.750> if<00:03:18.139> Serena<00:03:18.680> confesses<00:03:19.220> to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
chances are that if Serena confesses to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.680 
chances are that if Serena confesses to
as<00:03:19.459> she<00:03:19.670> won't<00:03:19.850> really<00:03:20.000> understand<00:03:20.480> or<00:03:20.660> won't

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
as she won't really understand or won't

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.140 
as she won't really understand or won't
be<00:03:20.900> ready<00:03:21.109> for<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.319> serious<00:03:21.500> relationship<00:03:22.150> what

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
be ready for a serious relationship what

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.699 
be ready for a serious relationship what
I'm<00:03:23.239> thinking<00:03:23.569> is<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.720> Serena<00:03:24.170> may<00:03:24.410> not

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
I'm thinking is that Serena may not

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.229 
I'm thinking is that Serena may not
travel<00:03:25.040> fast<00:03:25.400> for<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.639> rest<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.880> his<00:03:26.000> journey

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.470 
he makes a promise with Serena should
Serena<00:03:30.709> confess<00:03:31.280> how<00:03:31.639> she<00:03:31.700> feels<00:03:32.060> about<00:03:32.180> him
