 hi friends from youtube this is the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:13.600
 top loading samsung washer 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:17.020
 model w to 10 vp is achieved in 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.130
 canary although it is a model of 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.579
 Thai manufacturing 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.600
 let's say that we are in Spain because if 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.110
 you will not find any 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.960
 top loading washing machine 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.329
 Here we have the power button 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.420
 and before giving the start pause we should 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.489
 choose the program although it appears as 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.100
 digital that would be an automatic in all 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.579
 the programs except lan to the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.339
 machine will detect the weight and so by 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.909
 half of that will put the water that 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.680
 require according to the weight of the clothes here 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.649
 we can see that the water level is 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.949
 off because they will already take care of 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:07.290
 select it according to the weight of the clothes 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:10.740
 here is the temperate we open 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 by the way the water intake I only 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.120
 I have it cold because I do not have a shot 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.790
 of hot water is to say the machine does not 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.130
 it heats the water so I can only 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.370
 wash cold since I have everything water 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 hot 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.740
 here the deposit to let me people 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.820
 inside this big bucket and in the part 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.450
 higher we find the taking of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 softener and here a small filter that 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.520
 each pair of washes must be cleaned 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.510
 because there they are collecting everything that 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 go releasing the wash 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.729
 if you have recommended me 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.670
 I have been recommended as a machine 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.159
 better than traditional loading 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.290
 frontal and of German origin we are going to 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.450
 try your luck to see how 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.110
 at first you only hear things 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.280
 positive we will see 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.280
 good show
