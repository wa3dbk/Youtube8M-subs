just came out to the ps3 and I don't
condone<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:01.550> glitch<00:01:01.790> because<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.150> kind<00:01:02.360> of

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
condone this glitch because it's kind of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.689 
condone this glitch because it's kind of
cheating<00:01:02.900> but<00:01:02.930> oh<00:01:03.440> well<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.070> by<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.489> way<00:01:04.670> I

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
cheating but oh well but by the way I

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.340 
cheating but oh well but by the way I
just<00:01:04.940> likes<00:01:05.059> I<00:01:05.239> don't<00:01:05.420> condone<00:01:05.540> it<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:06.200> that

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
second time but there's two downfalls to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.050 
second time but there's two downfalls to
this<00:01:08.840> glitch<00:01:09.080> one<00:01:09.410> I<00:01:09.770> guess<00:01:10.340> one<00:01:10.580> person<00:01:10.910> has

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
this glitch one I guess one person has

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.969 
this glitch one I guess one person has
to<00:01:11.240> be<00:01:11.330> alive<00:01:11.630> salted<00:01:12.320> zombies<00:01:12.619> go<00:01:12.740> after

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
to be alive salted zombies go after

to be alive salted zombies go after
someone<00:01:13.240> second<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:14.360> doesn't<00:01:14.780> work<00:01:14.869> on<00:01:15.080> dry

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350
