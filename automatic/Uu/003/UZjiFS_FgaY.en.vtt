between a laptop and a smartphone and of
course<00:03:46.850> we've<00:03:47.270> pondered<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:47.840> question<00:03:47.900> for

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
course we've pondered this question for

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.960 
course we've pondered this question for
years<00:03:48.770> as<00:03:48.950> well<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:50.690> bar<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:50.990> pretty<00:03:51.290> high<00:03:51.470> in

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
years as well the bar is pretty high in

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.699 
years as well the bar is pretty high in
order<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.180> really<00:03:53.390> create<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.900> new<00:03:54.110> category<00:03:54.320> of

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
order to really create a new category of

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.949 
order to really create a new category of
devices<00:03:55.220> those<00:03:55.970> devices<00:03:56.300> are<00:03:56.630> going<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.810> have
