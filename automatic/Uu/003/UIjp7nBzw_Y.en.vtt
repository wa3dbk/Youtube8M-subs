 electronic day at tn.com and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.239
 It caught my attention in particular 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.549
 this question because I feel very 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.609
 well identified with her this is how 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:09.000
 do the wavy hair curls if one 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.250
 does not have in the curling iron or the iron 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.319
 Actually then, I know that you 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.879
 you come here to the rescue and you're going to 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.669
 show how it's done there we're going to give 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.580
 answers is very simple the only thing that 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:24.200
 have to have is 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.460
 the fleet was a farm the size of the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.070
 plant because I know there are several sizes 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.810
 for that is not important for this not 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.570
 is important and the other thing that has to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:38.750
 have is easy aluminum foil 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:42.110
 that is essential to do this is very 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.960
 simple is simpler look up chase 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.210
 we have it ready here I 'm going to 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.550
 prepare some here is a system of 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.970
 they have bloated look 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.420
 the hair ring is left the nice 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.420
 fact 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 and we close it with the paper 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.600
 and there we leave it, let's do one more 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.170
 to be seen 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.000
 We take the hair we organize is very 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.060
 simple 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.120
 when it was perfect ringed is not 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.760
 necessary to put dominant crochet and the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.770
 fish the hair has to be dry dry or 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.890
 dry ok do not do it with hair 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.890
 wet 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.820
 there is again 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.250
 this works for people who have the 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.050
 hair a little wavy but who wants 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.700
 give it more shape as I look at you 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.860
 you better be important studying 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.350
 produces for any of the stones 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.000
 in the cheek well straight that well 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.950
 when they are not caught at all 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.830
 curls that say form I made the curlers 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.890
 at 10 minutes in my case with this they go 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.290
 to be all night combed ok 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.490
 well before and then these are now 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.490
 I will show you 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.689
 when we have it wrapped we apply 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.239
 The iron 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.309
 they see that a vapor comes out and goes through the 

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:06.309
 moisture that remains of the cable is normal 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.370
 well we mark it well now I see that what 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.020
 you open the irons social words like 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.230
 when you ask yourself what town what is going 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.360
 unless we try the metal 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.960
 here if I would check it, the paper required me 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.310
 although then what I'm doing is 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.460
 well it's squeezing it opening and 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.460
 closing 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.810
 for how long you have to do that 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.440
 it's a few seconds 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.479
 5 hours 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.169
 5 seconds 6 seconds 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.750
 ok with this is already finished you have to leave 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.650
 cool this side well as I already 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.169
 everything is done excellent of course 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:56.050

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.880
 you want to spray so that it lasts longer 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.550
 at night because you're going to dance 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.310
 you can sweat a little 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.290
 you can perfectly use it is but not 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.030
 it is necessary it is good to me I love it
