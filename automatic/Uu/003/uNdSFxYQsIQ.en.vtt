00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.100
 hello guys today I bring you a new video 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.600
 and good since the second he recorded today 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.280
 I've recorded the blocks tutorial 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.900
 commands the first part but good 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 like I will not be able to upload today 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.560
 well I wanted about a video so I've 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.710
 I was thinking and in the end I was 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.420
 happened a very good idea that would be me 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.740
 he had always wanted to put spawn 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 of sena rubber so that in fact that at 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.929
 final I did not finish it and I gave it to a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.180
 sub not so good so that what 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.089
 have him and start his channel well so 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.460
 and well, that's always been dear 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.440
 put spinners but of course that's 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.930
 download the two man items and more now 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.420
 with the new way to install mods that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.179
 good to many it costs them then 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.679
 well I was thinking the other day and I said 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:54.269
 Well now with the new command 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:56.159
 composed if we do so live motion 137 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.479
 they will give us a block of commands 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.909
 So if we want to create a 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.190
 zombie spammer we are going to do well not 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:07.460
 we do not really do that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.150
 we put it and we put schümann 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.150
 zombie 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.180
 ok we do so we see that it works 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.270
 we put in and yes because if not it is not going to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.300
 expose clear clear it's okay see 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.900
 now we see that it works 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.200
 so 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.270
 this as I would be right now 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.670
 I can copy any coordinate because 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.070
 basically I would not agree or this is to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.530
 see good let's do it to see me the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 I'll point it will sign up the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.340
 coordinates and we're going to do what it would be 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.710
 an exhibit that is continually 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 generating zombies is not worth it and we're going to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.180
 aim less 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.350
 9 paint the pen is that I forget 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.619
 always of the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:02:01.060
 coordinates are worth less 400 does not paint me 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:03.220
 to see here minus 452 56 539 voucher 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.690
 then what we would do would be because if 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.710
 no zombies are generated right in the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.299
 center of the block and they stay here 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:17.500
 bogado if it's not cool ok then we would 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:21.550
 so minus minus 452 space 56 and 539 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.170
 ok we give to done we do this and if it is 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.490
 plan since a zombie is worth we're going to 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.490
 make time set 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.579
 so then it's worth now 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.620
 we would have what this would be and we could 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.680
 go generating zombies like that in a way 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.269
 random way and if we will create more 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.069
 command blocks with more areas where 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.409
 Spawn as we could generate that 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.599
 randomly generate one and the other 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.650
 here it's good, well, here what we 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.510
 interesting is that it is done automatically 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.280
 this as the spaces that give us 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.689
 tumán items then what are we going to do 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.819
 it's going to be a kind of clock like that 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.079
 improvised what good if I get it wrong I 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.980
 I'm inventing it now the watch like this 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:01.010
 that if I get it wrong I'm sorry and good 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.459
 watch would be like that to see what you think is worth 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.459
 Let's see 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.080
 that is problem is worth then this 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.340
 It works like this 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.770
 there worth study would point here 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.120
 sorry so 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.120
 we put a shot here 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.950
 we put here this like this and what 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.880
 we put to see here like this and like that and 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.460
 we put the four tics to each 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.020
 every one of this would be like that if this 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.890
 here we are not interested in the truth now that 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.560
 I think it 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.620
 ok then it would not be not us 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.940
 giving the signal I'm sorry to see this is 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.180
 I would have supposed that I would have to 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.180
 be like that 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:05.069
 it's worth here so this here does not lie this 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.450
 yes it's worth the active then what we 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.469
 interesting is that not many 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.450
 because it would give us a like 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.069
 awesome then what are we going to 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.620
 do is going to be going to be the next thing what 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.000
 we will do this so we will put this here 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.829
 A) Yes 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.560
 always with tics because it's not what we 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.130
 interesting is that it is worth then to know 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.890
 where spam put the spam site 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.900
 I have not put here and we see good 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.080
 we could place more tics even for 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.350
 that this time to move the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.390
 we put it like this like that 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.600
 but if so 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.280
 here here it is and well the truth can 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.320
 take a lot but I see something 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.850
 quite useful considering that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.350
 the ever present as we have 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.480
 cost as if we said that of 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.190
 install the too many items good is 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.110
 a trola gives then we can 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.210
 generate this species as to expose 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.820
 for maps that good is a kind like 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.860
 of a clock that has a lot of delay or 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.650
 we see that it takes a long time to get there 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.480
 and the more we place the better and these 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.980
 are going to continue generating we see that if 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.890
 we remove this guide will generate another 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.990
 here when the signal comes you see it 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.330
 generated one and so it would go 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.220
 generating a spoiler is worth it and if we place 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.169
 here zombie because the zombie if we want 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.860
 do skeleton as we do well skeleton 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.849
 where 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.849
 to see what is generated 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.880
 It is worth and it is generated that a skeleton valley 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.530
 we could do it in skeletons or 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.750
 we could simply place in a row 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.750
 several command blocks here sumo 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.720
 zombie 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.720
 it is worth seeing that it is generated 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.310
 as I did not put coordinates then 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.500
 is going to be generated here because as 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.580
 we know if the block gives a signal to this 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.930
 will generate here but if we put 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.060
 coordinates on other sites would go 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.039
 generating worth and then doing this 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.250
 watch we would basically have what 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.840
 it would be a good zombie spoiler that is 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.580
 So we try, but if we do not 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.620
 interesting will start to put mods and 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.690
 rare things from tumán items to receive 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.060
 a spoiler then with this new command 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.470
 we can do it okay I hope you have 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.240
 liked the video and nothing that you give to 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.919
 like if you have any problem or we 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.990
 it works something you tell me and I already 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:19.490
 answer in the comments and nothing 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.490
 up other goodbye guys
