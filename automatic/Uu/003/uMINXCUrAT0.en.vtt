00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
case for and then go ahead and cut down

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
case for and then go ahead and cut down
to<00:01:31.229> size<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> cut<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to size and then you're going to cut the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.200 
to size and then you're going to cut the
sides<00:01:36.600> off<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> opens<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.090> know

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
sides off so that it opens up you know

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.200 
sides off so that it opens up you know
the<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.570> fringy<00:01:40.259> side<00:01:40.619> thing<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the little fringy side thing see so it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.640 
the little fringy side thing see so it
opens<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.079> both<00:01:43.229> sides

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.940 

and<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.840> opens<00:01:53.110> up<00:01:53.230> like<00:01:53.260> that<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.770> then

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
and so it opens up like that and then

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.330 
and so it opens up like that and then
now<00:01:54.160> go<00:01:54.400> ahead<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.850> cover<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.840> front<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.470> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:54.470 

you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.630 

okay<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.540> once<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.440> are<00:02:56.470> done<00:02:56.680> duct<00:02:57.370> taping

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
okay so once you are done duct taping

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.750 
okay so once you are done duct taping
both<00:02:57.970> sides<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:59.470> are<00:02:59.500> going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.370> have<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.640> make

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
both sides you are going to have to make

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.630 
both sides you are going to have to make
the<00:03:00.880> creases<00:03:01.240> so<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.540> will<00:03:01.660> shut<00:03:01.990> and<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:03.520> can

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
the creases so it will shut and you can

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.309 
the creases so it will shut and you can
just<00:03:03.790> put<00:03:03.940> tape<00:03:04.120> on<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.390> outside<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.990> shut<00:03:05.170> it

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
just put tape on the outside to shut it

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.260 
just put tape on the outside to shut it
or<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.280> do<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.490> I'm<00:03:06.580> doing<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:07.120> I'm

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
or you can do what I'm doing and I'm

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.960 
or you can do what I'm doing and I'm
doing<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.630> inside<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.260> outside<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
doing the inside and the outside so the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.080 
doing the inside and the outside so the
length<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.360> my<00:03:11.040> laptop<00:03:12.040> happens<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
length of my laptop happens to be the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.840 
length of my laptop happens to be the
length<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.690> board<00:03:14.020> itself<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.040> just<00:03:15.370> cut

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
length of the board itself so I just cut

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.540 
length of the board itself so I just cut
out<00:03:15.880> two<00:03:16.630> pieces<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.470> length<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.400> board

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
out two pieces the length of the board

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.930 
out two pieces the length of the board
they<00:03:18.880> don't<00:03:19.030> have<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.450> completely<00:03:19.709> even<00:03:20.940> on

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
they don't have to be completely even on

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.280 
they don't have to be completely even on
the<00:03:22.120> edges<00:03:22.480> because<00:03:22.930> they're<00:03:23.050> going<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.230> be

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
the edges because they're going to be

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.830 
the edges because they're going to be
hidden<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.739> what<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.550> do<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:25.300> make<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.540> as<00:03:25.600> easy

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
hidden and what I do to make it as easy

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.400 
hidden and what I do to make it as easy
as<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.140> just<00:03:26.440> fold<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.070> up<00:03:27.160> half<00:03:27.459> way<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:29.140> I'm

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
as I just fold it up half way like I'm

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.979 
as I just fold it up half way like I'm
doing<00:03:29.860> right<00:03:29.980> here<00:03:30.130> as<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.610> can<00:03:30.760> see<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.209> then

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
doing right here as you can see and then

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.520 
doing right here as you can see and then
I<00:03:32.230> stick<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.550> side<00:03:34.209> that's<00:03:35.019> being<00:03:35.260> taped

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
I stick the side that's being taped

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.580 
I stick the side that's being taped
underneath<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.989> then<00:03:37.989> press<00:03:38.230> down<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.560> tape

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
underneath and then press down the tape

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.140 
underneath and then press down the tape
soon<00:03:41.590> as<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.769> get<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:42.010> all<00:03:42.130> even<00:03:42.489> I'll<00:03:42.910> press

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
soon as I get it all even I'll press

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.640 
soon as I get it all even I'll press
down<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.510> tape<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:48.510> then<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.630> fold<00:03:50.019> over<00:03:50.380> the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
down the tape and then I fold over the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.059 
down the tape and then I fold over the
other<00:03:50.830> half<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:53.050> connect<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.709> the

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
other half and I connect that to the

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.360 
other half and I connect that to the
piece<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:54.459> do<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.880> both<00:03:55.060> sides<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:56.370> it

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
piece so do that on both sides and it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.789 
piece so do that on both sides and it
may<00:03:57.610> be<00:03:57.670> hard<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.329> is<00:03:58.810> kind<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.079> hard<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.410> get<00:03:59.680> it

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
may be hard it is kind of hard to get it

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.680 
may be hard it is kind of hard to get it
to<00:03:59.829> go<00:04:00.610> in<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.060> you're<00:04:01.150> gonna<00:04:01.269> have<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.570> little

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
to go in and you're gonna have a little

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.080 
to go in and you're gonna have a little
sticky<00:04:02.200> showing<00:04:02.769> still<00:04:03.100> but<00:04:03.670> that's<00:04:03.760> okay

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
sticky showing still but that's okay

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.280 
sticky showing still but that's okay
because<00:04:04.120> we're<00:04:04.480> going<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.810> put<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> piece<00:04:05.170> on

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
because we're going to put a piece on

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:14.610 
because we're going to put a piece on
the<00:04:05.380> outside<00:04:05.739> as<00:04:05.890> well

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:26.810 

you

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:40.570 

you

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.670 

okay<00:04:41.580> now<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:42.030> will<00:04:42.690> have<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.200> insides

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
okay now that you will have the insides

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.280 
okay now that you will have the insides
done<00:04:43.950> um<00:04:44.190> cut<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.270> pieces<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.900> length<00:04:46.110> the

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
done um cut to pieces the length the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.190 
done um cut to pieces the length the
board<00:04:46.500> again<00:04:46.740> while<00:04:47.670> I<00:04:47.910> am<00:04:48.450> whatever<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
board again while I am whatever the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.100 
board again while I am whatever the
length<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.650> your<00:04:49.920> outside<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:51.690> I'm<00:04:51.810> doing

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
length of your outside is so I'm doing

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.090 
length of your outside is so I'm doing
that<00:04:52.200> again<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:53.810> then<00:04:54.810> we're<00:04:55.410> going<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.920> put

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
that again and then we're going to put

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.240 
that again and then we're going to put
the<00:04:56.250> duct<00:04:56.460> tape<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.090> outside<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:58.250> this

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
the duct tape on the outside and this

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.310 
the duct tape on the outside and this
one's<00:04:59.460> will<00:04:59.640> I<00:05:00.000> do<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.510> about<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.840> same<00:05:01.050> as<00:05:01.290> I

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
one's will I do it about the same as I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.230 
one's will I do it about the same as I
do<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.650> inside<00:05:02.010> but<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.280> little<00:05:02.520> trickier

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
do the inside but a little trickier

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.160 
do the inside but a little trickier
because<00:05:04.200> you<00:05:05.190> kind<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.520> have<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.730> make<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.420> even

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
because you kind of have to make it even

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.440 
because you kind of have to make it even
over<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.860> little<00:05:08.340> flap<00:05:08.670> it<00:05:08.940> adds<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.330> little

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
over the little flap it adds a little

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.670 
over the little flap it adds a little
extra<00:05:10.610> dimension<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:12.210> have<00:05:12.390> to<00:05:12.660> add<00:05:13.080> and

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
extra dimension that you have to add and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.040 
extra dimension that you have to add and
don't<00:05:14.670> worry<00:05:15.000> if<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.330> doesn't<00:05:15.360> go<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.870> whole

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
don't worry if it doesn't go the whole

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.080 
don't worry if it doesn't go the whole
way<00:05:16.170> up<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.710> doesn't<00:05:17.010> look<00:05:17.160> nice<00:05:17.790> at<00:05:18.060> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
way up and it doesn't look nice at the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.150 
way up and it doesn't look nice at the
top<00:05:18.450> where<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.930> opening<00:05:19.350> is<00:05:19.500> because<00:05:19.860> we<00:05:19.980> will

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
top where the opening is because we will

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:35.010 
top where the opening is because we will
be<00:05:20.310> doing<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.970> trim<00:05:21.420> there<00:05:21.780> next

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.270 

okay<00:05:36.020> so<00:05:36.080> now<00:05:36.379> I'm<00:05:36.500> going<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:36.889> be<00:05:36.949> doing<00:05:37.099> the

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280

trim and I'm cutting two more pieces at
12<00:05:39.620> inches<00:05:40.030> because<00:05:41.030> I<00:05:41.120> wanted<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.419> overlap
