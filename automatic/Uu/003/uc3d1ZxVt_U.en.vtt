00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
a short update on the equinox energies

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.170 
a short update on the equinox energies
and<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.720> short<00:00:04.020> update<00:00:04.380> from<00:00:04.620> me<00:00:05.180> September

22nd 2014 now you are only a few short
hours<00:00:10.830> away<00:00:11.309> from<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.820> point<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.330> time<00:00:12.570> when

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
hours away from that point in time when

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.379 
hours away from that point in time when
your<00:00:13.080> entire<00:00:13.440> planet<00:00:14.040> once<00:00:14.280> more<00:00:14.580> hangs<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.150> if

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
your entire planet once more hangs as if

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.660 
your entire planet once more hangs as if
suspended<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.049> equilibrium<00:00:16.830> when<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> light

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
suspended in equilibrium when the light

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.519 
suspended in equilibrium when the light
and<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> dark<00:00:18.330> seem<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:19.050> equally

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and the dark seem to be equally

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.640 
and the dark seem to be equally
distributed<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:20.430> over<00:00:20.750> well<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.320> may<00:00:22.619> be

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
distributed all over well that may be

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.099 
distributed all over well that may be
the<00:00:22.800> case<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.160> let<00:00:23.910> us<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.330> remind<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
this time there is indeed another huge

this time there is indeed another huge
influx<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.930> light<00:00:28.199> coming<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.800> way<00:00:28.830> just

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
influx of light coming your way just

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.400 
influx of light coming your way just
when<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> time<00:00:29.910> seems<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.510> stand<00:00:30.689> still<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
when the time seems to stand still and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.430 
when the time seems to stand still and

you with it you see once again this
window<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> opportunity<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.030> Equinox

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
window of opportunity that this Equinox

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.290 
window of opportunity that this Equinox
constitutes<00:00:37.500> will<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:37.950> utilized<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.850> this

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
constitutes will be utilized and this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.569 
constitutes will be utilized and this
time<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.750> will<00:00:39.870> indeed<00:00:40.469> far<00:00:40.770> surpass<00:00:41.309> any

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
time it will indeed far surpass any

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
very special way so make sure to stay
awake<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> way<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.799> enable<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
awake in a way that will enable you to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
awake in a way that will enable you to
literally<00:01:08.939> tune<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.689> huge<00:01:10.049> surge<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
literally tune into this huge surge of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440 
literally tune into this huge surge of
enlightened<00:01:11.250> messengers<00:01:11.850> coming<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.420> way

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
enlightened messengers coming your way

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and when we say stay awake it does not

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.450 
and when we say stay awake it does not
necessarily<00:01:15.810> entail<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:17.100> without<00:01:17.280> sleep

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
necessarily entail going without sleep

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
staying alert to any subtle or perhaps

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
staying alert to any subtle or perhaps
not<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.939> subtle<00:01:24.330> signals<00:01:24.540> heralding<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
light I have felt as if suspended in a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
light I have felt as if suspended in a
bubble<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.520> last<00:01:38.850> few<00:01:39.210> days<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.930> in

it<00:01:42.659> has<00:01:42.869> felt<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.560> mountains

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
it has felt like the mountains

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.850 
it has felt like the mountains
themselves<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.820> been<00:01:45.000> shaking<00:01:45.570> once<00:01:46.560> more
