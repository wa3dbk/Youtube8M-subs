dollars or 20 billion dollars excuse me

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.709 
dollars or 20 billion dollars excuse me
and<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> Republican<00:02:10.999> budget<00:02:11.999> deficit

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
and that is a Republican budget deficit

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.050 
and that is a Republican budget deficit
when<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.739> was<00:02:13.889> created<00:02:14.069> Republicans

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.960 
created and said deficit they will have
to<00:02:22.230> resolve<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.800> they've<00:02:23.280> already<00:02:23.460> said<00:02:23.850> they

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
