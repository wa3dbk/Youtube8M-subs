thing that i wish that they would have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.610 
thing that i wish that they would have
done<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.799> kind<00:01:56.130> of

done here is if they would have kind of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.650 
done here is if they would have kind of
even<00:01:56.740> more<00:01:57.190> of<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.580> old<00:01:57.610> school<00:01:58.360> nintendo

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
even more of the old school nintendo

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.800 
even more of the old school nintendo
