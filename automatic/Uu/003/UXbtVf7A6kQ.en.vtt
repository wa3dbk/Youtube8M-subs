00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.740 
say but what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna
use<00:01:46.860> spring<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.340> mice<00:01:47.520> 3<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.149> slow<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.689> thing

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
use spring to mice 3 to slow this thing

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.530 
use spring to mice 3 to slow this thing
down<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
down so you can really see the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.719 
down so you can really see the
difference<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.560> Cheesecake<00:01:53.070> installed<00:01:53.520> so

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
difference with Cheesecake installed so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.969 
difference with Cheesecake installed so
I<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> custom<00:01:54.479> speed<00:01:54.750> boost<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> 3

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
I have a custom speed boost it up to 3

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.459 
I have a custom speed boost it up to 3
so<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.149> slow<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.110> now<00:01:58.350> I'm

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
so it's really slow now and now I'm

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.959 
so it's really slow now and now I'm
going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> lock<00:01:58.890> them<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> ice<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
going to lock them out of ice and you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.990 
going to lock them out of ice and you
can<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> how<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.020> kind<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.439> just

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
can see it how it kind of just

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.789 
can see it how it kind of just
compresses<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> fades<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:04.049> ever<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.530> subtly

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
compresses and fades out ever so subtly

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.280 
compresses and fades out ever so subtly
and<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.119> cheesecake<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.110> can

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and that is cheesecake you can

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.830 
and that is cheesecake you can
definitely<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> difference<00:02:08.629> now<00:02:09.629> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
definitely see the difference now that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.170 
definitely see the difference now that
I've<00:02:09.989> slowed<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.470> down<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.670> very<00:02:11.910> subtle

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
I've slowed it down so it is very subtle

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.320 
I've slowed it down so it is very subtle
as<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.540> stated<00:02:12.870> but

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
