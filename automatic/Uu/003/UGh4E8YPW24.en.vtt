00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.320
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.280
 I will share a makeup teaching today. 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.900
 This makeup seems to be a piece of makeup 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 If you don't usually make too exaggerated makeup 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.235
 Dark red lips or too thick eye makeup 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.820
 This is another makeup that can be referenced. 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.333
 very simple 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.680
 But there are also cat eyes 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.020
 Can make the eyes look more spiritual 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.813
 And more prominent 

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:26.415
 Also don't need too much eye shadow 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.480
 I hope everyone can start. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.120
 First I will use Laneige's primer. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.480
 This will be more moisturizing 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.180
 It won't be too thick, so I will only apply it to a dry position. 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.754
 Because we have entered the fall 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.960
 Then I will use NARS's Tinted Moisturizer 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.340
 Squeeze on your finger first 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.020
 Then I will warm it up with my fingers 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.760
 This is what the international makeup artist of NARS taught me. 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.920
 Then I will apply it to my face with a massage 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.013
 Massage and relax at the same time 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 This foundation will be more durable and lasting. 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.260
 And the makeup looks more natural. 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.160
 Then cover the dark circles 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.740
 I certainly use my favorite 3CE Full Cover Concealer 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.960
 Then use Zoeva's concealer to sweep away 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.440
 This time, I think the eyebrows are more soft. 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.860
 So I use my favorite Soap &amp; Glory Archery eyebrow pencil 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.300
 I first use the eyebrow pencil to fill the eyebrows gently. 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.000
 Then use the liquid to fix the eyebrows. 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.580
 In terms of eye shadow, I will use Makeup Revolution's Go! Palette today. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.880
 I will first use the lightest dull beige to make a base. 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.900
 Then apply the entire eyelid with the ring finger 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.500
 Then I will take this brick color with glitter 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.940
 Apply your finger to the outer 1/3 of the eyelid 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.280
 Then I will use this dumb 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 I will use this to push open the eye shadow powder. 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.680
 No surprise, I will use Shu Uemura's eyeliner 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.540
 Go inside the eyeliner 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.500
 Painting cat eyes sometimes with gel eyeliner 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.074
 Because it is easier to control 

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.115
 I will use a beveled sweep 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.500
 Take the eyeliner as usual 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.360
 I personally like to drag down my eyeliner 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.460
 This will make the eyes look more rounded 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.880
 Then go up 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.140
 I often prepare a cotton swab with makeup remover. 

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.255
 Can be used to change the eyeliner 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.000
 Shadow powder I will use the Scultping Powder of Kevyn Aucoin 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.660
 And Zoeva's shadow sweep 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.320
 Then it will be applied to the lower part of the humerus. 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.480
 I want to have a very sculptural look for this makeup. 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.960
 So I keep licking the shadow powder 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.400
 Sweeping from the ear to the lips 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.480
 Today I chose the super cute Laduree rouge. 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.600
 Today, use Real Techniques's rouge sweep 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.514
 Then apply apple muscle 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.040
 Although this rouge is not very colored, it is very suitable for today's makeup. 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.200
 I chose to apply the rouge before I roll my eyelashes. 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.540
 Let the eyeliner get rid of it first. 

00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:56.974
 Roll eyelash first 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.720
 This time, mascara is my first time. 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.740
 MUFE's Smoky Extravagant Mascara 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.040
 Not very good and not too bad 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.974
 Very general 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.660
 I will use Kevyn Aucoin's mascara for lower eyelashes. 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.360
 Because it's younger, it's easier to apply upper and lower eyelashes. 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.520
 Today, my makeup doesn't feel complete. 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.880
 This is a very good natural pink for the base. 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.920
 What I paint on it will be more color 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.840
 This will not be too dry, although my lips are already dry. 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.480
 Then use Laduree's Lip Lacquer 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.080
 Good in autumn because it is very moist 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.400
 I will point on my lips first. 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.234
 Push it away with your fingers 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.640
 It can also produce very bright colors 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.980
 But this time I want makeup to be fresher and more natural. 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.740
 Finally, I will use One Heck of a Blot to fix my makeup. 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.213
 And Zoeva's makeup brush 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.540
 My makeup is so simple. 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.140
 I hope to help you and hope that you like it! 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.140
 If you don't like too heavy makeup, try this. 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.900
 If you like, please like it! 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.620
 See you next time! Bye!
