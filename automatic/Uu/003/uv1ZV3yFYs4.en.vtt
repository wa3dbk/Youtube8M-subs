what<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.020> is<00:05:19.050> it's<00:05:19.410> kind<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.800> like<00:05:19.949> the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
what it is it's kind of like the

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.800 
what it is it's kind of like the
concepts<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.669> leave-in<00:05:20.940> conditioner<00:05:21.449> but

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
concepts of a leave-in conditioner but

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.330 
concepts of a leave-in conditioner but
it<00:05:21.930> just<00:05:22.080> doesn't<00:05:22.260> work<00:05:22.500> for<00:05:22.560> my<00:05:22.860> hair<00:05:23.070> at<00:05:23.280> all

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
it just doesn't work for my hair at all

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.310 
it just doesn't work for my hair at all
it<00:05:23.789> leaves<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.090> really<00:05:24.419> frizzy<00:05:24.690> looking<00:05:25.139> and

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
it leaves it really frizzy looking and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.620 
it leaves it really frizzy looking and
it'll<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.430> sticky<00:05:26.910> as<00:05:26.970> well<00:05:27.180> which<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.479> really

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
it'll it's sticky as well which I really

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.690 
it'll it's sticky as well which I really
dislike<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.410> then<00:05:28.830> this<00:05:28.950> is<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.160> inverted

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
dislike and then this is the inverted

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.730 
dislike and then this is the inverted
journey<00:05:30.000> needs<00:05:30.150> silky<00:05:30.570> curls<00:05:30.810> intense<00:05:31.320> mask

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
journey needs silky curls intense mask

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.150 
journey needs silky curls intense mask
again<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:33.180> just<00:05:33.240> is<00:05:33.900> quite<00:05:34.200> runny<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.889> it

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
again this just is quite runny and it

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.830 
again this just is quite runny and it
leaves<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.580> bit<00:05:35.729> of<00:05:35.849> a<00:05:35.940> residue<00:05:36.419> on<00:05:36.450> my<00:05:36.630> hair<00:05:36.810> and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
leaves a bit of a residue on my hair and

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.839 
leaves a bit of a residue on my hair and
I<00:05:37.080> can't<00:05:37.320> say<00:05:37.530> I'm<00:05:37.590> feeling<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.160> rescue<00:05:38.789> of

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
I can't say I'm feeling the rescue of

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.690 
I can't say I'm feeling the rescue of
condition<00:05:39.330> on<00:05:39.450> my<00:05:39.570> hair<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.800> just<00:05:41.099> I<00:05:41.460> don't

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700

condition on my hair and it just I don't
know<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:41.970> just<00:05:42.000> doesn't<00:05:42.210> do<00:05:42.570> with<00:05:42.750> anything

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
know it just doesn't do with anything

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.610 
know it just doesn't do with anything
how<00:05:43.260> much<00:05:43.470> prefer<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.830> naked<00:05:45.050> hair<00:05:46.050> masks<00:05:46.500> to

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
this one it just doesn't really do

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.180 
this one it just doesn't really do
anything<00:05:48.389> and<00:05:48.690> it<00:05:48.780> just<00:05:48.930> kind<00:05:49.110> of<00:05:49.169> slips<00:05:49.950> or

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
