better<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.650> my<00:02:26.800> opinion<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.420> might<00:02:28.600> just

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
better in my opinion but that might just

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.620 
better in my opinion but that might just
be<00:02:28.930> me<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.830> new<00:02:33.150> Genosha<00:02:34.150> ins<00:02:34.330> but

be me I do like the new Genosha ins but

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.199 
be me I do like the new Genosha ins but
I<00:02:34.900> kind<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.770> wish<00:02:35.920> they<00:02:36.220> gave<00:02:36.730> them<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> old

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
I kind of wish they gave them the old

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.589 
I kind of wish they gave them the old
wings

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.129 

so<00:02:46.200> here's<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.920> genoshan<00:02:47.579> cannon<00:02:48.209> itself

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.089 

here's<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.260> front<00:02:52.469> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> cannon<00:02:55.099> pretty

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.099 
here's the front of the cannon pretty
detailed<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.180> looks<00:02:57.540> nice<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.079> my

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
detailed and that looks nice in my

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.550 
detailed and that looks nice in my
opinion<00:02:58.909> you<00:02:59.909> have<00:02:59.939> two<00:03:00.420> somewhat<00:03:01.290> hidden

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
opinion you have two somewhat hidden

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.890 
opinion you have two somewhat hidden
flick<00:03:01.980> fire<00:03:02.189> missiles<00:03:02.579> down<00:03:02.760> here<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:05.900> you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
flick fire missiles down here and you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.339 
flick fire missiles down here and you
push<00:03:07.170> here<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:07.920> here<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:09.030> shoot<00:03:09.209> them<00:03:09.510> so

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
push here and here to shoot them so

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.979 
push here and here to shoot them so
that's<00:03:10.530> nice<00:03:11.629> kind<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:12.780> hidden<00:03:13.669> so<00:03:14.780> it's<00:03:15.780> kind

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
that's nice kind of hidden so it's kind

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:32.949 
that's nice kind of hidden so it's kind
of<00:03:16.049> cool<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.379> my<00:03:16.409> opinion

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.890 

and<00:03:33.959> as<00:03:34.469> you<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:35.639> bottom<00:03:36.180> part<00:03:36.209> does

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
and as you can see the bottom part does

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.869 
and as you can see the bottom part does
move<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.519> move<00:03:38.699> each<00:03:38.969> side<00:03:39.269> individually

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
move you can move each side individually

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.250 
move you can move each side individually
if<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.939> set<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.269> down<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.689> can<00:03:42.840> move<00:03:43.019> this

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
if you set it down you can move this

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.520 
if you set it down you can move this
part<00:03:43.560> up<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.829> down<00:03:46.069> here's<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.219> back<00:03:48.530> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530

other side so all in all very good set I

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.349 
other side so all in all very good set I
do<00:03:54.479> think<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.189> worth<00:03:56.189> the<00:03:56.489> price<00:03:56.759> on<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.090> and

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
do think it's worth the price on it and

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.379 
do think it's worth the price on it and
everything<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:59.370> hope<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.970> enjoyed<00:04:00.239> the
