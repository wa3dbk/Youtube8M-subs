00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
show you guys how long each process

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.780 
show you guys how long each process
should<00:01:54.750> take<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> I'm<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.100> cutting<00:01:59.490> anything

should<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:04.350> which<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.560> jailbreak

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
should actually do which is jailbreak

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.419 
should actually do which is jailbreak
your<00:02:05.399> device

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.369 

it<00:02:10.519> says<00:02:10.879> it's<00:02:11.060> done<00:02:11.390> on<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.659> computer<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.349> you

screen and it is simply moving the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.490 
screen and it is simply moving the
applications<00:02:54.090> now<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.659> take<00:02:54.959> some<00:02:55.260> time

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
applications now this can take some time

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.959 
applications now this can take some time
depending<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:56.010> how<00:02:56.159> much<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.489> actually<00:02:56.640> have

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
we're going to have to browse for the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.749 
we're going to have to browse for the
firmware<00:04:46.319> again<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.009> we<00:04:47.129> are<00:04:47.190> going<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.520> have

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
firmware again and we are going to have

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.029 
firmware again and we are going to have
to<00:04:47.909> run<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.750> just<00:04:49.229> be<00:04:49.440> tethered<00:04:49.740> now

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
to run it in the just be tethered now

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.610 
to run it in the just be tethered now
mode<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.580> we<00:04:51.030> are<00:04:51.150> doing<00:04:51.389> this<00:04:51.629> because<00:04:51.930> this

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
mode and we are doing this because this

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.980 
mode and we are doing this because this
is<00:04:52.830> actually<00:04:53.069> a<00:04:53.310> tethered<00:04:53.789> jailbreak<00:04:53.990> which

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
is actually a tethered jailbreak which

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.170 
is actually a tethered jailbreak which
means<00:04:55.409> that<00:04:55.680> every<00:04:56.220> time<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:56.550> want<00:04:56.879> to<00:04:57.030> use

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
means that every time you want to use

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.999 
means that every time you want to use
Cydia<00:04:57.599> anything<00:04:58.199> you've<00:04:58.319> downloaded<00:04:58.560> from

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
Cydia anything you've downloaded from

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.879 
Cydia anything you've downloaded from
cydia<00:04:59.220> or<00:04:59.639> safari<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.900> will<00:05:01.139> actually<00:05:01.409> have

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
cydia or safari you will actually have

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.879 
cydia or safari you will actually have
to<00:05:02.190> run<00:05:02.789> at<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.870> be<00:05:04.050> tethered<00:05:04.319> now<00:05:04.620> mode

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
to run at this just be tethered now mode

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.219 
to run at this just be tethered now mode
if<00:05:05.130> your<00:05:05.370> device<00:05:05.550> turns<00:05:06.090> off<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:06.840> means

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
if your device turns off so that means

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.830 
if your device turns off so that means
if<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.590> dies<00:05:07.830> or<00:05:08.159> if<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.729> have<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.150> reboot<00:05:09.569> then

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
if it dies or if you have to reboot then

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.029 
if it dies or if you have to reboot then
you<00:05:09.960> will<00:05:10.139> have<00:05:10.349> to<00:05:10.470> do<00:05:10.590> this<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:10.979> that's

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
you will have to do this and that's

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.980 
you will have to do this and that's
really<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.400> only<00:05:11.539> reason<00:05:12.539> you<00:05:12.659> have<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.870> do

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
really the only reason you have to do

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.149 
really the only reason you have to do
this<00:05:13.020> because<00:05:13.319> this<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.710> tethered

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
this because this is a tethered

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.279 
this because this is a tethered
jailbreak and<00:05:14.849> this<00:05:15.240> is<00:05:15.419> required<00:05:15.960> in<00:05:16.169> order

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
jailbreak and this is required in order

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.279 
jailbreak and this is required in order
to<00:05:16.560> get<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.889> boot<00:05:17.460> up<00:05:17.639> properly<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.479> again

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
to get it to boot up properly so again

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.050 
to get it to boot up properly so again
it<00:05:19.469> just<00:05:19.500> select<00:05:20.069> the<00:05:20.159> firmware<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:20.909> will

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
it just select the firmware and you will

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.730 
it just select the firmware and you will
have<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.389> do<00:05:21.479> this<00:05:21.599> every<00:05:21.810> time<00:05:22.139> your<00:05:22.500> device

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
have to do this every time your device

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.529 
have to do this every time your device
turns<00:05:23.099> off<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:23.669> want<00:05:23.909> to<00:05:24.090> use<00:05:24.210> anything

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
turns off and you want to use anything
