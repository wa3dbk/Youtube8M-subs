on this week's track battle we've got
over<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.830> thousand<00:00:17.430> horsepower<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.029> play<00:00:18.210> with

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
over a thousand horsepower to play with

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.410 
over a thousand horsepower to play with
thanks<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.050> them<00:00:19.289> Sadie's<00:00:19.770> sl63<00:00:20.460> AMG<00:00:20.580> and

Jaguar<00:00:22.199> xkr-s<00:00:22.859> convertible<00:00:23.789> we're<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
Jaguar xkr-s convertible we're going to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
Jaguar xkr-s convertible we're going to
find<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.840> which<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.199> quickest<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.130> suspect

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
find out which is quickest and I suspect

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.950 
find out which is quickest and I suspect
we're<00:00:26.609> gonna<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.939> sideways<00:00:27.240> quite<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
we're gonna be going sideways quite a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
we're gonna be going sideways quite a
lot<00:00:28.260> both<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.429> these<00:00:29.550> cars<00:00:29.849> look<00:00:30.330> slightly

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
lot both of these cars look slightly

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330 
lot both of these cars look slightly
ridiculous<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> think<00:00:32.070> they're<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.250> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
ridiculous but I think they're going to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.369 
ridiculous but I think they're going to
be<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.579> lot<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> fun

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.369 

so<00:00:40.379> we're<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> start<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> sl63<00:00:42.379> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so we're going to start in the sl63 this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.920 
so we're going to start in the sl63 this
thing<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> huge<00:00:44.430> card<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.239> probably<00:00:45.750> not

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
thing is a huge card it's probably not

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.759 
thing is a huge card it's probably not
fully<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.620> home<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.100> track<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.540> all<00:00:48.769> 530

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
fully at home on track but it's all 530

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.790 
fully at home on track but it's all 530
horsepower<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.579> 600<00:00:51.390> pound<00:00:52.199> foot<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> torque

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
horsepower and 600 pound foot a torque

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340 
horsepower and 600 pound foot a torque
or<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.309> abouts<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.329> performance<00:00:54.750> is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
or there abouts so the performance is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.389 
or there abouts so the performance is
just<00:00:55.970> hardness<00:01:00.290> so<00:01:01.290> first<00:01:01.530> impressions<00:01:02.220> well

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
just hardness so first impressions well

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.670 
just hardness so first impressions well
it's<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.970> strange<00:01:03.269> car<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.379> very

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it's a strange car this it's got very

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
it's a strange car this it's got very
heavy<00:01:04.920> steering<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.860> no<00:01:08.130> body<00:01:08.430> roll

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
heavy steering it's got no body roll

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.419 
heavy steering it's got no body roll
it's<00:01:08.940> got<00:01:09.119> some<00:01:09.270> active<00:01:09.690> body<00:01:09.990> roll<00:01:10.429> system

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
it's got some active body roll system

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.999 
it's got some active body roll system
which<00:01:12.149> means<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.570> masses<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.229> response

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
which means you get masses of response

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.450 
which means you get masses of response
to<00:01:14.369> start<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.910> but<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.170> tires

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
to start with but then the tires

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.580 
to start with but then the tires
to<00:01:17.729> live<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.299> first<00:01:18.750> bit<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> response

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to live with that first bit of response

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350 
to live with that first bit of response
so<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.580> mucking<00:01:20.850> around<00:01:20.940> there<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
so that I'm mucking around there and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
so that I'm mucking around there and
getting<00:01:21.570> oversteer<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.920> generally<00:01:23.310> get

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
getting oversteer what you generally get

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.790 
getting oversteer what you generally get
is<00:01:23.700> instant<00:01:24.270> turning<00:01:24.750> by<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.260> then<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> washes

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
is instant turning by and then it washes

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.700 
is instant turning by and then it washes
into<00:01:26.159> understand<00:01:26.760> here<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.260> can't<00:01:28.470> get

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
into understand here you just can't get

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
into understand here you just can't get
it<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:28.950> around<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.369> corner<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.420> on

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it to go around the corner and then on

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.510 
it to go around the corner and then on
the<00:01:30.659> exit<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.890> talk<00:01:32.130> spikes<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.170> were

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
the exit the talk spikes up and you were

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.999 
the exit the talk spikes up and you were
fond<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.820> either<00:01:35.880> rear<00:01:36.180> tires

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
fond for either rear tires

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.260 
fond for either rear tires
but<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.430> enough<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
but I think that's enough of the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
but I think that's enough of the
sideways<00:01:39.720> stuff<00:01:40.050> let's<00:01:40.350> try<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> lap<00:01:41.399> see

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
sideways stuff let's try for a lap see

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.040 
sideways stuff let's try for a lap see
if<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.970> thing<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.050> neat<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> tiny<00:01:43.740> lap

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
if this thing can do a neat and tiny lap

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.100 
if this thing can do a neat and tiny lap
immediately

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
immediately

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.290 
immediately
get<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.500> understeer<00:01:48.160> it's<00:01:48.520> strange<00:01:48.970> this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
get the understeer it's strange this

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.090 
get the understeer it's strange this
thing

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
thing

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.050 
thing
it<00:01:52.100> feels<00:01:52.430> heavy<00:01:52.730> on<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.060> brakes<00:01:54.700> just<00:01:55.700> about

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
it feels heavy on the brakes just about

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.230 
it feels heavy on the brakes just about
turns<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.810> then<00:01:56.900> it's<00:01:57.050> just<00:01:57.230> patience

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
turns in and then it's just patience

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.380 
turns in and then it's just patience
bit<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.630> oversteer<00:02:00.909> you've<00:02:01.909> run<00:02:02.090> into<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
bit of oversteer you've run into the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.760 
bit of oversteer you've run into the
limiter<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:02.990> gear<00:02:03.200> box<00:02:03.380> if<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:03.740> don't

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
limiter in the gear box if you don't

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.060 
limiter in the gear box if you don't
preempt<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:04.729> which<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.799> quite<00:02:06.799> frustrating

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
preempt it which is quite frustrating

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.300 
preempt it which is quite frustrating
good<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.970> brakes<00:02:08.090> see<00:02:08.959> that<00:02:09.310> initial

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
good on the brakes see that initial

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.130 
good on the brakes see that initial
response<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.759> good<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.060> now<00:02:11.270> you're<00:02:11.990> just

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
response is good but now you're just

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.220 
response is good but now you're just
waiting<00:02:12.890> for<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.160> front<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.640> buy<00:02:13.840> as<00:02:14.840> soon<00:02:15.110> as

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
waiting for the front to buy as soon as

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.790 
waiting for the front to buy as soon as
it<00:02:15.319> does<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.970> rear<00:02:17.239> lights<00:02:17.510> up<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.959> makes<00:02:18.140> such

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
it does the rear lights up it makes such

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.410 
it does the rear lights up it makes such
a<00:02:18.830> tricky<00:02:19.430> balance

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
a tricky balance

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.940 
a tricky balance
but<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.930> fast<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.800> engine<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.459> wicked<00:02:24.950> for

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
but it is fast this engine is wicked for

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.160 
but it is fast this engine is wicked for
a<00:02:26.010> big<00:02:26.310> old<00:02:26.520> car<00:02:26.819> that's<00:02:27.239> turn

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:47.270 

Oh

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.180 

so<00:02:48.280> being<00:02:48.520> entirely<00:02:49.000> beat<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.690> obviously<00:02:50.190> not

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
so being entirely beat is obviously not

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.070 
so being entirely beat is obviously not
in<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.520> sl63<00:02:52.920> repertoire

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
in the sl63 repertoire

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.200 
in the sl63 repertoire
and<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.320> feels<00:02:55.650> really<00:02:56.070> slow<00:02:56.610> if<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.030> just

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
and it feels really slow if you just

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.080 
and it feels really slow if you just
don't<00:02:57.390> have<00:02:57.570> any<00:02:57.720> slip<00:02:58.140> angle<00:02:58.500> at<00:02:58.620> all<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.910> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
don't have any slip angle at all it is a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.120 
don't have any slip angle at all it is a
real<00:03:00.450> balance<00:03:00.960> through<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.620> high<00:03:01.770> speed

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
real balance through this high speed

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.240 
real balance through this high speed
corner<00:03:02.640> understeer<00:03:03.420> or<00:03:03.690> oversteer<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.980> so

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
corner understeer or oversteer it's so

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.180 
corner understeer or oversteer it's so
hard<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.730> keep<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.910> neutral

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.600 

about<00:03:11.520> kids<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.120> gets<00:03:12.980> that's<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.130> lap<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.580> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
about kids it gets that's a lap in the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.720 
about kids it gets that's a lap in the
sl63

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
sl63

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.180 
sl63
the<00:03:17.730> sl63<00:03:18.390> might<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.080> very<00:03:19.440> narrow<00:03:19.770> sweet

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
the sl63 might have a very narrow sweet

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.490 
the sl63 might have a very narrow sweet
spot<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.270> clearly<00:03:21.600> not<00:03:21.750> its<00:03:22.140> natural

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
spot and this is clearly not its natural

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.560 
spot and this is clearly not its natural
environment<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.610> grip<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.240> grunt

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
environment but the grip and the grunt

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.950 
environment but the grip and the grunt
is<00:03:24.780> undeniable<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.890> lap<00:03:26.550> time<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.790> 123<00:03:27.540> point<00:03:27.750> 9

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
is undeniable a lap time of 123 point 9

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:41.650 
is undeniable a lap time of 123 point 9
is<00:03:28.200> fast<00:03:28.560> really<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:29.940> fast

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.710 

so<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.380> sl63<00:03:43.040> might<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.580> felt<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.180> little<00:03:44.540> bit

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
so the sl63 might have felt a little bit

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.770 
so the sl63 might have felt a little bit
strange<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:45.560> no<00:03:46.550> arguing<00:03:47.030> with<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.240> grip<00:03:47.570> or

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
strange but no arguing with the grip or

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.920 
strange but no arguing with the grip or
the<00:03:48.080> performance<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:49.190> xkr-s<00:03:49.580> has<00:03:50.180> even<00:03:50.750> more

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
the performance the xkr-s has even more

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.010 
the performance the xkr-s has even more

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
power in terms of horsepower a little

really<00:04:03.740> light<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.160> point<00:04:04.490> here<00:04:05.500> but<00:04:06.500> there's

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
really light is point here but there's

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.700 
really light is point here but there's
more<00:04:06.770> body<00:04:07.040> roll<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.810> really<00:04:09.140> really

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
more body roll and it really really

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.810 
more body roll and it really really
struggles<00:04:10.430> with<00:04:11.230> traction<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.620> just<00:04:13.190> lights

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
struggles with traction it just lights

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.960 
struggles with traction it just lights
its<00:04:14.240> tires<00:04:14.540> up<00:04:15.070> every<00:04:16.070> time<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.520> go<00:04:16.670> near<00:04:16.700> the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
its tires up every time you go near the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.150 
its tires up every time you go near the
throttle<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:19.459> just<00:04:19.910> never<00:04:20.709> stops

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
throttle it just never stops

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:32.620 
throttle it just never stops
over<00:04:22.790> steering<00:04:27.730> so<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:30.190> thought<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.310> SL<00:04:31.640> 63<00:04:32.150> was

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
over steering so I thought the SL 63 was

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.390 
over steering so I thought the SL 63 was
a<00:04:32.660> trick<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:34.430> keep<00:04:34.460> meat<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.030> tidy<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:37.570> xkr-s

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
a trick to keep meat and tidy but xkr-s

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.650 
a trick to keep meat and tidy but xkr-s
redefines<00:04:40.400> larry<00:04:41.050> turns<00:04:42.050> in<00:04:42.290> pretty<00:04:42.530> well

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
redefines larry turns in pretty well

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.650 
redefines larry turns in pretty well
but<00:04:43.810> again<00:04:44.170> just<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:46.260> bra<00:04:47.260> all<00:04:48.210> into<00:04:49.210> this<00:04:49.330> heavy

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
but again just a bra all into this heavy

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.190 
but again just a bra all into this heavy
braking<00:04:50.020> zone<00:04:50.760> go<00:04:51.760> sideways<00:04:52.120> on<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.810> brakes

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
braking zone go sideways on the brakes

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.100

on<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.950> way<00:04:54.100> into<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.580> corner<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:55.210> then<00:04:55.960> as

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
on the way into the corner and then as

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.340 
on the way into the corner and then as
soon<00:04:56.440> as<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.740> look<00:04:57.070> at<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.340> shuttle<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:59.080> goes

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
soon as you look at the shuttle it goes

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.890 
soon as you look at the shuttle it goes
again<00:04:59.770> I've<00:05:00.250> got<00:05:00.490> about<00:05:00.670> quarter<00:05:01.240> throttle<00:05:01.510> up

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
again I've got about quarter throttle up

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.140 
again I've got about quarter throttle up
fourth<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:03.480> doesn't<00:05:04.480> make<00:05:04.660> any<00:05:04.930> difference

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
fourth it doesn't make any difference

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.870 
fourth it doesn't make any difference
that's<00:05:07.150> trying<00:05:07.570> keep<00:05:07.780> more<00:05:08.080> under<00:05:08.710> control<00:05:08.920> to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
that's trying keep more under control to

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.020 
that's trying keep more under control to
a<00:05:09.910> certain<00:05:10.000> extent<00:05:10.990> see<00:05:11.980> what<00:05:12.220> that<00:05:12.490> time<00:05:12.850> it

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
a certain extent see what that time it

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.000 
a certain extent see what that time it
runs

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.310 

thus<00:05:18.010> feel<00:05:18.910> heavy<00:05:19.420> on<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.660> brakes

thus feel heavy on the brakes
turns<00:05:20.560> him<00:05:20.830> well<00:05:21.040> but<00:05:21.250> then<00:05:21.430> instantly<00:05:22.270> lights
