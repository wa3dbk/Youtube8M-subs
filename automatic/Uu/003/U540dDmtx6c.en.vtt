00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
images that are supposed to create

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020 
images that are supposed to create
higher<00:00:34.469> self<00:00:34.800> esteem<00:00:35.100> by<00:00:35.399> actually<00:00:35.760> doing<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
higher self esteem by actually doing the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.910 
higher self esteem by actually doing the
complete<00:00:36.360> opposite<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:37.410> there's<00:00:37.590> no<00:00:37.739> way

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
complete opposite because there's no way

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.840 
complete opposite because there's no way
we<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.250> live<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.520> these<00:00:38.790> standards

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
we can live up to these standards

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.970 
we can live up to these standards
because<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.750> even<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.710> just

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
because not even they do it's just

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
because not even they do it's just
absolute<00:00:41.610> insanity<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:43.340> think<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:45.030> makeup<00:00:45.480> we

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.660 
they can actually achieve my whole
approach<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> makeup<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:47.100> keep<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> simple

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
approach to makeup is to keep it simple

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.910 
approach to makeup is to keep it simple
because<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.450> isn't<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.200> isn't<00:01:49.470> rocket<00:01:49.740> science

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
because it isn't it isn't rocket science

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340 
because it isn't it isn't rocket science
with<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.360> information<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.140> now

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
with so much information out there now

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
with so much information out there now
the<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.130> missing<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the one thing that's missing is the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
the one thing that's missing is the
explaining<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> teaching<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.200> makeup

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
explaining and the teaching of makeup

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
explaining and the teaching of makeup
you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.189> fine<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.759> watch<00:01:56.909> something

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you know it's fine to watch something

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
you know it's fine to watch something
but<00:01:57.570> what<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.869> need<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.560> why<00:01:58.979> you're

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
but what you need is to know why you're

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
but what you need is to know why you're
doing<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.969> specific<00:02:00.570> technique<00:02:00.930> if

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
doing that specific technique if

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
doing that specific technique if
somebody's<00:02:01.649> applying<00:02:02.040> blusher<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.909> example
