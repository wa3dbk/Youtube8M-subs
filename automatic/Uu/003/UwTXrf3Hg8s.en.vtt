00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.310
 let's start 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.810
 first we enter the photoshop I have 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.720
 the image with which I want to work 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.100
 as we will first duplicate the image 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.940
 with control j we go to picture settings 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.730
 and hd er tones 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.280
 we give and wait for him to load 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.160
 once loaded we will modify 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.269
 the radius the intensity the range 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 exhibition detail shadows highlight 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.170
 intensity and saturation 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160
 these tones for everything are not going to do what 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.930
 same depending on the image 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.740
 they change 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.740
 configuration 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.230
 that fits 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 all right 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.350

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.990
 and I'm going to leave it here 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.990

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.670
