00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.009
 Friday we saved ourselves with the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.150
 morning tide I was put on 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.600
 quarantine away from others 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.070
 passengers and crew 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.070
 now I just want to go home 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.680
 my dear sexsmith desperately needed 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.480
 of your help 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.029
 I came across a written diary 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 in 1849 by a dying lawyer in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 journey from an island in the Pacific to San 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.099
 francisco 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.410
 missing half free for me is absolutely 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.470
 devastating an unfinished book is 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.470
 after all an unfinished love story 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.590
 that you are reading old letters because 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.449
 you keep reading I do n't know just looking for 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 understand why we continue to commit 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:56.309
 the same mistakes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.180
 every time our life and ours 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.210
 choices 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.580
 every meeting he'd be spyglass 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.909
 magazine certainly suggests a new one 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.430
 This is the lesson to potential 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.130
 music of my dream 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.400
 I call it the cloud atlas I have 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 written inter movements imagining 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 our repeated standing encounters 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 different different ages than those who are 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.200
 doing in here 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.079
 let's pass and go back in our footsteps 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.159
 as artistic skaters the love of 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:32.640
 my life that had become of her not 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.710
 I can explain it but I knew when 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.079
 opened that door 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.960
 I felt it in a dream I was in a 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.109
 terrifying coffee bombarded by lights 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.579
 dazzling underground and and without via 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:50.299
 exit is the waiter they all had it 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.299
 same much 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:03.000
 you don't have to hide, I know who you are 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.000
 dreams 4 5 1 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:20.740
 yesterday my life was going in one direction 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:24.400
 today he goes to another I never think that 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.990
 the universe is against her but for that 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.160
 but where is our money 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.310
 the law says law 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.500
 fear faith love 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.160
 phenomena that determine the course of 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.770
 our life 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.319
 these forces begin long before that 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.530
 we are born and continue after ours 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.530
 end 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.510
 our life does not belong to us 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.530
 we are linked to others 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.210
 past 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.440
 is present 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.440
 and from every crime 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.220
 and every kindness we generate ours 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.220
 future 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.739
 I began to fear I could no longer 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.189
 hold my beloved in my arms 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.189
 kilda 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.260
 the problem you create by nature 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.260
 policy 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.700
 yesterday I believe I would never have done 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.700
 what I did today 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.860
 feel like something important me 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.550
 had happened it is possible 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.350
 I just met her and yet I am 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.350
 I would love him 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.630
 you saved me twice and now it's de 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.630
 I grab you 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.930
 there is a natural order in this world e 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.980
 those who try to turn it over do not 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.980
 they are doing well 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.300
 I believe there is another world that exists 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.139
 awaits six a better world 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.139
 and I am tender to you there
