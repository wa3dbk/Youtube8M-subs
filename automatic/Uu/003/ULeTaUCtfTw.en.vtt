first time I had some problems but after
a<00:02:35.290> few<00:02:35.560> minutes<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:36.400> was<00:02:36.939> really<00:02:37.180> easy<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
a few minutes it was really easy it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.119 
a few minutes it was really easy it
turned<00:02:38.799> out<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:38.950> easy<00:02:40.709> I've<00:02:41.709> been<00:02:41.890> wanting

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
turned out really easy I've been wanting

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.759

to<00:02:42.220> try<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.670> for<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.180> long<00:02:43.299> time<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:44.079> this<00:02:44.530> is

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
to try that for a long time and this is

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:51.360 
to try that for a long time and this is
my<00:02:45.010> chance<00:02:47.159> it's<00:02:48.159> pretty<00:02:48.519> simple<00:02:50.340> black<00:02:51.340> and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
my chance it's pretty simple black and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.649 
my chance it's pretty simple black and
white<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:54.040> really<00:02:54.340> feminine<00:02:57.269> it's<00:02:58.269> just

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
white it's really feminine it's just

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:10.420 
white it's really feminine it's just
really<00:02:58.989> hard<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.739> make<00:02:59.769> cakes<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:02.069> men<00:03:05.849> yeah
