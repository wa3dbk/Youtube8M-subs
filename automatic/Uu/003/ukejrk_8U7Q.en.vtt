00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.150 

so<00:00:01.589> Julia<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.310> were<00:00:02.429> wondering<00:00:02.939> about<00:00:03.030> the

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
so Julia you were wondering about the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.340 
so Julia you were wondering about the
looping<00:00:05.160> or<00:00:05.339> not<00:00:05.580> was<00:00:05.819> netting<00:00:06.390> technique<00:00:07.020> and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
looping or not was netting technique and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.110 
looping or not was netting technique and
it<00:00:07.529> happens<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.010> one<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.400> know<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.090> I

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
it happens to be one that I know so I

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.839 
it happens to be one that I know so I
thought<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.510> would<00:00:09.690> do<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> little<00:00:10.349> demo<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:11.040> you

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
thought I would do a little demo for you

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.690 
thought I would do a little demo for you
you<00:00:12.240> start<00:00:12.570> with<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.900> either<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.590> slip<00:00:13.950> knot<00:00:13.980> or<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
you start with a either a slip knot or a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.160 
you start with a either a slip knot or a
straight<00:00:15.059> piece<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.330> string<00:00:15.780> I'm<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.049> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
straight piece of string I'm going to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.779 
straight piece of string I'm going to
start<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> slip<00:00:16.770> knot<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.609> is

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
start with a slip knot because this is

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.019 
start with a slip knot because this is
likely<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.810> they<00:00:19.199> started<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.550> bottom<00:00:20.730> of

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
likely how they started the bottom of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.870 
likely how they started the bottom of
the<00:00:21.119> bag<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.960> you're<00:00:22.109> talking<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:22.880> so

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the bag that you're talking about so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.330 
the bag that you're talking about so
here's<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.240> slip<00:00:24.480> knot<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.070> take

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
here's my slip knot and then you take

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.310 
here's my slip knot and then you take
the<00:00:26.580> needle<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.090> thread<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.599> needle<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the needle and thread the needle and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.600 
the needle and thread the needle and
string<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:30.439> attached<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.309> slip<00:00:32.579> knot

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
string that is attached to the slip knot

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
string that is attached to the slip knot
take<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> needle<00:00:33.840> put<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> through<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
take the needle put it through the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.490 
take the needle put it through the
center<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.489> slip<00:00:35.730> knot<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:37.200> out

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
center of the slip knot and then out

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
center of the slip knot and then out
towards<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.579> notice<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:41.510> over

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
towards you and notice I'm going over

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
towards you and notice I'm going over
like<00:00:43.469> directly<00:00:44.010> towards<00:00:44.640> myself<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:46.640> through

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
like directly towards myself so through

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
like directly towards myself so through
the<00:00:48.090> loop<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:48.539> being<00:00:48.809> created<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.350> see

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the loop that's being created so see

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
the loop that's being created so see
this<00:00:49.829> nice<00:00:50.039> big<00:00:50.280> loop<00:00:50.579> that's<00:00:50.879> being<00:00:51.120> created

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
this nice big loop that's being created

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.410 
this nice big loop that's being created
as<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:53.190> pull<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> string<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.030> loop

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
as I pull on this string that loop

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
as I pull on this string that loop
becomes<00:00:54.809> smaller<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.710> smaller<00:00:57.680> there<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> go

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
becomes smaller and smaller there you go

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.529 
becomes smaller and smaller there you go
and<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.109> pull<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.539> tightly

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and and you can pull this as as tightly

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.130 
and and you can pull this as as tightly
or<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.049> loosely<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:05.010> depending<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
or as loosely as you want depending on

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
or as loosely as you want depending on
what<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.280> use<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.000> piece<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.299> if

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
what you want to use this piece for if

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.679 
what you want to use this piece for if
this<00:01:10.260> were<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> bag<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:12.060> would<00:01:12.210> probably

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
this were to be a bag you would probably

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.420 
this were to be a bag you would probably
want<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> pull<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.860> tight<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
want to pull it really tight like that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.359 
want to pull it really tight like that
so<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.900> no<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.189> almost

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
so it's like a little no it it's almost

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
so it's like a little no it it's almost
the<00:01:17.640> same<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.090> half<00:01:18.270> hitch<00:01:21.439> over<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> edge

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the same as a half hitch over the edge

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
the same as a half hitch over the edge
of<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.670> slip<00:01:24.000> knot<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.780> go

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
of this the slip knot so there we go

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.219 
of this the slip knot so there we go
there's<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.710> second<00:01:26.100> loop<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.930> do

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there's the second loop if you don't do

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.530 
there's the second loop if you don't do
it<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.189> put<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> needle

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it this way if you just put the needle

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
it this way if you just put the needle
through<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.759> loop<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.900> pull<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
through the loop like this and pull it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
through the loop like this and pull it
the<00:01:38.460> string<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.060> keep<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.390> on

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the string will just keep going on

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
the string will just keep going on
through<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> there's<00:01:40.470> nothing<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> hold<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
through and there's nothing to hold it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.770 
through and there's nothing to hold it
behind<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.829> need<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.689> put<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
behind so you really do need to put the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
behind so you really do need to put the
needle<00:01:45.990> through<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.579> pull

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
needle through and then and then pull

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
needle through and then and then pull
the<00:01:47.939> string<00:01:48.090> directly<00:01:48.840> towards<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> through

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the string directly towards you through

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.380 
the string directly towards you through
the<00:01:49.920> middle<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> loop<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.180> being

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the middle of the loop that's being

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
the middle of the loop that's being
created<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> loop<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.710> once<00:01:55.950> you've

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
created to make the loop so once you've

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.910 
created to make the loop so once you've
got<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> whole<00:01:56.610> row<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.149> these<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.500> let's<00:01:58.680> do

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
got a whole row of these so let's do

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.289 
got a whole row of these so let's do
three<00:01:59.460> more<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.040> probably<00:02:02.520> exactly<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
three more this is probably exactly the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.709 
three more this is probably exactly the
way<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.500> bag<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.520> saw<00:02:05.790> was<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.420> being

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
way that the bag you saw was was being

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.260 
way that the bag you saw was was being
done<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.369> actually<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> technique<00:02:09.090> that's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
done it's actually a technique that's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
done it's actually a technique that's
used<00:02:09.420> by<00:02:09.660> some<00:02:10.050> basket<00:02:10.560> makers<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.250> definitely

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
used by some basket makers I definitely

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.730

life and there we go let's do six

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.460 
life and there we go let's do six
stitches<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:20.040> start<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.390> go<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.320> now

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
stitches to start there we go so now

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.150 
stitches to start there we go so now
you've<00:02:22.620> got<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.310> row<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.970> little<00:02:24.810> loops

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
you've got this this row of little loops

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.560 
you've got this this row of little loops
half<00:02:26.160> hitches<00:02:26.490> whatever<00:02:27.060> you'd<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.420> call

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
half hitches whatever you'd like to call

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.870 
half hitches whatever you'd like to call
them<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:29.160> if<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.490> pull<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.940> slip<00:02:30.240> knot<00:02:30.380> tight

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
them and if you pull the slip knot tight

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.790 
them and if you pull the slip knot tight
then<00:02:32.880> they<00:02:33.090> will<00:02:33.240> form<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:33.870> circle<00:02:34.380> much

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
then they will form a little circle much

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.790 
then they will form a little circle much
like<00:02:35.280> starting<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:37.200> bit<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.190> round<00:02:38.430> crochet<00:02:39.800> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
like starting a bit of round crochet so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.500 
like starting a bit of round crochet so
it<00:02:41.040> looks<00:02:41.490> very<00:02:41.970> very<00:02:42.240> similar<00:02:43.280> indeed<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it looks very very similar indeed and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.090 
it looks very very similar indeed and
then<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:45.870> were<00:02:45.990> going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.320> start<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> second

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
then we were going to start the second

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.580 
then we were going to start the second
row<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.610> want<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.330> increase<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.930> size<00:02:49.320> of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
row you want to increase the size of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.270 
row you want to increase the size of
this<00:02:49.740> piece<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.940> second<00:02:51.300> row<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.570> always

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
this piece so the second row is always

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.130 
this piece so the second row is always
two<00:02:53.280> little<00:02:53.640> loops<00:02:55.100> formed<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:57.420> every<00:02:58.320> one

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
two little loops formed in every one

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.760 
two little loops formed in every one
loop<00:03:01.140> from<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.040> previous<00:03:02.550> row<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:05.900> if<00:03:06.900> you

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
loop from the previous row and if you

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.820 
loop from the previous row and if you
started<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.760> example<00:03:08.790> with<00:03:09.540> six<00:03:10.470> little

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
started for example with six little

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.000 
started for example with six little
loops<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.670> your<00:03:11.940> initial<00:03:12.180> row<00:03:12.620> you'll<00:03:13.620> want<00:03:13.890> to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
loops in your initial row you'll want to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.620 
loops in your initial row you'll want to
increase<00:03:14.460> by<00:03:14.700> six<00:03:14.760> stitches<00:03:15.470> every<00:03:16.470> row<00:03:17.630> to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
increase by six stitches every row to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.320 
increase by six stitches every row to
make<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.050> uniformly<00:03:19.860> round<00:03:22.850> little<00:03:23.850> piece<00:03:24.030> so

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
make a uniformly round little piece so

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.420 
make a uniformly round little piece so
if<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.810> had<00:03:24.960> six<00:03:25.200> stitches<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.740> start<00:03:25.980> I'm<00:03:26.160> doing

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
if I had six stitches to start I'm doing

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.720 
if I had six stitches to start I'm doing
two<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:27.030> each<00:03:27.620> stitch<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.010> second<00:03:29.370> row<00:03:29.490> so

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
two in each stitch for the second row so

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.790 
two in each stitch for the second row so
I<00:03:29.760> should<00:03:30.000> have<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.150> total<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.870> twelve<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.680> my

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
I should have a total of twelve for my

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.740 
I should have a total of twelve for my
second<00:03:32.220> row<00:03:32.870> there<00:03:33.870> we<00:03:33.990> go<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:36.450> your<00:03:36.720> third

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
second row there we go and in your third

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.230 
second row there we go and in your third
row<00:03:38.540> you'll<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.780> doing<00:03:40.530> stitches<00:03:41.240> two

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
row you'll be doing stitches two

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.190 
row you'll be doing stitches two
stitches<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.780> every<00:03:43.410> second<00:03:43.980> stitch<00:03:46.280> making

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
stitches in every second stitch making

eighteen stitches in total and so on and
so<00:03:53.280> forth

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
so forth

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.150 
so forth
if<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.570> it's<00:03:54.900> much<00:03:55.200> like<00:03:55.440> knitting<00:03:55.680> if<00:03:55.950> you

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
if you it's much like knitting if you

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.510 
if you it's much like knitting if you
keep<00:03:56.660> making<00:03:57.660> increases<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.950> same<00:03:59.220> place

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
keep making increases in the same place

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.040 
keep making increases in the same place
in<00:03:59.790> every<00:04:00.060> row<00:04:01.820> you<00:04:02.820> will<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> very

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
in every row you will have a very

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.400 
in every row you will have a very
uniform<00:04:06.620> structure<00:04:07.620> or<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.400> very<00:04:08.760> uniform

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
uniform structure or a very uniform

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.390 
uniform structure or a very uniform
increase<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.620> you'll<00:04:10.709> be<00:04:10.830> able<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.070> see<00:04:11.250> where

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
increase and you'll be able to see where

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.460 
increase and you'll be able to see where
those<00:04:11.520> increases<00:04:11.940> are<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.630> you'll<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.410> a

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
those increases are and you'll get a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.840 
those increases are and you'll get a
shape<00:04:13.709> much<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.520> do<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.670> see<00:04:14.820> how

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
shape much like this so do you see how

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.789 
shape much like this so do you see how
it's<00:04:15.180> starting<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.690> turn<00:04:15.930> into<00:04:16.230> a<00:04:16.350> little<00:04:16.590> bit

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
it's starting to turn into a little bit

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.950 
it's starting to turn into a little bit
of<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:19.250> Pentagon<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.580> we've<00:04:20.730> got<00:04:20.880> two<00:04:21.150> two<00:04:21.600> two

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
of a Pentagon so we've got two two two

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.840 
of a Pentagon so we've got two two two
and<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.530> can<00:04:22.680> definitely<00:04:22.860> see<00:04:23.400> definite

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and you can definitely see definite

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.690 
and you can definitely see definite
corners<00:04:25.220> sorry<00:04:26.220> hexagons

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
corners sorry hexagons

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.130 
corners sorry hexagons
and<00:04:29.250> then<00:04:30.250> we're<00:04:30.670> in<00:04:30.910> getting<00:04:31.540> into<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.930> third

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
and then we're in getting into the third

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.720 
and then we're in getting into the third
row<00:04:32.350> so<00:04:32.530> we're<00:04:32.620> back<00:04:32.770> at<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.100> beginning<00:04:33.190> again

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
row so we're back at the beginning again

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.030 
row so we're back at the beginning again
and<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.840> time<00:04:35.170> you're<00:04:35.350> going<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.710> two

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
and this time you're going to do two

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.960 
and this time you're going to do two
stitches<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:39.340> first<00:04:39.580> stitch<00:04:42.720> one<00:04:43.720> stitch

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
stitches in the first stitch one stitch

the<00:05:11.380> corners<00:05:11.860> in<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.100> shape<00:05:12.340> of<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.700> come<00:05:12.970> on

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
the corners in the shape of this come on

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.930 
the corners in the shape of this come on
now<00:05:13.600> if<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.990> were<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.640> continue<00:05:15.640> increasing

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
now if you were to continue increasing

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.690 
now if you were to continue increasing
in<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:16.870> same<00:05:17.140> stitch<00:05:17.500> all<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.890> way<00:05:18.190> out<00:05:18.490> as

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
in the same stitch all the way out as

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.300 
in the same stitch all the way out as
you<00:05:18.820> go<00:05:19.000> out<00:05:19.920> as<00:05:21.060> in<00:05:22.060> a<00:05:22.180> radial<00:05:22.570> way<00:05:22.980> you'll<00:05:23.980> see

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
you go out as in a radial way you'll see

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.110 
you go out as in a radial way you'll see
definite<00:05:24.910> corners<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:25.900> sides<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:27.700> your<00:05:27.880> piece

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
definite corners and sides to your piece

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.900 
definite corners and sides to your piece
if<00:05:28.420> you<00:05:28.480> prefer<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.470> more<00:05:29.620> round<00:05:30.130> shape<00:05:30.580> and

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
if you prefer a more round shape and

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.630 
if you prefer a more round shape and
less<00:05:31.200> geometric<00:05:32.200> square<00:05:32.770> or<00:05:33.040> triangular

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
less geometric square or triangular

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
less geometric square or triangular
hexagonal<00:05:34.450> then<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.980> increase<00:05:36.700> in<00:05:37.090> different

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
hexagonal then you increase in different

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.230 
hexagonal then you increase in different
places<00:05:37.900> in<00:05:38.440> each<00:05:38.710> row<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:39.250> you'll<00:05:39.790> get<00:05:39.910> a<00:05:39.970> more

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
places in each row and you'll get a more

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.930 
places in each row and you'll get a more
round<00:05:40.630> looking<00:05:41.320> piece<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:41.950> you<00:05:42.550> really<00:05:42.820> won't

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
round looking piece and you really won't

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.090 
round looking piece and you really won't
be<00:05:43.150> able<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.420> tell<00:05:43.780> all<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.080> much<00:05:44.470> where<00:05:44.860> the

be able to tell all that much where the

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.920 
be able to tell all that much where the
increases<00:05:45.730> are<00:05:45.760> happening<00:05:48.090> alright<00:05:49.090> so<00:05:49.630> as

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
increases are happening alright so as

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.380 
increases are happening alright so as
you<00:05:49.960> keep<00:05:50.230> going<00:05:50.470> when<00:05:51.340> you<00:05:51.460> get<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:51.910> little<00:05:52.120> bit

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
you keep going when you get a little bit

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.000 
you keep going when you get a little bit
bigger<00:05:52.630> a<00:05:54.270> definite<00:05:55.270> shape<00:05:55.570> is<00:05:56.260> starting<00:05:56.890> to

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
bigger a definite shape is starting to

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.510 
bigger a definite shape is starting to
take<00:05:57.220> place<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:59.290> when<00:05:59.620> you're<00:05:59.800> you're<00:06:00.160> the

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
take place and when you're you're the

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.370 
take place and when you're you're the
bottom<00:06:00.880> of<00:06:01.030> your<00:06:01.060> bag<00:06:01.390> is<00:06:01.660> as<00:06:01.810> big<00:06:02.080> as<00:06:02.230> you

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
bottom of your bag is as big as you

bottom of your bag is as big as you
would<00:06:02.530> like<00:06:02.710> it<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.890> be<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:04.330> just<00:06:04.630> start<00:06:04.960> doing

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
would like it to be you just start doing

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.460 
would like it to be you just start doing
one<00:06:06.250> stitch<00:06:06.610> in<00:06:06.880> every<00:06:07.150> stitch<00:06:07.420> going<00:06:08.200> all<00:06:08.350> the

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
one stitch in every stitch going all the

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.340 
one stitch in every stitch going all the
way<00:06:08.500> around<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.940> sides<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.600> the<00:06:10.840> bag<00:06:11.020> will

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
way around and the sides of the bag will

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.350 
way around and the sides of the bag will
will<00:06:11.620> start<00:06:11.920> to<00:06:12.070> form<00:06:12.310> themselves<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:13.030> you'll

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
will start to form themselves and you'll

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.740 
will start to form themselves and you'll
start<00:06:13.600> to<00:06:13.810> go<00:06:14.350> from<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.920> flat<00:06:15.400> piece<00:06:15.720> to<00:06:16.720> a

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
start to go from a flat piece to a

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.180 
start to go from a flat piece to a
three-dimensional<00:06:17.140> piece<00:06:18.960> there<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.080> go<00:06:20.290> so

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
three-dimensional piece there you go so

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.760 
three-dimensional piece there you go so
I<00:06:21.550> hope<00:06:21.760> that<00:06:22.000> that<00:06:22.180> helps<00:06:22.540> illuminate<00:06:23.290> this

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
I hope that that helps illuminate this

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.730 
I hope that that helps illuminate this
