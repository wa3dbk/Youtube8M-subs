00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.744
Hey, Armando. Armando! 

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.345
– It’s me, bro.
– What?

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:13.346
Over here, over here. 

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.115
– It’s me.
– What’s that? 

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.249
– Hey, Jorge!
– What’s up, bro?

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.485
– Good to see you, man!
– So, what’s up?

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.253
– I’m on a trip, man.
– On vacation?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.922
Yeah, on vacation, I’m taking 
the opportunity to travel.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.258
I’ve worked the whole year, right? 
I gotta take a little break, right?

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.960
Sure. Are you traveling by yourself?

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.796
No, I’m going with my wife 
and the two kids. Yeah!

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:30.430
Where are they, 
I don’t see them here.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.866
No, They’re not here because
 we’re traveling apart. 

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.969
We’re using our miles. 
I’m using the miles, I got to use my miles.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:39.205
but each one is taking a different path, 
so we could use them. 

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.642
Yeah, I got lucky that the bus service 
is now part of the Star Alliance… 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.543
– Is that so?
– Yeah. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.112
So I got a real good deal. 
Cause all the flights were taken. 

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.049
Claudia, for example, 
my wife is going by donkey to Maceió,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.984
and she’ll take 
a motorcycle there to…

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.685
– Where are you going?
– We’re going Miami!

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.855
I’m doing Galeão – Guarulhos, 
Guarulhos – Campinas, 

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.657
Campinas – Belém, 
Belém – Bogotá, 

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.661
Bogotá – Mexico City, and on Mexico City 
I’ll take the ferryboat to Miami. 

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.464
– It’s nice, right? Cool.
– Very nice, man. What about the kids?

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:09.803
Luquinhas is going by boat, 
he’s getting a ride on a boat to Cuiabá, 

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.306
and we’re trying to get him another ride on 
one of those collective buying websites…

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.840
Cool.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.476
And Leozinho, the youngest, 
our newborn, right? 

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.511
He’s getting a ride 
on a truck straight to Miami.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.480
– Straight to Miami?
– Yeah, it’s a privilege.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.349
On a car seat and all… 
Yeah, very nice. Cool.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.518
You got lucky, right? 
You got a nice seat.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.888
Yeah, I’m on business class, man! 
Yeah…

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.157
Belém – Bogotá – Miami, 
through Resende!

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.193
What about you? 
Where are you heading to?

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.595
– No, I’m just going downtown.
– Oh, cool!

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.063
But when are you 
coming back from Miami?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.732
We’re not sure about that yet. 
The future is still too open, right? 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.503
Cause I don’t have much, right? It’s kinda hard 
to find a flight back… using miles. 

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:47.941
So actually what I’m… oh, hi, what’s up?
 But we’re coming back eventually. 

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.845
Throughout the year, we’ll probably 
come back, little by little.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:56.216
But I’ve already got a steady job there in Miami,
 just in case… and also for Luquinha, 

00:01:56.382 --> 00:02:00.253
so we could save some money, send an amount,
 save a little more, send another amount.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.288
So we’ll come back
 throughout the year.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.790
– Yeah.
– But you’re not going on a trip? 

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.692
Me? Well, I don’t know, 
I’m still thinking about it.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.594
Hey, I see... nice, right?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.897
Yeah, I’m saving some miles 
to travel to Paris by the end of the year.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.966
– Yeah, cool… what year?
– This year now.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.535
– By the end of this year? With miles?
– Yeah.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:19.072
Look, Jorge, I’m planning 
this trip here since 97. 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.976
Do you wanna use your miles this year, Jorge?
 Do you wanna go to Paris? 

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.880
Hey, he wanna go to Paris 
by the end of the year using miles! 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.552
Let’s go to London, everybody! 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.888
Right?

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.662
Hey!

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.232
Let me just… 
How are you? 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.067
Can you? Yeah. 

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.837
– Do you go through Brasilia?
– Yeah.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.572
Great. I’ll just… 

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.908
Do you accept miles?
 I’ve accumulated some. 

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:57.810
Great. Let me just… 

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:03.016
Maybe I could put 
my luggage here… and you…

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:07.921
Yeah, it’s cold, right? They turn the 
ac up and it gets too cold, right? 

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.925
Wait. Let me see.
