on<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.110> these<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.800> install<00:00:35.670> drivers

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
on and on and these can install drivers

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.000 
on and on and these can install drivers
on<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> system<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.989> they<00:00:37.530> could<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.890> be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
on the system and they could just be

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
on the system and they could just be
left<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.969> cause<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> lot<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
left there and they can cause a lot of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360 
left there and they can cause a lot of
confliction<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.379> confusion<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.890> windows

into<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.910> actual<00:01:03.180> system<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> time<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
into the actual system at the time and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.649 
into the actual system at the time and
that's<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.450> want<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.260 
showing you hidden devices but it
doesn't<00:01:15.990> show<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.369> drivers<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
doesn't show you drivers that are on the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
doesn't show you drivers that are on the
system<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.659> aren't<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
system that aren't in use and this is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.890 
system that aren't in use and this is
what<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.670> need<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.390> remove<00:01:21.720> these

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
what we need to do to remove these

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
what we need to do to remove these
drivers<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.799> might<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> causing<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
drivers that might be causing a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.999 
drivers that might be causing a
confliction<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.960> you're<00:01:25.110> using<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.590> USB

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
confliction when you're using a USB

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
confliction when you're using a USB
device<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.450> we're<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.080> make

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
device so what we're going to do is make

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
device so what we're going to do is make
a<00:01:28.409> couple<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.890> little<00:01:29.009> word<00:01:29.220> tweaks<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
a couple of little word tweaks to the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.399 
a couple of little word tweaks to the
system<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.869> we're<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> use<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
system and then we're going to use a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.499 
system and then we're going to use a
driver<00:01:31.710> cleanup<00:01:32.159> tool<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.790> remove<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
driver cleanup tool to remove all the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.550 
driver cleanup tool to remove all the
USB<00:01:33.750> drivers<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.670> gets<00:01:35.850> started<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
USB drivers so this gets started so the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.050 
USB drivers so this gets started so the
first<00:01:37.590> thing<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.340> down<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.909> go

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
first thing I want to do down here is go

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.060 
first thing I want to do down here is go
to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> advanced<00:01:40.049> system<00:01:40.650> Sainz

as you can see it's removed quite a lot
from<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.950> system<00:05:21.340> now<00:05:21.820> these<00:05:22.180> can<00:05:22.420> build<00:05:22.690> up

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840

over<00:05:22.990> time<00:05:23.110> as<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.560> said<00:05:23.770> this<00:05:23.890> is<00:05:23.950> pretty<00:05:24.340> much

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
over time as I said this is pretty much

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.120 
over time as I said this is pretty much
a<00:05:24.550> fresh<00:05:24.940> install<00:05:25.360> so<00:05:26.290> there<00:05:26.440> isn't<00:05:26.560> much<00:05:26.860> on

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
a fresh install so there isn't much on

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.570 
a fresh install so there isn't much on
the<00:05:27.280> system<00:05:27.670> and<00:05:28.230> once<00:05:29.230> that's<00:05:29.410> done<00:05:29.580> we're

pretty much good to go now you can
remove<00:05:32.080> this<00:05:32.380> from<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.370> system<00:05:33.760> if<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:33.910> want
