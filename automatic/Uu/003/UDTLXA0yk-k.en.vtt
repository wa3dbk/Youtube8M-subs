00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:03.600
 Viebahn from before 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 for it's 16-year-old 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 still unclear 0 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.409
 the Geisecker SV VfL much before for the deselection is well-known for 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.640
 because not only 4 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.019
 his expertise but also for 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.259
 definitely the genotype I become the players 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.259
 we hope for many spectators a young lady 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.219
 Wunderkind from Korea primitive flow money laundering championships 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.349
 possibly already 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.300
 a lot of guilt 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.519
 that should be seen 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.260
 Turner looking to the future 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.110
 with four games, its value leads to the level 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.959
 with the ladies 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.869
 in figure skating percent concerns 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.129
 yes and definitely 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.030
 the jumps are excellent from the quality 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.099
 certainly with the costs up 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.790
 compare significantly better than the foremost master also she had a lot 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.029
 Time still misses triple and school 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.459
 True, the whalers percent dec 11 backwards hooked 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.069
 like most on 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.960
 "Incredibly good" fantastic program has a great presence 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.230
 very very nice rest 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.930
 in Dubai Radiance Wenger comes everything there everything comes together we want 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.110
 JU after fading you save yourself the triple toe-loop 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.379
 because some ladies troubles the sozis plunders first jump Cinar and 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.989
 Handy Boss, too, of course 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.989
 What I particularly like is the following 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.569
 Dell does not offer the trade the jumps 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:26.169
 and this is how it continues with Juliette 0-shooter shine 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.520
 Percent is she builds a program and the double-axel comes from Voss 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.879
 on Mauritius Combinations in the Air 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.800
 very well distributed the elements proved to be very difficult where the whole 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.050
 Two minutes 50 that it can also harsh impression that she has the courage 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.990
 Just wait to make some other elements first then the Lutz in there 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.430
 the middle of the program are armpit at the end of the program that speaks for their 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.340
 Safety is the one of her spoken axes from the Tina Bauer 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.629
 Moon around it really Heermann one percent off and way like the Koreans 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.080
 At the time of the performance, they are also so confident when they are 16 years old 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.930
 World Championships on 2 5 you almost think she is already an old hand bunny with 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.969
 to the 6 wm-participations but no 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.729
 Inlet is we lose one percent 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.689
 Martin Loos is strong 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.299
 the kicker skin in first place now sure that Russia but 

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:20.219
 also consider it realistic 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.550
 and I am against it 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.450
 Everything tells PremiÃ¨re only elected 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.580
 we have rarely experienced so far 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.759
 at such a level 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.960
 All this must certainly be two days but could also be the number one spot 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.419
 that must be said that was equal to the presentation by Carolina Kostner 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.419
 May the 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.699
 the heartfelt construction of a production 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.389
 but minor people the first expected in the current year madness that the SP 4 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.749
 the first 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:59.339
 Bad Nauheim El the plaintiff Akin a cultural heritage that is so to speak 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.469
 That's 71 or 95 points 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.469
 world Record 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.029
 74 45 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.059
 four and a half points more than Carlyle Group
