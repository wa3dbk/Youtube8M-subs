00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.560
 Y 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.639
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.140
 trailer well let's little more than week 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.599
 after a long time without knowing 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.130
 no personal promotions and before 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.410
 I would like to comment on everything 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.349
 cold so ask forgiveness for my voice 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.119
 well this time to compensate I bring you 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.430
 a pokémon that can be understood by 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.980
 two totally different and we're 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.540
 pokemon output talking flame 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.210
 which occupies the number 6 of our little 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.250
 dysfunctional good by all is known 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.050
 that in this new generation to realize is 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.940
 the only pokemon with YouTube permission 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.890
 who has not acquired a single 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.290
 evolution but two governments like this 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.610
 unpredictable for the rival not knowing 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.360
 all the information of this little are going to 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.820
 go out to the field 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.860
 As I say today I bring you two musset 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.690
 one to perform X and another to 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.550
 perform and so let's start 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.050
 first of all let's discuss the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.430
 skill that I personally think that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.380
 more should be beyond their ability 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.449
 basic that increases the power of 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.710
 Fire attacks by 50 percent 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.690
 when the pokemon has one third of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.280
 life and at least stability is more 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.740
 useful that solar power that is the skill 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.810
 hidden since if it is sunny we will lose 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.900
 one eighth of our health in exchange for 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.640
 increase so special 50% well 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.710
 commented on this let's start against 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.450
 liza de x which is the most versatile since 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.610
 to revolutionize acquires the kind of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.470
 dragon losing flying type and so 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.300
 so much gives option to you can use of 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.430
 different ways as we said the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.560
 skill will be more flames and the object 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.880
 equipped will launch this appointment x in 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 about the ability of the vananchal to raise 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.229
 This is a hard claw that has the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.600
 particularity of increasing power the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.610
 contact physical attacks by 30% 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 therefore we see that to take advantage 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.759
 solid is at maximum 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.950
 it is necessary that perform x be attacker 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.810
 physical and therefore the nature that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.190
 we will choose will be cheerful that increases your 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.360
 speed against reducing a 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.420
 inspection can also 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.160
 the firm preferred lucid force over 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.290
 the partition of the eps we are going to 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.900
 complicate too much since there will be four 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 of health points 252 in the attack 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.750
 and finally 252 in speed with 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.390
 these statistics and level 100 the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.130
 meazza distan x would count with 298 points 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 of health 359 physical attack 258 of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.720
 defense 2 169 of embodiment 206 of 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.970
 special defense and finally 328 in 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.220
 speed as we see is a pokémon with 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.230
 very balanced characteristics and that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.239
 with his dragon fire type he only has three 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.860
 weaknesses a rock and the earth since 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.660
 prevents the winning type and therefore 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.090
 we must think well the moment what 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.950
 We want to solve this 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.720
 about the movements to specialize 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 let's start with dragon spear that 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.069
 attacks and increases speed by 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.379
 50% and if we start taking and thus of 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.769
 shave x will now have 500 of them at 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.200
 physical attack and 492 speed adding 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.760
 also the claw ability lasts this 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.349
 Pokemon can be lethal for most 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 of the rivals we go with a movement 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.910
 of damage dragon claw which has seven 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.099
 of power and are of precision in addition to 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.629
 have this mega satirizing dragon and that 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.519
 added to the mentioned statistics 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.709
 previously you can get to do 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.390
 a lot of damage in another movement with the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.489
 crystallize will cause many casualties 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.200
 will be envite and I think with 120 of 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.870
 power and 100 precision type 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.700
 game and with ability to burn in addition 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.650
 of losing is unharmed increased by the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.629
 hard claw just like aragon 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.190
 just finish with any 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.260
 pokemon that does not have a very strong resistance 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.239
 great to this guy otherwise the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 last movement is respite to be able 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.510
 cure the fins after some limit 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.879
 igneous or after having used 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.620
 launches dragon as you see is a pokémon of 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.660
 very fast use but we do know 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.349
 use it well can give very good 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.610
 results 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.610
 Easily hydrate your rivals 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.830
 well then let's make several birds 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.209
 of the physical attack so now it touches your 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.459
 counterpart the side heart and 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.140
 personally the one I like the most 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.610
 two while the case of the previous 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.010
 start is 'possible' plus statistics 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.290
 similar attack and especially the third 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.580
 and it has a lot more special attack like that 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.860
 that there is no doubt that we will 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.600
 situation 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.520
 about nature we will talk 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.230
 fears has increased its speed and 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.180
 reduce attacks or bothers 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.860
 although honestly as explained in the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.390
 previous case I mean with 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.579
 speed so scary be the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.019
 nature that we discuss the distribution 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.880
 of beings will be the same as that of 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.570
 perform x but instead of attack 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.510
 special attack therefore 4 ps 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.060
 252 to so special and 252 in the speed 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.970
 with these points and level 100 saizar and 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.750
 you will have following characteristics 298 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:40.730
 of health 222 in the 192 attack on the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:43.940
 417 defense of social attack 226 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.639
 social protection and finally 328 in the 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.680
 speed 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.560
 the object that we will take away as it is 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.479
 logical will be the room and as we see its 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.979
 Special bird is a bestiality but that 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.419
 it's not all since its ability drought 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.150
 will activate sunny weather 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.169
 automatically for five turns 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.389
 thus increasing type movements 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.520
 fire among other things taking advantage 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.409
 this great skill that is what it does 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.909
 that I opted for this version is 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.039
 smoothen we will comment the 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.949
 movements the first of all is called 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.719
 nava since it has 110 power and 85 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.389
 of precision has the starter 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:19.240
 saizar and also thanks to the weather has 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.729
 increased its power by 50% said of 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.120
 another way these flares have 220 of 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.219
 power adding the 407 points great 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.110
 special this movement can destroy 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.330
 everything that prevents ahead and 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.939
 doing quick calculations does one hit 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.680
 ko to any pokemon with 250 points 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:36.720
 health and the others is the action 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.490
 special 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.020
 following with movements that take advantage 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.270
 the sun we meet with solar rays 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.550
 plant movement of 120 power 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.620
 and 7 precision that although it does not earn points 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.780
 because the sun makes the movement 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.640
 it is done in a single shift the save 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.560
 of charge energy as it is normal and so 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.120
 so much will come to us of pearls to treat 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.220
 common pokemon on earth as per 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.070
 example mouse wash the third movement 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.440
 to strike and strike the dragon with the 35 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.090
 of power and 100 precision is something to 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.800
 keep in mind at the time of the center 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.180
 dragon type rivals so with 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.350
 Coverage movements to meters 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.600
 cool 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.160
 to finalize his last movement what 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.710
 I leave to your choice being able to be 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.720
 weapon of 120 power and 70 of 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.940
 accuracy of fight type and that can 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.260
 reduce the goal difference if not 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.180
 do you trust the low request of this 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.790
 movement is always to remain an air shortcut 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.430
 with 75 power 112 by the state of 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.900
 type devourer and 95 of precision that 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.090
 It also has the side effect of 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.770
 be able to push back the rival as 6 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.140
 at the beginning I see him more at 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.120
 Sáizar and both coverage and power 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.490
 of your movements but you know that 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.710
 as I always say this at ease and according to 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.300
 the needs of each team so 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.340
 good that you decide with whom chávez to 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.170
 what you give for elements is not everything I 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.180
 I say goodbye now, as I always tell you

 good 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:14.830
 behind 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:14.830
 a bike trip to the island for gold 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.069
 for the drool
