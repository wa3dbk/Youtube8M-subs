600 m this is a 600 watt power supply

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.480 
600 m this is a 600 watt power supply
which<00:04:38.680> means<00:04:38.890> going<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.190> more<00:04:39.400> than

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
which means going to have more than

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.980 
which means going to have more than
enough<00:04:39.550> power<00:04:39.730> for<00:04:40.030> our<00:04:40.270> build<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.750> for

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
enough power for our build and for

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.650 
enough power for our build and for
overclocking<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:42.130> we<00:04:42.220> can<00:04:42.370> push<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.700> 8320<00:04:43.270> to

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
overclocking so we can push the 8320 to

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.480 
overclocking so we can push the 8320 to
above<00:04:44.170> 4<00:04:44.380> gigahertz<00:04:44.620> as<00:04:44.950> we<00:04:45.070> mentioned<00:04:45.460> before

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
above 4 gigahertz as we mentioned before

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.940 
above 4 gigahertz as we mentioned before
and<00:04:46.000> yeah<00:04:46.960> other<00:04:47.200> than<00:04:47.290> that<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> modular

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
and yeah other than that is a modular

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.500 
and yeah other than that is a modular
power<00:04:48.370> supply<00:04:48.490> which<00:04:48.940> means<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.270> don't<00:04:49.420> have

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
power supply which means you don't have

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.930 
power supply which means you don't have
used<00:04:49.720> all<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.200> cables<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.830> can<00:04:51.250> pick<00:04:51.790> and

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
used all of the cables you can pick and

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.520 
used all of the cables you can pick and
choose<00:04:52.000> which<00:04:52.270> cables<00:04:52.660> you<00:04:52.720> need<00:04:52.780> according

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
choose which cables you need according

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.860 
choose which cables you need according
to<00:04:53.560> walk<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:54.190> little

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
to walk a little

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.690 
to walk a little

finally<00:05:00.870> coming<00:05:01.170> onto<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.410> case<00:05:01.620> we're

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
finally coming onto the case we're

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.380 
finally coming onto the case we're
getting<00:05:02.010> using<00:05:02.220> a<00:05:02.280> corsair<00:05:02.730> carbide<00:05:02.940> series

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390

getting using a corsair carbide series
200<00:05:04.140> are<00:05:04.380> as<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.950> can<00:05:05.100> see<00:05:05.190> here<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> previous

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
200 are as you can see here a previous

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.310 
200 are as you can see here a previous
importance<00:05:06.180> case<00:05:06.330> before<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:07.140> it's

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
importance case before and it's

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.930 
importance case before and it's
currently<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.830> case<00:05:07.950> that<00:05:08.220> is<00:05:08.340> housing<00:05:08.580> my

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
currently the case that is housing my

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.030 
currently the case that is housing my
goal<00:05:09.180> right<00:05:09.510> now<00:05:09.570> it's<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.260> really<00:05:10.470> solid<00:05:10.740> case

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
goal right now it's a really solid case

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.980 
goal right now it's a really solid case
it's<00:05:11.370> designed<00:05:11.730> really<00:05:11.940> well<00:05:12.210> most<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.900> is

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
it's designed really well most of it is

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.570 
it's designed really well most of it is
made<00:05:13.140> out<00:05:13.290> of<00:05:13.320> steel<00:05:13.650> however<00:05:14.130> there<00:05:14.340> are<00:05:14.400> some

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
made out of steel however there are some

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.190 
made out of steel however there are some
bits<00:05:14.820> made<00:05:15.000> out<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.240> plastic<00:05:15.600> such<00:05:15.870> as<00:05:16.050> the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
bits made out of plastic such as the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.140 
bits made out of plastic such as the
hard<00:05:16.410> drive<00:05:16.620> cage<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.490> optical<00:05:17.970> drive

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
hard drive cage and the optical drive

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.120 
hard drive cage and the optical drive
cage<00:05:18.420> the<00:05:19.050> reason<00:05:19.320> they<00:05:19.410> made<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.590> plastic<00:05:20.010> is

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
cage the reason they made a plastic is

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.770 
cage the reason they made a plastic is
because<00:05:20.400> they<00:05:20.580> have<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.970> listen<00:05:21.330> stelae<00:05:21.570> shin

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
because they have to listen stelae shin

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.660 
because they have to listen stelae shin
so<00:05:22.320> you<00:05:22.410> don't<00:05:22.620> have<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:22.830> screw<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.250> any<00:05:23.400> hard

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
so you don't have to screw in any hard

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.910 
so you don't have to screw in any hard
drives<00:05:23.910> optical<00:05:24.870> drive<00:05:24.900> cables<00:05:25.500> sit<00:05:25.740> there

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
drives optical drive cables sit there

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.530 
drives optical drive cables sit there
and<00:05:26.130> they<00:05:26.310> will<00:05:26.460> sit<00:05:26.640> there<00:05:26.790> firmly<00:05:27.150> in<00:05:27.510> place

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
and they will sit there firmly in place

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.870 
and they will sit there firmly in place
and<00:05:28.140> you're<00:05:28.320> not<00:05:28.560> move<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.310> is<00:05:29.430> how<00:05:29.520> good<00:05:29.730> the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
and you're not move that is how good the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.460 
and you're not move that is how good the
structure<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:30.360> in<00:05:30.540> this<00:05:30.690> case<00:05:30.900> other<00:05:31.440> than

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
structure is in this case other than

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.440 
structure is in this case other than
that<00:05:31.710> it's<00:05:31.890> got<00:05:32.010> good<00:05:32.160> airflow<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.760> it's<00:05:33.330> got

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
that it's got good airflow and it's got

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.180 
that it's got good airflow and it's got
support<00:05:33.750> for<00:05:33.900> front<00:05:34.080> panel<00:05:34.350> USB<00:05:34.380> free<00:05:34.920> panos

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
support for front panel USB free panos

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.740 
support for front panel USB free panos
so<00:05:35.460> we<00:05:35.550> can<00:05:35.700> use<00:05:35.790> the<00:05:35.910> front<00:05:36.150> panel<00:05:36.270> header<00:05:36.540> on

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
so we can use the front panel header on

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.900 
so we can use the front panel header on
our<00:05:36.900> motherboard<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.560> as<00:05:38.280> well<00:05:38.430> as<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.670> you
