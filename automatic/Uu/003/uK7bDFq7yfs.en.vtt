look<00:00:12.360> at<00:00:12.509> shaft<00:00:12.750> dimensions<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.469> got<00:00:13.620> rounded

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
look at shaft dimensions we got rounded

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.160 
look at shaft dimensions we got rounded
corners<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.460> slightly<00:00:15.150> concave<00:00:15.450> sidewalls

corners and slightly concave sidewalls

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
corners and slightly concave sidewalls
they're<00:00:16.710> still<00:00:17.250> pretty<00:00:17.520> straight<00:00:17.880> offering

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
they're still pretty straight offering

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.300 
they're still pretty straight offering

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
your nice traditional holding the hands

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.700 
your nice traditional holding the hands
now<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.420> into<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> shaft<00:00:21.990> design<00:00:22.410> here

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
now get into the shaft design here

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.769 
now get into the shaft design here
they're<00:00:23.310> using<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> lot<00:00:23.880> higher<00:00:24.119> grade<00:00:24.420> carbon

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
they're using a lot higher grade carbon

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
they're using a lot higher grade carbon
fiber<00:00:24.990> than<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.380> we've<00:00:25.500> seen<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.859> 40<00:00:26.279> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
fiber than what we've seen the 40 and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.130 
fiber than what we've seen the 40 and
they're<00:00:26.760> also<00:00:26.939> blending<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.869> little

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
they're also blending it with a little

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.660 
they're also blending it with a little
bit<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.439> fiberglass<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> give

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bit of fiberglass so it's going to give

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
bit of fiberglass so it's going to give
you<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> nice<00:00:30.150> responsiveness<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> pop

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you that nice responsiveness and pop

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.680 
you that nice responsiveness and pop
also<00:00:32.250> getting<00:00:32.430> some<00:00:32.669> great<00:00:32.910> durability<00:00:33.360> out

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
also getting some great durability out

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.139 
also getting some great durability out
of<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.770> getting<00:00:35.190> into<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> taper<00:00:35.880> here

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of it now getting into the taper here

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.790 
of it now getting into the taper here
this<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.110> call<00:00:37.260> their<00:00:37.410> tapered

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
this is what they call their tapered

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
this is what they call their tapered
profile<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.300> too

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
profile but you can see it's not too

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.319 
profile but you can see it's not too
drastic<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.469> taper<00:00:40.710> into<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> blade<00:00:41.489> like

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
drastic of a taper into the blade like

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720 
drastic of a taper into the blade like
that<00:00:42.600> elliptical<00:00:43.320> taper<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.070> we've<00:00:44.219> seen<00:00:44.489> on

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that elliptical taper that we've seen on

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
that elliptical taper that we've seen on
the<00:00:44.789> stealth<00:00:45.239> series<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> while<00:00:46.079> it's

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
into the blade design we're gonna see

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
into the blade design we're gonna see
that<00:01:02.160> multi<00:01:02.820> segmented<00:01:03.449> PU<00:01:03.870> blade<00:01:04.170> core<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that multi segmented PU blade core that

that multi segmented PU blade core that
has<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> nice<00:01:05.100> traditional<00:01:05.700> feel<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.750> also

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
has a nice traditional feel and it also

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140 
has a nice traditional feel and it also
uses<00:01:07.290> their<00:01:07.619> micro<00:01:08.010> bladder<00:01:08.250> blade<00:01:08.610> process

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
uses their micro bladder blade process

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
uses their micro bladder blade process
that<00:01:09.360> gives<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.990> consistent<00:01:10.650> puck

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
that gives you really consistent puck

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.460 
that gives you really consistent puck
feel<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.670> heel<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> toe<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> big<00:01:13.229> upgrade

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
feel from heel to toe now a big upgrade

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
feel from heel to toe now a big upgrade
that<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.950> saw<00:01:14.189> compared<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> forty<00:01:15.360> is

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that we saw compared to that forty is

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.620 
that we saw compared to that forty is
gonna<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.560> 6k<00:01:17.100> carbon<00:01:17.549> weave<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.509> is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
gonna be the 6k carbon weave this is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.850 
gonna be the 6k carbon weave this is
going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.869> help<00:01:18.990> give<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.320> an<00:01:19.439> overall

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
going to help give you an overall

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
going to help give you an overall
lighter<00:01:20.340> stick<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.390> also<00:01:21.540> helps<00:01:21.960> balance

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lighter stick and it also helps balance

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 
lighter stick and it also helps balance
this<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.799> little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.250> better<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this out a little bit better because it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
this out a little bit better because it
removes<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.600> bit<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> weight<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.170> in

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
removes a little bit of weight that's in

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.410 
removes a little bit of weight that's in
the<00:01:25.530> blade<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.070> which<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.700> turn<00:01:26.880> gives<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the blade here which in turn gives you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
the blade here which in turn gives you
that<00:01:27.570> better<00:01:27.780> balance<00:01:28.229> point<00:01:28.549> now<00:01:29.549> we're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that better balance point now we're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
that better balance point now we're
seeing<00:01:29.909> two<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.570> great<00:01:30.689> technologies<00:01:31.439> in

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
seeing two really great technologies in

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550 
seeing two really great technologies in
this<00:01:32.220> 60<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> first<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.869> hyper<00:01:34.290> two

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
this 60 the first one is a hyper two

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
this 60 the first one is a hyper two
blade<00:01:34.829> design<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.820> saw<00:01:36.240> first<00:01:36.570> premiered

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
blade design that we saw first premiered

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.050 
blade design that we saw first premiered
in<00:01:37.110> velocity<00:01:37.560> series<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.850> some

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
in velocity series now you have some

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
in velocity series now you have some
rods<00:01:39.270> stiffeners<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> very

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
rods stiffeners right here in the very

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
rods stiffeners right here in the very
tip<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> toe<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.659> helps

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tip of the toe and this really helps

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
tip of the toe and this really helps
again<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.530> give<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.220> stiff

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
again just to give you a really stiff

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
again just to give you a really stiff
toe<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.780> acts<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> diving<00:01:46.680> board

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
toe here so it acts like a diving board

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.499 
toe here so it acts like a diving board
when<00:01:47.280> you're<00:01:47.399> using<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.850> toe<00:01:48.090> shooting

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
when you're using that toe shooting

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.749 
when you're using that toe shooting
technique<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.619> way<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.799> Easton<00:01:50.340> puts<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
technique so the way that Easton puts it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.969 
technique so the way that Easton puts it
the<00:01:51.210> further<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.020> toe<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the further out on the toe you are the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
the further out on the toe you are the
more<00:01:53.220> pop<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> velocity<00:01:54.149> you're<00:01:54.299> gonna<00:01:54.390> get

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
more pop and velocity you're gonna get

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.410 
more pop and velocity you're gonna get
now<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:56.009> continue<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
now to really continue with that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.080 
now to really continue with that
ideology<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:58.770> introduced<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.520> hyper<00:01:59.759> tuned

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ideology they introduced the hyper tuned

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
ideology they introduced the hyper tuned
technology<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.500> coming<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.310> year

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
technology that is coming out this year

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.240 
technology that is coming out this year
now<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:04.020> uses<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:04.740> more<00:02:04.950> broad

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
now what this is it uses some more broad

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.889 
now what this is it uses some more broad
stiffeners<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.090> run<00:02:06.270> through<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.479> center

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
stiffeners that run through the center

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
stiffeners that run through the center
here<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.259> these<00:02:07.829> stiffeners<00:02:08.640> actually<00:02:09.149> match

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
here and these stiffeners actually match

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.050 
here and these stiffeners actually match
the<00:02:09.450> stiffness<00:02:10.170> profile<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.920> your<00:02:11.099> shaft<00:02:11.370> so

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the stiffness profile of your shaft so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.600 
the stiffness profile of your shaft so
before<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.230> know<00:02:13.260> if

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
before you know if

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.150 
before you know if
using<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.030> 65<00:02:14.720> flex<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.410> would<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.710> really

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
using a 65 flex you would have a really

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.980 
using a 65 flex you would have a really
stiff<00:02:16.520> play<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.000> would<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.240> comparable<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.840> a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
stiff play that would be comparable to a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.650 
stiff play that would be comparable to a
hundred<00:02:18.470> flex<00:02:18.800> rating<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.850> what<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.150> does<00:02:20.390> it

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
hundred flex rating so what this does it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.040 
hundred flex rating so what this does it
mashes<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.110> with<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> 65<00:02:22.310> flex<00:02:22.760> blade<00:02:23.510> stiffness

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
mashes it with a 65 flex blade stiffness

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440 
mashes it with a 65 flex blade stiffness
profile<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.040> again<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.060> said<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.390> really

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
profile and again like I said it really

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.780 
profile and again like I said it really
takes<00:02:26.990> that<00:02:27.170> load<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.680> release<00:02:28.010> philosophy

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
takes that load and release philosophy

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.940 
takes that load and release philosophy
that<00:02:29.210> Easton<00:02:29.630> has<00:02:29.750> been<00:02:29.900> preaching<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.710> new

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
that Easton has been preaching to a new

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.400 
that Easton has been preaching to a new
level<00:02:31.400> because<00:02:31.820> now<00:02:32.240> not<00:02:32.870> only<00:02:33.170> are<00:02:33.290> you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
level because now not only are you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.260 
level because now not only are you
getting<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.950> maximum<00:02:34.190> power<00:02:34.730> out<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.030> your

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
getting the maximum power out of your

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.120 
getting the maximum power out of your
shaft<00:02:35.540> you're<00:02:36.110> also<00:02:36.290> getting<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.830> out<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.070> your

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
shaft you're also getting it out of your

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.160 
shaft you're also getting it out of your
blade<00:02:37.430> now<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> other<00:02:38.630> really<00:02:38.870> great<00:02:39.080> thing

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
blade now the other really great thing

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.890 
blade now the other really great thing
that<00:02:39.380> Easton<00:02:39.860> offers<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.880> these<00:02:41.240> synergy

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
that Easton offers in these synergy

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.960 
that Easton offers in these synergy
sticks<00:02:42.200> especially<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> hyper<00:02:43.550> tuned

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
sticks especially with the hyper tuned

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.150 
sticks especially with the hyper tuned
and<00:02:44.180> hyper<00:02:44.360> Totec<00:02:44.840> Knology<00:02:45.320> are<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.770> few

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
and hyper Totec Knology are a few

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.520 
and hyper Totec Knology are a few
different<00:02:46.550> dual<00:02:46.820> life<00:02:47.090> patterns<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:48.050> really

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
different dual life patterns that really

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.590 
different dual life patterns that really
give<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.010> perfect<00:02:49.280> shooting<00:02:49.880> angle<00:02:50.210> to

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
give you the perfect shooting angle to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.480 
give you the perfect shooting angle to
really<00:02:50.870> capitalize<00:02:51.350> on<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.650> hyper<00:02:51.920> toe<00:02:52.220> as

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
really capitalize on the hyper toe as

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.670 
really capitalize on the hyper toe as
well<00:02:52.760> as<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.000> hyper<00:02:53.209> tuned<00:02:53.540> technology<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.470> I

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
well as that hyper tuned technology so I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.650 
well as that hyper tuned technology so I
think<00:02:55.250> with<00:02:55.400> all<00:02:55.430> those<00:02:55.790> things<00:02:56.090> considered

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
think with all those things considered

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.050 
think with all those things considered
this<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.050> great<00:02:57.500> value<00:02:57.740> stick<00:02:58.280> as<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.910> can

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
this is a great value stick as you can

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.120 
this is a great value stick as you can
see<00:02:59.209> has<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> great<00:02:59.959> simple<00:03:00.440> look<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.010> and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
see has a great simple look to it and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.550 
see has a great simple look to it and
it's<00:03:01.520> open<00:03:02.300> it's<00:03:02.420> not<00:03:02.510> over<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.020> top<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.470> it

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
it's open it's not over the top and it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.490 
it's open it's not over the top and it
also<00:03:03.740> looks<00:03:04.100> like<00:03:04.280> all<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.820> other<00:03:05.030> HT<00:03:05.900> X's<00:03:06.320> as

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
also looks like all the other HT X's as

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.960 
also looks like all the other HT X's as
well<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.160> rest<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> eighties<00:03:07.940> and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
well as the rest of the eighties and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.210 
well as the rest of the eighties and
whatnot<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.750> keeps<00:03:08.930> sets<00:03:09.320> energy<00:03:09.800> family

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
whatnot so it keeps sets energy family

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.610 
whatnot so it keeps sets energy family
alive<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.300> for<00:03:11.510> even<00:03:11.750> more<00:03:11.900> information<00:03:12.050> on
