00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.250
 just how do you think how logical 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 I do not know the result of today's match 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.020
 how much the result was logical to win 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.210
 complicated 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.640
 the team is very organized that is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.970
 it was difficult to get the ball but as seen 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.460
 moment moments were just not 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.909
 realized you know from 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.829
 impression that the draw was 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:41.489
 acceptable outcomes for both teams so 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.319
 is it well I want if you want to say 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.309
 that we can play it on a draw or what 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:49.769
 it is not yet but I think in general probably yes 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.559
 all the same because at the end already 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:57.959
 a little bed can tell and 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.670
 losses to occur and pressure was too 

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:05.400
 exactly and could miss but draw will 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.500
 further the second lap was beautiful 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.320
 you have a chance in the second half there 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 prevented to score until very sorry at all 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.600
 I am not even presenting Lydia 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 I thought the same and not only me the rest 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.360
 everyone shared said they already saw 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.260
 the ball is in the net and well there the player set 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 I just didnâ€™t understand the sock myself 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.810
 just like that then you are generally like 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.380
 did you feel so confident having learned 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.510
 what are you de star there will make up what's needed 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.020
 I will leave in the old part well, generally good 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.840
 that is, just want to say yes 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 I repeat the Terek very well 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.370
 organized played defense and it was 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.909
 hard to get the ball and think of something 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:55.990
 what are you so 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:59.140
 what plans are now home moscow and there 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.600
 rest let's rest the sun on wanna see 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.459
 no longer rested on working with anyone 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.459
 I'm afraid. 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.459
 friends
