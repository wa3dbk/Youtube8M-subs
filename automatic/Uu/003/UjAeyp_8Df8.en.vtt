so as you can see you end up with that

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.880 
so as you can see you end up with that
and<00:01:37.030> then<00:01:37.210> if<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.480> show<00:01:37.930> them<00:01:38.170> I<00:01:38.260> can<00:01:38.290> them<00:01:38.620> say

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:51.310 
and then if I show them I can them say
one<00:01:39.100> thing<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:40.720> films<00:01:41.260> are<00:01:41.530> short<00:01:42.040> in<00:01:42.250> London

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.610 

so<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.370> gives<00:01:52.640> me<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.420> which<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.050> I<00:01:54.470> don't

so I think of this server it might be

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.630 
so I think of this server it might be
down<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.350> don't<00:02:00.620> know<00:02:00.710> let<00:02:01.010> me<00:02:01.070> try<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.610> more

in the pressure to perform page this is

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.260 
in the pressure to perform page this is
where<00:05:36.450> you<00:05:36.570> get<00:05:36.690> down<00:05:36.960> there<00:05:37.700> guys<00:05:38.700> be<00:05:39.000> careful

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
where you get down there guys be careful

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
look at the process but if we need not

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.780 
look at the process but if we need not
to<00:05:45.930> be<00:05:45.990> avoided<00:05:46.620> so<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.919> might<00:05:47.160> end<00:05:47.310> up<00:05:47.490> with<00:05:47.760> a

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790
