00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
would have been very young I mean he's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.630 
I just find a tremendous atmosphere to
his<00:01:06.570> paintings<00:01:07.230> sort<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.740> moving<00:01:08.040> quality<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
his paintings sort of moving quality I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.620

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
think there are for me suggestions of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
think there are for me suggestions of
distortions<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.520> memory<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.730> the<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
distortions of a memory in the way the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580 
distortions of a memory in the way the
faces<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.510> portrayed<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
faces are portrayed in a way that I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.149 
faces are portrayed in a way that I
found<00:01:16.770> fascinating<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:18.750> various<00:01:19.650> ways<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.070> my

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
found fascinating in various ways of my

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.360 
found fascinating in various ways of my

drawn<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:29.240> bleakness<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.810> really

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
drawn to the bleakness of it really

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
drawn to the bleakness of it really
because<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.910> whilst<00:01:32.910> it<00:01:33.090> might<00:01:33.240> be

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
because I think whilst it might be

because I think whilst it might be
emotionally<00:01:33.960> uncomfortable<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> bleakness

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
emotionally uncomfortable the bleakness

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.080 
emotionally uncomfortable the bleakness
of<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.590> represent<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.790> makes

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
it makes me think a lot about the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.900 
it makes me think a lot about the
geography<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.280> pending<00:02:47.519> about<00:02:47.700> whether

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
geography the pending about whether

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.500 
geography the pending about whether
Fergus<00:02:48.330> sits<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.780> world<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:50.510> quite

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
Fergus sits in the world and I quite

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.680 
Fergus sits in the world and I quite
like<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.230> paradoxical<00:02:53.040> nature<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.790> more<00:02:54.000> he

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
like the paradoxical nature the more he

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.869 
like the paradoxical nature the more he
removes<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.560> less<00:02:55.980> he<00:02:56.099> tells<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.610> really

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
removes the less he tells you really

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.369 
removes the less he tells you really
about<00:02:57.090> what's<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.540> there<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.870> more<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.080> find

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
about what's out there the more I find

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.020 
about what's out there the more I find
myself<00:02:58.500> thinking<00:02:58.709> about<00:02:59.190> what's<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
myself thinking about what's in that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.920 
myself thinking about what's in that
dark<00:03:00.690> space<00:03:00.959> behind<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.680> everything<00:03:02.930> because

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
dark space behind and everything because

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.070 
dark space behind and everything because
you<00:03:04.049> never<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:06.120> resources<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.690> fully

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
create the world that you're creating so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.630 
create the world that you're creating so
you<00:03:10.410> are<00:03:10.590> leaving<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.980> little<00:03:11.099> void<00:03:11.370> you're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
you are leaving a little void you're

you are leaving a little void you're
leaving<00:03:11.879> a<00:03:11.940> lot<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.150> gaps<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.870> part<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.590> what

unnecessary gaps intelligently so that

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.199 
unnecessary gaps intelligently so that
where<00:03:18.299> you're<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.599> showing<00:03:18.870> something<00:03:19.290> it's

where you're not showing something it's

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.059 
where you're not showing something it's
helping<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.360> rather<00:03:21.690> than<00:03:21.959> feeling<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
one of the interesting things for me

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.480 
one of the interesting things for me
about<00:03:29.980> seeing<00:03:31.680> paintings<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.800> real<00:03:32.950> life<00:03:33.160> is

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
about seeing paintings in real life is

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.190 
about seeing paintings in real life is
it's<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.480> completely<00:03:34.870> different<00:03:35.020> experience

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
it's a completely different experience

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.520 
it's a completely different experience
than<00:03:35.650> when<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> see<00:03:36.700> them<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.300> book<00:03:37.530> and

little bit more of personality to it I

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.910 
little bit more of personality to it I
think<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.770> helps<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.370> really<00:04:07.800> create<00:04:08.800> an

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
think that helps you really create an

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.100 
think that helps you really create an
atmosphere<00:04:09.070> for<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.580> audience<00:04:09.940> so<00:04:10.150> one<00:04:11.020> of

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
atmosphere for the audience so one of

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.440

the reasons that I I love film is that

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.740 
the reasons that I I love film is that
it<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> as<00:04:14.530> an<00:04:14.950> analog<00:04:15.250> medium<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:16.329> has<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:18.750> lot
