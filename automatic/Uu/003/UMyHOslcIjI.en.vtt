choose<00:05:15.270> developer<00:05:15.900> like<00:05:16.140> if<00:05:16.380> you've<00:05:16.590> been

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
choose developer like if you've been

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.380 
choose developer like if you've been
jailbroken<00:05:17.130> before<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.030> know<00:05:18.180> how<00:05:18.330> to

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
jailbroken before and you know how to

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.180 
jailbroken before and you know how to
use<00:05:18.510> it<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:18.960> what<00:05:19.170> things<00:05:19.410> to<00:05:19.560> install<00:05:19.950> I

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
use it and what things to install I

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.790 
use it and what things to install I
would<00:05:21.060> suggest<00:05:21.210> doing<00:05:21.570> developer<00:05:22.320> because<00:05:22.470> it

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
would suggest doing developer because it

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.430 
would suggest doing developer because it
knows<00:05:23.070> like<00:05:23.640> it<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:24.360> doesn't<00:05:24.630> leave<00:05:24.960> out<00:05:25.170> any

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
knows like it it doesn't leave out any

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.260 
knows like it it doesn't leave out any
of<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.620> packages<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.610> lets<00:05:26.790> you<00:05:26.940> install

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
of the packages that it lets you install

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.360 
of the packages that it lets you install
but<00:05:28.020> if<00:05:28.200> this<00:05:28.320> is<00:05:28.440> your<00:05:28.530> first<00:05:28.770> time<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.040> would

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
but if this is your first time I would

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.830
