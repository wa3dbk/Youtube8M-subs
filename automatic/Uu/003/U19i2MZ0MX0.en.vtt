00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.960
 Hello guys, I want you to be happy 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.179
 immediately apologize for so much 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.549
 the delay due to the fact that I had 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.709
 session but for the most part it was not 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.630
 because of the session and because of my laziness since 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.910
 I still want a little vacation 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.980
 rest but also in my life was 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.390
 a series of wonderful event which I 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.609
 I wanted to tell you today 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.890
 Well, unless of course not considering the fact that I 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.019
 proved the session from the second time but in general 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.089
 just yesterday the channel reached 3000 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.890
 subscribers and for me it's of course 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.110
 nice event in honor of this want 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.300
 thank you so much without 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.250
 you this channel would simply not 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.210
 there was a project without an audience 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.980
 exist 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.690
 well and also i have two wonderful 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.910
 news the first is what I got 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.950
 affiliate from machinima but i think you already 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.930
 noticed by the initial screensaver but 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.940
 the second news is that i 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.220
 ordered a new computer and now 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.530
 video quality will improve alagi video 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.390
 but the video card will be lost unfortunately 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.520
 brought only on Friday so 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.510
 the next video you can wait already in 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.220
 new quality 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.930
 in general, I plan to release this video 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.090
 after they bring me and 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.580
 computer but knowing that it will be wrong 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.590
 and soon decided to record this video so 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.600
 how I make you wait too long and 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.060
 for my part it will be pretty 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.150
 roughly well so today will burn on 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.470
 carbine and all 52 in battlefield 4 he 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 is one of the most popular 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.880
 class carbines of course in the class 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.880
 carbines have one more to collect 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.770
 family galil this is an essay 21 on by 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.960
 characteristics it is practically nothing 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.890
 different from its assault counterpart 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.450
 and ace 23 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.520
 so he me not so 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.010
 interested but it does not mean that he 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.720
 bad or i didn't like pro 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.909
 the galil family will be separate 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.190
 where the story will tell about all four 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.950
 trunk simultaneously and compare between 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.990
 yourself but for now let's move on smoothly to 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.090
 we have maximum damage characteristics 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.500
 equals 34 units applied on 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.100
 distance up to eight meters 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.830
 minimum damage is 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.080
 four-tenths of us puts at a distance 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.060
 up to 50 meters just the same main 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.210
 feature of essay 52 is 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.470
 maximum damage which is 34 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.259
 units this is the highest 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.840
 among carbines and by the way he 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.360
 roving karlych and he is an assault 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.300
 a rifle but the differences we still have 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.040
 recharge full 3.1 seconds a 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.470
 tactical on take two point two 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.840
 tenths of a second here is extremely important 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.360
 in front of the female we were left alone 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.370
 two patrons since you lose the whole 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.670
 precious second besides 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.190
 withdraw 52 you can charge only 26 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.200
 patron and so would we be leaving you 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.600
 fast and recharge you have to 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.730
 respectively, more likely to be well and say 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.810
 about recoil horizontal recoil left 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.850
 makes 0,25 to the right too 0 you have 500 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.890
 therefore, it will be compensated a 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.209
 upright recoil on face 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.280
 45 ares 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.799
 recoil is basically small and its easy 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.750
 controls on you can see that disappeared 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.239
 shoots somehow around keeping 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.820
 the position of the weapon is in place but for some 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.950
 reason with such a small recoil and 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.959
 rate of fire of 650 shots 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.940
 minute shoot personally for me on 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.070
 long distance was very difficult 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.380
 so I use it exclusively 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.959
 average and near distance as 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.180
 my opinion is essay 52 is king 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.380
 close our distance let's 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.660
 take a look at the module 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.060
 on hearing, leave only your neighbor 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.859
 sight sight advice sight coyote as he 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.570
 fits very well and he is very 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.370
 beautiful with him looks at the slot 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.109
 accessories put any auction your 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.540
 choice as it seems to me the most 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.340
 good accessory for this carbine he 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.560
 better shooting from the hip reduces 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.269
 deterioration in accuracy by 25 percent a 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.829
 can also blind the opponent on 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.109
 average distance that will give them 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.180
 advantage over the enemy for the demolition of the trunk I 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.070
 you do not advise to put or 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.170
 You can put the muffler and it will open 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.750
 your muzzle flash and your position 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.549
 minimap it reduces bullet speed and 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.109
 enhances its trajectory 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.209
 We put the pen short or 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.370
 podstvolnaya that is the same 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.560
 I think this is the best option since 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.290
 a little more accuracy will not hurt us 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.329
 But with this layout game 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.370
 I and I think this is the best option to 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.349
 protect your ass while you mend 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.390
 tank or run to mode 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.219
 needle superiority of the enemy in 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.379
 Generally speaking the trunk is really very 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.690
 good and he's not de copan once and consider 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.759
 its one of the best carbines in the game but 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.799
 this friend is probably still 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.810
