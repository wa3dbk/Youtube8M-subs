00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
what is this process like this is your

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.009 
what is this process like this is your
first<00:00:11.670> time<00:00:12.059> auditioning<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:12.630> anything<00:00:12.809> like

first time auditioning for anything like

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.660 
first time auditioning for anything like
this<00:00:13.139> before<00:00:13.290> yes<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.250> my<00:00:14.370> first

this before yes this is my first
professional<00:00:15.030> audition<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.470> think<00:00:17.220> that

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
professional audition and I think that

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.390 
professional audition and I think that
the<00:00:17.640> process<00:00:18.029> has<00:00:18.060> been<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.080> much<00:00:19.289> more<00:00:19.350> than<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the process has been so much more than I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.700

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
into the first morning I just think that

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.620 
into the first morning I just think that
the<00:00:25.199> process<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.980> having<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.880> big<00:00:27.330> show<00:00:27.599> like

about the caliber of girls that are here

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.969 
about the caliber of girls that are here
that<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.760> even<00:01:05.909> able<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.810> happen<00:01:06.990> it's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that this is even able to happen it's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
that this is even able to happen it's
crazy<00:01:08.220> we're<00:01:08.610> learning<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> routines

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
crazy we're learning all the routines

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870

minute<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:12.390> minute<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.670> going

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
minute by minute I think that it's going

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.200 
minute by minute I think that it's going
to<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> long<00:01:16.259> hours<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.060> it'll<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to be a lot of long hours but it'll be a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
to be a lot of long hours but it'll be a
great<00:01:18.540> show<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.080> everyone<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.619> comes
