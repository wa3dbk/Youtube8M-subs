00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.490
 these are the men who have to do it 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.690
 for psv b1 in the top match against feyenoord 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.400
 b1 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.349
 the game played on the new 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.840
 artificial turf is extremely important 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.599
 in the battle for the league title 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.640
 in the premier division for b-juniors psv 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 Feyenoord is the second leader 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.199
 a lead of two points and so 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.180
 counts only the profit for psv wit de 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.580
 first chance of the competition 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.429
 years in barn man clubbing comes on purpose 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.730
 but just misses the right direction 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.950
 header of clubs this is steve and berg 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.239
 where the action the shot of bergwine die 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.120
 a contract earlier this afternoon 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.690
 he signed with the first dangerous 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.670
 moment on behalf of psv but he also gets the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.140
 ball not between the posts 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 can kamkar at the back 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.309
 playing with makes a pijnenburg 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.230
 this is lennart danneels on the skin 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.300
 seated by danny van haar and has 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 a good action at home the purple on the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.660
 right outer 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.699
 jordi den hat how do you go here us 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.549
 beyond the hat 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.240
 out of balance lord no direction to that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.189
 ball so chances are not great in that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 first half and so it is not 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.670
 surprising that it is zero zero then 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 goes mountain where again beautiful easter at heart 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 pole 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.119
 and this looks dangerous beautiful 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.970
 attack by psv b1 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 mark and the pole finds goalkeeper ferry 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.229
 hagendijk on its way 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.970
 here he is again a pole he thinks 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.579
 when it comes to playing football which is difficult 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.290
 then I try again from a distance 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.290
 once it had a blast with the rescue 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.829
 bergwine 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 with kingsale facing him firmly 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.659
 bergwine good action berg where now the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 co-player pick mountain vineyard itself 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.840
 on her feet a dike and she 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 become a little despondent 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.630
 psv b1 kingsale goes into the cloud 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.110
 substitute martijn per de is this 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.310
 [Music] 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.790
 much room for b then it goes completely 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 only he chooses saved and you hear 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.080
 the whistle of referee sheet 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.410
 a violation has been committed on martijn 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.180
 third and therefore a free kick for PSV 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.890
 and there they have phillip morris and that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.290
 does this 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.780
 what a fantastic free kick by that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.340
 left back of psv b1 and looks at the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.950
 joy 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.650
 everyone celebrates who is one 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.480
 great kick say no chance 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.910
 hagendijk 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 about 10 the lead for psv and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.900
 hagendijk he looks at it again 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.750
 the intersection where that ball selden rigo 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.130
 were now reached roberta punctures and 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.170
 then it is not right for a while 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.590
 organized in the back at psv fernandez 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.959
 god sent away from us or firmly different 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.480
 peijnenburg no, that ball is in 5 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.730
 minutes taking feely 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.100
 humming it is the same again 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.100
 so now men from rotterdam sand 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.910
 can applaud practical abels and 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.910
 kardes by 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.320
 and then have and then here is some luck 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.420
 but the ball passes the goal line 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.070
 and so it is equal and still has psv 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.260
 but little time for that crooked situation 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.730
 to put it right 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.750
 pumps those balls that is the motto 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.140
 the final phase third fret 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.549
 yes it is very busy mountain wine there 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.100
 also does not get the ball with looks 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.400
 luckily maybe romans back 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.350
 cleverly done by getting a spa but who is it 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.480
 every time at psv it stays there 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.710
 incredibly busy abels left the duel 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.540
 fernandez 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.850
 a button strongly back like a real one 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.780
 defender kardash just pump that ball 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.050
 once forward 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.460
 this is raiding joby kings 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.520
 rick of the multi-faced dese 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.510
 maybe even you lost 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.670
 he too could be his direct opponent 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.130
 not over and then it is even 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.310
 watch out for the counter 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.370
 because there comes feyenoord with a lot of men 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.320
 this is the invader the guide cover has the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.230
 churning co-players for picking out 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.300
 smack in the gap 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.580
 the game had small decisions here 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.460
 where he chases the ball over the goalkeeper 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.440
 from us again psv 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.860
 abels that ball forward one more time 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.990
 is that good now only I was with 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.940
 feyenoord chats away and then 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.810
 whistle referee shalit for it 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.780
 end 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.150
 psv b1 and feyenoord b1 play a draw 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.930
 the re-entry to feyenoord will happen anyway 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.930
 feel the winner
