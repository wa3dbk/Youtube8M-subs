kinds of woods
the<00:00:49.440> SAP<00:00:49.649> wood<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:49.920> rot<00:00:50.100> first<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the SAP wood will rot first but the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.939 
the SAP wood will rot first but the
heartwood<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.750> still<00:00:51.930> extremely<00:00:52.230> solid<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
heartwood is still extremely solid and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.119 
heartwood is still extremely solid and
still<00:00:53.579> perfect<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.449> cut<00:00:54.660> yesterday

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
still perfect like it was cut yesterday

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.229 
still perfect like it was cut yesterday
so<00:00:56.129> that's<00:00:56.309> gonna<00:00:56.460> make<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.699> lot<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.030> great

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
so that's gonna make a lot of great

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
a few years ago Jim actually got
interested<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.500> making<00:01:37.770> lumber<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.729> he

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
interested in making lumber so he

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.249 
interested in making lumber so he
actually<00:01:39.150> built<00:01:39.329> his<00:01:39.479> own<00:01:39.630> swing<00:01:40.020> blade

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
actually built his own swing blade

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.740 
actually built his own swing blade
sawmill<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> he<00:01:41.790> actually<00:01:41.939> cut<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
sawmill and he actually cut all the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
sawmill and he actually cut all the
lumber<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.259> his<00:01:43.439> trailer<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> trailer

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
lumber for his trailer the trailer

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.880 
lumber for his trailer the trailer
decking<00:01:44.909> from<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.299> log<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.380> problem<00:01:46.799> with

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
decking from this log the problem with

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.440 
decking from this log the problem with
this<00:01:46.979> log<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> reason<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> log<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.299> out

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this log and the reason the log was out

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
this log and the reason the log was out
there<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.899> long<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
there for so long is we could not get it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.920 
there for so long is we could not get it
out<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> woods<00:01:50.520> no<00:01:51.060> matter<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.570> hard<00:01:51.840> we

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
out the woods no matter how hard we

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
out the woods no matter how hard we
tried<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.290> no<00:01:52.409> matter<00:01:52.649> what<00:01:52.860> method<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.430> tried

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
tried or no matter what method we tried

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.609 
tried or no matter what method we tried
it<00:01:54.390> seemed<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.049> always<00:01:55.170> too<00:01:55.409> heavy

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it seemed like it was always too heavy

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.010 
it seemed like it was always too heavy
for<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> Bobcat<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.820> wouldn't<00:01:57.090> move<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
for the Bobcat and just wouldn't move so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.270 
for the Bobcat and just wouldn't move so
it<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.320> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> sat<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.920> there

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it just kind of sat out there

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.999 
it just kind of sat out there
I<00:01:59.479> guess<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.689> weekend<00:02:01.110> Jim<00:02:01.350> found<00:02:01.860> himself

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
I guess this weekend Jim found himself

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
I guess this weekend Jim found himself
with<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:02.369> free<00:02:02.549> time<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.570> playing

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
with some free time and was playing

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.959 
with some free time and was playing
around<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> Bobcat<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> he

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
around up there with the Bobcat and he

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.449 
around up there with the Bobcat and he
managed<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.390> pull<00:02:06.630> log<00:02:06.869> out<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.290> woods<00:02:07.500> how

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
managed to pull log out of the woods how

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369 
managed to pull log out of the woods how
he<00:02:08.520> managed<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.690> don't<00:02:10.289> really

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
he managed to do that I don't really

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.320 
he managed to do that I don't really
know<00:02:10.619> he<00:02:11.250> also<00:02:11.370> managed<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> onto<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
know he also managed to get it onto the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.910 
know he also managed to get it onto the
trailer<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.840> Bobcat<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
trailer with the Bobcat so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.559 
trailer with the Bobcat so
again<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:14.490> not<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.610> sure<00:02:14.880> how<00:02:15.060> he<00:02:15.120> managed

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
again I'm not really sure how he managed

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.900 
again I'm not really sure how he managed
to<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.140> he<00:02:16.230> did<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> might<00:02:17.880> be

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
to do that but he did so you might be

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.460 
to do that but he did so you might be
asking<00:02:18.120> yourself<00:02:18.660> well<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.110> got<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
asking yourself well if I got on the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.710 
asking yourself well if I got on the
trailer<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.040> now<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.000> here<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.390> ground

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
trailer and now it's here on the ground

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.590 
trailer and now it's here on the ground
well<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.980> don't<00:02:23.760> Matt<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.060> don't<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.360> any

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
well I don't Matt you don't have any

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.420 
well I don't Matt you don't have any
heavy<00:02:24.780> equipment<00:02:24.900> around<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.250> pull

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
heavy equipment around here to just pull

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.309 
heavy equipment around here to just pull
stuff<00:02:26.610> off<00:02:26.760> trailers<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.810> how<00:02:27.990> do<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.140> get<00:02:28.290> a

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
stuff off trailers so how do you get a

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.350 
stuff off trailers so how do you get a
log<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.860> weighs<00:02:29.100> over<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.490> ton<00:02:29.580> off<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.300> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
log that weighs over a ton off of a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.199 
log that weighs over a ton off of a
trailer<00:02:31.340> well<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> answer<00:02:32.730> has<00:02:32.880> something<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
trailer well the answer has something to

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.760 
trailer well the answer has something to
do<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.600> strap<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.350> tree<00:02:34.620> back

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
do with that strap in that tree back

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.520 
do with that strap in that tree back
there<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:36.030> hook<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.540> log<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.500> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
there you actually hook up the log to a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.240 
there you actually hook up the log to a
tree<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.790> drive<00:02:39.060> off<00:02:39.800> that's<00:02:40.800> exactly

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
tree and you drive off that's exactly

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.040 
tree and you drive off that's exactly
how<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> got<00:02:41.670> these<00:02:41.820> logs<00:02:42.120> off<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.540> trailer

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
how I got these logs off the trailer

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.290 
how I got these logs off the trailer
so<00:02:43.770> last<00:02:44.069> night<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.580> gave<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.030> log<00:02:45.270> a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
so last night I actually gave this log a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.430 
so last night I actually gave this log a
quick<00:02:45.569> cut<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.080> cut<00:02:46.620> off<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.800> ends<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.640> see

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
quick cut I cut off the ends just to see

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.840 
quick cut I cut off the ends just to see
how<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.680> was<00:02:49.800> looking<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.340> inside<00:02:50.670> because

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
how it was looking on the inside because

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.729 
how it was looking on the inside because
from<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> outside<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.780> looks<00:02:51.930> pretty<00:02:52.530> junky

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
from the outside it looks pretty junky

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.009 
from the outside it looks pretty junky
you<00:02:52.980> can't<00:02:53.190> really<00:02:53.310> tell<00:02:53.580> how<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.910> looks<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.510> I

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
you can't really tell how it looks and I

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.140 
you can't really tell how it looks and I
wanted<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.320> trim<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.650> off<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.100> see<00:02:56.340> well

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
wanted to trim it off just to see well

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.850 
wanted to trim it off just to see well
for<00:02:57.420> two<00:02:57.600> reasons<00:02:57.630> really<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.290> see<00:02:58.500> how<00:02:58.680> it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
for two reasons really to see how it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.860 
for two reasons really to see how it
looked<00:02:59.100> as<00:02:59.580> far<00:02:59.640> as<00:02:59.880> checking<00:03:00.120> go<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.720> see

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
looked as far as checking go is to see

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.810 
looked as far as checking go is to see
if<00:03:00.959> there<00:03:01.080> was<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.230> lot<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.500> checking<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.220> there

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
if there was a lot of checking if there

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.250 
if there was a lot of checking if there
was<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.970> lot<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.209> checking<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.660> log<00:03:03.870> I

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
was a lot of checking on the log I

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.690 
was a lot of checking on the log I
wouldn't<00:03:04.860> really<00:03:04.950> want<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.310> mill<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
wouldn't really want to mill that I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.220 
wouldn't really want to mill that I
probably<00:03:05.970> cut<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.269> back<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.840> get<00:03:06.959> rid<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
probably cut it back and get rid of the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.570 
probably cut it back and get rid of the
checking<00:03:07.560> before<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.890> actually<00:03:08.010> milled<00:03:08.340> into

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
checking before I actually milled into

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.400 
checking before I actually milled into
lumber<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.120> then<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> other<00:03:09.900> reason<00:03:10.230> was

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
lumber and then the other reason was

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.080 
lumber and then the other reason was
just<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> clean<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.610> up<00:03:11.700> because<00:03:11.880> there's<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
just to clean it up because there's a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.340 
just to clean it up because there's a
lot<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.239> dirt<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.600> stuff<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.140> end<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
lot of dirt and stuff in the end of the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.290 
lot of dirt and stuff in the end of the
log<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.130> didn't<00:03:14.370> want<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.610> have<00:03:14.790> my

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
January I think so those have been

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.490

here<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.440> few<00:04:47.620> weeks<00:04:47.800> on<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.130> off<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.490> made<00:04:48.760> a

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
here a few weeks on and off I made a

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.090 
here a few weeks on and off I made a
little<00:04:48.970> cabinet<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:49.570> go<00:04:49.750> behind<00:04:50.530> my<00:04:50.590> jointer

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
little cabinet to go behind my jointer

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.730 
little cabinet to go behind my jointer
just<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.460> hold<00:04:51.610> some<00:04:51.880> random<00:04:52.210> stuff<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:52.900> with

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
just to hold some random stuff and with

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.409 
just to hold some random stuff and with
that<00:04:54.010> I'm<00:04:54.220> thinking<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.699> now<00:04:54.880> that<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.150> have

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
that I'm thinking that now that I have

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.780 
that I'm thinking that now that I have
all<00:04:55.720> this<00:04:55.870> extra<00:04:56.169> melamine<00:04:56.620> from<00:04:57.040> my<00:04:57.310> forms

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
all this extra melamine from my forms

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.939 
all this extra melamine from my forms
for<00:04:58.000> all<00:04:58.030> those<00:04:58.180> caps<00:04:58.479> I'm<00:04:59.229> gonna<00:04:59.470> continue<00:04:59.800> to

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
for all those caps I'm gonna continue to

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.740 
for all those caps I'm gonna continue to
make<00:05:00.130> some<00:05:00.340> more<00:05:00.460> cabinets<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.150> shelving<00:05:01.600> to

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
make some more cabinets and shelving to

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.870 
make some more cabinets and shelving to
go<00:05:01.870> along<00:05:02.080> that<00:05:02.229> wall<00:05:02.500> behind<00:05:03.220> my<00:05:03.340> jointer<00:05:03.850> and

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
go along that wall behind my jointer and

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.540 
go along that wall behind my jointer and
then<00:05:04.120> across<00:05:04.479> my<00:05:04.840> table-saw<00:05:05.199> area<00:05:05.710> it's<00:05:06.340> just

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
then across my table-saw area it's just

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.159 
then across my table-saw area it's just
hard<00:05:06.760> when<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.060> step<00:05:07.330> stuff<00:05:07.600> flying<00:05:07.960> all<00:05:08.139> over

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.540 
hard when you step stuff flying all over
the<00:05:08.320> place<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.740> don't<00:05:08.800> really<00:05:09.039> have<00:05:09.250> anywhere

all<00:05:22.120> over<00:05:22.330> here<00:05:22.630> so<00:05:23.260> that<00:05:23.410> I<00:05:23.440> can<00:05:23.650> work<00:05:23.740> over

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
all over here so that I can work over

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.800 
all over here so that I can work over
there<00:05:24.130> and<00:05:24.160> then<00:05:24.370> move<00:05:24.729> back<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:25.090> forth<00:05:25.330> and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
there and then move back and forth and

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.779 
there and then move back and forth and

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
there out of all that scrap and I think

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.240 
there out of all that scrap and I think
that'll<00:05:34.930> really<00:05:35.169> clean<00:05:35.530> up<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.830> organize

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
that'll really clean up and organize

that'll really clean up and organize
things<00:05:36.840> looking<00:05:37.840> forward<00:05:38.229> to<00:05:38.349> the<00:05:38.440> future<00:05:38.770> a

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
things looking forward to the future a

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.089 
things looking forward to the future a
few<00:05:39.039> things<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.370> want<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.550> do<00:05:39.700> on<00:05:39.849> the<00:05:39.970> shop<00:05:40.180> this

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
few things I want to do on the shop this

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.770 
few things I want to do on the shop this
bench<00:05:42.099> behind<00:05:42.520> me<00:05:42.700> I<00:05:42.880> like<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.450> get<00:05:43.599> rid<00:05:43.750> of

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
bench behind me I like to get rid of

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.330 
bench behind me I like to get rid of
that<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.139> place<00:05:44.349> that<00:05:44.380> with<00:05:44.650> cabinets<00:05:45.130> I

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
that and place that with cabinets I

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.159 
that and place that with cabinets I
think<00:05:45.910> that'd<00:05:46.060> be<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.240> lot<00:05:46.419> better<00:05:46.690> suited<00:05:47.110> for

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
think that'd be a lot better suited for

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.140 
think that'd be a lot better suited for
the<00:05:47.349> space<00:05:47.620> gave<00:05:48.099> me<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.220> lot<00:05:48.340> more<00:05:48.370> storage<00:05:48.820> and

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
the space gave me a lot more storage and

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.969 
the space gave me a lot more storage and
the<00:05:49.900> other<00:05:50.020> thing<00:05:50.200> I'd<00:05:50.289> like<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.410> do<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.770> build

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
the other thing I'd like to do is build

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.879 
the other thing I'd like to do is build
a<00:05:51.280> miter<00:05:51.820> saw<00:05:51.910> station<00:05:52.150> for<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.780> miter<00:05:52.990> saw<00:05:53.080> this

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
is my largest nomad tool at this point

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.110 
is my largest nomad tool at this point
and<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:56.380> really<00:05:56.530> needs<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.770> new<00:05:56.889> home<00:05:57.039> one<00:05:57.910> thing

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
from around my lathe I had a layer that

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.300 
from around my lathe I had a layer that
was<00:06:10.270> about<00:06:10.419> six<00:06:10.720> inches<00:06:10.960> thick<00:06:11.229> of<00:06:11.410> compressed

building of that little

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.739 
building of that little
a<00:06:41.319> bit<00:06:41.529> over<00:06:41.619> there<00:06:41.860> the<00:06:42.490> wall<00:06:42.639> cabinet<00:06:43.089> it's

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:43.749 
a bit over there the wall cabinet it's

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:46.139 
a bit over there the wall cabinet it's
not<00:06:43.960> really<00:06:44.319> all<00:06:44.349> that<00:06:44.729> complex<00:06:45.729> of<00:06:45.849> a<00:06:45.909> build

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149 
not really all that complex of a build

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:47.369 
not really all that complex of a build
it's<00:06:46.449> not<00:06:46.659> really<00:06:46.869> anything<00:06:47.020> you<00:06:47.139> probably

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:47.379 
it's not really anything you probably

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:48.899 
it's not really anything you probably
haven't<00:06:47.589> seen<00:06:47.619> before<00:06:47.830> but<00:06:48.249> it's<00:06:48.729> the

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
haven't seen before but it's the

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.149 
haven't seen before but it's the
materials<00:06:49.479> that<00:06:49.599> I<00:06:49.689> think<00:06:49.990> has<00:06:50.319> the<00:06:50.680> story<00:06:51.009> to

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
materials that I think has the story to

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.809 
materials that I think has the story to
tell<00:06:51.309> that<00:06:52.059> cabinet<00:06:52.539> is<00:06:52.599> made<00:06:52.629> out<00:06:52.990> of<00:06:53.139> the

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 
tell that cabinet is made out of the

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.239 
tell that cabinet is made out of the
what<00:06:54.819> the<00:06:54.939> second<00:06:55.300> thing<00:06:55.509> ever<00:06:55.689> made<00:06:55.960> so<00:06:56.289> a<00:06:56.559> low

00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:57.249 
what the second thing ever made so a low

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.129 
what the second thing ever made so a low
recycling<00:06:57.819> project<00:06:58.240> which<00:06:58.659> I<00:06:58.749> think<00:06:58.960> will<00:06:59.050> be

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
recycling project which I think will be
