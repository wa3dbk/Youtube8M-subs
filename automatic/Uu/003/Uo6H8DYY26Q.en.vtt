00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
something with the idea not to shed well

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.969 
something with the idea not to shed well

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you put it by the window chef so it does

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
you put it by the window chef so it does
have<00:01:22.680> some<00:01:22.710> white<00:01:23.119> label<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.360> well<00:01:24.570> because

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
have some white label it as well because

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.359 
have some white label it as well because
you<00:01:24.990> may<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.350> may<00:01:25.380> find<00:01:25.740> when<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> buy<00:01:26.189> them

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you may you may find when you buy them

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.859 
you may you may find when you buy them
you<00:01:26.490> might<00:01:26.700> buy<00:01:26.880> red<00:01:27.210> ones<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.600> yellow<00:01:27.780> ones

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you might buy red ones and yellow ones

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.390 
you might buy red ones and yellow ones
and<00:01:28.140> why

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
and why

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.360 
and why
wants<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.730> put<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.060> label<00:01:29.270> nursing<00:01:30.070> which<00:01:31.070> what

wants to put a label nursing which what
color<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:33.110> then<00:01:33.320> basically<00:01:33.890> when<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.310> is

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
color is and then basically when that is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.010 
color is and then basically when that is
enough<00:01:35.000> you'll<00:01:35.210> see<00:01:35.390> I'll<00:01:35.540> say<00:01:35.750> you'll<00:01:35.900> see

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
enough you'll see I'll say you'll see

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.260 
enough you'll see I'll say you'll see
the<00:01:36.140> buds<00:01:36.290> coming<00:01:36.530> up<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.980> that's

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
the buds coming up and that's

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.240 
the buds coming up and that's
established<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.480> good<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.890> danger

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
established in good and the danger

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.490 
established in good and the danger
Foster's<00:01:40.730> gone<00:01:40.940> then<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:41.840> can<00:01:41.990> plant<00:01:42.230> to<00:01:42.350> that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
Foster's gone then you can plant to that
