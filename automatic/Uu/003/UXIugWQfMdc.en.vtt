now because of how easy it is but pretty

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.810

much<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.520> Moga<00:02:33.820> pivot<00:02:34.180> app<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.570> is<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.980> market

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
much the Moga pivot app is is a market

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.370

that's<00:02:36.970> not<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> market<00:02:37.750> if<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.080> makes<00:02:38.260> any

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
that's not a market if that makes any

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.410
