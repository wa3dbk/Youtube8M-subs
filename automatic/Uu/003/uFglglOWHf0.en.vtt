00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
looked into a bit closely but I'm pretty

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.770 
looked into a bit closely but I'm pretty
sure<00:05:19.520> most<00:05:19.760> other<00:05:19.970> people<00:05:20.240> who<00:05:20.330> attended<00:05:20.690> the

less loaded ones but obviously the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.469

impact<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.640> bullet<00:05:25.910> goes<00:05:26.120> through<00:05:26.150> into

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
impact of the bullet goes through into

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.240 
impact of the bullet goes through into
the<00:05:26.660> back<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:27.470> supports<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.830> great<00:05:28.010> deal<00:05:28.130> of

the back it supports a great deal of

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.290 
the back it supports a great deal of
swelling<00:05:28.490> around<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:28.970> spine<00:05:29.350> it's<00:05:31.090> it's<00:05:32.090> done

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
swelling around the spine it's it's done

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.510 
swelling around the spine it's it's done
some<00:05:32.450> damage<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.960> t3<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:33.620> t4<00:05:33.800> vertebrae<00:05:34.070> I

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
some damage to the t3 and t4 vertebrae I

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.490 
some damage to the t3 and t4 vertebrae I
understand<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.240> possibly<00:05:35.930> some<00:05:36.169> bone

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
understand and possibly some bone

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.960 
understand and possibly some bone
fragments<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.070> come<00:05:37.250> from<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:38.680> so<00:05:39.680> there's

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
fragments that come from that so there's

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.550 
fragments that come from that so there's
obviously<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.300> upper<00:05:41.570> spine<00:05:42.229> is<00:05:42.260> quite

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
obviously the upper spine is quite

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.820 
obviously the upper spine is quite
agitated<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.630> with<00:05:44.630> with<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.289> swelling

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
agitated and with with the swelling

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.630 
agitated and with with the swelling
there<00:05:46.060> it's<00:05:47.060> going<00:05:47.210> to<00:05:47.270> inhibit<00:05:47.510> any<00:05:47.810> sort<00:05:48.080> of

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
there it's going to inhibit any sort of

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.190 
there it's going to inhibit any sort of
any<00:05:49.640> signals<00:05:50.180> or<00:05:50.300> any<00:05:50.419> movement<00:05:50.660> down<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.110> the
