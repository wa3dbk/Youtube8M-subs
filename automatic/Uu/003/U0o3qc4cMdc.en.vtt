00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.370

 chips in 1998 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 the use of this suffered 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.660
 side effects such as stomach cramps and diarrhea 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.529

 just a dash of yogurt with the slogan 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 it sold for no meter 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 messages came out 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.290
 people put the shampoo on water and there 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 get sick from it 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.980

 number 8 is premier cigarettes 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.070
 these smokeless cigarettes were found to be 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.750
 taste like burnt cabbage 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.719

 Apple Maps is at number 7 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.660
 this app from apple was full of errors 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.490
 such as lack of domicile of 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.140
 shakespeare and the mistake spelled 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.970

 ar deluxe 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.700
 it was sold in 1996 after one 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.310
 promotional campaign of 100 million dollars 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.650
 with a price of 2 dollars and 49 cents 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.119
 he was too expensive it contains a 79 percent 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.150
 of the daily recommended amount 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.000
 salt and 36 grams of fat 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.910
 lifts unhealthy so number 5 is the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.539
 new cola coca cola came up with another 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.580
 recipe in 1985 and within 79 days 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.530
 she went back to the old recipe 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.130
 this because there were 400,000 complaints 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.290

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.780
 pudding with vegetable taste 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.280
 the idea was to pass this inspection as 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.930
 substitute for real vegetables 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.530
 but soon it turned out not to be 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.580
 to work 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.290
 since then it is no longer 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.179

 [Music] 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.380
 on number service to the quick 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.150
 underpants to take a different path 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 then hit the razors and ballpoint pens 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.930
 have thought the company b could throw away 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.370
 to make underwear 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.170
 they found the idea a good idea themselves 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.510
 consumer did not really agree 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.150
 and was therefore not a hit at number two 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.040
 is healthier garden 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.110
 in 1980 there was a playing day where 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.150
 large darts had to be healthy on you 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.740
 being thrown was eight years later 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.240
 This is prohibited by the fact that there are three 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.100
 people were killed 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.520
 the inspection service considered it of value 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.530
 too dangerous and that number 1 yes too 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.110
 bizarre for words but the state of cocaine 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.170
 energy in it contained 350 for it 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.910
 more caffeine the red bull and also 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.470
 750 miligram cabin and this made it 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.360
 considered an alternative to street 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.010
