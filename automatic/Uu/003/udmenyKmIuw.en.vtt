our grazing trials as you can see and
look<00:00:30.660> around<00:00:30.810> today<00:00:31.399> we're<00:00:32.399> starting<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.910> get

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
look around today we're starting to get

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.850 
look around today we're starting to get
some<00:00:33.360> grass<00:00:33.630> growth<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.290> unfortunately

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
some grass growth but unfortunately

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
some grass growth but unfortunately
because<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> cold<00:00:35.550> temperatures<00:00:36.120> we

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
because of the cold temperatures we

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
because of the cold temperatures we
haven't<00:00:37.469> had<00:00:37.620> near<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> rush<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.940> green<00:00:39.180> grass

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
haven't had near the rush of green grass

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
haven't had near the rush of green grass
that<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.989> hoped<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.520> some<00:00:41.670> pop

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that we have hoped and so just some pop

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
that we have hoped and so just some pop
processes<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> we're<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.260> through<00:00:43.379> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
processes that we're going through that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.770 
processes that we're going through that
I<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> share<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.789> today<00:00:45.059> are

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
when is the appropriate time to turn

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
when is the appropriate time to turn
cows<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.870> traditionally<00:00:49.530> speaking<00:00:49.680> we'd

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
cows out now traditionally speaking we'd

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
cows out now traditionally speaking we'd
like<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.789> their<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.090> least<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.600> around<00:00:51.870> two

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
like for their at least to be around two

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.490 
like for their at least to be around two
tons<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.620> total<00:00:53.010> forage<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.629> tour<00:00:55.320> we

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
tons of total forage out here tour we

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
tons of total forage out here tour we
can<00:00:55.649> come<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.219> set<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> cows<00:00:56.789> take

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
can come in with a set of cows take

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
can come in with a set of cows take
perhaps<00:00:57.570> half<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.350> forage<00:00:58.710> off<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.579> then

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
perhaps half of that forage off and then

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.270 
perhaps half of that forage off and then
move<00:00:59.940> cows<00:01:00.210> into<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.750> new<00:01:00.960> paddock<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.100> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
move cows into a new paddock and so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
move cows into a new paddock and so
ultimately<00:01:02.579> our<00:01:03.030> goal<00:01:03.059> today<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.870> assess

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
ultimately our goal today is to assess

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.950 
ultimately our goal today is to assess
how<00:01:04.680> much<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.309> forage<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.689> here

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
how much to go forage we have out here

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.310 
how much to go forage we have out here
today

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
today

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
today
within<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> paddock<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.240> thing

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
within this paddock and so one thing

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.620 
within this paddock and so one thing
that<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.659> had<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.650> trusty<00:01:11.189> grazing<00:01:11.729> stick<00:01:12.060> on

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that I had is a trusty grazing stick on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.710 
that I had is a trusty grazing stick on
that<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:14.000> inch<00:01:15.000> increment

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that is going to be inch increment

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.469 
that is going to be inch increment

be about 300 pounds of total dry matter
forage<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.400> us<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.700> reach<00:01:26.850> our

forage out there so for us to reach our
goal<00:01:27.299> we're<00:01:27.509> needing<00:01:27.990> roughly<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.770> six<00:01:29.070> to

seven total inches of forage and get us

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.200 
seven total inches of forage and get us
at<00:01:32.020> amount<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.350> time<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:33.789> take<00:01:33.939> half

at amount of time and if we take half

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.510 
at amount of time and if we take half
that<00:01:34.240> that'll<00:01:34.869> be<00:01:34.899> about<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.289> thousand<00:01:36.100> of

game<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.860> question<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.399> we<00:01:54.520> want<00:01:54.759> to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
game of the question that we want to

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:27.509 
game of the question that we want to
answer<00:01:55.060> today<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.950> much<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:24.930> three<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.340> as

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
answer today is how much to three so as

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.390 
answer today is how much to three so as
you<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.880> see<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:29.260> would<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.739> have<00:02:29.890> six<00:02:30.220> to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
you can see we would like to have six to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.220 
you can see we would like to have six to
seven<00:02:30.700> inches

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
seven inches

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.930 
seven inches
unfortunately<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.349> average<00:02:32.829> just<00:02:33.670> roughly

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
unfortunately on average just roughly

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.670 
unfortunately on average just roughly
thinking<00:02:34.390> through<00:02:34.599> we're<00:02:34.750> probably<00:02:35.200> closer

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
thinking through we're probably closer

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.280 
thinking through we're probably closer
to<00:02:35.709> an<00:02:35.890> average<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.310> three<00:02:36.609> to<00:02:36.700> four<00:02:36.910> inches

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
to an average of three to four inches

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.900 
to an average of three to four inches
which<00:02:38.290> would<00:02:38.500> basically<00:02:38.890> mean<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:39.790> are

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
which would basically mean that we are

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.289 
which would basically mean that we are
still<00:02:40.209> perhaps<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.440> few<00:02:41.680> weeks<00:02:41.890> left<00:02:42.160> or<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.269> a

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
still perhaps a few weeks left or have a

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.420 
still perhaps a few weeks left or have a
few<00:02:43.600> weeks<00:02:43.780> out<00:02:43.989> until<00:02:44.350> we<00:02:44.530> can<00:02:44.739> feel

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
few weeks out until we can feel

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.390 
few weeks out until we can feel
comfortable<00:02:45.700> turning<00:02:46.630> cows<00:02:47.019> out<00:02:47.319> today<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
comfortable turning cows out today the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.879 
comfortable turning cows out today the
problem<00:02:48.850> by<00:02:49.000> turning<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.510> too<00:02:49.690> quick<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.530> quite

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
problem by turning in too quick is quite

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.879 
problem by turning in too quick is quite
simply<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.370> we<00:02:51.910> take<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.359> plant<00:02:52.780> down<00:02:52.959> too

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
simply that we take the plant down too

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.000 
simply that we take the plant down too
far<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:55.150> plant<00:02:55.450> in<00:02:55.630> turn<00:02:55.840> has<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.260> use<00:02:56.410> extra

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
far the plant in turn has to use extra

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.030 
far the plant in turn has to use extra
energy<00:02:57.970> reserves<00:02:58.389> in<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.720> root<00:02:58.900> system<00:02:59.829> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
energy reserves in the root system to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.059 
energy reserves in the root system to
regrow<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.090> ultimately<00:03:01.989> we<00:03:02.620> lose<00:03:02.829> our

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
regrow and ultimately we lose our

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.400 
regrow and ultimately we lose our
opportunities<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.819> utilize<00:03:04.299> our<00:03:04.540> solar<00:03:04.870> panel

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
opportunities to utilize our solar panel

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.530 
opportunities to utilize our solar panel
and<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.190> unfortunately<00:03:06.819> we<00:03:07.000> aren't<00:03:07.239> able<00:03:07.389> to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
and so unfortunately we aren't able to

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.990 
and so unfortunately we aren't able to
turn<00:03:07.780> our<00:03:07.959> cows<00:03:08.200> out<00:03:08.470> today<00:03:08.769> but<00:03:09.489> are<00:03:09.639> hoping

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
turn our cows out today but are hoping

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.660 
turn our cows out today but are hoping
so<00:03:10.810> soon<00:03:11.170> please<00:03:11.709> always<00:03:11.950> be<00:03:12.100> sure<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.489> check
