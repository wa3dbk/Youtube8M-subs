day old hair it's maybe two days where
it<00:00:30.990> already<00:00:31.170> has<00:00:31.410> maybe<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it already has maybe a little bit of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.479 
it already has maybe a little bit of
product<00:00:32.550> build-up<00:00:33.770> it's<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.920> super<00:00:35.340> super

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
product build-up it's not super super

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
product build-up it's not super super
clean<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.090> you're<00:00:36.329> probably<00:00:36.420> gonna<00:00:36.690> get

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
clean then it you're probably gonna get

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.910 
clean then it you're probably gonna get
the<00:00:36.960> best<00:00:37.200> result<00:00:37.649> out<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:40.710> still

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the best result out of this so I'm still

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.290 
the best result out of this so I'm still
gonna<00:00:41.040> leave<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> roots<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.030> dry<00:00:42.239> just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
gonna leave the roots kind of dry just

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.670 
gonna leave the roots kind of dry just
so<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.140> list<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.890> there

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
hairspray just to tame some of the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.750 
hairspray just to tame some of the
uncontrollable<00:03:44.680> frizz<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.460> would<00:03:45.580> probably

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
uncontrollable frizz that would probably

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.020

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
some I'm not no such thing as continuity

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:17.090 
some I'm not no such thing as continuity
with<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.650> style<00:05:07.010> like<00:05:07.190> this

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.980 

go<00:05:17.670> ahead

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
go ahead

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.510 
go ahead
so<00:05:20.990> now<00:05:21.139> we're<00:05:21.289> going<00:05:21.409> to<00:05:21.469> start<00:05:21.740> unraveling

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
so now we're going to start unraveling

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:35.040 
so now we're going to start unraveling
these

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.719 

so<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.740> fun<00:05:35.949> thing<00:05:36.129> about<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:36.490> hairstyle

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
so the fun thing about this hairstyle

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.279 
so the fun thing about this hairstyle
too<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.330> every<00:05:37.599> time<00:05:37.780> that<00:05:37.840> you're<00:05:38.110> going<00:05:38.229> to

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
too is every time that you're going to

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:38.879 
too is every time that you're going to
do<00:05:38.470> it

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
do it

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.040 
do it
you<00:05:39.129> can<00:05:39.280> do<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.490> differently<00:05:39.690> so<00:05:40.690> if<00:05:40.930> you

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
you can do it differently so if you

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.270 
you can do it differently so if you
wanted<00:05:41.289> to<00:05:41.379> put<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.560> different<00:05:41.740> braid<00:05:42.069> like

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
wanted to put a different braid like

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.909 
wanted to put a different braid like
across<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.639> front<00:05:43.120> larger<00:05:43.810> smaller<00:05:44.319> maybe

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
across the front larger smaller maybe

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.619 
across the front larger smaller maybe
