00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.020
 e 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.410
 1 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.410
 he well hello to all these kids I hope 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.910
 that you're fine 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.770
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.990
 new video is today I'm going 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.570
 tell you about the next update 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.200
 which should come out on minecraft ps3 and 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.029
 ps4 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.830
 this time it concerns that these 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.270
 versions there why simply 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.329
 because it's an update that is 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.500
 already out on xbox and that's where I get 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.809
 ask questions this is an update 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.750
 that came out at least two three 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.010
 weeks on xbox and still is not 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.140
 released on playstation versions 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.399
 so I will introduce you anyway 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.350
 the contents of this update for 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.020
 you know what will be in the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.220
 next update normally 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.260
 so this is an update of 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.620
 mainly bug fixes that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.440
 will correct two big bug that we have 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.120
 currently the first one is the one who 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.460
 makes sure that when you are on a horse a 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.320
 ring a mule and that one does open 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.790
 the inventory we can not use the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 fast moving of said m 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.630
 that is to say we can not do 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.220
 triangle on an item to move it from 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.500
 inventory sabart to the rest of 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.520
 inventory or conversely 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.829
 when finally triangle it does not matter 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.999
 stay still 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.880
 so it's a bug that has a bit 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:21.439
 problematic in survival that should be 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.350
 corrected in the next update 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.560
 since it has been corrected on xbox and 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.630
 the second bug him I think you 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.359
 have it all meet is that of the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.249
 placement of the pistons since since the 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.799
 last update when you want 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.479
 to place a piston it is almost 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.310
 each time in the opposite direction in 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.119
 which one would like to place ie 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.719
 that if you want the placed 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.029
 vertically 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.409
 it will be placed horizontally if you 

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.219
 want to be placed horizontally he will get 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.340
 weary vertically 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.259
 you have to find some distance 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.520
 of the blog on which we want to put it for 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.729
 able to pose it in the dance in this 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.929
 we want and here too it's very very 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.590
 problematic for those who make the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.420
 restaurant on so live normally 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.139
 in the next update on 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.459
 playstation versions 

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:09.289
 this bug should be fixed at last 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.039
 last thing that was added in 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.280
 this update 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.360
 this time it's not a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.939
 it's not a bug fix and a 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.159
 new skins pack that's all 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.319
 simply the skins pack simpson 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.969
 had spoken in a video ad for 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.760
 so you announce that he was going to be 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:29.430
 added at the time he was supposed to go out 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.829
 only on xbox and maybe on 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.470
 playstation and so if this update 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.120
 fate and that's exactly the same as 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.049
 the one that came out on xbox normally 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.980
 we should have this pack of skins 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.359
 unfortunately nothing is sure it's 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.950
 the case of the studio is very quiet 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.269
 Actually it's actually for that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.000
 there are few activities on my channel 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.250
 of that studio has not tweeted 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.620
 about minecraft for weeks 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.590
 and weeks about the mine of 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.609
 future updates so low for 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.010
 the moment we have no information 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.720
 additional 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.169
 it is also possible that this 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.090
 update of bug fixes either 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.470
 integrated face and bugfixes 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.540
 be integrated in another update 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.919
 that would add other things but 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.269
 you know that in any case we have 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.060
 always a face years late 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.019
 currently on xbox versions 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.690
 since this update is released 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.919
 three weeks ago on xbox and we did not 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.290
 always no information regarding 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.099
 the playstation version 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.299
 that's all for this video 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.250
 Feel free to leave a comment 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.379
 to comment on the video in 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.449
 itself to add information 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.510
 if you have any, do not hesitate 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.010
 to leave your suggestions and then on 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.379
 those wear well and I tell you to 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.889

 bye everyone
