00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.930
 very good guys today we are going to 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.580
 unlock the new functions of the 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.620
 motor camera or motorcycle gp for 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.809
 improve them a little bit well what 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.160
 we need is the file explorer what 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.430
 we download from the store totally 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.199
 free and being a root user, it's worth 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.940
 we see the three dashes above in light blue 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.370
 well, we give you that low in everything in 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.820
 security I believe or configuration we give 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.980
 a ruth we follow the different images 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.280
 what am I putting here in the video or 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.890
 would be to go to that channel and then already 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.460
 all this is valid, I already say it is 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.200
 being a root user well once 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.090
 we have the folder there is the only thing 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.620
 we have to do is click on the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.590
 Wild point file but give it is not you 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.910
 editor to edit the line that makes us 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.250
 missing to come out 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.739
 these small configurations 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.970
 additional see how you see the next 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.070
 screen the only thing we have to do 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.159
 is to give the three dots above and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.069
 edit and locate the following 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.659
 next code is worth the one that 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:18.439
 we have to the right that is the one that puts 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.450
 row back Felix clicks well then nothing 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.990
 that we have to remove the reliz and put 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.250
 the word test that you will see in this 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.140
 image 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.240
 They took your time to use the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.980
 video if you want but good does not have 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.380
 complication much care with erase 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.100
 some lines and do it I say but good 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.870
 then we press the back button and 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.910
 we keep the changes once 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.950
 we have restarted the phone we are going 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.710
 to the application of the camera and we take out 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.900
 the left panel and we'll see that down to 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.650
 the right comes out a new logo as a 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.770
 ladybug if we give it up there in the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.420
 upper tabs let's leave all 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.910
 the settings as I am 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.649
 returning vale is in the main already 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.119
 I know that there is more below but good no more 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.399
 you have to put these you see here 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.020
 and good and little more guys and now a 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.209
 Once you do this, you give it back and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.399
 it's supposed to improve a little bit more the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.840
 I hope that I have served you and we 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.840
 we see in the next video a greeting
