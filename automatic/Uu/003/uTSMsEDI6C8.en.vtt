00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.270
 we know manufacturer xiaomi of course 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.770
 all and one of the things true 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.840
 they are actually known to be positive 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.180
 are their powerbanks well I have now 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.000
 one to go and review in this 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.340
 video I will briefly discuss this with him 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 is the 5000 milliampere hour model 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.360
 thin he is pretty thin and we are too 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.030
 other models there is a 10,000 hair 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.560
 median per hour model 3 is also on 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.000
 16,000 video per hour model 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.000
 these are all pretty cheap these 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.410
 costs around 14 euros and yes that lasts 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 which are another course, the more expensive 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.340
 For example, 16,000 is around 30 euros 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.130
 but well it is just very neat 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.810
 prices I notice about this one 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.660
 Powerbank is that he just returned 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.220
 pleasantly handy, the construction is also good 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.020
 he has an aluminum body 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.309
 with a plastic on the bottom 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 place the plastic on top 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.500
 picture in the button with what 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.660
 indicators of how full it is and there 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 is a usb port as output and one 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.960
 usb port as input it is just 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.739
 all simple he is nice and thin he 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.019
 is not too big 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.359
 and with that is the ideal to take with you 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.689
 and as far as I am concerned that 

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:11.130
 backup thing just more convenient than one 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.359
 10,000 or 16,000 a million per hour 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.679
 variant 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.299
 he feels is just firmly attached 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.770
 all well put together this cable 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.359
 you get supplied nice and short 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.979
 they don't find a built-in cable 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.149
 cable in that might be a pity 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 if you put it in it 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.020
 and you can always just go in like that 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.139
 do your bag and it is not in the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.310
 away so find that very handy 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:30.389
 performance of this power bank 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.249
 of course not so much left 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:36.689
 so has 5000 milliampere hours 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:38.969
 content he can charge with two van per 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.409
 well that 's just fast enough with one 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.219
 bit the standard in power banks 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.020
 nowadays the yes battery that does not work 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.329
 5,000 along with it and the seat 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.169
 always some loss over that is not 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.640
 very different from others 

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:52.740
 power banks and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.080
 yes that you sign for example an hour 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.950
 at essent 7 measures 140 with 100 million 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.260
 per hour 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.979
 battery content that look approximately at times 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.409
 recharge 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.630
 well if you have a galaxy s6 or a galaxy 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.670
 s5 therefore has a telephone between the two 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.290
 and the three thousand million per hour 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.660
 then you probably go twice 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.400
 just did not save but is in any case 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.810
 just a full one for all phones 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.030
 battery charge in and with it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.650
 of course just very good backup 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.660
 so in that respect, it simply performs 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.209
 completely fine is the xiaomi mi 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.890
 powerbank is a whole for me 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.780
 nice model he's just not too 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.489
 large you can easily take with you 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.450
 so it doesn't cost that much 14 euros 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.459
 about 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.880
 and yes in terms of output and functionality 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.880
 with the indicator lights and the like 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.530
 he is also just doing well he is under 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.239
 others available on to it by point 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.010
 comes from there the link from him 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.870
 the description of this video 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.130
 you can also at other web shops 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.630
 He is not officially in it 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.739
 Netherlands available so that is has 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.870
 something to be reckoned with 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.940
 but if you are looking for cheap 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.690
 and good powerbank then I would definitely 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.690
 look at this one
