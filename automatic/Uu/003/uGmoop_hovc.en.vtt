00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.090
 you can suddenly get a little bit of 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.090
 job 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.190

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.370
 day a little bit to evaluate in 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.670
 as a trainee it's good it's good 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.890

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.990
 friendly approach 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.700
 anyway a trainee who 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.899
 think it's a trainee who takes 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.200
 risks and an internship to who takes 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.460
 risks 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.119
 it's a trainee who is not doing well 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.560
 job the trainee must needs to be 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.390

 this is the goal but risk 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.610
 of error an emotion for you when you 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.960
