had<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.570> had<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> Bronze<00:01:31.590> Age<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> like

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
had it had to be the Bronze Age and like

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
had it had to be the Bronze Age and like
bronze<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.909> chip<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.390> bronze

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
bronze if you chip a little bronze

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.380 
bronze if you chip a little bronze
pickaxe<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.549> granite<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.180> limestone

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
pickaxe on some granite or limestone

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
pickaxe on some granite or limestone
which<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.470> Pyramid<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> Giza<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
which is I think the Pyramid of Giza is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460 
which is I think the Pyramid of Giza is
made<00:01:38.460> our<00:01:38.610> limestone<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.020> gonna<00:01:40.200> last

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
made our limestone it's not gonna last

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
made our limestone it's not gonna last
too<00:01:40.650> long<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> got<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> make<00:01:41.400> tons<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
too long so you got to make tons of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
too long so you got to make tons of
these<00:01:42.210> things<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:43.500> almost<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.829> playing

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
these things it's almost like playing

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.149 
these things it's almost like playing
Minecraft<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.700> some<00:01:44.880> shit<00:01:45.710> seriously<00:01:46.710> yeah<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Minecraft for some shit seriously yeah I

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
Minecraft for some shit seriously yeah I
built<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.759> I've<00:01:47.939> built<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> fucking<00:01:48.689> period

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
built that I've built the fucking period

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.840 
built that I've built the fucking period
in<00:01:49.110> Minecraft<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> takes<00:01:50.220> long<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
in Minecraft and it takes long in that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
in Minecraft and it takes long in that
but<00:01:51.090> yeah<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> mean<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.020> thing<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
but yeah I mean this this thing is so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440 
but yeah I mean this this thing is so
big<00:01:53.070> -<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:53.790> what's<00:01:53.970> crazy<00:01:54.240> about

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
big - like that's what's crazy about

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080 
big - like that's what's crazy about
about<00:01:55.049> Giza<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> mean<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> fact<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
about Giza right I mean the fact that it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
about Giza right I mean the fact that it
was<00:01:57.210> built<00:01:57.619> here's<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.950> okay<00:01:59.189> let<00:01:59.430> me<00:01:59.490> tell

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
was built here's here okay let me tell

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.980 
was built here's here okay let me tell
you<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.909> here's<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you this here's what I think is the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
you this here's what I think is the
craziest<00:02:01.409> thing<00:02:01.500> about<00:02:01.799> Giza<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.880> was

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
craziest thing about Giza right it was

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
craziest thing about Giza right it was
built<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.229> 4th<00:02:04.560> dynasty<00:02:04.829> which<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.399> what

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
built in the 4th dynasty which is what

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.210 
built in the 4th dynasty which is what
like<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.880> said<00:02:06.090> way<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.600> fuck<00:02:06.810> back<00:02:06.990> 2500<00:02:07.829> BC

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
like we said way the fuck back 2500 BC

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.699 
like we said way the fuck back 2500 BC
now<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.940> wasn't<00:02:09.179> even<00:02:09.390> close<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
now this wasn't even close to when the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.220 
now this wasn't even close to when the
Egyptian<00:02:11.310> Empire<00:02:11.459> was<00:02:11.849> at<00:02:11.970> its<00:02:12.000> peak

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
Egyptian Empire was at its peak

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.210 
Egyptian Empire was at its peak
that<00:02:13.769> happened<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.690> 1300<00:02:15.690> years<00:02:15.900> after<00:02:16.620> they

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that happened like 1300 years after they

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.250 
that happened like 1300 years after they
finished<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.030> Great<00:02:18.239> Pyramid<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.690> Giza<00:02:18.750> so

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
finished the Great Pyramid of Giza so

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.570 
finished the Great Pyramid of Giza so
you<00:02:19.620> would<00:02:19.739> have<00:02:19.830> figured<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.129> like<00:02:20.400> when

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you would have figured that like when

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.440 
you would have figured that like when
they<00:02:20.670> were<00:02:20.730> at<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.879> height<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.090> their<00:02:21.209> power

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
they were at the height of their power

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.660 
they were at the height of their power
right<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:21.930> had<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.379> know<00:02:22.470> huge<00:02:23.010> territory

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
right they had you know huge territory

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.490 
right they had you know huge territory
they<00:02:23.909> they<00:02:24.360> could<00:02:24.569> have<00:02:24.659> brought<00:02:24.840> materials

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
they they could have brought materials

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.619 
they they could have brought materials
in<00:02:25.650> from<00:02:25.920> from<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:26.519> over<00:02:26.790> their<00:02:26.940> empire<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
in from from all over their empire and

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.990 
in from from all over their empire and
and<00:02:28.409> they<00:02:28.650> didn't<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.159> fact<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.580> they<00:02:29.760> did

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and they didn't the fact is they did

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880 
and they didn't the fact is they did
this<00:02:30.150> thing<00:02:30.360> way<00:02:30.720> way<00:02:30.959> earlier<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:31.590> their<00:02:31.709> in

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
this thing way way earlier in their in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.070 
this thing way way earlier in their in
their<00:02:32.069> history<00:02:32.489> with<00:02:33.120> mathematics<00:02:33.870> that

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
their history with mathematics that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.339 
their history with mathematics that
nobody<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.160> explain<00:02:35.610> how<00:02:35.819> they<00:02:35.970> got<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.629> like

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
nobody can explain how they got and like

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.380 
nobody can explain how they got and like
you're<00:02:37.560> saying<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.010> thing<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.549> precise<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you're saying the thing is so precise I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.530 
you're saying the thing is so precise I
mean<00:02:39.989> this<00:02:40.349> thing<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.700> within<00:02:42.090> like

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
mean this thing is like it's within like

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.850 
mean this thing is like it's within like
1%<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.440> perfect<00:02:43.920> accuracy<00:02:44.340> still<00:02:45.269> today<00:02:45.870> right

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
1% of perfect accuracy still today right

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.160 
1% of perfect accuracy still today right
I<00:02:46.890> mean<00:02:47.190> we're<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.940> know<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.269> we're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
I mean we're in what you know the we're

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.720 
I mean we're in what you know the we're
2,000<00:02:49.920> years<00:02:50.099> past<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:52.200> BCE<00:02:52.590> era<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.370> we're

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
2,000 years past the BCE era so we're

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.550 
2,000 years past the BCE era so we're
like<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.299> like<00:02:54.599> 40<00:02:54.989> hours<00:02:55.109> I<00:02:55.319> live

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
like you know this like 40 hours I live

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.520 
like you know this like 40 hours I live
in<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.920> isn't<00:02:56.459> 100%<00:02:56.879> on<00:02:57.269> flat<00:02:57.510> ground<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.049> it

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
in is isn't 100% on flat ground and it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.400 
in is isn't 100% on flat ground and it
took<00:02:58.709> them<00:02:58.980> forever<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.400> even<00:02:59.670> get<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.910> close

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
took them forever to even get it close

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.140 
took them forever to even get it close
right<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.829> think<00:03:02.129> of<00:03:02.220> how<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.790> how<00:03:02.849> long

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
right so think of how think of how long

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.280 
right so think of how think of how long
this<00:03:03.390> thing's<00:03:03.599> been<00:03:03.780> sitting<00:03:03.810> there<00:03:04.049> for<00:03:04.140> over

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
this thing's been sitting there for over

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.740 
this thing's been sitting there for over
4,000<00:03:05.160> years<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.609> it's<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.359> know<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.599> earth

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
4,000 years and it's you know the earth

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.089 
4,000 years and it's you know the earth
is<00:03:07.019> settled<00:03:07.440> there's<00:03:07.620> banging<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.069> know

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
is settled there's banging you know

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.110 
granite casing didn't if I'm pretty sure
yeah<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.139> was<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:34.410> polished<00:03:35.040> granite<00:03:35.430> casing

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
yeah it was like polished granite casing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.210 
yeah it was like polished granite casing
stones<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:36.690> covered<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.169> entire<00:03:37.200> thing<00:03:37.919> so

stones that covered the entire thing so

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.129 
stones that covered the entire thing so
I<00:03:38.250> mean<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.579> must<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.090> blood<00:03:39.299> must<00:03:39.510> look<00:03:39.750> like

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
I mean it must have blood must look like

fucking a million bucks like you see not
black<00:03:42.660> granite<00:03:43.049> sitting<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:43.680> there<00:03:43.910> yeah<00:03:44.910> I

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
black granite sitting out there yeah I

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.089 
black granite sitting out there yeah I
mean<00:03:45.389> I<00:03:45.419> guess<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.870> was<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.200> tallest<00:03:46.500> human

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
structure up until I don't know I think

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.490 
structure up until I don't know I think
it's<00:03:50.489> something<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.910> Lincoln<00:03:51.500> some

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
it's something like the Lincoln some

it's something like the Lincoln some
something<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:53.040> know<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.220> might<00:03:53.519> want<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.819> to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
something I know I might want to go to

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.119 
something I know I might want to go to
the<00:03:54.120> aliens<00:03:54.510> thing<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.410> have<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.829> ask<00:03:55.980> this

long<00:04:37.730> ago<00:04:38.770> are<00:04:39.770> we<00:04:39.830> under<00:04:40.190> estimating<00:04:40.840> yeah<00:04:41.840> I

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
long ago are we under estimating yeah I

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.410 
long ago are we under estimating yeah I
mean<00:04:42.680> I<00:04:42.800> really<00:04:43.040> like<00:04:43.580> did<00:04:43.850> they<00:04:43.970> really<00:04:44.210> have

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.550 
mean I really like did they really have
they<00:04:44.660> might<00:04:44.840> have<00:04:44.960> had<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.110> complex

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
they might have had a complex

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.280 
they might have had a complex
mathematics<00:04:46.100> system<00:04:46.430> but<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.030> no<00:04:47.330> well<00:04:48.050> here

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
mathematics system but the no well here

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.140 
mathematics system but the no well here
okay<00:04:48.590> here's<00:04:48.800> here's<00:04:49.040> how<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.280> refute<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:49.790> and

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
okay here's here's how I refute that and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.550 
okay here's here's how I refute that and
this<00:04:50.450> gets<00:04:50.780> back<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:51.110> what<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.260> was<00:04:51.410> saying

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
this gets back to what I was saying

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.920 
this gets back to what I was saying
about<00:04:51.710> when<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.250> was<00:04:52.400> built<00:04:52.670> in<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.450> timeline

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
about when it was built in the timeline

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.200 
about when it was built in the timeline
of<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.200> Egyptian<00:04:54.620> Empire<00:04:54.770> if<00:04:55.430> if<00:04:55.910> the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
of the Egyptian Empire if if the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.600 
of the Egyptian Empire if if the
Egyptians<00:04:56.780> had<00:04:57.350> this<00:04:57.650> kind<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:58.010> math<00:04:58.250> down

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
Egyptians had this kind of math down

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.090 
Egyptians had this kind of math down
that<00:04:59.000> early<00:04:59.480> and<00:04:59.660> they<00:05:00.440> weren't<00:05:00.740> even<00:05:00.980> at<00:05:01.070> the

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
that early and they weren't even at the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.850 
that early and they weren't even at the
top<00:05:01.400> of<00:05:01.550> their<00:05:01.670> power<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.330> top<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.750> the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
top of their power the top of the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.590 
top of their power the top of the
Egyptian<00:05:03.860> dynasty<00:05:04.460> was<00:05:04.640> like<00:05:04.850> Tutankhamun<00:05:05.510> or

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
Egyptian dynasty was like Tutankhamun or

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.570 
Egyptian dynasty was like Tutankhamun or
I<00:05:05.660> can<00:05:05.900> cut<00:05:06.110> all<00:05:06.260> that<00:05:06.380> shit<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.860> was<00:05:06.920> like<00:05:06.980> it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
I can cut all that shit it was like it

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.040 
I can cut all that shit it was like it
was<00:05:07.730> called<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:08.060> new<00:05:08.210> Kingdom<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.780> was<00:05:08.870> like

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
was called a new Kingdom it was like

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.600 
was called a new Kingdom it was like
fifteen<00:05:09.530> hundred<00:05:09.830> years<00:05:09.860> after<00:05:10.190> they

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
fifteen hundred years after they

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.310 
fifteen hundred years after they
finished<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.060> Great<00:05:11.240> Pyramid<00:05:11.660> don't<00:05:12.140> you

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
finished the Great Pyramid don't you

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.110 
finished the Great Pyramid don't you
think<00:05:12.620> that<00:05:12.770> one<00:05:12.950> of<00:05:13.070> these<00:05:13.160> pharaohs<00:05:13.700> who<00:05:13.940> was

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
think that one of these pharaohs who was

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.060 
think that one of these pharaohs who was
way<00:05:14.390> richer<00:05:14.840> had<00:05:15.080> way<00:05:15.320> more<00:05:15.350> advanced<00:05:15.860> society

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
way richer had way more advanced society

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.909 
way richer had way more advanced society
would<00:05:17.030> have<00:05:17.060> built<00:05:17.450> something<00:05:17.750> as<00:05:18.169> good<00:05:18.860> or

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
would have built something as good or

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.400 
would have built something as good or
better<00:05:19.370> I<00:05:19.760> would<00:05:20.540> think<00:05:20.690> so<00:05:20.930> Spinks<00:05:21.350> was

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
better I would think so Spinks was

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.730 
better I would think so Spinks was
before<00:05:22.070> them<00:05:22.390> and<00:05:23.390> that<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:24.140> I<00:05:24.260> consider<00:05:24.530> the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
before them and that and I consider the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.980 
before them and that and I consider the
Sphinx<00:05:25.040> a<00:05:25.160> much<00:05:25.580> greater<00:05:26.180> achievement<00:05:26.840> than

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
Sphinx a much greater achievement than

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.010 
Sphinx a much greater achievement than
the<00:05:27.140> Great<00:05:27.350> Pyramid<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.740> Giza<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:29.630> do<00:05:29.810> why

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
the Great Pyramid of Giza you do why

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.850 
the Great Pyramid of Giza you do why
because<00:05:30.410> it's<00:05:30.620> one<00:05:30.890> solid<00:05:31.310> piece<00:05:31.340> of<00:05:31.490> stone

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
because it's one solid piece of stone

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.990 
because it's one solid piece of stone
well<00:05:33.860> yeah<00:05:34.010> but<00:05:34.130> they<00:05:34.250> just<00:05:34.400> had<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.640> carve<00:05:34.850> the

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
well yeah but they just had to carve the

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.670 
well yeah but they just had to carve the
fuck<00:05:35.210> out<00:05:35.390> of<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.750> ground<00:05:36.020> fuck<00:05:36.290> out<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.590> it

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
fuck out of the ground fuck out of it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.260 
fuck out of the ground fuck out of it
like<00:05:36.919> how<00:05:37.340> do<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.490> get<00:05:37.790> like<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.240> know

and like if you had frost and better you
wouldn't<00:06:21.229> sitting<00:06:21.500> there<00:06:21.590> beat<00:06:21.740> him<00:06:21.890> to<00:06:21.979> death

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
wouldn't sitting there beat him to death

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.969 
wouldn't sitting there beat him to death
you'd<00:06:22.340> give<00:06:22.550> him<00:06:22.669> food<00:06:22.850> water<00:06:23.180> they<00:06:23.930> keep<00:06:24.140> I

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
you'd give him food water they keep I

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.630 
you'd give him food water they keep I
think<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:25.850> Sphinx<00:06:26.180> is<00:06:26.330> pretty<00:06:26.540> badass<00:06:26.780> but<00:06:27.380> I

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
think the Sphinx is pretty badass but I

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.830 
think the Sphinx is pretty badass but I
think<00:06:28.640> what<00:06:28.790> distinguishes<00:06:28.910> it<00:06:29.570> from<00:06:29.600> the

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
think what distinguishes it from the

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.659 
think what distinguishes it from the
Great<00:06:30.050> Pyramid<00:06:30.440> again<00:06:30.680> is<00:06:30.860> that<00:06:31.040> is<00:06:31.220> the<00:06:31.430> math

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
Great Pyramid again is that is the math

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.080 
Great Pyramid again is that is the math
and<00:06:32.030> just<00:06:32.750> the<00:06:32.930> pure<00:06:33.169> logistics<00:06:33.890> of<00:06:34.040> it<00:06:34.190> I<00:06:34.370> mean

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
and just the pure logistics of it I mean

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.180 
and just the pure logistics of it I mean
how<00:06:35.360> many<00:06:35.419> stones<00:06:35.960> they<00:06:36.229> had<00:06:36.410> to<00:06:36.530> get<00:06:36.770> how<00:06:37.010> they

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
how many stones they had to get how they

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.650 
how many stones they had to get how they
had<00:06:37.340> to<00:06:37.460> get<00:06:37.669> them<00:06:37.820> where<00:06:38.030> they<00:06:38.060> quarried<00:06:38.510> them

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
had to get them where they quarried them

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.070 
had to get them where they quarried them
from<00:06:38.900> how<00:06:39.080> they<00:06:39.229> carried<00:06:39.620> them<00:06:39.740> all

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
from how they carried them all

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.140 
from how they carried them all
they<00:06:40.199> coordinated<00:06:40.919> at<00:06:41.039> all<00:06:41.189> and<00:06:41.460> they<00:06:41.849> ended

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
they coordinated at all and they ended

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.719 
they coordinated at all and they ended
up<00:06:42.270> with<00:06:42.449> this<00:06:42.569> absolutely<00:06:43.139> perfect

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
up with this absolutely perfect

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.600 
up with this absolutely perfect
structure<00:06:44.729> it's<00:06:45.509> just<00:06:46.020> that<00:06:46.830> you<00:06:46.979> ski<00:06:47.340> really

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
structure it's just that you ski really

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.040 
structure it's just that you ski really
can't<00:06:47.849> explain<00:06:48.210> it<00:06:48.389> and<00:06:48.539> then<00:06:48.629> it<00:06:48.780> leaves<00:06:48.930> you

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
can't explain it and then it leaves you

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.200 
can't explain it and then it leaves you
believe<00:06:49.259> well<00:06:49.469> why<00:06:50.069> did<00:06:50.340> they<00:06:50.460> build<00:06:50.639> it<00:06:50.879> are

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
believe well why did they build it are

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.760 
believe well why did they build it are
we<00:06:51.419> really<00:06:51.629> supposed<00:06:51.870> to<00:06:52.110> believe<00:06:52.169> this<00:06:52.439> was

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
we really supposed to believe this was

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.920 
we really supposed to believe this was
just<00:06:52.979> to<00:06:53.069> put<00:06:53.219> some<00:06:53.460> old-ass<00:06:53.969> crusty<00:06:54.509> mummy<00:06:54.719> in

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
just to put some old-ass crusty mummy in

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.860 
just to put some old-ass crusty mummy in
when<00:06:55.110> they<00:06:55.199> got<00:06:55.319> done<00:06:55.530> I<00:06:56.479> don't<00:06:57.479> know<00:06:57.659> I<00:06:57.689> did

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
when they got done I don't know I did

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.779 
when they got done I don't know I did
here's<00:06:58.409> another<00:06:58.620> question<00:06:58.860> like<00:06:59.520> you<00:06:59.610> said

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
here's another question like you said

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.399 
here's another question like you said
this<00:06:59.939> was<00:07:00.150> before<00:07:00.360> they<00:07:00.870> got<00:07:01.050> into<00:07:01.289> their

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409 
this was before they got into their

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:02.779 
this was before they got into their
mainstay<00:07:01.830> power<00:07:02.069> when<00:07:02.340> they<00:07:02.430> had<00:07:02.550> all<00:07:02.639> the

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
mainstay power when they had all the

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.899 
mainstay power when they had all the
gold<00:07:03.030> and<00:07:03.449> all<00:07:03.509> the<00:07:03.689> big<00:07:04.319> armies<00:07:04.740> right<00:07:05.039> yeah<00:07:05.669> I

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909 
gold and all the big armies right yeah I

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.360 
gold and all the big armies right yeah I
didn't<00:07:06.419> like<00:07:06.539> to<00:07:06.569> Tut<00:07:07.199> King<00:07:07.680> Tut<00:07:07.889> and<00:07:07.919> create

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
didn't like to Tut King Tut and create

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.159 
didn't like to Tut King Tut and create
this<00:07:08.520> huge<00:07:08.879> massive<00:07:09.150> one<00:07:09.509> to<00:07:09.599> outdo<00:07:09.930> him

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
this huge massive one to outdo him

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.920 
this huge massive one to outdo him
that's<00:07:11.099> exactly<00:07:11.370> what<00:07:11.819> I<00:07:11.849> would<00:07:12.000> say<00:07:12.240> it<00:07:12.750> goes

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
that's exactly what I would say it goes

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.409 
that's exactly what I would say it goes
not<00:07:13.169> exist<00:07:13.500> back<00:07:13.620> then<00:07:13.680> if<00:07:14.639> yeah<00:07:15.000> you<00:07:15.240> could

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
not exist back then if yeah you could

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:16.850 
not exist back then if yeah you could
have<00:07:15.509> you<00:07:15.810> think<00:07:16.139> that<00:07:16.289> if<00:07:16.409> they<00:07:16.530> could<00:07:16.740> have

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
have you think that if they could have

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.200 
have you think that if they could have
if<00:07:17.129> they<00:07:17.250> could<00:07:17.430> have<00:07:17.520> just<00:07:17.669> pulled<00:07:17.879> a<00:07:18.000> Great

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
if they could have just pulled a Great

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.550 
if they could have just pulled a Great
Pyramid<00:07:18.599> out<00:07:18.690> of<00:07:18.810> their<00:07:18.900> ass<00:07:19.050> whenever<00:07:19.440> they

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
Pyramid out of their ass whenever they

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.159 
Pyramid out of their ass whenever they
felt<00:07:19.770> like<00:07:19.979> it<00:07:20.190> that<00:07:20.699> then<00:07:21.240> if<00:07:21.659> you<00:07:21.840> look<00:07:22.020> at

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169 
felt like it that then if you look at

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:25.159 
felt like it that then if you look at
the<00:07:22.259> pyramids<00:07:22.740> that<00:07:22.830> were<00:07:23.099> created<00:07:23.669> after<00:07:24.169> you

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169 
the pyramids that were created after you

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.559 
the pyramids that were created after you
know<00:07:25.289> the<00:07:25.469> old<00:07:25.620> old<00:07:26.129> dynasties<00:07:26.759> they<00:07:27.389> look

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:27.569 
know the old old dynasties they look

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:29.330 
know the old old dynasties they look
like<00:07:27.780> shit<00:07:28.110> in<00:07:28.289> comparison<00:07:28.919> to<00:07:28.949> this<00:07:29.099> thing

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
like shit in comparison to this thing

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.490 
like shit in comparison to this thing
and<00:07:29.520> the<00:07:29.909> mathematics<00:07:30.569> don't<00:07:30.810> don't<00:07:31.259> match<00:07:31.469> it

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
and the mathematics don't don't match it

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.379 
and the mathematics don't don't match it
it's<00:07:31.949> just<00:07:32.159> not<00:07:32.340> as<00:07:32.550> it's<00:07:32.789> not<00:07:32.940> as<00:07:33.120> accurate

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:33.389 
it's just not as it's not as accurate

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:37.010 
it's just not as it's not as accurate
it's<00:07:34.349> nowhere<00:07:34.650> near<00:07:34.830> as<00:07:35.069> tall<00:07:35.460> and<00:07:35.819> again<00:07:36.750> you

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
it's nowhere near as tall and again you

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.659 
it's nowhere near as tall and again you
know<00:07:37.080> yeah<00:07:37.259> they<00:07:37.500> were<00:07:37.560> they<00:07:37.860> were<00:07:37.919> more

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:38.669 
know yeah they were they were more

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.260 
know yeah they were they were more
affluent<00:07:39.120> than<00:07:39.779> then<00:07:40.529> the<00:07:41.099> Egypt<00:07:41.909> that<00:07:42.060> built

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270 
affluent than then the Egypt that built

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.850 
affluent than then the Egypt that built
the<00:07:42.419> Great<00:07:42.569> Pyramid<00:07:42.930> at<00:07:43.050> Giza<00:07:43.080> so<00:07:43.469> it<00:07:43.560> just<00:07:43.710> it

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 
the Great Pyramid at Giza so it just it

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.170 
the Great Pyramid at Giza so it just it
just<00:07:44.039> doesn't<00:07:44.279> really<00:07:44.340> doesn't<00:07:44.879> really<00:07:45.000> add

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 
just doesn't really doesn't really add

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.080 
just doesn't really doesn't really add
up<00:07:45.210> it<00:07:45.569> seems<00:07:45.779> it<00:07:46.080> seems<00:07:46.409> out<00:07:46.650> of<00:07:46.680> place<00:07:47.090> so

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.090 
up it seems it seems out of place so

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.269 
up it seems it seems out of place so
yeah<00:07:48.900> you<00:07:48.960> know<00:07:49.139> you<00:07:49.259> connect<00:07:49.889> it<00:07:50.009> with<00:07:50.039> the

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:50.279 
yeah you know you connect it with the

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.680 
yeah you know you connect it with the
Mayans<00:07:50.669> and<00:07:50.819> some<00:07:51.029> of<00:07:51.120> that<00:07:51.210> other<00:07:51.360> shit<00:07:51.659> you

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.690 
Mayans and some of that other shit you

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.510 
Mayans and some of that other shit you
start<00:07:52.050> to<00:07:52.139> ask<00:07:52.289> yourself<00:07:52.409> like<00:07:52.889> well<00:07:53.129> I<00:07:53.370> don't

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 
start to ask yourself like well I don't

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.760 
start to ask yourself like well I don't
know<00:07:53.610> I<00:07:53.639> mean<00:07:54.169> maybe<00:07:55.169> there's<00:07:55.560> something

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:55.770 
know I mean maybe there's something

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.890 
know I mean maybe there's something
