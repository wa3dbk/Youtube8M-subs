Warhammer which is looks exactly the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.440 
Warhammer which is looks exactly the
same<00:02:37.019> looks<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.220> I'll<00:02:39.060> equip<00:02:39.299> it

for<00:02:39.659> you<00:02:41.180> now<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.360> will<00:02:42.599> be<00:02:42.720> what<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.019> long

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
for you now this will be what the long

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.470 
for you now this will be what the long
hammer<00:02:43.409> looks<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:43.920> except<00:02:44.430> let's<00:02:45.180> go<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
hammer looks like except let's go to the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.449 
hammer looks like except let's go to the
stats<00:02:45.750> real<00:02:45.989> quick<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:48.680> pretty<00:02:49.680> heavy<00:02:49.890> 26

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
stats real quick this is pretty heavy 26

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.970 
stats real quick this is pretty heavy 26
weight<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.959> long<00:02:52.170> hammer<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:54.980> lot

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
weight now the long hammer is a lot

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.210 
weight now the long hammer is a lot
lighter<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.200> because<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.620> lightness<00:02:59.040> it

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
lighter and because of the lightness it

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.369 
lighter and because of the lightness it
has<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.609> same<00:02:59.819> effect<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.780> ebony<00:03:01.140> blade

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
has the same effect that the ebony blade

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.420 
has the same effect that the ebony blade
does<00:03:01.680> which<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.519> swings<00:03:03.030> at<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.349> speed<00:03:05.069> of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
does which is it swings at the speed of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.910 
does which is it swings at the speed of
a<00:03:05.579> one-handed<00:03:06.180> weapon<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:06.930> it's<00:03:07.650> got<00:03:07.829> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
a one-handed weapon so it's got the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.800 
a one-handed weapon so it's got the
power<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.519> two-handed<00:03:09.150> weapon<00:03:09.450> with<00:03:09.659> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
power of a two-handed weapon with the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.930 
power of a two-handed weapon with the
speed<00:03:10.079> of<00:03:10.109> a<00:03:10.290> one-handed<00:03:10.650> weapon<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.760> this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
speed of a one-handed weapon so this

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.270 
speed of a one-handed weapon so this
obviously<00:03:12.120> swings<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.780> lot<00:03:12.959> slower<00:03:13.319> than<00:03:13.769> what

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
obviously swings a lot slower than what

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.180 
obviously swings a lot slower than what
the<00:03:14.430> long-term<00:03:14.640> one<00:03:14.940> would<00:03:15.060> do<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:17.040> long

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the long-term one would do and the long

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.150 
the long-term one would do and the long
hammer<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.609> not<00:03:17.639> enchanted<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.919> can

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
hammer is not enchanted but you can

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.159 
hammer is not enchanted but you can
enchant<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.760> which<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.269> do<00:03:21.329> recommend<00:03:21.450> doing

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
enchant it which I do recommend doing

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.059 
enchant it which I do recommend doing
because<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:24.060> kind<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.870> weak<00:03:25.139> not<00:03:25.859> really

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
because it's kind of weak not really

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.520 
because it's kind of weak not really
it's<00:03:26.160> got<00:03:26.220> 21<00:03:26.669> damage<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.510> mean<00:03:27.720> if<00:03:28.410> you're

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it's got 21 damage but I mean if you're

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.750 
it's got 21 damage but I mean if you're
a<00:03:28.560> higher<00:03:28.799> level<00:03:29.160> you're<00:03:29.430> gonna<00:03:29.519> want

a higher level you're gonna want

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.330 
a higher level you're gonna want
something<00:03:30.090> higher<00:03:30.239> than<00:03:30.269> 21<00:03:30.840> damage<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.500> just

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
something higher than 21 damage so just

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.369
