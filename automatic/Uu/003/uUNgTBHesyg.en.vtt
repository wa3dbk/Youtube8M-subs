 rome is density with three men but 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.570
 manage to get you the value for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.889
 Christmas stekelenburg is the answer 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.290
 spectacular of the Roma goalkeeper who 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 manages to stretch out to dive to divert 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.520
 this sudden conclusion of di 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 Christmas that immediately goes close to scoring 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.080
 surprise punishment of totti per 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 flourishes the parade of berchicci and ball 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.900
 sensational goal for the Rome that now 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.910
 insists with the apple then ends on the ground 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.810
 fails to catch balloon ball 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.760
 that ends up outside 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.480
 surprise punishment beat by totti 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.620
 in vertical for florenzi gravissima the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.540
 carelessness of the player from Udine 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.370
 but the florenzi moons are also very serious 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.480
 that only ahead for those who failed 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.829
 to beat him 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.780
 the porter found himself practically 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 the ball on the foot and managed to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.730
 reject simply by lifting the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.100
 left foot big goal ball for the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 big rome assisi totti that in short yes 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 is invented you talked about inventions has 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.710
 found free florenzi lilo has served 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.899
 with a surprise punishment but 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.969
 inattention is very serious and aside 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 of guidolin defenders in three were 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.140
 on the apple and none marked 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.299
 florenza provides the udinese totti la 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.729
 catches the cross in florenzi again 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.500
 the header crosses and then the sail 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.990
 deposits the ball in the net for the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.570
 advantage of the Giallorossi team 1 a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.670
 0 for Rome once again Udine 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.140
 that in defense doll on this 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.750
 attack action of the Rome ball 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.180
 recovered from totti cross in half shot 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.700
 of florenzi head a half parade 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.439
 instinctively by bechis the ball 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.360
 which bounced to the ground hit the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 crossbar and finished on the foot was apple 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.250
 that put him back on the net and rome then 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.870
 that is really advantageous 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 very important from the point of view 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.890
 We have said this tactic florenzi 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.120
 more than once and that is playing from 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.160
 striker and also in this circumstance 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.200
 first a goal was devoured 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.300
 now I hit the crossbar and then it is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 transformed into an assist for the goal of 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.050
 lamela and udinese can restart with the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.340
 attempt to descend maicon on the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.290
 ball on the right the conclusion 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.080
 stuck on the ground by stekelenburg 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.000
 and then hugs the ball where to say 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.130
 thank goodness that I did not pass between the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200
 legs in taninese at left 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240
 with 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.619
 which avoids the bottom jump skips two 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.619
 great opponents played goal 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.280
 they the put on of muriel that puts to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.170
 sit two dimensions of Rome and then 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.910
 goes to finish with the right ball 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.709
 ends up between the legs of 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.170
 stekelenburg and therefore there is a tie 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.569
 of Udine in the sixteenth minute with 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.970
 muriel who returns to the goals afterwards 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.709
 I believe three days of abstinence ball 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.750
 inside for a regular position 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.040
 voltage osvaldo the goalkeeper jumps and 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.230
 ball out 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.810
 sensational goal ball failed by osvaldo 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.560
 just in front of berchicci is wrong 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.810
 lob 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.790
 the ball ends up sensational 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.800
 chance is for the Rome to get the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.510
 advantage right in the first minute of 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.489
 recovery but osvaldo only in front of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.959
 berkeley missed the lob 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.340
 Udinese protested for recovery 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.530
 he talks about leaps that maybe was 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.660
 foul and 25 seconds a conclusion 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.340
 burdisso looks for reds rome doesn't know 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.250
 whether to throw along the ball or search 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.549
 the action is played and tries with piris 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.350
 which drops 17 seconds to the end piris 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.760
 wrong step forward e 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.590
 the Udinese recaptures the ball is 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.400
 practically this is the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.799
 draw 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.230
 1 1 ends between Udine and Rome at the end 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.209
 I would say the right result even if the Rome 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.650
 at the ninetieth the goal of the wasted 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.120
 victory with osvaldo are in front and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.400
 beautiful that there is a lob that is wrong 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.380
 but in the end it is just so accounts 1 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.180
 1 the first time the second time roma 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.459
 better than the Udine and Rome did not have 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.620
 the nastiness and cynicism of closing 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.880
 the match with osvaldo and therefore 11 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.130
 against 10 more players now 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.989
 they go to trial with the race director 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.640
 it is not known why it ends 1 to 1 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.530
 between udinese and roma pvc a rocket col 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.530
 result that serves little revenue
