00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
bubbles or any lint on the screen itself

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.840

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
which I did a pretty nice job I do like

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.490 
which I did a pretty nice job I do like
to<00:03:55.000> take<00:03:55.150> my<00:03:55.269> time<00:03:55.299> when<00:03:55.780> I'm<00:03:55.870> doing<00:03:56.049> screen

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
to take my time when I'm doing screen

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.860 
to take my time when I'm doing screen
shows<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:57.430> that's<00:03:57.640> why<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.880> get<00:03:58.180> no<00:03:58.329> bubbles<00:03:58.720> or

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
shows so that's why I get no bubbles or

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.039 
shows so that's why I get no bubbles or
anything<00:03:59.260> like<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.410> all<00:03:59.860> my<00:04:00.190> device<00:04:00.489> itself

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
anything like that all my device itself

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.360 
anything like that all my device itself
so<00:04:02.049> let's<00:04:02.230> simply<00:04:02.470> go<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.709> take<00:04:02.829> closer<00:04:03.130> look
