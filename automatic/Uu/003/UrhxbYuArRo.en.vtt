00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.110
 hi everyone guys are the bows from 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.240
 there and today we are here in a new video 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.460
 where you will see a new tactic that 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.210
 I think it will be very, very useful in 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.250
 clan wars 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.369
 let's say for the mid-high levels then 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.289
 the town hall level 8 9 and 10 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.570
 I'm talking about the tactics that he combines 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.849
 hot air balloons hunt down two troupes that they are 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.470
 flying of course but let's say they don't have 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.140
 in fact, much the balloons in common 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.570
 attack defenses while videos dragons 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.460
 they attack all these two too much for 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.399
 Combined guys become something 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.020
 devastating and so there I did 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.420
 these two really really attacks 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.610
 very beautiful in my opinion and then 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.129
 attacked people also quite strong 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.430
 now I will show you the boys we have to 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.469
 make more or less 89 dragons and the rest 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.410
 hot air balloons to keep beckham in the home a 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.660
 dragon and two or three hot air balloons 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.760
 hot air balloons and you're done 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.100
 then we go to have a daughter of 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.190
 dry as proud hot air balloons we support 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.229
 these two rows with the furies and then 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.640
 we have practically finished ours 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.410
 attack 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.090
 now you guys see the first one here 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.929
 Scratch case is this here with reader 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.750
 hell on 2 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.289
 so let's say a player enough 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.440
 strong 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.360
 before hanging up with a survey 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.090
 hot air balloons or uncovered points 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.220
 with some archer so we say o 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 also directed my dragons towards the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.440
 center of the village in fact you see they are 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.170
 went to place archers in 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.539
 I turn the dead spots precisely and then I have 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.310
 started with the actual attack 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.929
 there is really the beauty of these troops 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.569
 that the dragons saw attacking 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.099
 target to a multiple also attack 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.869
 the troops of the Giannini who therefore do not 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.819
 there is the problem of destroying troops 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.649
 of the enemy clan because anyway 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.509
 they quietly kill the dragons 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.630
 so I mean this is a point in my opinion 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.090
 strongly support this strategy 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.039
 I especially recommend it to municipalities 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.720
 level moves like me who can't 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.910
 have for example the four that 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.560
 have the municipalities level 10 or even goes 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.629
 also good for a town hall at level 10 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.030
 for the lower ones not much 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.569
 because anyway the balloons go 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.129
 well 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.249
 that at 5 then velotto town hall 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.870
 however lower they are not good look 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.450
 here I put two files before investigation 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.060
 command and then the balloons and then the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 world there and obviously two furies advance 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.359
 side and then I put a nice one 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.819
 central fury you see here that the troops 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.340
 the cram of the opposing clan have been 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.079
 annihilate like nothing and then I have 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.000
 even the town hall was destroyed 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.480
 two beautiful stars that in war not 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.639
 they are absolutely bad and go to the boys 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.709
 however this strategy in my opinion is 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.750
 much much better than hot air ballooning 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.669
 thugs because it is more reliable but it is 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.040
 more expensive so if we want to climb 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.930
 however it takes much more time and not 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.510
 I would advise sailing for 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.060
 climb maybe you can do like me every 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.129
 so you put them to do so at night 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.099
 morning attack and don't waste time 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.900
 to make these troops 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.219
 so guys for this heel we say 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.370
 that was all because now I have put 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:11.290
 the heroes for failing 50 percent 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.669
 better here anyway I am at all 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.129
 easily 50 percent player 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.930
 strong enough and with hot air balloons 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.359
 cigars I would have practiced a lot because 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.549
 however I have city hall level 9 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.310
 I can't have big frost spells and 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.759
 therefore said hell annoy 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.650
 A lot of my balloons I sent here 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:33.470
 just the mess I was there real to do 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.180
 as much percentage as possible and no 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.669
 second attack instead was against a 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.409
 City Hall at level 9 we say an attack 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.810
 a little simpler but not entirely 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.169
 because anyway this one had le 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.879
 very very high and therefore air defenses 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.669
 let's say it was a moment longer 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.829
 complicated one member recommended me 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.509
 of my attached claudio was a bit 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.009
 skeptical because I saw these anyway 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.299
 air defenses the reader must be good 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.919
 and so on 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.530
 but in the end I managed to do two 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.689
 stars that is really an ethical attack and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.849
 we go immediately to see it then I put it 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.889
 immediately as you can see in dragons ne 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.200
 hot air balloons and then of course he has them 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.319
 put two beautiful furies to make them go 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.060
 much further on you see here that 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.650
 however it is already heading towards the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.070
 center of the village so it was already 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.180
 practically made boys 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.220
 the point where you put i 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.840
 dragons and hot air balloons because of them 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.510
 put the dragons in the wrong place 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.820
 maybe they go around the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.740
 village and it really becomes a mess 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.810
 so guys, I recommend you while you 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.600
 from there in line because if you put them all 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.060
 a point there is no notice where they want 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.580
 really becomes a mess that is not 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.010
 do it because they are really sending you 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.750
 to the area completely the attack goes well 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.910
 here I had already made two stars then I have 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.340
 also put the royalty so I'm going to do 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.310
 more and more possible percentage e 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.290
 however a very very nice attack 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.139
 I think I recommend you try this 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.780
 strategy because I think it is one of the 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.300
 best for clan wars 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.710
 obviously not better than a golem 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.960
 spots and various stuff 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.810
 but a valid alternative these 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.180
 proven strategies to let me know if you 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.010
 like let me know how you are 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.020
 if you have any alternative if you have 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.610
 some different strategy and nothing 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.020
 guys this was the end of the attack 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.760
 see the two heroes that are 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.280
 destroying the rest of the buildings e 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.490
 remaining at the end I will be able to do the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.960
 71 percent and so guys try 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.210
 really this strategy because it is 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.680
 devastating and no kids us there 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.680
 let's see in an upcoming video
