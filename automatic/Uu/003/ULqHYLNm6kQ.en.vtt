magazine and Ave Web today we're gonna

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.669 
magazine and Ave Web today we're gonna
fly<00:00:08.610> some<00:00:08.910> NDB<00:00:09.570> approaches<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.349> Cirrus

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
fly some NDB approaches and the Cirrus

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.730 
fly some NDB approaches and the Cirrus
sr22<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:12.179> doesn't<00:00:12.420> have<00:00:12.509> an<00:00:12.630> ADF<00:00:12.960> we're<00:00:13.620> gonna

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
sr22 it doesn't have an ADF we're gonna

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.250 
sr22 it doesn't have an ADF we're gonna
use<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> GPS<00:00:14.370> instead<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.630> clouds

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
use the GPS instead in the clouds

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.250 
use the GPS instead in the clouds
no<00:00:16.699> but<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:18.270> still<00:00:18.539> something<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.170> do

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
no but it's still something you can do

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
no but it's still something you can do
for<00:00:19.500> proficiency<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.340> good<00:00:20.760> mental<00:00:21.150> exercise

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
for proficiency a good mental exercise

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.269 
for proficiency a good mental exercise
when<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> turn<00:00:22.230> off<00:00:22.439> all<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> moving<00:00:23.100> maps

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
when you turn off all the moving maps

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.580 
when you turn off all the moving maps
here's<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.090> works

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
here's how it works

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.170 
here's how it works
we're<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> use<00:00:25.920> GPS<00:00:26.250> number<00:00:26.820> two<00:00:27.029> in

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
we're going to use GPS number two in

we're going to use GPS number two in
this<00:00:27.330> series<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.470> set<00:00:28.500> for
