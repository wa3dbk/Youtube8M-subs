00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 so hello and it comes to another 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.430
 Video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.589
 Unfortunately today I want you right 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.660
 cool she shows what that all looks like 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.559
 I want to include you after the intro 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.559
 2 to the same 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.180
 so it comes back to one 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.220
 further goal today as well 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.480
 I want to tell you a cool one 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:47.600
 prefers to introduce 4172 yes so you sport 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:50.870
 here plan bio of it sees minus 1 55 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.970
 20 49 23 7 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.339
 this is bonus rest i believe i 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.809
 I would not always be that different 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.129
 for sure 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.129
 apparently kept the situation looks like 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.909
 very nice if you turn right now 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.770
 you can see a glass under water and 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.130
 Of course, it does not come naturally 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.939
 in front 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.049
 I just marked that where the 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.659
 dungeon is here you are already there 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.330
 skeleton dungeon I'll pick him up 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.159
 can not see anything yet 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.820
 so are some money that brownish 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.909
 colored no access to the cave to a 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.520
 cave 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.109
 but here and in the chest 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.020
 located quite nice 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:39.320
 It's not that great, but that's it 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.359
 does not mean anything if we go here again 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.020
 go on or fly 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:47.030
 swim but what if we still have one 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 monastery to the technically natural 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.909
 but here we also have 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.909
 then already that spinning 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.799
 so has the broken even 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.299
 open access two tests of bread 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.069
 vinyl records gold horses is very nice 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.709
 but not that is maybe not 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:13.280
 you have already been bad 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.370
 relatively much iron for direct and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.260
 at the beginning yes, then I always want to continue 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.830
 fly 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 So now we return to sport 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.310
 back 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.930
 and there are two more 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.720
 either from a tenant where there 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.660
 There is something really great as well 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.850
 interior design and now go fly 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.010
 Whatever we dance, swim 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:49.390
 just diagonally over the whole way so 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.730
 beautiful brook and so and then we would have to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.660
 also the rector on the first pc 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.330
 belch here it is doing now 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.500
 fortunately relatively big with church can 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.800
 you pray a bit and so on 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:09.750
 we even sell cheaper here 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:17.260
 no one needs here you can age 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:22.620
 stupid sale nxp well apparently have 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.620
 Here we carrots cereal potatoes 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.850
 unfortunately no forge but church so 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.880
 but now comes the borssum haft wants 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.700
 I'll say which one is my concept 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.230
 closed at practically here, too 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.200
 bz on now seen here on the left 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.150
 you come to a desert and the desert 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.680
 winning really involves something extreme 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.319
 is great 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.079
 So you really do not have to go far 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.909
 running dancing is swimming no matter 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:01.269
 that which is externally liable in others 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.540
 However, there was not quite enough 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:10.239
 no matter how rare it is 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:14.250
 Just watch yourself where that was the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.250
 should be the whole of him 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.210
 coordinates you have to help me so 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.740
 still there 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.259
 now we have to be there for 15 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.009
 and there we have it already and that 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:41.500
 Well-known is a pyramid in one 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.070
 villiger doors so i mean manager 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.370
 village i know the percent such 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.060
 chance how likely it is 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.430
 village spot access half in plains bio and 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.240
 then the percentage chance of 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.680
 one here from a temple and so on 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.380
 then directly with a forge 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.669
 Into each other so that's it 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.289
 on his heels 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.300
 the hips are just so 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.729
 survived and where not from the celebrity the 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.240
 luckily crushes the chest too 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.610
 Not 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.060
 it is even relatively good 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.280
 ice evaluates the ever hot and in the 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.750
 pyramid that can be here right there 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.539
 you actually live well here 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:28.389
 islands transition because here is the other one 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:30.250
 house even with basf books is too 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.270
 not so great man but has two books 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.240
 houses a church on the changed 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.980
 Parameters are except phaeton 19 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.370
 a little bit wool 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.850
 a pressure plate and a lot of sandstone 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:51.310
 nor will but the meat still unaware 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:54.850
 very nice gold bars bone rink 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.560
 still a bit of the dull helpless and that 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.670
 is cool iron until you can handle it 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.200
 act immediately 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.200
 some horse armor altogether so ne 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.200
 printing plate 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.620
 I still have it here 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.680
 Christmas tree end 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.210
 Well, in any case, what actually 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.070
 maybe vastic's imagination is 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.860
 not the best but i mean like that 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.150
 just with cheaper village is forever 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.200
 already lifestar forward 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.720
 you have to go a bit further 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.920
 run was still in a jungle 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.760
 here we still pumpkins for that is 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.870
 more so for common yes some chickens 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:46.140
 so and a flower forest the market too 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:48.850
 every yes forest arrangements flowers here 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.610
 yes I draw her for how long 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.080
 I know here are horses here 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:59.419
 then another epic mountain region 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:03.379
 This is not really bad for me 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.030
 he would have that meat too 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:07.520
 enough 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:10.219
 well so the further he could still 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.979
 explore yourself if you are in the 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:15.830
 bz found other local 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.240
 media not only like my comments 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:23.840
 for me but also for the others 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:25.009
 now a lot of gravel otherwise thanks for 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.699
 I hope that you see 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.699
 failed
