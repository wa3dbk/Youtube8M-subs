was just part of a video that 343

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.630 
was just part of a video that 343
released<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> corner<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.520> like

three seconds you can see somebody

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.549 
three seconds you can see somebody
playing<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.370> looks<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.940> halo<00:00:39.450> 4<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.140> if

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
playing what looks to be a halo 4 and if

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.200 
playing what looks to be a halo 4 and if
you<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.800> watch<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> video<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.730> kind<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> like

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you go watch the video it's kind of like

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
you go watch the video it's kind of like
a<00:00:42.270> zoomed<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.719> picture<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.950> can

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
a zoomed in picture of it and you can

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
a zoomed in picture of it and you can
make<00:00:44.879> out<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> assault<00:00:45.719> rifle<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.170> some

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
make out the assault rifle in some

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.380 
make out the assault rifle in some
bright<00:00:46.829> light<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.550> hard<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:47.969> but

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
bright light it's really hard to see but

keeping this like on the dl ok I ya know

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.460 
keeping this like on the dl ok I ya know
much<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.299> at<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.840> mean<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.409> were

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
much about it at all I mean there were

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
much about it at all I mean there were
so<00:01:19.710> many<00:01:19.799> rumors<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.520> around<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:21.000> the

so many rumors going around that the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.840 
so many rumors going around that the
physics<00:01:21.780> were<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.530> reach<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.220> end

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
physics were gonna be like reach I end

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.870 
physics were gonna be like reach I end
up<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.990> cry<00:01:25.560> myself<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.159> sleep<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.700> they

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
up I would cry myself to sleep as they

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
up I would cry myself to sleep as they
were<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.360> mean<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> heard<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.170> they're<00:01:28.320> using

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
were I mean I heard that they're using

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.399 
were I mean I heard that they're using
the<00:01:28.680> same<00:01:28.890> graphics<00:01:29.670> engine<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.570> but

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the same graphics engine and like but

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
the same graphics engine and like but
they're<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> use<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> same<00:01:32.490> like

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they're not going to use the same like

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.929 
they're not going to use the same like
physics<00:01:33.600> barely<00:01:34.290> jump<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> hope<00:01:35.820> they

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
physics barely jump in so I hope they

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.460 
physics barely jump in so I hope they
don't<00:01:36.090> use<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> same<00:01:36.540> ranking<00:01:36.930> system<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> mean

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
don't use the same ranking system I mean

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
don't use the same ranking system I mean
do<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> want<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.340> halo<00:01:38.640> 3<00:01:38.880> or<00:01:39.030> halo

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
do you want it to be like halo 3 or halo

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.270 
do you want it to be like halo 3 or halo
reach<00:01:39.479> I'd<00:01:39.930> rather<00:01:40.350> ever<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.890> more<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.159> there

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
reach I'd rather ever be more on there

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.149 
reach I'd rather ever be more on there
Caleb<00:01:41.610> hey<00:01:42.060> look<00:01:42.680> actually<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> could<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
Caleb hey look actually it could be a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.630 
Caleb hey look actually it could be a
combination<00:01:44.460> between<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.450> how<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.590> um<00:01:46.920> ok

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
combination between the two how so um ok

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.960 
combination between the two how so um ok
say<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.899> played<00:01:49.439> um<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.610> could<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
say like you played um you could have a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.399 
say like you played um you could have a
credit<00:01:51.390> system<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.320> a

a game and what people don't want yeah
me<00:03:55.170> buddy<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.890> equipment<00:03:56.760> do<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:56.940> like<00:03:57.120> the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
me buddy the equipment do you like the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.670 
me buddy the equipment do you like the
equipment<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:58.230> Halo<00:03:58.950> 3<00:03:59.150> not<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.360> Halo<00:04:00.660> 3<00:04:00.690> oh<00:04:01.200> fun

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
equipment in Halo 3 not in Halo 3 oh fun

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770 
equipment in Halo 3 not in Halo 3 oh fun
of<00:04:01.800> that<00:04:01.950> but<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.910> know<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.120> Halo<00:04:03.420> Reach<00:04:03.450> I

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
of that but you know in Halo Reach I

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.940 
of that but you know in Halo Reach I
think<00:04:03.959> they<00:04:04.050> went<00:04:04.170> too<00:04:04.380> far<00:04:04.620> with<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
think they went too far with the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.220 
think they went too far with the
abilities<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.910> just<00:04:06.209> feel<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.930> kind<00:04:07.050> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
abilities it's just feel that kind of

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.259 
abilities it's just feel that kind of
made<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.070> game<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.250> bit<00:04:08.459> more<00:04:08.610> unbalanced<00:04:09.090> than

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
made the game a bit more unbalanced than

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.560 
made the game a bit more unbalanced than
it<00:04:09.390> wasn't<00:04:09.720> halo<00:04:10.410> 3<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.709> Halo<00:04:10.769> 2<00:04:10.970> anyway<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
it wasn't halo 3 and Halo 2 anyway I

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.050 
it wasn't halo 3 and Halo 2 anyway I
don't<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.650> armor<00:04:14.400> abilities<00:04:14.730> really

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
don't like the armor abilities really

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.440 
don't like the armor abilities really
either<00:04:15.300> but<00:04:16.109> if<00:04:16.410> they<00:04:16.680> had<00:04:17.640> made<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.269> like

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
either but if they had made it so like

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.090 
either but if they had made it so like
you<00:04:18.600> pick<00:04:18.900> them<00:04:19.109> up<00:04:19.169> kind<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.769> like<00:04:19.919> the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
you pick them up kind of like the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.279 
you pick them up kind of like the
equipment<00:04:20.580> in<00:04:20.669> Halo<00:04:20.970> 3<00:04:21.000> then<00:04:21.750> there's<00:04:22.049> more
