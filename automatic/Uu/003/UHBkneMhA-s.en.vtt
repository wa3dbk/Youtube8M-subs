00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
you're frozen and then using the rail

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:22.360 
you're frozen and then using the rail
for<00:02:12.680> sure<00:02:16.840> without<00:02:17.840> rail<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.290> cold<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:22.220> you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
for sure without rail is cold and you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.470 
for sure without rail is cold and you
know<00:02:22.489> one<00:02:22.670> thing<00:02:22.880> that<00:02:23.030> will<00:02:23.090> save<00:02:23.300> your

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
know one thing that will save your

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
calves from getting too sore of course

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.699 
calves from getting too sore of course
that<00:02:39.590> will<00:02:39.650> make<00:02:39.799> your<00:02:39.920> quads<00:02:40.190> more<00:02:40.430> sore<00:02:41.709> and

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
that will make your quads more sore and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.210 
that will make your quads more sore and
then<00:02:43.580> another<00:02:43.880> thing<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.630> do<00:02:44.890> going<00:02:45.890> down

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
then another thing you can do going down

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.820 
then another thing you can do going down
is<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.530> sideways<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.440> next<00:02:51.470> time

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
is to do it sideways so the next time

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.860 
is to do it sideways so the next time
the<00:02:52.700> next<00:02:52.820> time<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.150> go<00:02:53.269> down<00:02:53.420> we<00:02:53.450> can<00:02:53.690> go

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the next time we go down we can go

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.410 
the next time we go down we can go
sideways<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.250> right<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:56.330> we

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
sideways to the right and then we

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.080 
sideways to the right and then we
excited<00:02:56.810> ways<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.200> left<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:58.640> that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
excited ways to the left and and that

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.060 
excited ways to the left and and that
spreads<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.600> around<00:02:59.660> between<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.769> different

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
spreads it around between the different

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.470 
spreads it around between the different
rustles<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.510> then<00:03:02.660> your<00:03:02.870> your<00:03:03.079> left<00:03:03.739> sore<00:03:04.329> in<00:03:05.329> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
rustles so then your your left sore in a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.430 
rustles so then your your left sore in a
particular<00:03:05.930> muscle<00:03:08.049> you're<00:03:09.049> still<00:03:09.320> at<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
particular muscle you're still at the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.930 
particular muscle you're still at the
same<00:03:09.620> amount<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:09.980> sore<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.549> spreads<00:03:10.820> it

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
same amount of sore but it spreads it

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.420 
same amount of sore but it spreads it
around<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> lots<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.860> different<00:03:13.130> muscles

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
around it's a lots of different muscles

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.860 
around it's a lots of different muscles
so<00:03:13.579> it's<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.790> little<00:03:13.940> more<00:03:14.000> tolerable<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.780> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
so it's a little more tolerable and it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.729 
so it's a little more tolerable and it
doesn't<00:03:15.110> last<00:03:15.290> for<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.489> long<00:03:16.900> because<00:03:17.900> if<00:03:18.530> you

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
doesn't last for so long because if you

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.280 
doesn't last for so long because if you
do<00:03:18.920> repeat<00:03:19.370> stairs<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.780> just<00:03:20.930> keep<00:03:21.110> going

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
do repeat stairs and you just keep going

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.250 
do repeat stairs and you just keep going
down<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.680> down<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.799> down<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:24.049> sore

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
down and down and down you can be sore

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.320 
down and down and down you can be sore
for<00:03:24.290> four<00:03:24.950> or<00:03:24.980> five<00:03:25.130> days<00:03:26.799> yeah

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.360
