00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.690 
I think the way I uninstalled it is
supposed<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.260> make<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.440> undetectable<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.550> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
supposed to make it undetectable so you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.100 
supposed to make it undetectable so you
don't<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.150> like<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> huge<00:02:17.860> part<00:02:18.370> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
don't have like a like a huge part and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.540 
don't have like a like a huge part and
it's<00:02:20.110> difficult<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.680> put<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:20.980> your<00:02:21.130> own<00:02:21.190> area

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
it's difficult to put in your own area

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.360 
it's difficult to put in your own area
so<00:02:22.090> over<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.330> course<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.780> week<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:24.340> I

shower<00:02:51.730> caps<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.239> shower<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.870> personally<00:02:53.650> know

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
shower caps to shower I personally know

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.740 
shower caps to shower I personally know
from<00:02:54.310> my<00:02:54.430> experience<00:02:54.459> using<00:02:55.120> shower<00:02:55.450> caps

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
from my experience using shower caps

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.390 
from my experience using shower caps
against<00:02:56.080> my<00:02:56.380> hair<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:57.180> wetter<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.900> wetter

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
against my hair a wetter that wetter

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.370 
against my hair a wetter that wetter
here<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.610> guess<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.299> makes<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.630> wetter<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.230> gets

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380
