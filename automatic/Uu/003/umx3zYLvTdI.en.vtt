00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.520
 We already had the third video of the series dedicated to the products 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.370
 renowned star today we will know how is the production process of the 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.369
 white stud and we're going to do it with the team of rapporteurs who 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.499
 work south of Navarre in the municipality of fustiÃ±ana 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.779
 As you know, white asparagus is obtained by preventing the plant from 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.619
 expose to the sun to give you an idea you could compare the plant with 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.260
 a comb each of the leaks is an asparagus to pick it up the first thing is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 discover it is to separate the black plastic that cover the earth and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.649
 then it starts 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.879
 what is done is that only one of the plays is started 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.590
 that is just an asparagus 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.170
 and that they do when 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.100
 the tip of the asparagus protrudes and we must try not to damage the rest that go 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.399
 coming out during the season is also curious because the plant lasts quite 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.920
 about seven years when the season ends what they do is to let grow 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.260
 the asparagus and they do not cut it until the following season 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.160
 newly picked makes a first cut at the base of the stud just for 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
 fit in the house that is the measure that interests 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.619
 once they have picked up as you see that day it was raining and we had to 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.990
 run out they are taken to the ship where they do what they call the book 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
 public is to say that they put very cold water for a few minutes with this is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 manages to keep all its properties 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.649
 After the environment are classified by size and shape 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:22.939
 if they are for restaurants that sell in boxes of 5 kilos and if they do what 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.939
 they call half-kilo diapers 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.290
 and as you can see, he tries hard not to touch the sun because immediately 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.560
 they start to catch a pink color 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.420
 and it is about that they are well white now there is a detail aes for those who 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.940
 they come from quite far 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.140
 it is about equal transport spend fifteen days or more and obviously the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.840
 they have to try to keep the color so if you see asparagus 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.440
 navarra that are a little pink is a good sign that they have not been 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.440
 added no product to keep them 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.989
 also during the whole season you can buy online, but right now 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.929
 did not contemplate nature is more oriented to tomatoes since it is 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:30.819
 good season I'm sure it's interesting interest a hug 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.469
 horned
