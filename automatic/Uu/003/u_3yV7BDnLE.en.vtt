sometimes we wake up on the wrong side

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.690 
sometimes we wake up on the wrong side
of<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.900> bed<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.410> our<00:01:27.860> bodies<00:01:28.250> feel

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
of the bed and our bodies feel

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.120 
of the bed and our bodies feel
differently<00:01:29.180> then<00:01:29.870> they<00:01:30.470> had<00:01:30.620> felt<00:01:30.920> before

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
differently then they had felt before

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.200 
differently then they had felt before
and<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.600> inner<00:01:33.230> signals<00:01:34.010> for<00:01:34.610> certain

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
and so the inner signals for certain

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.720 
and so the inner signals for certain
changes<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:35.900> adjustments<00:01:36.010> change<00:01:38.350> we<00:01:39.350> also

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.559 
the way it feels that something new will
feel<00:02:06.530> wrong<00:02:06.890> instead<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.730> right<00:02:08.030> and

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
feel wrong instead of right and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.830 
sometimes that very new thing is
thing<00:02:10.850> that<00:02:11.030> will<00:02:11.150> set<00:02:11.360> everything<00:02:11.480> in

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
thing that will set everything in

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.510 
thing that will set everything in
balance<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:12.530> we're<00:02:12.710> so<00:02:12.890> used<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.490> old

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
balance but we're so used to the old

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.490 
balance but we're so used to the old
feeling<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.870> trouble<00:02:15.170> letting<00:02:15.320> go

when things don't go the way that we

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.940 
when things don't go the way that we

need to punish ourselves in order to

self-flagellation<00:04:11.440> it's<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:12.590> it's<00:04:12.739> a

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
self-flagellation it's so it's a

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.460 
self-flagellation it's so it's a

different kind of atmosphere to work in

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.390 
different kind of atmosphere to work in
I<00:04:17.019> know<00:04:18.019> from<00:04:18.200> my<00:04:18.349> own<00:04:18.380> experience<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:19.160> being

having been a perfectionist that
sometimes<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:25.490> can<00:04:25.669> really<00:04:25.910> get<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.240> way

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
sometimes that can really get in the way

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.650 
sometimes that can really get in the way
of<00:04:26.660> our<00:04:26.780> progress<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.430> if<00:04:28.789> you<00:04:28.970> extend

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
of our progress and that if you extend

of our progress and that if you extend
the<00:04:29.870> concept<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.560> perfection<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.460> include

with all of the things that are
then<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.600> progress<00:04:47.020> is<00:04:47.050> even<00:04:47.410> greater<00:04:47.560> then

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
then the progress is even greater then

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.890 
then the progress is even greater then
you're<00:04:48.430> expanding<00:04:48.940> your<00:04:49.210> concept<00:04:49.780> of

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
you're expanding your concept of

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.870 
you're expanding your concept of
perfection<00:04:50.560> so<00:04:51.070> in<00:04:51.190> other<00:04:51.280> words<00:04:51.550> it's<00:04:51.729> no

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
perfection so in other words it's no

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.879 
perfection so in other words it's no
longer<00:04:52.120> perfect<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.720> beat<00:04:52.900> myself<00:04:53.110> up<00:04:53.470> it's<00:04:53.710> no

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
longer perfect to beat myself up it's no

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.400 
longer perfect to beat myself up it's no
longer<00:04:54.130> perfect<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.509> punish<00:04:55.870> myself<00:04:56.110> for
