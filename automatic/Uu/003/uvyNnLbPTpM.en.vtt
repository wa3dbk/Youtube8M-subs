00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.590 
it first 30 years ago I wanted to buy it
30<00:00:30.839> years<00:00:31.080> ago<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.669> didn't<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> money<00:00:33.059> man

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
30 years ago I didn't have a money man

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
30 years ago I didn't have a money man
it<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.900> had<00:00:34.199> been<00:00:34.379> converted<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.220> mini

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it was had been converted to mini

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
it was had been converted to mini
storage<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.360> didn't<00:00:39.659> buy<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.839> but<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
storage and so I didn't buy it but I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
storage and so I didn't buy it but I
happen<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.400> be<00:00:41.519> looking<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:41.970> paper<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
happen to be looking at the paper and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.410 
happen to be looking at the paper and
saw<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.739> sale<00:00:43.949> by<00:00:44.760> someone<00:00:45.329> who

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
saw that it was for sale by someone who

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.990 
saw that it was for sale by someone who
I<00:00:45.570> knew<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.079> came<00:00:47.070> over<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.370> looked<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
I knew I came over and looked at it and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.990 
I knew I came over and looked at it and
he<00:00:48.059> had<00:00:48.210> converted<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> duplex<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
he had converted it to a duplex and I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
he had converted it to a duplex and I
thought<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.260> potentially<00:00:52.949> great

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
thought it was really potentially great

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.390 
thought it was really potentially great
space<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> could<00:00:55.079> remodel<00:00:55.379> this

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
space but I could remodel this

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.430 
space but I could remodel this
and<00:00:56.550> make<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.880> better<00:00:57.030> space<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:58.140> shapes

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and make it better space all the shapes

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.570 
and make it better space all the shapes
that<00:00:58.860> you<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.830> like<00:01:01.830> nothing<00:01:02.370> else

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
that you see it's it's like nothing else

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.760 
that you see it's it's like nothing else
you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.600> vertical<00:01:04.050> space<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
you know the vertical space and the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.950 
you know the vertical space and the
different<00:01:05.160> forms<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.910> things<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
different forms of things and because of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.670 
different forms of things and because of
the<00:01:07.230> colors<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.940> sits<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.660> geometry<00:01:12.680> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the colors you sits like geometry that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.340 
the colors you sits like geometry that
used<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.250> mostly<00:01:14.640> closed<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.300> +<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.840> was
