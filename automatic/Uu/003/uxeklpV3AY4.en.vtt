common<00:00:14.849> misconception<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
common misconception here is that the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040 
common misconception here is that the
entire<00:00:16.980> team<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.880> affected<00:00:18.539> by<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.720> one

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
relic so let's say one person runs the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
relic so let's say one person runs the
take<00:00:21.330> more<00:00:21.539> damage<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.560> entire<00:00:22.890> team

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
take more damage and the entire team

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.250 
take more damage and the entire team
suffers<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> did<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.810> helped<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.230> a

game with my friend John the chief and
we<00:00:27.240> decided<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> go<00:00:27.750> test<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.349> used<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
we decided to go test this I used the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.580 
we decided to go test this I used the
fire<00:00:28.890> track<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.000> fire<00:00:30.269> trap<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:30.779> my

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
fire track of the fire trap as my

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
fire track of the fire trap as my
damaging<00:00:32.550> method<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.000> let<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.420> hit<00:00:33.630> me

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
damaging method I just let it hit me

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.209 
damaging method I just let it hit me
five<00:00:33.989> times<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> fire<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> then<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.040> hit

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
five times in the fire and then it hit

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.560 
five times in the fire and then it hit
me<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.340> sixth<00:00:35.700> time<00:00:35.880> when<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> got<00:00:36.270> out<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
me a sixth time when I got out of the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.030 
me a sixth time when I got out of the
fire<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.440> looked<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
fire and I just looked at what the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.619 
fire and I just looked at what the
health<00:00:38.219> was<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> very<00:00:39.270> clear

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
health was and it was a very clear

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.170 
health was and it was a very clear
difference<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.860> first<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> control

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
difference the first one was a control

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.750 
difference the first one was a control
the<00:00:42.600> second<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.620> where<00:00:43.920> my<00:00:44.160> teammate<00:00:44.579> had

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the second one was where my teammate had

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.830 
the second one was where my teammate had
it<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.360> no<00:00:45.480> difference<00:00:45.809> between

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it and there was no difference between

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
it and there was no difference between
those<00:00:46.260> two<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.190> last<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.579> was<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.090> had

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
those two and the last one was one I had

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.450 
those two and the last one was one I had
it<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.719> teammate<00:00:49.079> did<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.280> could

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it my teammate did not and you could

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060 
it my teammate did not and you could
clearly<00:00:50.969> tell<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> last<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:52.739> red

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
clearly tell on the last one I had red

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
clearly tell on the last one I had red
health<00:00:53.309> after<00:00:53.489> five<00:00:53.850> hits<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.329> sixth<00:00:54.600> hit

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
health after five hits and a sixth hit

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.049 
health after five hits and a sixth hit
out<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> fire<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.920> compared<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
out of the fire but compared to the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.580 
out of the fire but compared to the
first<00:00:57.480> ones<00:00:57.690> where<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> actually<00:00:57.989> still<00:00:58.350> had

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
first ones where I actually still had

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.920 
first ones where I actually still had
green<00:00:58.980> health<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.480> very

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
green health so this is a very very

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560 
green health so this is a very very
obvious<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.609> true<00:01:02.910> when<00:01:03.359> one

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
obvious that it is not true when one

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
obvious that it is not true when one
person<00:01:03.899> has<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.170> take<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:04.769> damage<00:01:04.949> relic

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
person has they take more damage relic

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
person has they take more damage relic
the<00:01:05.820> fact<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.510> he<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> only<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the fact is he is the only one that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
the fact is he is the only one that
takes<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.369> damage<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.390> does<00:01:09.510> not

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
takes more damage it really does not

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
takes more damage it really does not
make<00:01:09.780> any<00:01:09.960> sense<00:01:10.229> otherwise<00:01:10.770> everyone<00:01:11.369> else

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
make any sense otherwise everyone else

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
make any sense otherwise everyone else
in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> team<00:01:12.210> should<00:01:12.750> run<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> round<00:01:13.590> like

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
in the team should run that round like

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
in the team should run that round like
so<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.220> guys<00:01:14.490> ever<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:15.060> anyone<00:01:15.360> say

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
so if you guys ever see anyone say

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
so if you guys ever see anyone say
anything<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.650> direct<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
anything about this just direct them to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
anything about this just direct them to
this<00:01:17.220> video<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> guys<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.720> see

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this video and you guys can just see

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.960 
this video and you guys can just see
them<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> results<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
them at the results because this is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.359 
them at the results because this is
scientific<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> real<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.979> really

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
scientific this is real and it's really

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
scientific this is real and it's really
it<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.790> makes<00:01:24.000> no<00:01:24.119> sense<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:25.020> most

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it just makes no sense because most

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140 
it just makes no sense because most
things<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.220> rumors<00:01:26.729> are<00:01:26.909> they're<00:01:27.000> kind

things that are rumors are they're kind

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
things that are rumors are they're kind
of<00:01:27.270> weird<00:01:27.420> things<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.960> guys<00:01:28.110> give<00:01:28.380> me

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of weird things that you guys give me

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.010
