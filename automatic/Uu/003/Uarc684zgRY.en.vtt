00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.020
 Here we have established the program, we press

 and we can turn off this panel as we 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.110
 we see we have more or less our 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.640

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.260

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.400

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.640
 on the top panel here it is also we 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 can we see the application here these 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.870
 it works but this panel is called 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.720
 hands and dock climbs 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.640
 that is, on top of all windows I can 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.640

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.590
 do fullscreen mode 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.940
 and we see that it hinders us a little 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.940
 let's and turn 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.090

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.530
 by the way ng 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.880
 We naturally set Russian here 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.910
 here we are ok 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.740
 do not go setting up the panel 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.740
 go to the position tab 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.530
 and put here on the desktop also 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.760
 and lower raise or lower i 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.470
 I'll lower it a little so that 0 is from the edge 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.940
 pixels 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.440

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.890
 work well 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.690

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.620
