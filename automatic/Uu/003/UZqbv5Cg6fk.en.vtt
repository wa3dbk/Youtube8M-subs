00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.679
 // 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.100
 as the lived this tutorial on objectives canal be operated and she has 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.549
 genes 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.549
 in this tutorial we will treat landscape photography 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.679
 what happens when we want to capture some clues 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.030
 it's not just focusing a landscape and shooting 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.679
 This is not enough 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.310
 we must think about what we are living to capture all kinds of things not 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.309
 only the landscape if not the sounds the smells 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.270
 we have to establish an emotional connection with the viewer 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.960
 Is it too much to ask 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.770
 but if you really wonder what these images are really about, 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.790
 the rest will be much easier 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.900
 one of the first things to keep in mind is the composition 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.710
 landscape photography is pure composition 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.690
 to include that excluded 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 how to do it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.500
 if we move what happens with the perspective 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.890
 and with the scale of the elements of the landscape 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.829
 we must capture that little tree in front of the mountain 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.439
 or make it stick out above her in the distance think about the 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.100
 position is very important and will undoubtedly influence the goal we choose 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.579
 the next thing to consider is the light 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.250
 obviously the light is basic in any photo 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.990
 but in a foreign country it is part of the same photo 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.030
 landscape photographers do not just think about the scene 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.509
 but at the time of day and where the light comes 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.130
 where the sun goes down at five in the afternoon 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.700
 you may even have a compass today even an alarm clock 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330
 also very useful when photographing landscapes 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.010
 a good landscape photograph gives the feeling of being able to get into it 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.329
 as if I were there 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.060
 as a 3d experience 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.150
 and to capture the details you have to think about which entity to use as is the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.289
 crystal is really the best option so that we choose a goal for 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.030
 landscapes 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.470
 I do not think there's anything better than this 24 millimeter Canon series l is a 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.350
 great goal 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.550
 The series has very good construction very good lens 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.420
 besides that it uses an incredible technology yamada coating of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.380
 structure of his blog github de honda s wc means that when light penetrates 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.670
 in the objective 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.820
 the interface between the air and the glass breaks 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.360
 this technology is based on the structure of a butterfly's eye for 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.469
 we mean that it drastically reduces the reflection 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.990
 the glow that would enter and you get a more useful image 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.889
 which is obviously what the photographer is looking for 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:27.549
 if you get out of your budget and are looking for something more affordable more flexible about 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.379
 everything if your camera and senate psc like the 60 itv vehicles 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.860
 This is a very short range of 10 22 millimeters very flexible 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.280
 have an equivalent to 16 35 focal length 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:44.630
 instead if you want a super ambular to get a full view 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.689
 I recommend a 14 millimeter 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.899
 also of the l series as indicated by the red stripe 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:51.840
 It is a big lie 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.870
 You can capture every detail all the subtlety of light 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.930
 canon factory also central objectives 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.820
 to take a picture we usually think of the approach as something that is ahead of 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.309
 we 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.580
 these objectives alter the angle 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.590
 so that if we work with little depth of field 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.969
 we can create strange illusions of focus in different planes 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.330
 it serves to create a juliete city effect 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.549
 where things look like miniatures 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.540
 the most important thing for a photographer of especially urban landscapes is the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.339
 displacement function because avascular the objective is distorted the 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.109
 object 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.889
 but being able to move the lens focal plane of the lens is as if the 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.449
 The photo was taken from a higher plane and the horizontal 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.859
 back of the camera keeping the building of the objects 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.089
 without distortion 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.609
 and now let's see what the objectives can do 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.530
 now that we have on the screen I have pictures of landscapes captured with this type 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.109
 of objectives 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.129
 here is a very good one with a fixed target of 14 millimeters 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:55.129
 you see all the light differences the approach covers the full breadth of the 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.489
 image almost to the bottom where the mountain is 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.689
 very pretty and 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.689
 this piece the same goal 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.409
 we see how it is also possible to bring everything to the front and continue using the 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.719
 landscape the view reaches far away has a nice sweep on the shore 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.640
 there is also the composition 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.690
 it's funny we usually say that we do not take pictures with the sun 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.310
 but look is just coming out there is no that annoying reflex that can ruin 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.100
 the contrast of an image 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.430
 and that's because of the great quality of the lens 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.490
 this image was captured with a 24 mm objective 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.319
 an interesting perspective yes it's very close fills the whole plane 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.339
 has a special strength and has been very well does not require that focus but 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.030
 keep the detail sharp 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.750
 the silhouette of each person 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.249
 and despite everything the movement retains the sensation of sweep 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:43.110
 I like it 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.290
 and that detail of movement in the corner 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.650
 and even in low light 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.690
 has captured the movement the lens has not captured very well it looks very sharp 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.030
 let's see the objectives decentralize I have two images that reflect very well 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.300
 how to act in a country urban agesa do an exact before and after 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.039
 This is a classic shot of buildings 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.860
 these lines are expected to point towards the exact infinity are more 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.360
 convergent verticals that we talked about earlier when you scale the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.999
 target on a building now with the aim of extending speak you can 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.490
 lengthen verticals 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.689
 so it was taken in the same place 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.499
 this time with the right lens 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.699
 It is very interesting because sometimes we hope that a perspective 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.669
 disappear 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.520
 and with a fence in a natural way 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.389
 and if you exaggerate it, we seem to do the opposite 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.370
 The central objective allows very precise control 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.520
 we could even exchange the towers 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.520
 today even redesign venice florence 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.650
 this one was made with an ax groped millimeters the longest we've 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:44.700
 seen so far 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.600
 is an example of someone who was quite distant with a long goal 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.870
 and the effect shortens the perspective 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.439
 because when we are far away the perspective in the distance is flat 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.860
 it's very well got 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.639
 the mountain appears flat as in a painting 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.650
 the light is also very good 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.240
 I also like the way he has had to work the photographer is a 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.070
 of the things that we have talked about getting up early pick up the light carry 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.789
 a heavy equipment to the right place 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:10.939
 plan well 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:13.939
 everything contributes to a great photo 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:15.719
 thank you has 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.210
 we have seen many things today and I hope they encourage you to think 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.930
 in new ways to improve your landscape photos one of the first 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.689
 things you can do is to try a different goal and see where it goes 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.469
 so go out and explore and let the goals or be inspired 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.719
