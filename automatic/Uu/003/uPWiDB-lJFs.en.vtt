00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
lengths and there's a few that actually

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.050 
lengths and there's a few that actually
have<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.420> round<00:01:32.840> stem<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.430> under

have a round stem on it and under
technical<00:01:35.630> specs<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.170> try<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.829> put<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
technical specs I try to put the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.490 
technical specs I try to put the
dimensions<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:38.509> thing<00:01:38.810> on<00:01:38.990> there<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:39.409> you

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
dimensions of this thing on there so you

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.580 
dimensions of this thing on there so you
can<00:01:39.680> tell<00:01:40.579> what<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:41.170> anyhow<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.439> is

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
can tell what it is but anyhow there is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.090 
can tell what it is but anyhow there is
the<00:01:42.829> accelerator<00:01:43.820> pump<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.920> have<00:01:46.070> a

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the accelerator pump and you have a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.870 
the accelerator pump and you have a
couple<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:46.729> jets<00:01:48.070> one<00:01:49.070> with<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.430> check<00:01:49.670> ball

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.109 
couple of jets one with the check ball
and<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.180> other<00:01:50.299> one<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.869> without<00:01:52.119> that's

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
and the other one that without that's

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.380 
and the other one that without that's
nice<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.659> have<00:01:53.840> can't<00:01:54.530> buy<00:01:54.710> those<00:01:54.890> separately

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
nice to have can't buy those separately
