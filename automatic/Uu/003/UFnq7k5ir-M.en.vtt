00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello how are you I hope you are super 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.660
 super good and thanks for joining me 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.010
 another video more and good you want to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.780
 we do not want to show off 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.179
 smile much whiter than the one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 we have I think the majority because 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 because it is very normal that with the passage of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 time our smile is no longer so 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 white as it was before and this is not 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.740
 necessarily it is because dirt can be 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.859
 so you take what you eat for yourself 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.269
 you smoke for time and so on but you do not 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.400
 worry because today you 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.070
 I will teach how to make 3 whiteners 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.649
 super easy to make homemade dental 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 super effective and with very few 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.300
 ingredients so if you want to have 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.170
 a perfectly white smile stay 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.879
 watching this video 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.410
 The first thing we will occupy will be a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.410
 bowl and spoon 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.910
 for our first dental whitener 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.140
 what we will occupy will be a spoonful of 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.140
 sodium bicarbonate 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.579
 and the toothpaste that normally 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.579
 you use 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.240
 what we will do is put a little bit of 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.310
 toothpaste in a container and then 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.040
 add the tablespoon of baking soda and 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.410
 mix very well to apply what 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.990
 you will do is put this mixture in your 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.300
 toothbrush and brush the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.210
 teeth as you usually do in a 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.520
 2 to 3 minutes when you finish 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.500
 brush your teeth with your normal pasta 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.100
 and this procedure is repeated every 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 week 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.910
 for our second bleach 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.300
 We deal with a new bicarbonate 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.300
 sodium 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.920
 and a few drops of lemon juice 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.080
 what we will do is mix very well 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.759
 these two ingredients to form a 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.759
 pasta like the one we can see here 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.800
 for our third dental whitener 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.050
 The only thing that we are going to occupy is a 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.360
 banana peel what we will do 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.430
 rub the inside of the shell 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.500
 of banana with our teeth for a 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.600
 a lapse of about two minutes this 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.340
 procedure is done every time you finish 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.790
 to brush your teeth and it can be 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.790
 daily 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.420
 that you really liked this video 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.640
 really the bleaches are 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 effective but remember that we have to 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.410
 be constant to see very good 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.120
 good results and before I go I want 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.110
