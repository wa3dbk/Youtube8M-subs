00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.250 
do you want to know what a mistake
sounds<00:03:29.800> like<00:03:29.950> on<00:03:30.630> 12<00:03:31.630> string<00:03:31.840> guitar<00:03:31.870> like

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
sounds like on 12 string guitar like

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.780 
sounds like on 12 string guitar like
this<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.709> sounds<00:03:33.010> kinda<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:33.640> made

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
this it sounds kinda like it just made

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.280 
this it sounds kinda like it just made
so<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.420> figured<00:03:35.730> probably<00:03:36.730> most<00:03:37.300> guitarists

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
so I figured probably most guitarists

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.949 
so I figured probably most guitarists
make<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.560> mistake<00:03:39.010> at<00:03:39.130> some<00:03:39.160> point<00:03:39.550> in<00:03:39.610> time

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
make a mistake at some point in time

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.670 
make a mistake at some point in time
here's<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.080> difference<00:03:41.320> between<00:03:41.410> me<00:03:41.650> and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
here's the difference between me and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.370 
here's the difference between me and
most<00:03:41.890> guitarists<00:03:42.510> I'm<00:03:43.510> too<00:03:43.720> lazy<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.050> start

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
most guitarists I'm too lazy to start

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.430 
most guitarists I'm too lazy to start
the<00:03:44.470> video<00:03:44.560> over<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:45.870> that's<00:03:46.870> what<00:03:47.080> it<00:03:47.170> sounds

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
the video over so that's what it sounds

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.800 
the video over so that's what it sounds
like<00:03:47.470> when<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.800> screw<00:03:48.070> up<00:03:48.360> if<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.480> watch<00:03:49.690> any

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
like when you screw up if you watch any

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.270 
like when you screw up if you watch any
of<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.080> other<00:03:50.200> videos<00:03:50.530> which<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:51.010> highly
