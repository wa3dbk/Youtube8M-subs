 there is the following enter the house is central 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.410
 In her house downstairs there is a flat that was 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.540
 a shame that lived from africa to 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.030
 climbing the stairs upstairs had my 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.060

 a flex study and the bathroom just for us 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.620
 It was very cool too. 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.550
 and here goes a multi type worked on 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.610
 old about 10 to 15 minutes here 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.500
 I left to walk alone guide 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.280
 there is only Brazilian death of the Brazilian and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.280
 all parked here 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.550
 then I sent about 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.290
 what year is there is only thing 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.830
 Brazilians or more there 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.360
 Brazilian there, he has the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.360
 pizzeria liked the story 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.360
 I already told that pizzeria it's time. 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:12.510
 the Brazilian market here the butcher 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.020
 coffee and juice 10 and play 10 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.790
 Ah dude there 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.790
 I'm going down because you better leave. 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.030
 I just have to go out here because it's 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.709
 against hand back there mateus wanted 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.709
 show where I lived too, right? 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.019
 very Brazilian live here I enjoyed 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.900
 live in this area that has seen 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.430
 It is a very cheap place so the staff 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.730
 What if London is coming? 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.629
 now it's going to fall a lot here because it's the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.090
 greater awareness of the Brazilian 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.060
 So you think sometimes you come to know 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.220
 someone any friend or even people 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.959
 that tells you someone in your room place 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.000
 the staff have many houses the staff 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.629
 hence the possibility of living here 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.629
 it's bigger 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:07.500
 that street does not come up to whine 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:10.670
 or not only could we block is matheus 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.930
 He had already come to here, mateus. 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.670
 guys'm carrying matthew here 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.560
 with me here with a wire the photo 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.780
 trancadinho trancadinho the police pick up 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.430
 your escape 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.840
 I'm walking with the team without power. 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.320
 still nothing 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.910
 the motorcycle insurance and she's her insurance 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.199
 It covers two people and I do not 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.199
 so no problem 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.449
 will pass in front of the personal butcher 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.860
 Where I bought a lot of people, question was 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.789
 except to buy the barbecue meat 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.639
 This shows us there I'll spend in the 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.710
 door right 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.810
 There are several I do not know, you have here. 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.319
 several just so what I like the most 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.639

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.900

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.969
 coined it when I had a 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.610
 I lived alone that I had no wife. 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.770
 I still did not make food at home then 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.150
 when I was comfortable eating food 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:14.210
 I came here guy and I stayed 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.639
 five months without eating rice with 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:22.029
 beans come then when I came to do the 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:27.740
 I counted the lap until the saw is on. 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:29.930
 Wait, wait, I'll see you there, people. 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.689

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.169
 So I recommend it in variety. 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:47.030

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:49.380

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.030
