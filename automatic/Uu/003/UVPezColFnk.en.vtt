00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.799
Today on our 2014 Ford Focus, we&amp;#39;re doing
a test fit on the Thule Rapid Traverse Roof

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:06.799
Rack System.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.520
We&amp;#39;re using the 53 inch Aero-blades, that&amp;#39;s
part number THARB53.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:18.890
The four ADR foot packs, which are the Rapid
Traverse, the part number is TH480R and we&amp;#39;ve

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.340
got the Thule Fit Kit, which is part number
THKIT1627.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.850
We&amp;#39;ve already installed our front bar,
per the manufacturer&amp;#39;s instructions.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:41.170
To begin our installation on the rear bar,
we&amp;#39;re first going to open up our doors,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.620
then place the rack up onto our roof line.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.730
Now we&amp;#39;re going to take a measurement.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:01:30.740
It&amp;#39;s going to be per Thule&amp;#39;s fit guide,
it lists two 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:03:07.570
measurements 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:04:36.690
in there.
