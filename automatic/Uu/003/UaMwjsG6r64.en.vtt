00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.139
 here 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.220
 and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.220
 or almost 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.850
 very good then the other day after 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.820
 make the video where he has taught the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.640
 they ran in to look 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.100
 I took the trough and what you from the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.079
 shelf I hung it on a bar very 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.430
 near the shelf where they 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.970
 they stopped to eat so they left 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.550
 getting used to the roll of the feeder 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.290
 when I did a little air and that and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.660
 so they would get used to flying 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 until the feeder because I already commented 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.040
 in the first video that the purpose was 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.020
 put it in a very central place of 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.820
 I studied so that the birds were 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.710
 flying to the feeder and they went 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.330
 flying with him to his site that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.850
 also forms seeds and 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.890
 masks would be on the pavement 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.649
 and they would not be on the bonsai that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.360
 good that then the seeds that do 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.310
 intra germinate husk dirty 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.110
 many substrates is very ugly does not seem 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.030
 ugly like that would be on the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.460
 clean pavement where simply 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.070
 I would have to sweep the points and then 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.320
 look ya hey I put it there ahead of 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.610
 yesterday and live the first time I see ya 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.610
 carrion is eating 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.689
 young males are still the ones 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.189
 come I do not know if the males are more 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.229
 adventurous than the female less archers 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.649
 or that this would have something in common with the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.500
 human race too but they are males 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.610
 this year's young 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.640
 so that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.860
 we are going to have visitors little by little 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.530
 I will go away every day I will leave one 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.940
 fourth one twenty-five centimeters 30 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.020
 centimeters until I take them to the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.580
 position where you want and they neither 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.470
 they will not even realize that there has been 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.580
 a change because he's already just wanted 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.190
 share this with you because I 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.820
 I look forward to a hug and even the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.820
 next video 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.660
 Y
