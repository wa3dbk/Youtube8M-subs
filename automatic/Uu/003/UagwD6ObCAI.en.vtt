00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.019
 separate heading there for five flights 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.119
 such typical here we will create a chat 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.960
 I'll arrive at the airport where we will see 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.559
 what i produce 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.149
 a couple of points noted there are wires. 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.570
 she is very awesome 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.149
 we fly there polls watching the air 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.030
 let's just pick up speed and 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.059
 take off doing our coup this 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 backflip sort of like that she is called 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.430
 not very ball him a motorcycle finger file 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.730
 but okay we drive in also jump 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.690
 based and drove on 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.690
 get up to others 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.550
 neatly jump backflip and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.830
 we landed on the second floor so 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.790
 say again we do something like that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.480
 on until night fleet fails let's 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.600
 watch two steak little show them 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.130
 a rough bounce off so i changed my mind 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.130
 changed my mind so I see there here 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.680
 little little tramp which 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.260
 So you can fly 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.370
 the main thing is not very good at us is 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.380
 here are the problems now we will make a turn 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.210
 well, or prezi can and so little bit 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.820
 soar we turn our beautiful 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.920
 hangar checks all this happens 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.390

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.490
 I did not support this new 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.220
 because of this i will not continue this 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.790
 we are like a building here that can 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.770
 old charge it by itself top and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.959
 there will be a roof 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.340
 That roof can take one awesome 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.819
 flight can justify here 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.819
 now I take it myself you can fix it 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.590
 drove we climbed the asset i need 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.560
 remember where you can fly 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.840
 yeah from here you can wear on here 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.760
 this pancake if the speed is not very 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.790
 big you need to stand on and off 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.879
 flew okay second attempt we want 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.840
 we can height but now we have to 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.400
 you can turn around and draw big 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.769
 speeds up you can gain speed here and 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.480
 flew right on the photo for the house try 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.370
 let's make it smooth 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.610
 do in flight here we have everything 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.450
 it will turn out but one-two-three drove 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.150
 glayd gala 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.870
 but okay you could not fly you 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.799
 all fields 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.310
 our character lies but basically flying 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.970
 they as if they can not be at 2 you can not them 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.819
 guess what happens for example a day i 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.819
 I did not think that it is highly treatable 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:56.350
 lol ok let's try divide on there 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.440

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.230
 turnover normally landed we went 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.410

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:14.720
 you found yourself an interesting and a little 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.380
 mixed up a button for jessica 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.870
 I played a lot I did slow down 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.870
 Angelina gave sluggishly take off 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.100
 about and then areas yes they just flew 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.370
 going over the fence here that was by the way 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.150
 epic but the reality you are not the first 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:39.470
 it scares your faces online your helmet we 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:44.220
 flew over the fence flew 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:49.560
 fences and how do we go from here to 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.160
 there is always a conclusion but ok but i'm a principle 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.880
 found a way out 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.160

 I jump all muddied and read 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:09.419
 because our redwood we left the court 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:13.110
 evil we gain speed goes on the runway 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:14.970
 Basically write that together with dvuhetazhki 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.390

 need as you notice there are very poor 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.550
