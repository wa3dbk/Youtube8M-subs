00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so the first error is unable to access

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.789 
so the first error is unable to access
craftbukkit<00:00:12.360> don't<00:00:12.900> jostle<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.469> we'll<00:00:13.620> get

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
craftbukkit don't jostle it we'll get

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.079 
craftbukkit don't jostle it we'll get
that<00:00:13.950> one<00:00:14.009> over<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.370> done<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.639> cuz<00:00:14.940> that's

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that one over and done with cuz that's

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.390 
that one over and done with cuz that's
the<00:00:15.150> simplest<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.780> right<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> reason<00:00:17.160> you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the simplest one right so the reason you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.189 
the simplest one right so the reason you
have<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.640> problem<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.720> rename

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
have this problem is because you rename

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.380 
have this problem is because you rename
it<00:00:19.380> jar<00:00:19.949> or<00:00:20.220> you've<00:00:20.369> done<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> typo<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.300> was

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it jar or you've done a typo and it was

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
it jar or you've done a typo and it was
something<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.800> you've<00:00:22.980> got<00:00:23.130> yours<00:00:23.369> looks<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
something so if you've got yours looks a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.460 
something so if you've got yours looks a
bit<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.910> well<00:00:24.449> these<00:00:24.630> don't<00:00:24.900> say<00:00:25.199> dot

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
bit like that well these don't say dot

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.380 
bit like that well these don't say dot
bar<00:00:25.680> at<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> end<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.880> don't<00:00:27.090> need

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
bar at the end of them you don't need

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
bar at the end of them you don't need
the<00:00:27.570> dot<00:00:27.750> jar<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.920> look<00:00:29.099> at<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> extensions<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the dot jar to look at the extensions of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
the dot jar to look at the extensions of
other<00:00:30.119> things<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.929> your<00:00:31.080> room<00:00:31.650> dot

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
other things if that if your room dot

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
other things if that if your room dot
back<00:00:32.009> does<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.219> say<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.850> wrong<00:00:33.239> dot<00:00:33.660> bar

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
back does not say you know wrong dot bar

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
back does not say you know wrong dot bar
and<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.350> says<00:00:34.469> run<00:00:34.800> run<00:00:35.430> me<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.760> something

under half of it you don't really want

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
under half of it you don't really want
to<00:01:41.220> allocate<00:01:41.549> more<00:01:42.090> than<00:01:42.299> half<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.439> just

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to allocate more than half so I'm just

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.100 
to allocate more than half so I'm just
gonna<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.890> half<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.939> how<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
gonna do half so how do you know you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.179 
gonna do half so how do you know you
can't<00:01:46.320> support<00:01:46.560> 8

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
can't support 8

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.580
