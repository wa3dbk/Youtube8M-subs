00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.800
 there is something strange going on with both roaming geese that are not on my own 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.800
 stay 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.240
 This is quite a familiar sight to thousands of barnacle geese that winter here 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 spend it 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.599
 a few are walking between those roaming geese 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.379
 nothing succeeded copies when cups not marked beautiful song they are bicycle 

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.379
 small and they have looking rather than black legs 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 it's a mystery here 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.710
 to solve this mystery we will never go in search of a goose species 3 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.790
 the Netherlands 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.370
 It is a species that does in Scandinavia in ten years to it 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 area around the Black Sea to spend the winter 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.150
 the most likely ended up in the edge of that as tele2 says hans 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.080
 lovers 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.080
 less and less on the pole in the spring 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.360
 in 1980 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.250
 was almost extinct 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.040
 this was had 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.420
 less than 100 green pearls were left of this beautiful little sconce with the golden 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.640
 edge of nonsense 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.300
 the police wanted dogs 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.700
 filmed in June 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 North Holland 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.520
 holder de put in we are among those annually-rearing roosters 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 about twenty rare twenty others 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.260
 these have exchanged unsafe eastern europe for the netherlands 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.880
 But what has made it decide to after maybe want a thousand generations too 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.620
 depart routes 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.370
 the answer seems amazing 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.410
 they learned that from the roaming geese 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.700
 Swedish researchers have had one of the two largest carried out 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.120
 the fire raged 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.670
 one thing is definitely the store here until your kids are up 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.890
 it is important to leave our country to shorten a 4 2 victory 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.580
 the court declares this presence of the 9 to the forefront 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.919
 schiermonnikoog 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.649
 weird anyway and there is the explanation 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.379
 This is the first time father the only two large funds went up 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.159
 his ring number 8 4 4 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.729
 told that in 1790 he was born a swedish lapland with every option parents 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.079
 barnacle geese 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.759
 the autopsy turned out well for this goose, he seems completely upset 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.189
 convinced that he is a barnacle goose and that only provide offspring 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.189
 with a barnacle goose 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.189
 it's like a boy from a far country and there 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.189
 who later with your daughter's house 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.459
 the comedy without children
