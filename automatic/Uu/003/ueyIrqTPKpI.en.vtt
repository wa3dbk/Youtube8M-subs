 video on call of duty black ops 2 so 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.309
 today a pretty short video but 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.320
 I will try to give rhythm to 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.280
 you appreciate this video a maximum 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.140
 so you saw him in a match in 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.750
 delay which on the after directly 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.940
 game fail a triple but worry 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.489
 not he goes to see another is very pretty 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.050
 clip in the sequel to the game so for 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.329
 those who would like class that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.760
 I used with xps 50 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.769
 it's now showing on your screen 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.930
 everyone likes to apologize because like 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.940
 you know the xpr is a sniper 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.379
 semi auto and I tend to rafah them 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.110
 a few times that I hope you 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.820
 will not bother too much so the small gym 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.059
 surprise for you I leave you to everything 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.059
 right now 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 c 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.710
 so here are the guys I hope you 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.869
 have enjoyed this little surprise this little 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.789
 and say realized by bsf that I 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.340
 thanks a lot because he did 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.899
 great work in very very little 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.330
 time and I really think it makes 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.679
 great with the gameplay so if you 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.929
 are of the same opinion as me do not hesitate 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.970
 especially not to what is the chain of 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.770
 bsf which will of course be annotations and 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.659
 a description of this video 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.039
 so for those who would not have everything 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.770
 included in the clip that I admit I put 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.409
 a small five bone with a key 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.840
 kitchen so it's really nice to 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.179
 go back click like this especially 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.049
 after the games remains relatively 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.299
 suitable 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.299
 so as you saw at the beginning of 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.010
 this video with the intros that I have 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.590
 is trying to send this video to several 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.519
 community channels to extend my 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.890
 community 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.440
 so I thank them greatly if she 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.840
 me so here's the guys kitty chan 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.459
 community says little subject so 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.290
 that's why today I have a 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.000
 little question to ask yourself and 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.739
 I really want you to answer it 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.640
 en masse in the comments area of 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.769
 this video 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.900
 so as you have seen with advance 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.940
 warfare they were coming double jumps 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.340
 dash there was really a big 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.650
 big innovation compared to 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.170
 movements that were available on 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.239
 call of duty and thinking about the next 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.090
 call of duty which will of course be developed 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.859
 by treyarch world at war 2 black ops 3 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.950
 or maybe a brand new opus name 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.350
 I told myself the exoskeleton 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.600
 is now indispensable to the 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.060
 creating a call of duty is what 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.859
 treyarch will be forced to put a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.600
 exoskeleton or something 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.400
 like that will make 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.139
 of age double jumps so I'm going 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.900
 immediately give you my opinion so 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.819
 for me not very h is not at all 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.000
 obliged to realize this simply 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.090
 because I really have a large number 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.340
 hours of play on call of duty advance 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.989
 warfare or very early and it really has me 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.400
 do not let go why I have more 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.220
 at all want to play for that too 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.060
 that you see black up 2 in the background and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.180
 I really had no trouble with myself 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.500
 to re-accustom to classical movements 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.900
 of a call of duty which for me 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.560
 the exoskeleton will be the wii 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.720
 not everything will depend on the time at 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.700
 which will evolve in the call of 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.110
 duty if we are in the near future or 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.849
 in the present my opinion there will not be 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.019
 of skeleton exodus and if we are in 2040 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.970
 I do not know why I say this date 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.400
 even in 2040 in my opinion there will be some 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.750
 exoskeletons so here are the guys give 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.609
 me your opinion in space 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.349
