00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.460
 I live Spanish the year comes to an end 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.710
 but I want to stay for the good 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.380
 although many tell me changes wikis 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.910
 good and seeing my not true I do not 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.320
 I notice that 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.320
 but as I know that for us it is 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.810
 towns and roads I want to remind you of a 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.439
 year full of videogames and shapes 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.439
 for all 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.739
 it seems that the image at the end yes that 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.070
 it comes well then let's review 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.300
 quickly where with the best of 2012 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.159
 before we go to fry 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.370
 charged I'm going to me never up 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.370
 then 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.989
 number 10 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.670
 if we had wii sports to prove their 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.939
 benefits we choose be valid from 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.799
 nintendo land for that same maybe not 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.750
 have the most pointer graphics or 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.790
 lack a dramatic story but 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.799
 its multiplayer approach and its 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.630
 smart use of the gamepad what 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.580
 become an essential for 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.480
 Brand new the console we are very 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.420
 happy with him 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.420

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.039
 number 9 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.740
 I dedicate myself since I grew up with this 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.509
 the master chief so it's not 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.390
 miss the critical and public success 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.340
 that has had and what four especially 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.289
 for his great approach to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 multiplayer and a gaming experience 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.939
 fluid and intense 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.939
 I love vale 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.240
 number 8 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.039
 in a year as apocalyptic as this is 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.100
 logical that sneaks into the list- 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.869
 darksiders 2 but of course it is also 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.060
 here on own merits as they are a 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.759
 development a plagued of action a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.190
 epic artistic design and an air to comic 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.720
 that feels great what better 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.720
 way to face the end of the world 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.680
 always on arrival let me talk number 7 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.780
 playstation vita is the other console that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.670
 his game was released this year without a doubt 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.520
 most spectacular and representative has 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.080
 been the starring nathan drake 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.520
 uncharted the abyss of gold that holds 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.730
 everything that has made the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.670
 franchise in ps3 you will see great 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.050
 adventure riddles action and a prota with 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.340
 Easiness to get into trouble 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.340
 number 6 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.879
 bigger plus beast and more varied all 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.310
 that and much more is Borderlands 2 one of 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.890
 the most anticipated games of the year and without 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.239
 doubt one of the broadest worlds and with 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.840
 more personality than we have been able 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.519
 explore in 2012 clear that is claptrap 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.200
 it also helps because there is nothing else 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.200
 Funny that a funny robot 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.269
 number 5 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.480
 Look, it has taken years to arrive but 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.300
 the result of max payne 3 has been to 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.459
 the height of the circumstances a 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.410
 atmosphere with the seal of rockstar and 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.810
 a max that no matter how much it degrades 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.060
 still max are some values 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.080
 insurance for this adventure with a whole 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.080
 Brazilian rhythm 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.820
 number 4 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.200
 how was our classic of the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.510
 annual tops mario returns to sneak in 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.310
 the list with its delivery for wii in the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.500
 that merge small thanks 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.330
 tactile for the whole family with his 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.120
 platform approach was always 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:12.660
 if it is that jumping well does not 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:15.900
 anybody entered the final straight 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.479
 number 3 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.549
 the magisterial adventure of being nothing 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.650
 come to an end and he has done it with 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.410
 style thanks to an amazing game in 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.770
 its technical section its script and its mixture 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.870
 of action role and investigation to mass 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.820
 effect 3 you have the merits 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.160
 enter the podium this year despite 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.520
 that his end would win over many of 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.520
 shout 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.800
 the moment number 2 the relay is coming 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.530
 in fact auditors could not be more 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.000
 fortunate the American revolution is 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.770
 just the backdrop for a 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.330
 Assassin's Creed Three Deepening 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.580
 more than ever in the division between 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.770
 Templars and murderers but that also 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.449
 offers a richer and different environment 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.309
 varied 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.229
 if someone tells you that you are wrong with 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:06.689
 this game remembered what George said 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.849
 Washington persevere in compliance 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.020
 of your duty and keep silence is the 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.020
 better response to slander 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.470
 leidy sanchez from I got to number 1 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.360
 there goes a dose of reality for the 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.030
 who say they always end up triumphing 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.470
 the same franchises 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.900
 bethesda has shown that he can create 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.880
 attractive and unique universes from scratch 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.760
 and also drag millions of 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.310
 grateful users until the viso is not 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.740
 an intense and intelligent experience 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.590
 that rewards the advanced player and falls in love 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.220
 the newcomer is definitely the 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.220
 game of the year 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.350
 I love 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.350
 until the next top ten '
