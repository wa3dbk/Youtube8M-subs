00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
with the new wall breaker AI as you can

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.929 
with the new wall breaker AI as you can
see<00:01:10.119> but<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:11.499> was<00:01:11.709> still<00:01:11.799> efficient<00:01:12.399> this

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
see but this was still efficient this

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.109 
see but this was still efficient this
was<00:01:13.209> so<00:01:13.389> good<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:15.130> another<00:01:15.429> air<00:01:15.789> right

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
was so good there's another air right

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.219 
was so good there's another air right
here

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
here

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.099 
here
that's<00:01:17.679> not<00:01:18.090> constructing<00:01:19.090> but<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.719> forgot

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
that's not constructing but I forgot

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.679 
that's not constructing but I forgot
completely<00:01:20.139> and<00:01:20.920> put<00:01:21.069> my<00:01:21.219> archer<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.850> put<00:01:22.509> my

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
completely and put my archer I put my

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.209 
completely and put my archer I put my
angel<00:01:23.439> well<00:01:24.399> healer<00:01:24.880> before<00:01:25.569> on<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:26.950> died

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
angel well healer before on that it died

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.419 
angel well healer before on that it died
so<00:01:27.579> my<00:01:27.880> angel<00:01:28.569> actually<00:01:28.990> died<00:01:29.289> which<00:01:30.159> was

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
so my angel actually died which was

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.059 
so my angel actually died which was
pretty<00:01:30.779> disappointing<00:01:31.779> but<00:01:32.560> now<00:01:33.009> he's<00:01:33.929> um<00:01:35.069> it

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
pretty disappointing but now he's um it

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.249 
pretty disappointing but now he's um it
would<00:01:36.219> have<00:01:36.340> been<00:01:36.520> better<00:01:36.759> if<00:01:37.020> he<00:01:38.020> would<00:01:38.139> have

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
would have been better if he would have

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.679 
would have been better if he would have
actually<00:01:38.529> survived<00:01:39.369> as<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:40.149> can<00:01:40.270> see<00:01:40.420> here<00:01:40.659> I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.090 
going to die and you'll see he'll pop
into<00:02:17.920> two<00:02:18.130> little<00:02:18.340> golems

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.610 

so<00:02:22.100> right<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.900> now<00:02:24.050> there's<00:02:24.260> like<00:02:24.410> two

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
so right now so now there's like two

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.590 
so right now so now there's like two
little<00:02:24.800> golems<00:02:25.220> as<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> can<00:02:25.580> see<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.910> they

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
little golems as you can see and they

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.540 
little golems as you can see and they
still<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:26.990> pretty<00:02:27.320> good<00:02:27.530> life<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.430> can

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
still have a pretty good life as you can

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.450 
still have a pretty good life as you can
see<00:02:28.840> because<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.230> think<00:02:30.470> maybe<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.980> units<00:02:31.310> are

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
see because I think maybe the units are

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.090 
see because I think maybe the units are
attacking<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> big<00:02:32.180> one<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:32.890> they're<00:02:33.890> still

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
attacking the big one but they're still

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.230 
attacking the big one but they're still
pretty<00:02:34.160> strong<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.910> another

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
pretty strong so this is another

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.050 
pretty strong so this is another
strategy<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.990> can<00:02:39.140> do<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.190> golems<00:02:40.760> with

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
strategy you can do that is golems with

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.780 
strategy you can do that is golems with
archers<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.960> wall<00:02:42.230> breakers<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.890> it's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
archers and wall breakers and it's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.840 
archers and wall breakers and it's
pretty<00:02:44.390> good<00:02:44.570> but<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.380> prefer<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.460> wizard

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
pretty good but I prefer the wizard

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.710 
pretty good but I prefer the wizard
because<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.840> more<00:02:48.880> more<00:02:49.880> fun<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.600> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
because it's more more fun to see the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.420 
because it's more more fun to see the
Wizards<00:02:51.190> owning<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.900> yeah<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.500> really<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.310> the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
the wall breakers but I place them in a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.840 
the wall breakers but I place them in a
bad<00:03:50.480> position<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.890> have<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.070> bit<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.430> trouble

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
bad position and I have a bit of trouble

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.120

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
with the new wall breaker ai as you can

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.150 
with the new wall breaker ai as you can
see<00:03:55.340> but<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.720> was<00:03:56.960> still<00:03:57.050> efficient<00:03:57.650> this

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
see but this was still efficient this

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.360 
see but this was still efficient this
was<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:58.640> good<00:03:59.380> there's<00:04:00.380> another<00:04:00.650> air<00:04:01.010> right

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
was so good there's another air right

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.960 
was so good there's another air right
here<00:04:01.930> that's<00:04:02.930> not<00:04:03.340> constructing<00:04:04.340> but<00:04:04.730> I

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
here that's not constructing but I

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.090

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
angel actually died which was pretty

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.460 
angel actually died which was pretty
disappointing<00:04:17.030> but<00:04:17.810> now<00:04:18.230> he's<00:04:19.120> um<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:21.320> would

disappointing but now he's um it would
have<00:04:21.560> been<00:04:21.770> better<00:04:21.980> if<00:04:22.340> he<00:04:23.240> would<00:04:23.390> have

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
have been better if he would have

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.900 
have been better if he would have
actually<00:04:23.780> survived<00:04:24.590> as<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.400> can<00:04:25.520> see<00:04:25.670> here<00:04:25.880> I

side so actually right now if you look

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.180 
side so actually right now if you look
closely<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.330> red<00:04:57.600> goal<00:04:57.840> just<00:04:58.620> take<00:04:59.040> your

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
closely to the red goal just take your

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.830 
closely to the red goal just take your
eyes<00:04:59.340> onto<00:04:59.640> him<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.090> he's<00:05:00.180> actually<00:05:00.390> going<00:05:00.750> to

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
eyes onto him and he's actually going to

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.380 
eyes onto him and he's actually going to
die<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.320> you'll<00:05:02.250> see<00:05:02.460> he'll<00:05:02.670> pop<00:05:02.910> into<00:05:03.150> two

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
die and you'll see he'll pop into two

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.290 
die and you'll see he'll pop into two
little<00:05:03.570> golems<00:05:06.320> so<00:05:07.320> right<00:05:07.620> now<00:05:08.120> so<00:05:09.120> now

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
little golems so right now so now

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.700 
little golems so right now so now
there's<00:05:09.510> like<00:05:09.630> two<00:05:09.840> little<00:05:10.020> golems<00:05:10.470> as<00:05:10.620> you

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
there's like two little golems as you

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.620 
there's like two little golems as you
can<00:05:10.830> see<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.160> they<00:05:11.820> still<00:05:12.060> have<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.240> pretty

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
can see and they still have a pretty

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.710 
can see and they still have a pretty
good<00:05:12.810> life<00:05:13.080> as<00:05:13.380> you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.770> see<00:05:14.060> because<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.480> think

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
good life as you can see because I think

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.420 
good life as you can see because I think
maybe<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.230> units<00:05:16.560> are<00:05:16.680> attacking<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.220> big

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
maybe the units are attacking the big

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.160 
maybe the units are attacking the big
one<00:05:17.610> but<00:05:18.170> they're<00:05:19.170> still<00:05:19.350> pretty<00:05:19.410> strong<00:05:21.170> so

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
one but they're still pretty strong so

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.190 
one but they're still pretty strong so
this<00:05:22.950> is<00:05:23.160> another<00:05:23.460> strategy<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:24.210> can<00:05:24.390> do<00:05:24.570> that

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
this is another strategy you can do that

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.890 
this is another strategy you can do that
is<00:05:25.440> golems<00:05:26.010> with<00:05:26.280> archers<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.180> wall<00:05:27.480> breakers

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
is golems with archers and wall breakers

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.670 
is golems with archers and wall breakers
and<00:05:28.170> it's<00:05:29.010> pretty<00:05:29.580> good<00:05:29.670> but<00:05:30.270> I<00:05:30.630> prefer<00:05:31.290> the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
and it's pretty good but I prefer the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.810 
and it's pretty good but I prefer the
wizard<00:05:32.100> because<00:05:32.700> it's<00:05:33.090> more<00:05:34.100> more<00:05:35.100> fun<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.700> see

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
wizard because it's more more fun to see

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.520 
wizard because it's more more fun to see
