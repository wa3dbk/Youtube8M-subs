 This time we will introduce the app for smartphone android terminal is here 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.529
 At first glance of that 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.099
 It is a screen of iphone 4 s 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 I'm writing kddi in Ueno style 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:40.409
 It is a screen similar to iphone 4 s coming out of au well 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 This is a funny app called fake iphone 4s 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:46.100
 It is fake as the name is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.649
 But a 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:56.520
 Like this, iphone 4 s with smartphone 3 of android terminal 2 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:02.010
 In that it can display a similar face 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:08.220
 It's illegal to make it appear to have created an iphone user 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.770
 A place to properly setting the kana I think only this of good can be 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.619
 When you tap 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.619
 It will switch to the setting screen properly and tap a message 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.050
 You can create Prost Sea Mail 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.010

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.540
 I 'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:38.740
 When you tap on youtube 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.740
 Why can't Steve Jobs' results 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.020

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.150
 Yes I 'm going 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 When you click on a book, there is a noise of visiting below . 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:01.500
 I can call you 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:04.170
 Although excellent, between functions properly even while being in the fake can be used 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.869
 It is a unique app 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:14.030
 Try to use for change 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:19.030
 I think I can do it and fake in the android market 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.540
 Please look for the iphone 4 s 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.890
