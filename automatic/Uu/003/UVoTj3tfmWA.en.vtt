it's completely seamless and smooth it's
got<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.719> very<00:00:39.050> very<00:00:39.430> intuitive<00:00:40.430> shift<00:00:41.030> chip

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
got a very very intuitive shift chip

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.049 
got a very very intuitive shift chip
system<00:00:42.410> where<00:00:42.949> you<00:00:43.160> just<00:00:43.370> rotate<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.850> hand

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
system where you just rotate the hand

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.000 
system where you just rotate the hand
grip<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:44.539> it<00:00:44.899> tells<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:45.379> if<00:00:45.500> you're<00:00:45.680> more<00:00:45.980> of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
grip and it tells you if you're more of

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.250 
grip and it tells you if you're more of
a<00:00:46.129> hill<00:00:46.309> or<00:00:46.489> less<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.789> a<00:00:46.850> hill<00:00:47.030> flats<00:00:47.750> for<00:00:48.050> going

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
a hill or less of a hill flats for going

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.860 
a hill or less of a hill flats for going
fast<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:49.039> steep<00:00:49.489> hill<00:00:49.699> for<00:00:49.940> going<00:00:50.210> for

the<00:00:52.609> system<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.300> very<00:00:53.629> easy<00:00:53.929> to<00:00:54.050> shift<00:00:54.379> under

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
the system is very easy to shift under

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.979 
the system is very easy to shift under
load<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:55.399> if<00:00:55.550> you're<00:00:55.699> actually<00:00:56.120> pedaling<00:00:56.719> up<00:00:56.840> a

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
load so if you're actually pedaling up a

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.990 
load so if you're actually pedaling up a
hill<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.440> you're<00:00:57.590> find<00:00:57.859> yourself<00:00:58.160> in<00:00:58.280> -<00:00:58.519> too

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
hill and you're find yourself in - too

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.910 
hill and you're find yourself in - too
low<00:00:59.149> of<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.359> gear<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.989> can<00:01:00.050> continue<00:01:00.559> peddling

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
low of a gear you can continue peddling

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.259 
low of a gear you can continue peddling
with<00:01:01.039> full<00:01:01.219> torque<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.699> still<00:01:01.879> shift<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
with full torque and still shift the

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.280 
with full torque and still shift the
system<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.800> system<00:01:04.010> is<00:01:04.370> maintenance<00:01:05.150> free<00:01:05.450> so

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
system the system is maintenance free so

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.990 
system the system is maintenance free so
there's<00:01:06.530> no<00:01:06.590> internal<00:01:07.280> maintenance<00:01:07.760> for<00:01:07.940> the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
there's no internal maintenance for the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.720 
there's no internal maintenance for the
hub<00:01:08.180> for<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.450> life<00:01:08.660> of<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> product<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:10.340> gives

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
hub for the life of the product it gives

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.270 
hub for the life of the product it gives
you<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.120> ability<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.570> shift<00:01:12.020> much<00:01:12.590> easier<00:01:12.980> and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
you the ability to shift much easier and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.370 
you the ability to shift much easier and
general<00:01:14.180> people<00:01:14.360> find<00:01:14.660> themselves<00:01:14.840> shifting

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
general people find themselves shifting

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.500 
general people find themselves shifting
more<00:01:15.590> often<00:01:16.040> because<00:01:16.580> it's<00:01:16.910> natural<00:01:17.390> and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
more often because it's natural and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.210 
more often because it's natural and
therefore<00:01:18.230> they're<00:01:18.380> using<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.920> e<00:01:18.950> bike

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
therefore they're using the e bike

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.340 
therefore they're using the e bike
system<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.090> better<00:01:20.270> way<00:01:20.510> increasing<00:01:21.140> range

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
system and a better way increasing range

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.380 
system and a better way increasing range
and<00:01:21.650> performance<00:01:21.770> mm-hmm<00:01:22.730> so<00:01:23.150> there's<00:01:23.330> really

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and performance mm-hmm so there's really

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.800 
and performance mm-hmm so there's really
no<00:01:23.890> indexing<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.330> gear<00:01:26.510> shift

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
no indexing in the the gear shift

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.930 
no indexing in the the gear shift
there's<00:01:27.080> no<00:01:27.260> Klunk<00:01:27.980> Klunk<00:01:28.100> Klunk<00:01:28.430> between

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
there's no Klunk Klunk Klunk between

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.910 
there's no Klunk Klunk Klunk between
gears<00:01:29.240> exactly<00:01:29.780> no<00:01:29.930> steps<00:01:30.320> there's<00:01:30.560> no<00:01:30.620> shift

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
gears exactly no steps there's no shift

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.340 
gears exactly no steps there's no shift
shop<00:01:31.280> I'm<00:01:31.610> going<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.910> call<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.210> sometimes<00:01:32.390> it's

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
shop I'm going to call it sometimes it's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.990 
shop I'm going to call it sometimes it's
seamless<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.190> in<00:01:34.400> between<00:01:34.700> gears<00:01:34.820> it's

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
seamless and in between gears it's

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.640 
seamless and in between gears it's
almost<00:01:35.240> like<00:01:35.450> volume<00:01:35.750> shifting<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:36.470> if<00:01:36.530> you

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
almost like volume shifting so if you

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.650 
almost like volume shifting so if you
can<00:01:36.800> tune<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.340> volume<00:01:37.820> on<00:01:38.000> your<00:01:38.030> on<00:01:38.480> your

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
can tune the volume on your on your

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.810 
can tune the volume on your on your
radio<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.200> shift<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:39.710> bike<00:01:39.920> okay<00:01:40.490> wow

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
radio you can shift this bike okay wow

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.350 
radio you can shift this bike okay wow
that's<00:01:41.210> great<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.730> this<00:01:44.120> particular

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
that's great and so this this particular

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.680 
that's great and so this this particular
ebike<00:01:45.110> has<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.730> motor<00:01:46.970> down<00:01:47.360> by<00:01:47.630> the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
ebike has the the motor down by the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.580 
ebike has the the motor down by the
cranks<00:01:48.290> basher<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:48.980> so<00:01:49.760> you're<00:01:50.240> actually

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
cranks basher and so you're actually

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.140 
cranks basher and so you're actually
getting<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.770> benefit<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.910> motor

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
getting the benefit of the the motor

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.650 
getting the benefit of the the motor
going<00:01:54.050> through<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.360> drivetrain<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
going through the the drivetrain of the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.440 
going through the the drivetrain of the
bicycle<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:58.160> maybe<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.970> could<00:01:59.060> explain

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
bicycle and so maybe you could explain

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.830 
bicycle and so maybe you could explain
just<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.130> benefits<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.720> know

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
just the benefits of of that you know

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.540 
just the benefits of of that you know
exactly<00:02:03.590> I'm<00:02:03.710> going<00:02:03.740> through<00:02:04.040> yeah<00:02:04.520> a

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
exactly I'm going through yeah a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.460 
exactly I'm going through yeah a
transmission<00:02:05.270> by<00:02:05.420> nature<00:02:05.810> gives<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.260> either

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
transmission by nature gives you either

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.260 
transmission by nature gives you either
torque<00:02:06.890> multiplication<00:02:07.310> or<00:02:07.850> speed

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
torque multiplication or speed

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.029 
torque multiplication or speed
multiplication<00:02:08.989> that<00:02:09.319> means<00:02:09.560> effectively

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
multiplication that means effectively

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.550 
multiplication that means effectively
for<00:02:10.250> your<00:02:10.280> legs<00:02:10.700> let's<00:02:11.030> say<00:02:11.209> you

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
for your legs let's say you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.740 
for your legs let's say you
get<00:02:11.739> up<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.160> steeper<00:02:12.790> Hill<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.300> lower<00:02:13.480> gear

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
get up a steeper Hill in a lower gear

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.410 
get up a steeper Hill in a lower gear
and<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.440> go<00:02:14.530> faster<00:02:15.069> with<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> taller<00:02:16.090> gear

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
and you can go faster with a taller gear

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.300 
and you can go faster with a taller gear
and<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:17.260> same<00:02:17.440> thing<00:02:17.650> works<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:17.920> electric

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
and the same thing works for electric

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.640 
and the same thing works for electric
motors<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.880> motor<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.840> operate<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.500> get

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
motors the motor can operate and get

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.559 
motors the motor can operate and get
better<00:02:20.890> better<00:02:21.550> torque<00:02:21.849> multiplication<00:02:22.239> to

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
better better torque multiplication to

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.170 
better better torque multiplication to
help<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.870> get<00:02:23.140> up<00:02:23.290> drills<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.730> same<00:02:24.940> time

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
help you get up drills and the same time

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.570 
help you get up drills and the same time
it<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.569> operate<00:02:25.840> at<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:26.380> higher<00:02:26.770> vehicle<00:02:27.310> speed

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
it can operate at a higher vehicle speed

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.460 
it can operate at a higher vehicle speed
and<00:02:27.849> provide<00:02:28.269> power<00:02:28.480> higher<00:02:28.840> vehicle<00:02:29.200> speeds

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
and provide power higher vehicle speeds

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.530 
and provide power higher vehicle speeds
so<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.730> benefiting<00:02:31.269> from<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
so it is benefiting from the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.449 
so it is benefiting from the
transmission<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.680> as<00:02:32.800> much<00:02:32.950> as<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.220> rider

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
transmission just as much as the rider

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.729 
transmission just as much as the rider
and<00:02:33.790> especially<00:02:34.420> promoters<00:02:35.050> they<00:02:35.260> don't<00:02:35.470> like

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
and especially promoters they don't like

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.449 
and especially promoters they don't like
abrupt<00:02:36.310> shift<00:02:36.670> abrupt<00:02:37.660> changes<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.290> speed<00:02:38.950> and

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
abrupt shift abrupt changes in speed and

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.190 
abrupt shift abrupt changes in speed and
so<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> CVT<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.630> shifted<00:02:40.959> all<00:02:41.080> the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
so with a CVT you can be shifted all the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.559 
so with a CVT you can be shifted all the
time<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.680> it's<00:02:41.800> smooth<00:02:42.130> shifting<00:02:42.700> yeah<00:02:43.090> yeah

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
time so it's smooth shifting yeah yeah

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.420 
time so it's smooth shifting yeah yeah
well<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.350> great<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.860> really<00:02:45.100> makes<00:02:45.310> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
well that's great that really makes a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.940 
well that's great that really makes a
lot<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.610> sense<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.239> know<00:02:46.360> having<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.140> that's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
lot of sense you know having that that's

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.970 
lot of sense you know having that that's
the<00:02:48.400> smoothness<00:02:48.910> for<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.660> motor<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.200> for<00:02:50.560> for

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
the smoothness for the motor and for for

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.009 
the smoothness for the motor and for for
the<00:02:51.100> rider<00:02:51.310> themselves<00:02:52.090> exactly<00:02:52.540> that's<00:02:52.930> why
