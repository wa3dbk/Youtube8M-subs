hi I'd like to share with you today -

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.089 
hi I'd like to share with you today -
del<00:00:04.680> Studio<00:00:05.390> 1535<00:00:07.790> the<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.179> left<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:10.099> a

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
del Studio 1535 the one on the left is a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.299 
del Studio 1535 the one on the left is a
little<00:00:11.550> older<00:00:12.090> than<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.480> one<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> right

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
little older than the one on the right

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.250 
little older than the one on the right
but<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.150> Left<00:00:15.330> does<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.780> faster

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
but the one on the Left does have faster

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.609 
but the one on the Left does have faster
processor<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.220> t90<00:00:17.940> 300<00:00:18.600> as<00:00:19.260> opposed<00:00:19.529> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
processor as the t90 300 as opposed to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.939 
processor as the t90 300 as opposed to
the<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> right<00:00:20.279> has<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.859> 8800<00:00:22.859> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the one on the right has the 8800 I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.740 
the one on the right has the 8800 I
think<00:00:24.680> but<00:00:25.970> one<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> main<00:00:27.510> differences

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
think but one of the main differences

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.460 
think but one of the main differences
between<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.410> two<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.660> with<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.140> older

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
between the two is that with the older

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.260 
between the two is that with the older
one<00:00:32.090> has<00:00:33.090> like<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> graphite<00:00:34.520> type<00:00:35.520> palm<00:00:35.940> rest

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
one has like a graphite type palm rest

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:46.010 
one has like a graphite type palm rest
and<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:39.200> touchpad<00:00:40.820> has<00:00:42.829> like<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.480> print<00:00:45.480> on

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and the touchpad has like the print on

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.650 
and the touchpad has like the print on
it<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.649> says<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.670> way<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> scroll<00:00:48.360> lines

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it that says the way the scroll lines

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
it that says the way the scroll lines
are<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:51.079> with<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.410> newer<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.489> does<00:00:53.699> not

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
are and with the newer one it does not

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
are and with the newer one it does not
have<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> nor<00:00:54.870> does<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> graphite

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
have that nor does it have the graphite

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.319 
have that nor does it have the graphite

of<00:01:00.420> strange<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
of strange because the one with the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.359 
of strange because the one with the
graphite<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> nice<00:01:03.500> also<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> older<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
graphite is nice also on the older one I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.570 
graphite is nice also on the older one I
do<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> extended<00:01:07.080> battery<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.430> can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
do have the extended battery as you can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.580 
do have the extended battery as you can
see<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.689> does<00:01:10.580> lift<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.119> bit

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
see here it does lift it up a little bit

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
see here it does lift it up a little bit
as<00:01:13.590> opposed<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.310> flat<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
as opposed to this one it is flat on the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.590 
as opposed to this one it is flat on the
ground<00:01:18.420> pretty<00:01:18.750> much<00:01:18.930> there's<00:01:19.350> no<00:01:19.590> room<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
ground pretty much there's no room for a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.270 
ground pretty much there's no room for a
very<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.930> room<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.259> air<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> flow<00:01:22.950> under

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
very little room for air to flow under

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.890 
very little room for air to flow under
it<00:01:23.720> here<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> big<00:01:25.799> difference

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
it here you can see a big difference

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
it here you can see a big difference
there<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.130> amount<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
there you can see that this amount of

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
there you can see that this amount of
space<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.270> opposed<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> here<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.110> pretty

space as opposed to here this pretty

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.420 
space as opposed to here this pretty
much<00:01:31.890> no<00:01:32.130> space<00:01:32.750> um<00:01:34.159> but<00:01:35.270> I've<00:01:36.270> noticed<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
much no space um but I've noticed that

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.069 
much no space um but I've noticed that
as<00:01:38.430> far<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:38.880> boot<00:01:39.180> times<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:41.090> older<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.299> there

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
as far as boot times the older one there

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.090 
as far as boot times the older one there

there's<00:03:18.350> not<00:03:18.470> much<00:03:18.709> difference<00:03:18.950> both<00:03:19.580> have

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
there's not much difference both have

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.500 
there's not much difference both have
the<00:03:19.970> high<00:03:20.090> resolution<00:03:20.750> screens<00:03:22.270> for<00:03:23.270> some

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
the high resolution screens for some

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.940 
the high resolution screens for some
reason<00:03:23.930> on<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:25.090> older<00:03:26.090> computer<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:27.290> has<00:03:28.750> this

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
reason on the older computer it has this

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.910 
reason on the older computer it has this
screen<00:03:30.950> brightness<00:03:31.750> when<00:03:32.750> on<00:03:32.930> high<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.620> lot

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
screen brightness when on high is a lot

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.080 
screen brightness when on high is a lot
brighter<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.739> crisper<00:03:36.739> than<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.440> new<00:03:39.440> one

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
brighter and crisper than the new one

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.380 
brighter and crisper than the new one
which<00:03:41.090> seems<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.540> little<00:03:41.600> strange<00:03:42.070> but<00:03:43.390> other

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
which seems a little strange but other

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.260 
which seems a little strange but other
than<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.660> both<00:03:45.530> computers<00:03:46.270> function

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
than that both computers function

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.840 
than that both computers function
extremely<00:03:47.900> well

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
extremely well

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.220 
extremely well
the<00:03:49.850> older<00:03:50.060> one<00:03:50.180> does<00:03:50.540> have<00:03:50.720> blu-ray<00:03:51.170> as

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the older one does have blu-ray as

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 
the older one does have blu-ray as
opposed<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.800> new<00:03:51.920> one<00:03:52.070> we<00:03:52.640> did<00:03:52.850> not<00:03:53.000> get<00:03:53.360> a

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
opposed to the new one we did not get a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.140 
opposed to the new one we did not get a
blu-ray<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.640> let<00:03:55.640> me<00:03:55.670> turn<00:03:55.880> these<00:03:56.090> around

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
blu-ray on it let me turn these around

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.580 
blu-ray on it let me turn these around
so<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.080> can<00:03:57.290> see<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:58.750> size<00:03:59.750> of<00:04:00.170> the

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
so that you can see the size of the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.090 
so that you can see the size of the
battery<00:04:01.450> difference<00:04:02.450> because<00:04:02.860> one<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.920> the

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
battery difference because one of the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.229 
battery difference because one of the
main<00:04:05.350> things<00:04:06.350> when<00:04:07.180> ordering<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.540> computer<00:04:08.989> I

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
main things when ordering the computer I

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.650 
main things when ordering the computer I
was<00:04:11.239> not<00:04:11.390> sure<00:04:11.630> exactly<00:04:12.470> how<00:04:13.070> big<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:14.269> battery

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
was not sure exactly how big the battery

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.319 
was not sure exactly how big the battery
is<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.019> extended<00:04:15.739> battery<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:17.030> was<00:04:17.150> very

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
is the extended battery and it was very

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:17.849 
is the extended battery and it was very
hard<00:04:17.570> to

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
hard to

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.479 
hard to
information<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.699> but<00:04:19.000> here<00:04:19.599> you<00:04:19.750> can<00:04:19.930> see

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
information on it but here you can see

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.059 
information on it but here you can see
this<00:04:21.489> has<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.419> extended<00:04:22.960> battery<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.680> this

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 
this has the extended battery and this

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:28.760 
this has the extended battery and this
has<00:04:24.479> just<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.840> regular<00:04:26.289> battery<00:04:27.389> smart<00:04:28.389> side

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
has just the regular battery smart side

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.230 
has just the regular battery smart side
science<00:04:29.770> difference<00:04:30.189> let<00:04:30.400> me<00:04:30.490> put<00:04:31.090> them

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
science difference let me put them

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.779 
science difference let me put them
together<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:33.580> can<00:04:33.759> just<00:04:33.969> see<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.150> comparison

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
together you can just see a comparison

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.080 
together you can just see a comparison
there<00:04:36.789> there<00:04:38.129> that's<00:04:39.129> the<00:04:39.400> size<00:04:39.610> difference

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
there there that's the size difference

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.559 
there there that's the size difference
in<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.539> battery<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:43.000> right<00:04:43.150> one<00:04:43.360> has

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
in the battery the right one has

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.040 
in the battery the right one has
standard<00:04:44.229> and<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.650> left<00:04:44.830> has<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:46.050> extended

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
standard and the left has the extended

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.830 
standard and the left has the extended
but<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.919> can<00:04:48.129> swap<00:04:48.460> them<00:04:48.669> you<00:04:49.419> know<00:04:49.539> if<00:04:49.750> you

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
but you can swap them you know if you

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.350 
but you can swap them you know if you
don't<00:04:49.990> buy<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.199> extended<00:04:50.529> battery<00:04:50.860> for<00:04:51.400> the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
don't buy the extended battery for the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.350 
don't buy the extended battery for the
laptop<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:52.779> can<00:04:53.110> buy<00:04:53.379> it<00:04:53.439> and<00:04:53.740> put<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.520> on<00:04:54.580> one

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
laptop you can buy it and put it on one

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.939 
laptop you can buy it and put it on one
that<00:04:55.509> you<00:04:55.629> bought<00:04:55.779> the<00:04:55.960> standard<00:04:56.319> battery<00:04:56.710> for

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
that you bought the standard battery for

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.010 
that you bought the standard battery for
I<00:04:57.250> wasn't<00:04:57.909> sure<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.509> because<00:04:58.870> the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
I wasn't sure of that because the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.129 
I wasn't sure of that because the
battery<00:04:59.349> looks<00:04:59.529> a<00:04:59.650> lot<00:04:59.770> different<00:04:59.800> but<00:05:01.139> it

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
battery looks a lot different but it

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.939 
battery looks a lot different but it
just<00:05:02.379> has<00:05:02.590> here<00:05:03.039> an<00:05:03.330> extra<00:05:04.330> piece<00:05:04.659> as<00:05:05.560> opposed

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
just has here an extra piece as opposed

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.459 
just has here an extra piece as opposed
to<00:05:06.039> here<00:05:06.279> there's<00:05:06.460> nothing<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.909> battery<00:05:07.210> just

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
to here there's nothing the battery just

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:12.209 
to here there's nothing the battery just
stops<00:05:08.469> here<00:05:09.069> here<00:05:10.060> goes<00:05:10.449> from<00:05:11.169> here<00:05:11.469> to<00:05:11.860> here

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
stops here here goes from here to here

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:17.040 
stops here here goes from here to here
and<00:05:12.400> then<00:05:12.729> that<00:05:13.270> extended<00:05:13.840> piece<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.960> other

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
and then that extended piece but other

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.709 
and then that extended piece but other
than<00:05:17.139> that<00:05:17.319> the<00:05:17.409> computers<00:05:17.860> are<00:05:18.009> both

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
than that the computers are both

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.760 
than that the computers are both
extremely<00:05:19.719> great<00:05:20.789> got<00:05:21.789> them<00:05:21.969> both<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:22.330> black

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
extremely great got them both in black

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.100 
extremely great got them both in black
the<00:05:23.770> black<00:05:24.039> shows<00:05:24.659> fingerprints<00:05:25.659> all<00:05:25.779> over<00:05:25.810> it

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
the black shows fingerprints all over it

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.800 
the black shows fingerprints all over it
though<00:05:26.349> which<00:05:27.129> is<00:05:27.159> a<00:05:27.339> downside<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:30.610> I<00:05:30.849> like

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
though which is a downside but I like

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.010 
though which is a downside but I like
the<00:05:31.960> computer<00:05:32.379> I<00:05:32.409> upgraded<00:05:33.009> from<00:05:33.479> an<00:05:34.479> older

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
the computer I upgraded from an older

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.129 
the computer I upgraded from an older
Inspiron<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:37.000> haven't<00:05:37.509> had<00:05:37.599> any<00:05:37.750> problems

Inspiron and haven't had any problems

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.589 
Inspiron and haven't had any problems
yet<00:05:39.629> both<00:05:40.629> have<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.229> backlit<00:05:41.650> keyboard<00:05:41.919> which

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
yet both have the backlit keyboard which

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:49.950 
yet both have the backlit keyboard which
is<00:05:43.599> really<00:05:44.199> nice<00:05:44.460> in<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.610> dark<00:05:48.960> especially

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
is really nice in the dark especially

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.179 
is really nice in the dark especially
when<00:05:50.349> you<00:05:51.159> have<00:05:51.339> no<00:05:51.550> lights<00:05:52.589> otherwise<00:05:53.589> with

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
my older computer which did not have the

my older computer which did not have the
backlit<00:05:56.379> keyboard<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:58.270> had<00:05:58.449> to<00:05:58.629> tilt<00:05:58.870> the

backlit keyboard you had to tilt the

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.399 
backlit keyboard you had to tilt the
screen<00:05:59.349> down<00:05:59.560> in<00:06:00.339> order<00:06:01.060> to<00:06:01.270> take<00:06:01.750> a<00:06:01.900> look<00:06:02.110> at

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
screen down in order to take a look at

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:07.369 
screen down in order to take a look at
the<00:06:03.400> keys<00:06:03.639> that<00:06:04.620> you<00:06:05.620> are<00:06:05.740> trying<00:06:06.069> to<00:06:06.250> touch

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
the keys that you are trying to touch

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.659 
the keys that you are trying to touch

just get an idea of what the keyboard

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.469 
just get an idea of what the keyboard
looks<00:06:13.960> like<00:06:15.180> here's<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.509> backlit<00:06:17.500> keyboard

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
there we go so yeah the keyboard

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.960 
there we go so yeah the keyboard
keyboards<00:06:36.240> are<00:06:36.390> great<00:06:36.710> the<00:06:37.710> backlit<00:06:38.160> when<00:06:38.880> you

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
keyboards are great the backlit when you

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.090 
keyboards are great the backlit when you
see<00:06:39.150> it<00:06:39.210> from<00:06:39.330> an<00:06:39.480> angle<00:06:39.780> like<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.740> light

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
see it from an angle like the light

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.400 
see it from an angle like the light
comes<00:06:41.460> out<00:06:41.610> a<00:06:41.640> little<00:06:41.880> bit<00:06:42.120> you<00:06:43.080> can<00:06:43.200> see<00:06:43.260> that

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
comes out a little bit you can see that

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.200 
comes out a little bit you can see that
it's<00:06:43.680> bright<00:06:43.920> but<00:06:44.250> it<00:06:44.850> doesn't<00:06:45.120> affect

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
it's bright but it doesn't affect

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:52.910 
it's bright but it doesn't affect
anything<00:06:50.600> well<00:06:51.600> other<00:06:51.810> than<00:06:52.020> that<00:06:52.170> there's

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
anything well other than that there's

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.440 
anything well other than that there's
pretty<00:06:53.220> much<00:06:53.340> no<00:06:53.670> difference<00:06:54.030> between<00:06:54.330> them

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
pretty much no difference between them

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.300 
pretty much no difference between them
although<00:06:55.050> on<00:06:55.380> the<00:06:55.470> newer<00:06:55.650> one<00:06:55.920> the<00:06:56.130> two

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
although on the newer one the two

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.010 
although on the newer one the two
megapixel<00:06:56.880> camera<00:06:57.240> seems<00:06:57.510> to<00:06:57.690> be<00:06:57.810> a<00:06:57.840> little

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
megapixel camera seems to be a little

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.510 
megapixel camera seems to be a little
bit<00:06:58.290> clearer<00:06:58.740> than<00:06:59.250> the<00:06:59.760> older<00:07:00.090> one<00:07:00.270> but

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
bit clearer than the older one but

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.960 
bit clearer than the older one but
they're<00:07:02.520> both<00:07:02.760> great<00:07:03.030> computers<00:07:03.540> and<00:07:04.130> I<00:07:05.130> hope

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
they're both great computers and I hope

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.080 
they're both great computers and I hope

the<00:07:19.260> size<00:07:19.500> difference<00:07:20.010> was<00:07:20.330> but<00:07:21.330> having<00:07:21.600> the

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
the size difference was but having the

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.530 
the size difference was but having the
extended<00:07:21.870> battery<00:07:22.200> is<00:07:22.530> great<00:07:22.770> I<00:07:22.800> get<00:07:23.120> about<00:07:24.120> I

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
extended battery is great I get about I

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.170 
extended battery is great I get about I
don't<00:07:25.230> know<00:07:25.380> how<00:07:25.500> much<00:07:25.680> extra<00:07:26.120> probably<00:07:27.120> an

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
don't know how much extra probably an

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.120 
don't know how much extra probably an
extra<00:07:27.450> hour<00:07:27.710> depending<00:07:28.710> on<00:07:28.800> what<00:07:28.980> you're

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
extra hour depending on what you're

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.600 
extra hour depending on what you're
doing

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
doing

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.020 
doing
but<00:07:30.150> it<00:07:30.750> also<00:07:30.870> raises<00:07:31.230> up<00:07:31.650> the<00:07:31.680> laptop<00:07:32.580> so<00:07:32.850> that

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.030 
but it also raises up the laptop so that

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.330 
but it also raises up the laptop so that
it<00:07:33.960> creates<00:07:34.290> like<00:07:34.710> a<00:07:34.740> palm<00:07:35.100> rest<00:07:35.990> and<00:07:37.340> having

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
it creates like a palm rest and having

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.020 
it creates like a palm rest and having
that<00:07:38.460> extra<00:07:38.790> height<00:07:38.940> makes<00:07:39.240> a<00:07:39.330> difference<00:07:39.800> but

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.030 
that extra height makes a difference but

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.250 
that extra height makes a difference but
