but<00:02:35.330> these<00:02:35.480> aren't<00:02:35.900> leaking<00:02:36.590> at<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.800> seams

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
but these aren't leaking at the seams

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.670 
but these aren't leaking at the seams
which<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.520> good<00:02:37.730> sign<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.450> can<00:02:39.440> see<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
which is a good sign you can see the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.130 
which is a good sign you can see the
smoke<00:02:39.920> plumes<00:02:40.580> out<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.180> chimney<00:02:41.390> it's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
smoke plumes out the chimney it's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.830 
smoke plumes out the chimney it's
lightweight<00:02:42.470> compact<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.330> like<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.510> said<00:02:44.570> it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
lightweight compact and like I said it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.270 
lightweight compact and like I said it
goes<00:02:44.960> all<00:02:45.260> into<00:02:45.560> my<00:02:45.800> cook<00:02:46.130> kit<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:47.540> problem<00:02:47.960> is

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
goes all into my cook kit the problem is

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.420 
goes all into my cook kit the problem is
the<00:02:49.280> front<00:02:49.610> here<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:51.350> ventilations<00:02:52.070> fine<00:02:52.400> I

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the front here the ventilations fine I

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.190 
the front here the ventilations fine I
haven't<00:02:52.910> got<00:02:53.000> my<00:02:53.120> gloves<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.480> can't<00:02:53.780> turn

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
haven't got my gloves so I can't turn

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.940 
haven't got my gloves so I can't turn
the<00:02:54.500> unit<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.490> it's<00:02:55.610> on<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> rotation<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.860> you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
the unit but it's on a rotation so you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.610 
the unit but it's on a rotation so you
just<00:02:58.100> twist<00:02:58.490> it<00:02:58.640> round<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.300> it<00:03:00.020> will<00:03:00.170> seal<00:03:00.440> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
just twist it round and it will seal it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.040 
just twist it round and it will seal it
off<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.700> these<00:03:01.880> small<00:03:02.060> vents<00:03:02.720> at<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.930> bottom

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
off but these small vents at the bottom

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.560 
off but these small vents at the bottom
allow<00:03:03.830> enough<00:03:04.190> air<00:03:04.430> into<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.500> stove<00:03:07.570> to

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
allow enough air into the stove to

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.460 
allow enough air into the stove to
maintain<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.890> flame<00:03:13.900> but<00:03:14.900> again<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.410> think

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
maintain the flame but again I think

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.860 
maintain the flame but again I think
I've<00:03:16.040> cut<00:03:16.310> these<00:03:16.459> slightly<00:03:17.120> too<00:03:17.300> small<00:03:17.660> so

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
I've cut these slightly too small so

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.890 
I've cut these slightly too small so
long<00:03:18.020> enough<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.560> compromise<00:03:19.780> slightly<00:03:20.780> on

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
long enough to compromise slightly on

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.960 
long enough to compromise slightly on
the<00:03:21.080> micro<00:03:21.560> size<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> bloody<00:03:22.459> thing<00:03:22.730> I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
the micro size of the bloody thing I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.390 
the micro size of the bloody thing I
mean<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:23.330> can<00:03:23.600> see<00:03:24.040> my<00:03:25.040> hand<00:03:25.250> down<00:03:25.489> there<00:03:25.790> boy

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
mean you can see my hand down there boy

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
mean you can see my hand down there boy
bloody<00:03:28.400> hot<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:29.630> tiny<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.820> know<00:03:31.820> that<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.150> could

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
bloody hot it's tiny I know that I could

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.010 
bloody hot it's tiny I know that I could
attach<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.959> door<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.530> front<00:03:33.890> on<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.400> hinge

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
attach the door to the front on a hinge

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.610 
attach the door to the front on a hinge
but<00:03:36.020> then<00:03:36.260> it's<00:03:36.850> extending<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.239> width<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.780> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
but then it's extending the width of the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.820 
but then it's extending the width of the
cylinder<00:03:40.630> because<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.780> aim<00:03:41.930> behind<00:03:42.260> all<00:03:42.620> of

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
cylinder because the aim behind all of

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.390 
cylinder because the aim behind all of
my<00:03:42.980> cooking<00:03:43.690> side<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.840> things<00:03:45.050> is<00:03:45.350> it's<00:03:46.160> like

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
my cooking side of things is it's like

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.729 
my cooking side of things is it's like
Russian<00:03:46.820> dolls<00:03:47.030> they<00:03:47.390> all<00:03:47.570> slot<00:03:48.050> inside<00:03:48.560> of

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
Russian dolls they all slot inside of

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.660 
Russian dolls they all slot inside of
each<00:03:48.860> other<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.550> I'm<00:03:50.090> trying<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.600> eliminate

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
each other and I'm trying to eliminate

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.530 
each other and I'm trying to eliminate
light<00:03:52.670> for<00:03:53.060> example<00:03:53.510> with<00:03:53.660> my<00:03:53.690> cup<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:56.239> soot

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
light for example with my cup the soot

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.240 
light for example with my cup the soot
buildup<00:03:57.020> so<00:03:57.470> like<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:57.830> cup<00:03:59.170> the<00:04:00.170> soup<00:04:00.680> isn't

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
buildup so like this cup the soup isn't

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.699 
buildup so like this cup the soup isn't
going<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.940> contaminate<00:04:02.420> say<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.440> would

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
going to contaminate say this is would

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.500 
going to contaminate say this is would
be<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:04.100> cooking<00:04:04.489> pot<00:04:04.750> which<00:04:05.750> slots<00:04:06.140> inside

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
be the cooking pot which slots inside

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
be the cooking pot which slots inside

across<00:04:56.479> is<00:04:57.159> somebody<00:04:58.159> using<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.610> fire<00:04:58.879> blanket

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
across is somebody using a fire blanket

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.950 
across is somebody using a fire blanket
so<00:05:00.620> maybe<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.949> can<00:05:01.039> construct<00:05:02.000> a<00:05:02.300> fire<00:05:02.779> blanket

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
so maybe I can construct a fire blanket

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.619 
so maybe I can construct a fire blanket
side<00:05:03.500> of<00:05:03.620> things<00:05:03.800> with<00:05:04.129> it<00:05:04.689> instead<00:05:06.159> but<00:05:07.159> yeah

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
side of things with it instead but yeah

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:13.409 
side of things with it instead but yeah
it's<00:05:08.629> good<00:05:08.719> to<00:05:08.870> have<00:05:09.020> these<00:05:09.199> little<00:05:09.439> projects

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.279 

I'm<00:05:14.419> just<00:05:14.719> waiting<00:05:15.020> for<00:05:15.050> my<00:05:15.229> brew<00:05:17.020> so<00:05:18.020> I'm<00:05:18.139> able

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
I'm just waiting for my brew so I'm able

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.219 
I'm just waiting for my brew so I'm able
to<00:05:18.529> have<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.710> quick<00:05:19.129> cuppa<00:05:19.550> for<00:05:20.210> our<00:05:20.300> head<00:05:20.479> off

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.640 

again<00:05:24.229> I<00:05:24.259> didn't<00:05:24.620> explain<00:05:24.919> about<00:05:25.310> these

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
again I didn't explain about these

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.290 
again I didn't explain about these
screws<00:05:27.650> down<00:05:27.889> here<00:05:28.159> they're<00:05:28.400> clamped<00:05:28.699> into<00:05:29.000> it

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
screws down here they're clamped into it

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.510 
screws down here they're clamped into it
so<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:29.839> can<00:05:30.050> grab<00:05:30.349> those<00:05:30.650> obviously<00:05:31.339> with<00:05:31.490> a

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
so I can grab those obviously with a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.800 
so I can grab those obviously with a
pair<00:05:31.729> of<00:05:31.759> gloves<00:05:32.029> and<00:05:32.210> twist<00:05:32.539> it<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:32.990> would<00:05:33.680> like
