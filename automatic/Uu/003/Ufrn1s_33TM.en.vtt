people<00:00:08.780> don't<00:00:09.289> know<00:00:09.950> enough<00:00:10.280> about<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:10.820> when

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
people don't know enough about this when

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.150 
people don't know enough about this when
they<00:00:11.510> want<00:00:11.750> to<00:00:11.869> draw<00:00:12.049> a<00:00:12.080> tin<00:00:12.410> can

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
they want to draw a tin can

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.710 
they want to draw a tin can
they<00:00:13.879> draw<00:00:14.150> something<00:00:14.690> like<00:00:14.719> this<00:00:16.599> that<00:00:17.599> would

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
they draw something like this that would

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.429 
they draw something like this that would
be<00:00:17.930> me<00:00:18.759> now<00:00:19.759> I<00:00:20.029> want<00:00:20.360> to<00:00:20.390> tell<00:00:20.630> you<00:00:20.779> whatever

be me now I want to tell you whatever

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.000 
be me now I want to tell you whatever
they<00:00:22.099> this<00:00:22.490> is<00:00:22.550> called<00:00:23.230> area<00:00:24.230> remember<00:00:24.830> these

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
they this is called area remember these

they this is called area remember these
names<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.060> height<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:26.689> width<00:00:27.109> relationship

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
names the height and width relationship

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.229 
names the height and width relationship
once<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.480> establish<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.259> in<00:00:31.070> your<00:00:31.699> head<00:00:31.939> I

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
once you establish that in your head I

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.020 
once you establish that in your head I
usually<00:00:32.870> draw<00:00:33.080> a<00:00:33.110> center<00:00:33.470> line<00:00:33.650> first<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.580> I

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
usually draw a center line first so I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.780 
usually draw a center line first so I
can<00:00:35.390> keep<00:00:35.629> it<00:00:35.900> symmetric<00:00:36.890> about<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.400> center

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
can keep it symmetric about the center

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.030 
can keep it symmetric about the center
line<00:00:38.030> you<00:00:38.420> know<00:00:38.900> one<00:00:39.049> of<00:00:39.080> me<00:00:39.260> without<00:00:39.769> this

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
line you know one of me without this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.990 
line you know one of me without this
line<00:00:40.339> I'm<00:00:40.580> not<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.850> make<00:00:41.030> this<00:00:41.239> too<00:00:41.510> shallow

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
line I'm not to make this too shallow

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.390 
line I'm not to make this too shallow
suddenly<00:00:44.000> gives<00:00:44.239> me<00:00:44.360> a<00:00:44.420> sense<00:00:44.659> of<00:00:44.839> balance

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
suddenly gives me a sense of balance

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.660 
suddenly gives me a sense of balance
then<00:00:46.400> I<00:00:46.640> know<00:00:46.989> that<00:00:47.989> all<00:00:48.409> tin<00:00:48.920> cans<00:00:49.339> are

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
then I know that all tin cans are

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.710 
then I know that all tin cans are
ellipses<00:00:50.330> or<00:00:51.400> are<00:00:52.400> not<00:00:52.640> pointed<00:00:53.269> at<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.570> end

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
ellipses or are not pointed at the end

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.079 
ellipses or are not pointed at the end
like<00:00:54.049> people<00:00:54.500> don't<00:00:54.650> like<00:00:55.040> that<00:00:55.309> they're

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
like people don't like that they're

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.670 
like people don't like that they're
wrong<00:00:56.979> how<00:00:57.979> round<00:00:58.420> half<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.659> whatever<00:00:59.900> this<00:01:00.320> is

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
wrong how round half of whatever this is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.609 
wrong how round half of whatever this is
so<00:01:01.610> if<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:01.790> draw<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.030> circle<00:01:02.600> here<00:01:02.629> that's

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
so if you draw a circle here that's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.170 
so if you draw a circle here that's
called<00:01:03.890> around

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.740 

that's<00:01:08.180> not<00:01:08.330> around

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
that's not around

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.190 
that's not around
yes<00:01:08.990> no<00:01:09.259> once<00:01:10.189> I<00:01:10.490> get<00:01:10.789> that<00:01:11.000> I<00:01:11.329> go<00:01:11.960> straight

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
yes no once I get that I go straight

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.190 
yes no once I get that I go straight
down<00:01:12.500> but<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:12.920> what<00:01:13.070> ten<00:01:13.369> can<00:01:13.869> kind<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:15.020> can

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
down but it's what ten can kind of can

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.830 
down but it's what ten can kind of can
you<00:01:15.350> get<00:01:15.590> beads<00:01:15.829> there's<00:01:16.369> nothing<00:01:16.840> straight

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
you get beads there's nothing straight

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.919 
you get beads there's nothing straight
down<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.469> take<00:01:18.710> your<00:01:18.890> time<00:01:19.130> use<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> rule<00:01:19.929> but

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
down you take your time use a rule but

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.770 
down you take your time use a rule but
the<00:01:21.109> bottom<00:01:21.530> circle<00:01:21.859> is<00:01:22.579> are<00:01:22.700> all<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.210> same

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
the bottom circle is are all the same

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.679 
the bottom circle is are all the same
width<00:01:24.170> that's<00:01:24.499> the<00:01:24.649> top<00:01:24.890> one<00:01:25.189> but<00:01:25.789> it's<00:01:25.999> deeper

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
width that's the top one but it's deeper

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.440 
width that's the top one but it's deeper
the<00:01:27.499> reason<00:01:27.979> is<00:01:28.189> because<00:01:28.759> you're<00:01:29.149> higher

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
the reason is because you're higher

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.249 
the reason is because you're higher
above<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:31.070> know<00:01:31.189> it's<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.579> same<00:01:32.060> width<00:01:32.479> but

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
above it you know it's a same width but

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.889 
above it you know it's a same width but
it's<00:01:33.560> different<00:01:33.920> than<00:01:34.280> height<00:01:34.780> meaning<00:01:35.780> if

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
it's different than height meaning if

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.200 
it's different than height meaning if
it's<00:01:36.079> a<00:01:36.170> glass<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:37.280> will<00:01:37.460> have<00:01:37.609> more<00:01:37.819> bulge

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
it's a glass this will have more bulge

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.450 
it's a glass this will have more bulge
here<00:01:38.600> have<00:01:39.140> more<00:01:39.829> than<00:01:40.039> this<00:01:40.189> does

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
here have more than this does

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.860 
here have more than this does
because<00:01:41.119> you're<00:01:41.270> higher<00:01:41.509> a<00:01:41.689> button<00:01:42.140> go<00:01:42.319> of<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
because you're higher a button go of the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.950 
because you're higher a button go of the
but<00:01:44.470> into<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.920> camera<00:01:45.460> at<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.240> level<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
but into the camera at the level of the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.530 
but into the camera at the level of the
glass<00:01:47.230> and<00:01:47.460> photographic<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.940> top<00:01:49.180> will<00:01:49.390> come

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
glass and photographic the top will come

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.630 
glass and photographic the top will come
out<00:01:49.690> straight<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.620> you'll<00:01:51.010> see<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.430> lips

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
out straight and you'll see in the lips

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.330 
out straight and you'll see in the lips
on<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.970> bar<00:01:52.180> if<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.170> cameras<00:01:53.620> at<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:54.010> height

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
on the bar if the cameras at that height

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.630 
on the bar if the cameras at that height
you<00:01:54.790> know<00:01:55.480> what<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.660> mean<00:01:55.810> then<00:01:56.230> you<00:01:56.890> can't<00:01:57.250> see

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
you know what I mean then you can't see

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.420 
you know what I mean then you can't see
a<00:01:58.000> dish<00:01:58.720> they<00:01:58.990> must<00:01:59.200> hold<00:01:59.650> up<00:01:59.950> your<00:02:00.130> eye<00:02:00.190> it's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
a dish they must hold up your eye it's

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.420 
a dish they must hold up your eye it's
straight<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.690> if<00:02:02.230> you<00:02:02.440> put<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.770> camera<00:02:03.190> above

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
straight so if you put the camera above

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.900 
straight so if you put the camera above
you<00:02:04.150> have<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.540> show<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.590> degree<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.370> lips

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
you have to show the degree of the lips

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.640 
you have to show the degree of the lips
the<00:02:07.540> higher<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.170> camera<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.670> more<00:02:10.650> the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the higher the camera is the more the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.790 
the higher the camera is the more the
wider<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.400> ellipse<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.080> if<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.170> right<00:02:14.440> up<00:02:14.620> on

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
wider the ellipse and if you right up on

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.910 
wider the ellipse and if you right up on
top<00:02:15.100> it's<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.700> true<00:02:15.940> circle<00:02:16.620> does<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.740> make

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
top it's a true circle does that make

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.270 
top it's a true circle does that make
sense

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280

going to draw coffee cam fast here and
round<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.090> edges<00:02:25.240> make<00:02:25.990> sure<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.590> round

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
round out the edges make sure you round

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.699 
round out the edges make sure you round
out<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.370> edges<00:02:27.790> how<00:02:28.330> route<00:02:28.690> whatever<00:02:29.470> this

witness am then you draw to power long

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.820 
witness am then you draw to power long
lines<00:02:33.640> if<00:02:34.090> you're<00:02:34.690> drawing<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.620> of

that's<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.209> tin<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.750> see<00:03:19.250> now<00:03:20.250> if<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.640> want<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:22.069> do

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
that's a tin can see now if I want to do

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.559 
that's a tin can see now if I want to do
something<00:03:23.370> new<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.060> can<00:03:24.439> I'm<00:03:25.439> gonna<00:03:26.569> make

I'll go down a short distance to the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.449 
I'll go down a short distance to the
depth<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.239> what<00:04:15.389> you<00:04:15.510> take<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.750> frying<00:04:16.139> pan<00:04:16.459> then

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
depth of what you take a frying pan then

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.969 
depth of what you take a frying pan then
you<00:04:17.609> tilt<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.239> edges<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.810> fine<00:04:19.169> ten<00:04:19.500> is

you tilt the edges to the fine ten is

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.730 
you tilt the edges to the fine ten is
not<00:04:20.280> straight<00:04:20.699> like<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.030> tin<00:04:21.329> can

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:21.740 
not straight like a tin can

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.029 
not straight like a tin can
the<00:04:22.740> edge<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.419> like<00:04:24.419> more<00:04:24.660> like<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:25.169> do

the edge of it like more like that do

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.310 
the edge of it like more like that do
you<00:04:26.099> understand<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.870> then<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:27.900> draw

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
you understand that then you draw

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.909 
you understand that then you draw
whatever<00:04:29.099> this<00:04:29.580> circle<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.300> here<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.919> little

whatever this circle is here a little
stronger<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.830> carry<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.370> inside<00:04:36.260> like

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
stronger and you carry it inside like

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.219 
stronger and you carry it inside like
you<00:04:37.410> could<00:04:37.590> see<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.039> they<00:04:38.970> see<00:04:39.630> what<00:04:39.780> I'm<00:04:39.900> doing

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229

something that where these two meet the
cone<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.050> shader<00:04:55.800> an<00:04:56.190> angle<00:04:56.699> now<00:04:56.970> it's

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
cone and you shader an angle now it's

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.570 
cone and you shader an angle now it's
straight<00:04:58.080> up<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.440> down<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.830> Canda<00:04:59.280> straight

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
straight up and down to Canda straight

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.180 
straight up and down to Canda straight
if<00:05:00.060> it's<00:05:00.240> an<00:05:00.330> angular<00:05:00.930> your<00:05:01.590> shading<00:05:02.099> is

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
if it's an angular your shading is

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.000 
if it's an angular your shading is
angular<00:05:02.789> but<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.330> starts<00:05:03.780> changing<00:05:04.139> its<00:05:04.590> angle

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
angular but it starts changing its angle

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.010 
angular but it starts changing its angle
because<00:05:05.550> you're<00:05:05.849> always<00:05:06.060> keeping<00:05:06.419> it<00:05:06.810> and

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
because you're always keeping it and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.100 
because you're always keeping it and
wine<00:05:07.380> with<00:05:07.949> that<00:05:07.979> dot<00:05:08.430> tell<00:05:09.419> you<00:05:09.599> when<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:09.930> get

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
wine with that dot tell you when you get

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.870 
wine with that dot tell you when you get
about<00:05:10.409> halfway<00:05:11.280> through<00:05:12.979> know<00:05:13.979> a<00:05:14.010> little<00:05:14.610> more

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
about halfway through know a little more

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.909 
about halfway through know a little more
than<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.389> do<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:15.960> ease<00:05:16.260> up<00:05:16.289> on<00:05:16.770> your

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
than that do you ease up on your

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.490 
than that do you ease up on your
pressure<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:17.970> it's<00:05:18.180> only<00:05:18.389> dark<00:05:18.870> in<00:05:19.080> this<00:05:19.229> area

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
pressure so it's only dark in this area

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.550 
pressure so it's only dark in this area
now<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.070> make<00:05:20.490> this<00:05:20.760> dark<00:05:21.210> in<00:05:21.840> this<00:05:22.080> area

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
now you make this dark in this area

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.600 
now you make this dark in this area
because<00:05:23.220> it's<00:05:23.610> right<00:05:23.849> here

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
because it's right here

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.610 
because it's right here
and<00:05:26.610> then<00:05:26.880> you're<00:05:27.480> heavy<00:05:27.750> up<00:05:27.990> this<00:05:28.290> wine

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
and then you're heavy up this wine

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.850 
and then you're heavy up this wine
because<00:05:29.340> it's<00:05:29.520> in<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.820> foreground<00:05:30.740> can<00:05:31.740> you

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
because it's in the foreground can you

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.360 
because it's in the foreground can you
put<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.100> hammer<00:05:32.900> that's<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.050> frying<00:05:34.380> pan<00:05:34.500> for<00:05:35.010> you

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
put a hammer that's a frying pan for you

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.450 
put a hammer that's a frying pan for you
do<00:05:35.730> you<00:05:35.820> understand<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.390> angle<00:05:36.930> do<00:05:37.740> you<00:05:37.920> yeah

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
do you understand that angle do you yeah

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.380 
do you understand that angle do you yeah
now<00:05:38.910> let's<00:05:39.180> draw<00:05:39.450> boys<00:05:40.610> if<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:41.790> draw<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.030> voice

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
now let's draw boys if you draw a voice

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.200 
now let's draw boys if you draw a voice
like<00:05:42.840> this<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.320> two<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.620> one<00:05:43.860> ellipse<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.580> a

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
like this you two a one ellipse and a

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.370 
like this you two a one ellipse and a
center<00:05:45.630> line<00:05:46.970> then<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.300> shape<00:05:48.600> it<00:05:48.840> on<00:05:49.110> one

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
center line then you shape it on one

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.020 
center line then you shape it on one
half<00:05:49.940> there's<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:51.150> safeguard<00:05:51.720> for<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:53.370> center

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
half there's a safeguard for that center

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.710 
half there's a safeguard for that center
line<00:05:54.060> helps<00:05:54.990> you<00:05:55.230> maintain<00:05:56.420> uniformity<00:05:57.420> on

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
line helps you maintain uniformity on

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.820 
line helps you maintain uniformity on
both<00:05:58.260> sides<00:05:58.650> if<00:05:59.160> you<00:05:59.400> take<00:05:59.640> your<00:05:59.820> time<00:06:00.590> now<00:06:01.590> how

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
both sides if you take your time now how

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.150 
both sides if you take your time now how
do<00:06:01.890> you<00:06:02.010> say<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.670> you<00:06:03.170> split<00:06:04.170> this<00:06:04.530> distance

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
do you say that you split this distance

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.200 
do you say that you split this distance
with<00:06:05.910> a<00:06:05.940> line<00:06:06.980> whatever<00:06:07.980> this<00:06:08.490> distance<00:06:08.730> is

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
with a line whatever this distance is

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.290 
with a line whatever this distance is
you<00:06:09.390> split<00:06:09.900> it<00:06:10.610> meaning<00:06:11.610> whatever<00:06:11.820> this

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
you split it meaning whatever this

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.900 
you split it meaning whatever this
distance<00:06:12.870> is<00:06:13.320> so<00:06:13.920> I'm<00:06:14.070> going<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.280> split<00:06:14.580> this

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
distance is so I'm going to split this

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.060 
distance is so I'm going to split this
and<00:06:15.240> I'm<00:06:15.690> traveling<00:06:15.960> in<00:06:16.320> the<00:06:16.440> middle<00:06:16.740> of<00:06:16.919> the

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
and I'm traveling in the middle of the

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.060 
and I'm traveling in the middle of the
middle<00:06:17.370> of<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.640> two<00:06:17.850> lines<00:06:18.180> I'm<00:06:19.140> gonna<00:06:19.830> make

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
middle of the two lines I'm gonna make

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.409 
middle of the two lines I'm gonna make
it<00:06:20.220> an<00:06:20.370> open<00:06:20.880> jar<00:06:21.210> so<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:22.260> is<00:06:23.000> you<00:06:24.000> can<00:06:24.060> see

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
it an open jar so this is you can see

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.500 
it an open jar so this is you can see
both<00:06:24.630> ends<00:06:24.960> or<00:06:25.200> cameras<00:06:25.620> above<00:06:25.950> it<00:06:26.270> then<00:06:27.270> I'm

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
both ends or cameras above it then I'm

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.690 
both ends or cameras above it then I'm
going<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.840> do<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:28.770> middle<00:06:28.980> of<00:06:29.250> this<00:06:29.430> middle

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
going to do the middle of this middle

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.630 
going to do the middle of this middle
yeah<00:06:31.100> and<00:06:32.150> the<00:06:33.150> middle<00:06:33.419> of<00:06:33.540> that<00:06:33.690> middle<00:06:34.640> try

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
yeah and the middle of that middle try

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.780 
yeah and the middle of that middle try
to<00:06:35.700> keep<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.150> in<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.419> middle<00:06:36.450> so<00:06:37.350> this<00:06:37.790> shading

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
to keep it in the middle so this shading

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.330 
to keep it in the middle so this shading
now<00:06:38.970> to<00:06:39.510> no<00:06:39.690> longer<00:06:39.930> be<00:06:40.320> like<00:06:40.590> the<00:06:40.770> tin<00:06:41.010> can

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
now to no longer be like the tin can

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.460 
now to no longer be like the tin can

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
which is up and down this is the dark

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.350 
which is up and down this is the dark
area<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.700> first<00:06:45.030> splits<00:06:45.419> in<00:06:45.960> and<00:06:46.410> then<00:06:47.360> this

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
area the first splits in and then this

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.140 
area the first splits in and then this
then<00:06:48.630> here<00:06:48.960> might<00:06:49.200> be<00:06:49.229> a<00:06:49.440> half<00:06:49.740> tone<00:06:50.150> little

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
then here might be a half tone little

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.240 
then here might be a half tone little
less<00:06:51.330> than<00:06:51.600> that<00:06:51.870> and<00:06:52.229> there's<00:06:52.590> a<00:06:52.740> little<00:06:52.919> less

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
less than that and there's a little less

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.190 
less than that and there's a little less
than<00:06:53.490> that<00:06:53.669> nothing<00:06:54.150> you<00:06:54.419> make<00:06:54.630> a<00:06:54.660> thing<00:06:54.960> look

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
than that nothing you make a thing look

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.820 
than that nothing you make a thing look
shaded<00:06:56.130> round<00:06:56.810> was<00:06:57.810> that<00:06:57.960> too<00:06:58.169> fast

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
shaded round was that too fast

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.680 
shaded round was that too fast
no<00:06:59.760> every<00:07:00.479> question<00:07:00.750> right<00:07:01.080> up<00:07:01.110> to<00:07:01.380> that<00:07:02.479> okay

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
no every question right up to that okay

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.180 
no every question right up to that okay
now<00:07:04.140> the<00:07:04.200> inside<00:07:05.300> this<00:07:06.300> would<00:07:06.570> be<00:07:06.780> shaded<00:07:07.190> here

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
now the inside this would be shaded here

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.940 
now the inside this would be shaded here
but<00:07:08.430> the<00:07:08.970> black<00:07:09.330> area<00:07:09.780> be<00:07:09.990> larger<00:07:10.560> at<00:07:10.770> the

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
but the black area be larger at the

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.730 
but the black area be larger at the
maximum<00:07:11.700> bulge<00:07:12.050> you<00:07:13.050> know<00:07:13.200> what<00:07:13.320> I<00:07:13.380> mean<00:07:13.560> but

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
maximum bulge you know what I mean but

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.650
