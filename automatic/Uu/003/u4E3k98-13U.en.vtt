00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 in the heart of the village of Batignolles 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.299
 today it is the effervescence in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 this art gallery or to him the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.740
 opening of an exhibition not like

 the others that of louis and marceau who 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.910
 present us their car of the future 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.530
 I did not imagine at all that they had 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.050
 could make a drawing old perfection 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.100
 but before discovering the work of our 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.809
 budding designers 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.820
 little back one week 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.739
 to build the car of their dreams 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.720
 louis and marceau went to ask for 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.400
 help to gary sanchez designers 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.850
 professionals and true specialist 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.870
 in car design parked in the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.370
 small creative studio 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.030
 you have an idea a little bit for 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.940
 your car of your dreams makes you a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.460
 little drawing and after we leave ok 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.759
 well right now i'm expecting 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.509
 especially a lot of imagination 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.670
 with pretty new ideas is enough 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.159
 quite liberated from the technical constraints 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.749
 today that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.990
 which are taxed in the world of 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:28.439
 the automobile industry, to which the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.420
 motor she screams she could be 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.479
 hyper tonic and she can also go 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 in the water still ideas me I 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:51.560
 did not want me anymore either we start 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:59.090
 by the last we can add no to 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.090
 hot like that in melee 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.080
 so children did you do you 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.420
 have drawn the car of your dreams 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.070
 it's a rocket car a bit badly a 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.540
 car subject boat because that's it 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.790
 have the wrinkle in words quite light 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.939
 the gay party button and ben ali whose it's 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.939
 a really dynamic car this one 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.439
 is going super fast to be able to go far and 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:38.939
 in the sky and in the water in fact one 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:41.159
 can go anywhere with even agreement 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.299
 in the Bahamas then this one we go the 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.700
 to put 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.159
 like that he will serve us as a model 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.420
 what's all your concept it's great on 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.989
 will try to give it a shape 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.099
 even more what goes fast what ok like 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.599
 a flame like a rocket 3160 so he 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.650
 must really be super 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.480
 aerodynamic 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.430
 when the car and ride it has to be that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.810
 the students are tidied up so he goes 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.930
 have to find where we can get them 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.420
 tidy up she'll roll it's like that 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.500
 okay so here's going to have to have a system 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.239
 to get the wings in so when 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.420
 there are too many bottles age ball and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.760
 she walks like that can go to 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.079
 over the traffic jams good bah 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.519
 that's fine then we'll try to 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:32.129
 to draw the moors under here then 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.989
 will do the little cockpit here so that's 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.310
 where there will be to our gentleman 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.949
 little guys so he's going to drive 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.139
 with a helmet to go to 3600 km 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:44.639
 hour exactly then during this time 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.510
 in your head you will think about 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.940
 name of the car 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.519
 you have time and then a little bit to his 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.930
 color and all that then number 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.930
 of children t ah bah yes 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.770
 we had not played in the name of 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.350
 car 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.330
 it's called the caravan of agreement and 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.640
 why you chose the word la roja 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.640
 abbas that want it to be accounts 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.620
 back to the gallery gary sanchez le 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.720
 designer has reworked the drawings of 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.969
 louis and marceau taking good care of 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.379
 respect their ideas and by following the 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.379
 letter their recommendation 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.390
 seduce I tried to be or more 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.070
 faithful anyway from their concept of 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.200
 base it was the car that was 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.600
 transformable who had a fuselage 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.250
 really airplane before automobiles 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.620
 were dream automobiles and 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.790
 that was it today about 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.590
 I was pretty proud of what he did 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.840
 it is especially that I was super happy 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.190
 that he has passed but who today 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.100
 it is exceptional that he counted seven 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.420
 years and 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.700
 and we make you live a day on 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.980
 request to draw a car it's a 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.440
 super project what the progression between 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.840
 the initial project very free very 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.190
 drawn up to the prototype 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.710
 like the impression of seeing in the 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.230
 pad at home renault ago 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.660
 a real link from a little child's drawing 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:43.030
 we can make something of his 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:46.420
 breasts not have made out he found 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.580
 with quebec and more 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.860
 that it evolves but I would like 3 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.170
 that she exists like this if she is in 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.310
 james bond and bah it will make a new 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.310
 car you want
