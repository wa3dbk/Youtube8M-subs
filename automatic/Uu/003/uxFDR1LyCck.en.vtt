00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
over your opponent's well that's what I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.670 
over your opponent's well that's what I
think<00:02:56.370> at<00:02:56.459> least<00:02:56.580> I've<00:02:57.390> already<00:02:57.660> already<00:02:58.350> seen

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
think at least I've already already seen

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.570 
think at least I've already already seen
guys<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.220> use<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.200> cloak<00:03:01.200> ability<00:03:01.739> while

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
guys that use the cloak ability while

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.449 
guys that use the cloak ability while
packing<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.690> silenced<00:03:04.350> shotgun<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.040> end

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
packing a silenced shotgun and the end

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.009 
packing a silenced shotgun and the end
of<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> most<00:03:05.910> valuable<00:03:06.300> player<00:03:06.480> with<00:03:06.989> the

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
of the most valuable player with the

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.949 
of the most valuable player with the
highest<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.620> left<00:03:07.860> ratio<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.820> think<00:03:09.720> about

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
highest to left ratio and I think about

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.250 
highest to left ratio and I think about
doing<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.220> same<00:03:11.459> because<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.510> seems<00:03:13.170> like

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
doing the same because it seems like

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.680 
doing the same because it seems like
really<00:03:13.680> good<00:03:13.830> tactic<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.190> don't<00:03:17.190> know

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
really good tactic and but I don't know

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.350 
really good tactic and but I don't know
okay<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.900> end<00:03:19.680> up<00:03:19.860> most<00:03:20.340> valuable<00:03:20.940> player<00:03:21.180> as

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
okay I end up most valuable player as

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.240 
okay I end up most valuable player as
well<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.810> game<00:03:22.049> but<00:03:22.260> more<00:03:22.830> because<00:03:22.950> i'm

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
well in this game but more because i'm

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.490 
well in this game but more because i'm
using<00:03:23.280> brute<00:03:23.850> force<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.570> i'm<00:03:24.720> able<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.260> flank

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
using brute force and i'm able to flank

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.770 
using brute force and i'm able to flank
the<00:03:25.830> enemy<00:03:25.860> most<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:26.970> time<00:03:27.120> while<00:03:27.360> using

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the enemy most of the time while using

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.680 
the enemy most of the time while using
maximum<00:03:28.320> armor<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.090> don't<00:03:30.090> think<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.420> used

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
maximum armor I don't think that I used

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.810 
maximum armor I don't think that I used
the<00:03:31.320> cloaking<00:03:31.739> ability<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.370> game<00:03:32.580> I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
the cloaking ability in this game I

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.870 
the cloaking ability in this game I
promise<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.750> will<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.440> da<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.890> one<00:03:35.850> of

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
which I kind of regrets as this game is

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.860 
which I kind of regrets as this game is
a<00:03:51.690> lot<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.170> fun

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
campaign though but even that is really

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.839 
campaign though but even that is really
good<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:58.599> it's<00:03:59.200> good<00:03:59.470> i'm<00:03:59.860> not<00:04:00.159> going<00:04:00.370> really

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
was made to work on consoles as well the

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.520 
was made to work on consoles as well the
part<00:05:13.120> where<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.450> beauty<00:05:13.720> of<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.960> game<00:05:14.110> is<00:05:14.349> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
part where the beauty of the game is the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.940 
part where the beauty of the game is the
most<00:05:14.800> striking<00:05:15.190> isn't<00:05:16.289> multiplayer<00:05:17.289> it's

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
most striking isn't multiplayer it's

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.650 
most striking isn't multiplayer it's
probably<00:05:18.340> one<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.729> the<00:05:19.090> best<00:05:19.360> looking

and<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:26.620> forth<00:05:26.740> because<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.880> there's<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.300> lot

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
and so forth because that there's a lot

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.200
