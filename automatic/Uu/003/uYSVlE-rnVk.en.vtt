anyway over time but one of the benefits

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
anyway over time but one of the benefits
of<00:01:40.590> doing<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> provide<00:01:41.490> provides<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
of doing this is it provide provides a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.530 
of doing this is it provide provides a
little<00:01:42.680> protectant<00:01:43.680> layer<00:01:43.710> underneath<00:01:44.540> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
little protectant layer underneath it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569 
little protectant layer underneath it
kind<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.470> puts<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.829> good<00:01:47.040> rust<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.430> your

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
kind of it puts a good rust on your

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.280 
kind of it puts a good rust on your
knife<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.450> prevents<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.110> getting

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
knife and it prevents it from getting

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.859 
knife and it prevents it from getting
bad<00:01:49.560> rust<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.090> still<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.479> bad<00:01:51.630> rust

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
bad rust now you can still get bad rust

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.420 
bad rust now you can still get bad rust
on<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.140> knife<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.799> seems<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.130> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
on your knife but it just seems like it

and I checked it out a couple hours
later<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.640> certain<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.000> develop<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
later and it was certain to develop a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
later and it was certain to develop a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
steel life guys see away from carbon

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.270 
steel life guys see away from carbon
steel<00:02:50.660> but<00:02:51.320> there's<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> lot<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.770> benefits<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
steel but there's a lot of benefits to

steel but there's a lot of benefits to
carbon<00:02:52.700> steel<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.110> very<00:02:54.620> easy<00:02:54.860> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
carbon steel like it's very easy to

sharpen and it seems like it takes an
edge<00:02:56.660> very<00:02:56.990> well

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
edge very well

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.670

paper here let's see if this affected

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.970 
paper here let's see if this affected
our<00:03:11.990> cutting<00:03:12.230> edge<00:03:12.350> at<00:03:12.470> all<00:03:14.890> still<00:03:15.890> very<00:03:16.130> sharp

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
our cutting edge at all still very sharp

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.820 
our cutting edge at all still very sharp
and<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:21.110> know<00:03:21.200> one<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.500> good<00:03:21.620> things

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
and you know one of the good things

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.949 
and you know one of the good things
about<00:03:21.890> carbon<00:03:22.370> steel<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:23.060> even<00:03:23.630> if<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.810> does

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
about carbon steel is it even if it does

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.570 
about carbon steel is it even if it does
dull<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.380> very<00:03:24.560> easy<00:03:24.740> to<00:03:24.890> sharpen<00:03:25.100> so<00:03:25.400> not<00:03:25.550> a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
dull it's very easy to sharpen so not a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.730 
dull it's very easy to sharpen so not a
big<00:03:25.790> deal<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.810> affected<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.320> edge<00:03:27.440> at<00:03:27.650> all

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
big deal if it affected the edge at all

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.720 
big deal if it affected the edge at all
I<00:03:27.770> don't<00:03:27.950> really<00:03:28.280> notice<00:03:28.430> any<00:03:28.730> difference<00:03:29.260> but

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
I don't really notice any difference but
