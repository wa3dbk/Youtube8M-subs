00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.450
 game is not to grind is a game worth 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.480

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.600
 this rather photos 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.320
 the first one would be called gold and 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.810
 I would call going for the gold earns more than one 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.540
 million g in total 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.510

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.590
 little play win 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.700
 to start 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 the next rise in the ladder of 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.309
 silver is promoted rank 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.940
 I'm the same is to play and win so that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.440
 you can level up how to know 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.010
 for example when you are playing a 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.950
 starting will put rise of rank you will put and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.080
 you raise tubes and raise others in the photo and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.360
 This is easy has to play in 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.840
 Match to Player or Ranked in Mode 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.970
 arcade serves us next 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.800
 silver perfectionist you have won a 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.570
 combat without taking damage doing a 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.310
 perfect, I recommend you do it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.890
 in the arcade it's easy is against the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.490
 machine 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.900
 next never give up money to the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.070
 won a fight when you're 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.760
 practically ko 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.690
 this can be done for example 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.729
 when I'm playing against something a 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.810
 package that is bad that you see that a 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.290
 this one could make you a dog 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.670
 perfectly then you leave that a mate 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.340
 a little bit and when you see that the bar 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.310
 health is blinking you are about to 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.100

 I do not understand those things either but 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.000
 in a match is to play against one and in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.719
 but not against player if you do not choose if 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.470
 one does not want to be passed on to the other but 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:31.160
