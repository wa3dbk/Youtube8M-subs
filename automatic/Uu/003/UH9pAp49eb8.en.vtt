00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello how good I am going to show what 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.640
 they are two controls 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.530
 Kate 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.640
 art that the psc as a baker who buys 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.380
 with a provider by means of 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.949
 free market 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.919
 in this case he had compared 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:28.060
 first a control which I 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:31.720
 they sent but unfortunately not 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.210
 the lever was with a lot of play 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.670
 was stuck it stayed like that or logos and 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.590
 the coin stayed that way and it felt very 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.680
 very very loose then what what 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.290
 happened is that I committed him the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.019
 guarantee to this provider this problem 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.699
 he told me human I do not know the board 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.750
 this one they received him and then I 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.699
 to take a second this to 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.800
 seize the shipment what I did is that 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.980
 I acquired a second board 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.890
 well here I have two boards in this 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.640
 case this board came to me completely 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 sealed this board back is what I'm going 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.860
 to put in this moment of this board 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.970
 if you realize, I will try to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.990
 focus a bit more I will try to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.370
 focus here if you are going to listen 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.640
 the noise I will press 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.300
 is to listen to the character's blow I'm going to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.300
 turn up the volume a little 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.280
 of this board I do not have no complaints 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.080
 in fact the board is working not 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.290
 it's working it's working 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.290
 correctly 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.560
 but unfortunately I got the 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.509
 inconvenient 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.790
 that they already sent me I do not know which of the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.460
 twelve tie the board that I buy if it's the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.579
 that came with the box closed or was 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.590
 the one that this one came in this case with the 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.660
 open box but it came more protected 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.700
 I imagine that this was the board that 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.260
 they changed my warranty here what I'm going 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.760
 to check or what I'm going to do this I'm going to 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.680
 disconnect the cable 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.180
 so they realize and in return 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.310
 asking for command 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.510
 what I'm going to do is I'm going to connect 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.510
 here if you will notice 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.800
 I'm going to connect 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.310
 the usb cable 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.290
 and she 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.520
 is already returning will be enabled but if 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.520
 I have the inconvenience 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.380
 that only one button that is 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.570
 listening sites are going to listen to what 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.320
 is the sound of the blow I will raise a 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.320
 little bit more the volume 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 in no button 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.209
 is working 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.680
 Well, I'm going to see what the provider says 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.970
 because the truth is a true 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.160
 disappointment that you do not check the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.080
 things that send the truth if it is 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.920
 very very annoying and good to see what 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.920
 solution is given to me
