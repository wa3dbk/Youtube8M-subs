00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.180
 hello everyone I'm doing a little 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.489
 video for a friend to show him that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.400
 sending plus the bi elements it can be 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.260
 Just huge 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.839
 so 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:54.510
 First the staff not much I 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:56.680
 sacrier to shut up because must balance 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.839
 do not know much you just have to 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 thirty minutes with three items slope 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:09.000
 it gives damage by all so you 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.000
 answer the vampiric breastplate for 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.690
 it can take me very expensive so a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.550
 some time to enjoy 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.700
 we epaulets 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.760
 i took paulette body swear and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 hendaye I took the dax thanks to 5337 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.590
 uncle and erp like that got balanced 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 each searches 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.150
 maka 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.450
 the four frames then have one stage you 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.170
 show she does not seem to be huge 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.210
 at the stats level but trust me and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.640
 that now with the update is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.620
 from us just huge 320% omhtr and 321 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.340
 for a red tribute knowing that I 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:02.190
 the bonuses knowing that bonuses 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.820
 I started a pea to be fooled and 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.880
 peace m 35 pm anyway and the TV the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.500
 force to balance why not say 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.950
 because since I am 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.750
 hair and r when I play ground I you 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.430
 do a little colonnades and when I'm 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.250
 do we can make a bloodthirsty fury 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.790
 and 300 percent the hub of spells have 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.940
 been made and neck 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.240
 how there is more too how to wash 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.700
 before the elemental mastery of the blow 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.790
 can ride it like that and we'll have as much 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.980
 damage on a Master so I 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.920
 100 takes a new meaning to finish 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.440
 910 that nat aimless level and 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.420
 snowshoes 1910 the fact that I do not have 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.650
 climbed the 30 level schedules for the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.620
 resistance it's my choice I find a 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.380
 little need to do that in the climbs 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.400
 relief even though it's helpful to have 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.420
 30% more so we will look after a 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.220
 fight and I find you right after 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.709
 then I have three fights so I 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.660
 I'll show you this 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.250
 show this to show you that while being 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.110
 given that we are bi elements we can 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.650
 allow to watch resistances 80 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.910
 ter are seven fires him in voltaire vol 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.910
 have all well and I'm doing colonnades 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:41.049
 here you have situations of the game to 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:44.510
 peck the sound of the game that's it 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.950
 like that to the amount though they are 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.950
 well placed good bah I colonel 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.680
 we also saw ourselves with a sacred even if 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.720
 was three hundred 300 or even 322% 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.980
 the brit air tribute we are made later 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.610
 every time we hit each other and we can 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.770
 look at me I'm with 348 6 349 so I 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.770
 fell 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.770
 here 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240
 at 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.850
 play a lot ground i know you know 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.650
 What I will do a fight warm 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.310
 underground what earth and the fight 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.310
 up to the light 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:37.360
 fell I could do for the side 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.240
 you see 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.180
 what are you going out are not are 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.710
 not mounted I take these prices the most 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.020
 important 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:56.520
 so I mounted the most tires 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.919
 used here where I took expensive bossa 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.229
 nova fauna and chained chained is this 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.309
 a bit too much 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.659
 at worst we find ourselves after 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.680
 so I have three fights that was just 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:16.110
 not even 5 meters away 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.110
 so we will play fire the party 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.370
 and then we eat should play earth 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.539
 to go faster and I will play 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.539
 that fire as today 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.860
 now I do not make any costs 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.470
 here's one 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.419
 here you have seen that 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:46.069
 we can be bi elements and hoarse it is 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:48.289
 just as much I know that some 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:50.509
 will find that it's not much 320 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:54.729
 people at the master 321 yet in my 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:59.469
 hair but since I'm a 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:01.729
 I think it's good 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:07.119
 imagine yop to whom his stats wanted him 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:11.119
 add 40% more he has 300 360 and 361 

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:16.309
 frankly I think it 's growing 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:20.779
 and it's nickel actually it's nickel by 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:22.309
 against since the maj is a little 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:26.149
 difficult to spend the four hundred to 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:28.430
 cent but some people really get there 

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:31.729
 a lot of giant I have beautiful looking all 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.699
 time a year every year every 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.069
 meaning it matter how I -gc not 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:38.559
 assignable and the 400 named hair and r 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:44.089
 I did not succeed 

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:47.900
 I did not succeed so let's see that 

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:52.289
 full fire I had 442 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:54.300
 348 3 162% dumas hair I said to myself 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:58.169
 leaving to lose 40% I put myself in balls 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:04.139
 elements so she see well I galley 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:05.939
 it's not easy so here I hope that 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:08.870
 this video will please you and I tell you 

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:11.849
 next time it was me 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.330
 it was in any case a one and I you 

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.020
 see you soon 

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.020
