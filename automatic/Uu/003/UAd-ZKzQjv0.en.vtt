00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.000
 hi friends 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.210
 today we will see how to drive a vehicle 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.960
 automatic the first thing we will learn 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.670
 our role shifter 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.580
 unlike a vehicle with 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.350
 mechanical transmission in this car only 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.050
 we have to select the march that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.340
 we want and press the accelerator to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.509
 split 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.820
 we will start lighting the vehicle 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.610
 For this we will verify that the lever 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.420
 of changes is in pÃ© and we give 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.420
 departure to the engine 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.590
 the letter p of parking is used to 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.260
 immobilize the vehicle once 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.890
 parked and must be selected with the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.300
 brake pedal pressed we will start the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.880
 march removing the brake 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.070
 parking we select the march 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.880
 and we accelerate 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.589
 the lyrics of this live and is used 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.930
 so that the vehicle selects the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.780
 marches automatically according to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.790
 loading conditions in this case only 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.000
 we worry about pressing the pedal 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.690
 of the accelerator more or less to increase 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.380
 or slow down 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.180
 the function of marks 1 2 and 3 serve 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.490
 to indicate to the vehicle that we want 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.030
 maintain the strength that each one gives us 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.970
 of them 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.640
 in this case the car will not perform 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.130
 the changes 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.100
 now we will see a demonstration for 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.830
 climb only in first gear for 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.390
 we brake before the rise we put 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.790
 march number 1 and accelerate is not 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.979
 necessary final before the slope to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.890
 put the first gear but if our 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.590
 speed is high pass directly from 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.229
 this march will increase the revolutions and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.509
 we could damage the engine to avoid 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.570
 this we can introduce a higher gear 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.690
 as 3a 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.760
 and finally we will see the function of the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.530
 letter R 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.160
 just like in cars with changes 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.570
 manuals the letter r of reverse serves 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.090
 to perform maneuvers 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.209
 parking or that require moving 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.980
 back to select this march 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.390
 we step on the brake pedal and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.190
 we selected the letter r as we could 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.660
 see in this video the driving of a 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.640
 automatic vehicle is much more 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.260
 simple and comfortable than a mechanical car 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120
 I hope you liked this video 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.989
 I invite you to subscribe and comment 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.989
 until the next
