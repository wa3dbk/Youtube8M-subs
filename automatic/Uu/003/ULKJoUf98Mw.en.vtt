00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.090
 so for those who do not know how to do it I'll show you how 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.610
 can make a screenshot 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.219
 to keep evidence 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.230
 of something for example in my case it will serve me back for a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 complaint 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.560
 so for example this morning under this post I discovered a message 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.460
 that you can see here so it's mark I say it here 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.739
 and I'm going to do I'm going to kill you from the snare game you're a son of a bitch 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.359
 et cetera and so on 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.869
 sherbrooke press the key a premium 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 my keyboard screen 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.420
 I then went to my documents 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 I will go to my pictures 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
 it's choosing a random image 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.300
 I will make a click with my mouse and I will do 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.480
 my record but let's imagine now that I tried to bring a picture that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.360
 is called new images 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.670
 that I play or your laughs so to open it exactly where you need to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.890
 make 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.740
 worker with 4 and that choose microsoft office then leave their 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.610
 manager 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 I will go to edit the images 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.250
 I will help him deny it 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.740
 see those little things that are on the sides and well I'm going to pull them 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.960
 to keep 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.650
 that what interests me 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.660
 to know 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.150
 so the message of the person in question 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.680
 member here it is here 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 the rest but we do not care 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.450
 I then do 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.479
 and that's all I have left is a screenshot of this famous 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.060
 message 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.480
 I am going to register m 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.980
 and that icing on the cake if I still want to click by king 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.530
 I will do 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.210
 will open 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.409
 waiting a lot here and then I downloaded a little free software 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.719
 whose name is 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.719
 m actors 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.949
 I find the net antenna message I will choose 10 6% 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.919
 same color show red for example 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.709
 I will choose this little 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.819
 the machined him would have said a little 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.449
 which can also allow me to put in view 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.369
 holding the golden balloon the message 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.599
 this is then 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.389
 I do 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.379
 recorded 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.280
 and now so I have my screenshot see it take 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.040
 a few seconds so it's up to you to play
