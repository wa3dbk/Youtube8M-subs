00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.420
 so it's all often a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.400
 new little video and this time 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.219
 so it's safe for people to flank so 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 I will show you a village of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.500
 gvt and level 5 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 I believe that of my brother so you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.340
 go see this movie to say after this is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.340
 because by his c he has won everything 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.460
 defended himself no I'll see you I 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.029
 will show you 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.029
 so here's the game is charging 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 that should be good not yet 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 So that's why 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.289
 that's my village 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 so I 'm answering this question 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.180
 it's because the moc and the mortar 20 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.000
 news you already see that they overlapping 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.360
 a big a big area group and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.969
 covers almost the entire village 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.210
 then the wizard's trick protects the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.610
 mortar is said that as soon as they arrive 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.760
 to enter and she kills all units 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.680
 we will then say the wizard's tricks 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.310
 are low are placed fairly 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.720
 judicious what it covers a good 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 part of the whole there is not too much 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 of spacing hide it's just the tail is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.689
 the dough 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.710
 no building or being 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.430
 almost all of them the same she 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.420
 short she enjoy a maximum of 16 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 billion we will say and just the acquis 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:41.759
 what a blow for nothing and this one so 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.360
 this one it protects the tv or there it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:51.020
 v protects is a little bit in 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.270
 reservoirs of elixir so otherwise sic 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.590
 if someone attacks with them by 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.840
 example of the balloons of the servants 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.119
 pagan deities what the defense 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.850
 anti-aircraft will cover the 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:12.319
 dbm nettles and some for darche and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:15.019
 etienne then have the ramparts 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.160
 are still high enough for his game 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:23.299
 his level I personally find so 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.390
 I will soon show you 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 some attacks so excuse me 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.780
 I zapped to show the level of both 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.709
 elephants 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.209
 so he has a wizarding level one tour 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.870
 amortized level 3 a kind of arch 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.519
 level 5 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.400
 a finished tour also once at this 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.750
 level 5 1 channel level 6 a cannon 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.690
 number 5 is a place of calm at the level 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:55.280
 I was showing you defenses or 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:59.329
 there then look already can see there is 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.940
 many victories but anne and me 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:06.170
 that it's pretty much every nipple has 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.040
 not idle shot three or for example 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.690
 we will take I am a good attack 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.690
 I am found a beautiful attack he has 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.130
 resisted attacked countries all could that 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.190
 the creat one percent and here after he 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.190
 left 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.349
 so I 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.080
 I showed you see yesterday this one yeah 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.600
 so you'll see the attak so already 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.400
 had icg i'm going to show you why 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.800
 it's the flaws of this attack so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.080
 already they use all these giants and there 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.680
 had a whore 1,100 euros 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.130
 excuse me I zapped the world sent 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.710
 rare spell that blew some 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.180
 days and watch a wizard's tower 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.330
 view that halfway and I at the same time 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.870
 time does a lot of damage and the 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.460
 mortar has already removed on average the 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.280
 less than half is half of the 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.920
 hit points of the barbarians so 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.620
 watch foodstuffs with the level of 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.870
 ramparts the legion remains stuck and the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.300
 wizards turn ignites the against 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.550
 look at it there is hot and the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.850
 reprieve trick that takes it from him 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.250
 above 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:40.210
 look at the Bavarians remain they have 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:43.480
 not resisted and the porter by his 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.850
 far reaching is going to be able to all 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.360
 three years 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.760
 but there was he had a lot of 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.590
 barbarians and with the mortar he has everything ay 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:02.260
 by watching play 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:06.460
 I let you see so yeah I 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.980
 shows you if you show the second 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.400
 video that I hesitated in montreuil where I 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:17.710
 am going to do to please is too much 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.850
 nice so you'll see the attacked 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.850
 with a lightning night 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.300
 so like like another attack but 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.470
 finally not because he was there I 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.620
 believe he has not said everything all these 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:39.360
 giant of a sudden he puts three giants of 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.280
 three giants on that side and two 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.300
 giants made then it's a technique 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.430
 simple it but it's gyan for for 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.830
 to place breaks bricks like that is that at 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.169
 this true that finally imitate the units 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.400
 to shoot defense unit concentrates 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.080
 on the giants and so on the cases the 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.110
 brick so the frames they can 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.830
 quietly break their walls but 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.590
 look at her she was sort of 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.380
 lightning so that 's fine I do not see too much 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.600
 interest we used a lot of 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.289
 barbarians look at the mortar ball 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.729
 here already half of life points 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.720
 request 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.729
 then you have more than one 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.340
 little bit of life to a lot of 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:25.169
 barbarians ben skull 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:26.669
 here and there there is carnage so I do 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.650
 then he tries to place archers 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:33.889
 on around to also make the 50% 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.889
 end I think but he's not going to succeed at 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.349
 we stick to this little arch and so 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.700
 so here is the opinion of already finished 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:46.560
 so I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:48.860
 do not hesitate to like commented here is a 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.860
 lease
