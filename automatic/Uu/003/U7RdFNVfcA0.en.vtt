00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.509
 mouth 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:18.740
 you ask me if the new captain can 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.880
 offer you a life of looting treasures and 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.390
 adventure 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.980
 yes 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.380
 the expectation that has been creating 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.150
 assassin's creed 4 black flag face 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.340
 his arrival to the new generation is 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.379
 transforms into compliments from the first 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.050
 moment one enjoys it in xbox one 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.760
 or in precision 4 although both versions 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.970
 they come standard with a resolution 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.040
 native of 900 pixels in precession 4 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.350
 we can enjoy it at 1080 pixels with 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.790
 an update of the game itself 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.370
 showing us the splendor of life 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.409
 pirate who told us that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.150
 we analyze this game on its day whose 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.370
 video analysis of the versions of the 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.129
 other platforms you can see in this 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.199
 channel this analysis focuses on what 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.300
 improvement in his jump to the two consoles of 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.980
 new generation as usual 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.170
 delivery after delivery 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.880
 ubisoft has already left us amazed with its 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.280
 black flag for the other platforms 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.979
 but what is seen in these versions exceeds 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 what is expected is not just about getting him 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.570
 a more polished visual appearance but it 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.820
 take advantage to decorate and improve many 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.890
 aspects that make this one one of 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.710
 multiplatform games that better 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.479
 they look on these new consoles from the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.680
 principle we will be trapped by the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.090
 number of elements that have been 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.759
 multiplied between 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.340
 and the densest dense vegetation 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.140
 incredible that the other versions the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.329
 water and fire are elements that achieve 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.729
 also greater realism thanks to its 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.429
 representation in this new generation 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.890
 the approaches are even more spectacular 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.610
 and the naval battles now take a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.950
 new dimension 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.810
 organizations now have more 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.240
 decorative elements and are more 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.250
 populated the fluidity of movements 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.219
 It has also been revised enjoying now 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.869
 of greater dynamism has been taken advantage of 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.880
 also to implement a 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.369
 artificial intelligence a little more 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.739
 demanding doing something more challenging 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.630
 the clashes although nothing that 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:11.420
 come to despair and take by surprise 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.760
 the player in both versions luce 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.190
 great though on playstation 4 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.200
 the faces are better represented and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.450
 the environment offers more elements in its 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.829
 horizon the pc version is very 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.230
 similar to the one offered to the version of 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:27.379
 playstation 4 although it allows a fan 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.239
 greater resolutions as we said in 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.129
 the analysis when it came to the market 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.620
 assassin's creed 4 black flag is a 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.209
 excellent game but in the versions of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.400
 new generation where it offers a 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.980
 quality 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.659
 a product 100% recommended that 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.409
 takes advantage of the hardware of each one 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.409
 of the consoles
