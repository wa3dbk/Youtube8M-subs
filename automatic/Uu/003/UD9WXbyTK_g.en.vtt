 who relaunch too tenacious eric d 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.360
 historic under a new season under 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.460
 a new game so first of all I have 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.869
 presented what is a history on 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.539
 the call of duty then it's usually 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.210
 something hidden that can be a 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.789
 object a picture a text something 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.770
 like that so hide in the game that 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.240
 pay a taste a reference have a twinkle 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.880
 look at something where I gave a 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.159
 very well known and very simple example which 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.259
 are the TVs so read on who were 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.390
 present on good shots of call of duty 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.009
 6 modern 3 4 4 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.840
 short mirin TVs had mostly the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.460
 bells and it was just a 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.680
 wink to the daughter of one of 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.509
 game developers what I believe that 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.740
 it was activision-blizzard I am 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.049
 really passionate I think it was 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.490
 an activision developer in his 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.020
 daughter died simply he me 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 seems like a cancer and its teddy 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.189
 favorite was simply forbidden 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.869
 read that's why we find it on 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.490
 full of gifts it's just for a 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.710
 simple wink and a little thought 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.420
 here it is really nice and so 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.200
 several subscribers will claim a 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.969
 series on 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.829
 she has to redo because they have me so 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.960
 you are a little easter egg and well 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.909
 so I decided to relaunch this 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.070
 series on dancer do and we 're going all 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.969
 just started with their first 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.830
 historical that I will introduce you 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.519
 which is therefore simply in 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.379
 campaign 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.840
 so in the second mission I believe 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.459
 that these atlases or that they are worth something 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.709
 with atlas I do not know the exact name anymore 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.319
 as soon as you go swing so a 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.849
 marking pomegranate behind the door 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.530
 it's you will kill the enemies you 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.970
 will see on the ground there is a soft toy 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.290
 aliens and there you will say 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.420
 but what are you talking about 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.500
 who ordered to shoot down and well 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.540
 simply this plush and extra 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.959
 terrestrials were present on bo2 on 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.120
 newton en online is still present on 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.810
 ghost when you and the historical lol 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.310
 overweight in contact with extinction 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.959
 we want to kill the aliens was full 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.459
 lint is how they were flying 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.840
 alright but they handed over again 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.180
 that makes sense no hunger it's 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.220
 nice to see this stuffed 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.750
 then second easter egg rather more 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.849
 interesting inter alia about something 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.620
 fun enough that they have hidden so that's 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.250
 pass on the strait map in the car 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.170
 on fire of the spawn it's not sentinel 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.209
 it's the other team I believe and well 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.799
 sure the steering wheel on the side of those spawn in 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.389
 the car burn its marks and game 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.980
 over so sorry about the quality it's getting 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.060
 will see very very badly but I have not succeeded 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.480
 to have a better picture while 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.769
 just from this little hidden text 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.500
 on during wearily marked 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.239
 game over and the third easter egg is 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.250
 also passes on detroit then there must 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.600
 to be a spectator so go in part 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.359
 pray to make his voice weary not very 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.260
 difficult so look well where I 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.019
 placed my camera 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.489
 what that is where will have to go under the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.870
 So that's it I did not find any other 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.299
 way to go under ground of a behind 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.430
 end of mans under this little bush 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.410
 you will go from the ground to the ground and 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.910
 there you will see basically a kind 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.590
 image and there you go suddenly try 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.480
 to go as close to this image and 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.250
 that you see on the screen under the map 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.630
 developers have hidden an image of the good 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.880
 meaning francisco so it's an image 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.490
 will rule 360 degrees ie that 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.900
 see the image all around us and 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.080
 it's really very nice and very very 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.060
 beautiful so that's not very important 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.950
 but it's really nice what they have 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.110
 then makes it known that by episode I 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.780
 will present each time 3 easter egg 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.390
 and if you have other easter egg 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.670
 on this call of duty is of course doing 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.170
 and do not hesitate to propose them to me 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.330
 in comment and I will be happy 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.140
 to make them on video of you 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.630
 present on video 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.420
 in any case I hope that this season 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.770
 on aden surfing will make you happy and 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.060
