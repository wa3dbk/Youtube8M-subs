ending<00:00:19.289> 2012<00:00:20.119> with<00:00:21.119> lots<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.689> ideas<00:00:21.869> bubbling

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
ending 2012 with lots of ideas bubbling

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.269 
ending 2012 with lots of ideas bubbling
over<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.070> creativity<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.000> 2013<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.980> course

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
over with creativity for 2013 of course

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.779 
over with creativity for 2013 of course
I've<00:00:26.460> had<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.000> ridiculous<00:00:27.779> idea<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.099> 2013

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I've had a ridiculous idea that in 2013

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.580 
I've had a ridiculous idea that in 2013
I<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.420> create<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.140> book<00:00:31.880> I<00:00:32.960> will<00:00:33.960> create<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I would create a book I will create a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.880 
I would create a book I will create a
book<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.280> week<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.380> by

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
book a week and I will do that by

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.180 
book a week and I will do that by
creating<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.730> book<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.660> day<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.680> I'm

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
creating one book in a day and I'm

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
creating one book in a day and I'm
thinking<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.820> 24<00:00:42.090> hour<00:00:42.360> period<00:00:42.690> but

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
thinking of your 24 hour period but

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.639 
thinking of your 24 hour period but
primarily<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.460> primarily<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.360> would<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.750> from

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
primarily it primarily it would be from

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.260 
primarily it primarily it would be from
the<00:00:46.739> time<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> wake<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.250> until<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> time<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.120> go

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the time I wake up until the time I go

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.040 
the time I wake up until the time I go
to<00:00:48.329> bed<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.520> day<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.629> create<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.930> hook

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to bed in one day I will create a hook

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.729 
to bed in one day I will create a hook
from<00:00:52.350> scratch<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:54.059> definitely<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.870> an

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
from scratch so it will definitely be an

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.920 
from scratch so it will definitely be an
experiment<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.780> means<00:00:57.780> 52<00:00:58.350> books<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> year

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
experiment that means 52 books in a year

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
experiment that means 52 books in a year
so<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.109> means<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.800> creating<00:01:02.370> one

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so that means I will be creating one

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800 
so that means I will be creating one
book<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.539> week<00:01:03.890> 52<00:01:04.890> books<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.760> year<00:01:05.810> I'm

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
book a week 52 books in a year I'm

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.020 
book a week 52 books in a year I'm
excited<00:01:07.290> about<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.680> I'm<00:01:07.770> also<00:01:07.950> super<00:01:08.490> thinking

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
excited about it I'm also super thinking

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.109 
excited about it I'm also super thinking
it's<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.420> crazy<00:01:10.310> but<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.640> hope<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it's gonna be crazy but I hope that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
it's gonna be crazy but I hope that
you'll<00:01:12.240> join<00:01:12.270> me<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> journey<00:01:12.950> it'll<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you'll join me on the journey it'll be a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
you'll join me on the journey it'll be a
lot<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.280> experimentation<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.600> find<00:01:15.840> new

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
lot of experimentation I find new

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.380 
lot of experimentation I find new
products<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.650> different

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
products and different

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.720 
products and different
I<00:01:17.750> will<00:01:18.050> use<00:01:18.260> different<00:01:18.470> structures<00:01:19.130> I'll

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
I will use different structures I'll

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.120 
I will use different structures I'll
think<00:01:20.060> about<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.360> content<00:01:21.050> sometimes<00:01:21.440> and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
think about the content sometimes and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:53.920 
think about the content sometimes and
let<00:01:22.370> that<00:01:22.550> drive<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.090> book

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.529 

other<00:01:54.930> times<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:56.490> allow<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.149> structure

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
other times I will allow the structure

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.709 
other times I will allow the structure
of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> book<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.470> drive<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.890> content

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
of the book to drive the content

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.609 
of the book to drive the content
sometimes<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> book<00:02:01.020> will<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.200> blank

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
sometimes the book will be blank

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:20.910 
sometimes the book will be blank
depending<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.189> how<00:02:02.759> intricate<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.509> structure

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.900 

so<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:21.980> doing<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.310> bunch<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.580> different<00:02:22.880> things

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
so I'm doing a bunch of different things

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.090 
so I'm doing a bunch of different things
I<00:02:23.210> have<00:02:23.420> no<00:02:23.600> plan<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.260> have<00:02:24.530> nothing<00:02:24.980> planned

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
I have no plan I have nothing planned

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.390 
I have no plan I have nothing planned
out<00:02:25.430> at<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:25.760> point<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:27.320> started<00:02:28.070> with<00:02:28.220> this

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
out at this point I started with this

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.570 
out at this point I started with this
book<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.970> created<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:30.130> about<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> week<00:02:31.430> ago

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
book I created this about a week ago

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
ending 2012 and as I did this I kept

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.170 
ending 2012 and as I did this I kept
thinking<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.320> could<00:02:36.560> do<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.160> did<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.850> in<00:02:37.970> one

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
thinking I could do this I did it in one

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.670 
thinking I could do this I did it in one
day<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.570> created<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.050> book<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.380> one<00:02:39.530> day

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
granted it's a blank book but the cover

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.380 
granted it's a blank book but the cover
is<00:02:42.470> super<00:02:42.980> layered<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.580> textured<00:02:44.150> and
