Louis<00:00:06.680> what<00:00:07.680> I'm<00:00:07.770> doing<00:00:08.040> today<00:00:08.160> is

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
Louis what I'm doing today is

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.690 
Louis what I'm doing today is
blueprinting<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.740> savage<00:00:10.740> model<00:00:11.070> 10<00:00:11.280> action

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
blueprinting a savage model 10 action

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.580 
blueprinting a savage model 10 action
actually<00:00:12.000> I'm<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.300> doing<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> first<00:00:13.349> phase

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
actually I'm just doing the first phase

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.320 
actually I'm just doing the first phase
of<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:13.950> which<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.400> square<00:00:14.700> up<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.910> receiver

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
of it which is to square up the receiver

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.609 
of it which is to square up the receiver
face<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> common<00:00:17.220> axis<00:00:17.990> to<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.170> end<00:00:19.439> what

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
face with a common axis to that end what

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.400 
face with a common axis to that end what
I've<00:00:19.740> done<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.160> make<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.369> mandrel<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.960> which

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
I've done is make a mandrel here which

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.980 
I've done is make a mandrel here which
was<00:00:22.590> turned<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> single<00:00:23.400> unit<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.820> ensure

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
was turned as a single unit to ensure

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.529 
was turned as a single unit to ensure
concentricity<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.789> this<00:00:26.789> portion<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
concentricity and this portion is a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
concentricity and this portion is a
indicated<00:00:28.349> portion<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.769> center<00:00:29.099> drilled<00:00:29.429> for

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
indicated portion at center drilled for

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
indicated portion at center drilled for
a<00:00:29.849> live<00:00:30.660> center<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.439> threaded<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> 1<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a live center it's threaded with a 1 and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.709 
a live center it's threaded with a 1 and
1/8<00:00:33.059> by<00:00:33.440> 20<00:00:34.440> large<00:00:34.890> shank<00:00:35.250> thread<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
that bears against the bolt face feature
in<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> receiver<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.660> tightly

in the receiver and a very tightly
fitted<00:00:46.469> mandrel<00:00:48.140> that<00:00:49.140> allows<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.780> main

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
fitted mandrel that allows this to main

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.979 
fitted mandrel that allows this to main
parallel<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> common<00:00:53.640> axis<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.840> not

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
parallel to the common axis it's not

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.229 
parallel to the common axis it's not
quite<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.500> essential<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.370> savage<00:00:56.670> action

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
quite as essential with a savage action

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.760 
quite as essential with a savage action
since<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> floating<00:00:57.989> bolt<00:00:58.260> head<00:00:58.469> would

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
since it as a floating bolt head would

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.610 
since it as a floating bolt head would
be<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.160> say<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.210> example<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> Remington<00:01:01.079> 700

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
be for say for example a Remington 700

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.520 
be for say for example a Remington 700
but<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> same<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.110> good<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> have

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but it's all the same it's good to have

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.480 
but it's all the same it's good to have
everything<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.159> air<00:01:05.369> law<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> common<00:01:06.060> axis

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
everything up air law to a common axis

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.620 
everything up air law to a common axis
through<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.520> whole<00:01:08.729> thing<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.000> essentially

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
through the whole thing but essentially

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.679 
through the whole thing but essentially
this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> real<00:01:10.260> key<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
this is the real key to it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.200 
this is the real key to it
and<00:01:12.930> why<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.530> key<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> want

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and why that is key is because you want

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.890 
and why that is key is because you want
this<00:01:15.659> face<00:01:16.530> square<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> line<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this face square to the to the line of

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
this face square to the to the line of
the<00:01:18.990> bore<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.520> centerline<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> bore<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the bore the centerline the bore so that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.880 
the bore the centerline the bore so that
when<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.909> barrel<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.750> screwed<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.470> place

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
when the barrel is screwed into place

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.289 
when the barrel is screwed into place
and<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:27.000> barrel<00:01:27.330> nut<00:01:27.509> which<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:29.299> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and the barrel nut which I have here is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.730 
and the barrel nut which I have here is
also<00:01:30.689> messed<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.200> when<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> barrel<00:01:31.650> gets

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
also messed up so when the barrel gets

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289 
also messed up so when the barrel gets
screwed<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> barrel<00:01:33.150> nut

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
screwed into here and the barrel nut

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.780 
screwed into here and the barrel nut
clamps<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.200> against<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> recoil<00:01:35.340> lug<00:01:35.549> which

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
clamps down against a recoil lug which

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
clamps down against a recoil lug which
is<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.090> between<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.479> barrel<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.590> receiver

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
is in between the barrel or the receiver

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.810 
is in between the barrel or the receiver
and<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> nut<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:39.439> want<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.710> even<00:01:41.189> across

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and the nut you want to be even across

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.530 
and the nut you want to be even across
the<00:01:42.119> entire<00:01:42.479> face<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.500> receiver

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
the entire face of the receiver

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.940 
the entire face of the receiver
if<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.780> receiver<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> square<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
if this receiver is out of square it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
if this receiver is out of square it
only<00:01:47.100> barrel<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.759> side<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:49.200> will

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
only barrel on one side and it will

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
only barrel on one side and it will
cause<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> barrel<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> flex<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:51.090> oddly<00:01:51.390> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
cause the barrel to flex very oddly and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
cause the barrel to flex very oddly and
usually<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.649> very<00:01:52.710> detrimental<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
usually it's very detrimental to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.590 
usually it's very detrimental to
accuracy<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:55.380> worse<00:01:55.619> case<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
accuracy in a worse case if if this is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.090 
accuracy in a worse case if if this is
really<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.020> square<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> bolt<00:01:58.829> face

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and the bolt face is cocked you could

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.899 
and the bolt face is cocked you could
have<00:02:01.770> stressing<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.549> side<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> your

have stressing on one side of your

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.600 
have stressing on one side of your
cartridge<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.680> that's<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.860> fairly<00:02:05.159> extreme

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
cartridge but that's a fairly extreme

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.520 
cartridge but that's a fairly extreme
case<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.180> I've<00:02:06.240> never<00:02:06.719> seen<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> rifle<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
case and I've never seen a rifle like

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.760 
case and I've never seen a rifle like
that<00:02:07.770> personally

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
that personally

that personally
right<00:02:09.130> about<00:02:09.310> them<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.630> for<00:02:10.780> for<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.320> for

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
right about them so for for this for

right about them so for for this for
this<00:02:12.100> exercise<00:02:12.550> got<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.660> got<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.020> mandrill

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
this exercise got the got the mandrill

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.480 
this exercise got the got the mandrill
this<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.280> threaded<00:02:15.610> onto<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.060> locked<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:17.020> place

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
this is threaded onto it locked in place

this is threaded onto it locked in place
I've<00:02:18.490> already<00:02:18.790> had<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.090> out<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.540> put<00:02:19.690> it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
I've already had this out and I put it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.700 
I've already had this out and I put it
back<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.410> it's<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.460> few<00:02:21.850> ten<00:02:22.090> thousands<00:02:22.710> more

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
back in so it's a few ten thousands more

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.340 
back in so it's a few ten thousands more
run<00:02:23.950> out<00:02:24.100> than<00:02:24.340> when<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.550> made<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.970> cut<00:02:25.320> but<00:02:26.320> I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
run out than when I made the cut but I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.790 
run out than when I made the cut but I
will<00:02:26.680> show<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.640> level<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.800> accuracy

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
will show you the the level of accuracy

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.920 
will show you the the level of accuracy
this<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.460> four<00:02:30.730> jaw<00:02:30.970> Chuck<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.660> put<00:02:31.810> in

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
this is a four jaw Chuck on I put in

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.320 
this is a four jaw Chuck on I put in
there<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.200> dialed<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.910> sorry<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.150> kind

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
there and dialed it in sorry it's kind

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.090

of our ceiling flopping camera around
here<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.550> it's<00:02:37.270> uh<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:38.350> needles<00:02:38.650> moving

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
here but it's uh the needles moving

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.290 
here but it's uh the needles moving
about<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.100> third<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.520> graduation<00:02:40.000> which

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
about a third of a graduation which

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.300 
about a third of a graduation which
would<00:02:40.540> indicate<00:02:41.380> about<00:02:41.650> three<00:02:42.070> ten

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
would indicate about three ten

would indicate about three ten

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
thousandths of an inch on this end here

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.870 
thousandths of an inch on this end here
just<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> bring<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.550> out<00:02:47.760> bring<00:02:48.760> the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
just going to bring this out bring the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:59.000 
just going to bring this out bring the
three<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:50.110> other<00:02:50.140> side<00:02:54.300> Allen<00:02:55.300> on<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:55.870> side

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.690 

even<00:03:00.010> though<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.160> doesn't<00:03:00.280> have<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.520> be<00:03:00.610> on

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
even though it doesn't have to be on

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.750 
even though it doesn't have to be on
zero<00:03:01.060> just<00:03:01.560> seems<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.830> good<00:03:03.370> way<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:03.520> look

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
zero just seems to be a good way to look

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.240 
zero just seems to be a good way to look
at<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:08.170> can<00:03:08.290> see<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.770> yet<00:03:09.010> right

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
at it and you can see that yet right

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.280 
at it and you can see that yet right
there<00:03:09.460> it<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.660> I'm<00:03:10.780> not<00:03:10.930> showing<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
there it is so I'm not showing the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.760 
there it is so I'm not showing the
camera<00:03:11.620> very<00:03:11.800> well

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.460 

so<00:03:19.400> it's<00:03:19.520> about<00:03:19.640> five<00:03:20.420> ten<00:03:20.690> thousands<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.290> this

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
so it's about five ten thousands on this

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.210 
so it's about five ten thousands on this
end<00:03:23.020> when<00:03:24.020> I<00:03:24.050> measured<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.710> with<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.010> dial

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
end when I measured this with the dial

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.490 
end when I measured this with the dial
indicator<00:03:25.600> I'd<00:03:26.600> prefer<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.080> have<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.290> test

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
indicator I'd prefer to have a test

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.170 
indicator I'd prefer to have a test
indicator<00:03:27.980> for<00:03:28.160> all<00:03:28.250> these<00:03:28.400> operations<00:03:28.820> but<00:03:29.150> I

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
indicator for all these operations but I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.060 
indicator for all these operations but I
don't<00:03:29.330> have<00:03:29.420> one<00:03:29.600> here<00:03:29.660> with<00:03:29.960> me<00:03:30.170> when<00:03:30.770> I<00:03:30.800> did

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
don't have one here with me when I did

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.460 
don't have one here with me when I did
do<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.460> with<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.970> measure<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.750> face<00:03:33.260> with

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
do this with the measure this face with

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.920 
do this with the measure this face with
the<00:03:33.560> dial<00:03:33.740> indicator<00:03:34.240> needle<00:03:35.240> going<00:03:35.480> in<00:03:35.720> this

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
the dial indicator needle going in this

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.110 
the dial indicator needle going in this
way<00:03:36.200> before<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.400> made<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.730> cut

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
way before I made the cut

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.900 
way before I made the cut
I<00:03:38.150> got<00:03:38.510> about<00:03:38.740> almost<00:03:39.740> two<00:03:40.130> thousandths<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.790> an

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
I got about almost two thousandths of an

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.890 
I got about almost two thousandths of an
inch<00:03:41.030> difference<00:03:41.680> along<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.890> whole<00:03:43.040> turn<00:03:43.340> now

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
inch difference along the whole turn now

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.380 
inch difference along the whole turn now
it<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.110> virtually<00:03:45.920> none<00:03:46.490> discernible<00:03:47.240> with

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
it is virtually none discernible with

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.960 
it is virtually none discernible with
with<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.410> dial<00:03:48.680> indicator<00:03:49.160> just<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.550> slight

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
with this dial indicator just a slight

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.700 
with this dial indicator just a slight
perturbation<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.870> NiO<00:03:51.050> maybe<00:03:51.350> at<00:03:51.530> ten

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
perturbation in the NiO maybe at ten

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.160 
perturbation in the NiO maybe at ten

thousand or a couple ten thousands at

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.230 
thousand or a couple ten thousands at
best<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:54.950> think<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.400> will<00:03:55.610> serve<00:03:56.060> our

best so I think that will serve our

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.290 
best so I think that will serve our
purposes<00:03:57.040> again<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> savage<00:03:59.090> model

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
purposes again this is a savage model

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.270 
purposes again this is a savage model

also<00:04:13.520> of<00:04:13.880> importance<00:04:14.390> is<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:15.080> did<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.410> same

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
also of importance is I did the same

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.430 
also of importance is I did the same
thing<00:04:15.920> with<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.250> barrel<00:04:16.940> nut<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:18.260> was

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
thing with the barrel nut this was

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.050 
thing with the barrel nut this was
turned<00:04:18.680> on<00:04:18.770> a<00:04:18.830> stub<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.080> four<00:04:21.320> jaw<00:04:21.530> Chuck

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
turned on a stub and a four jaw Chuck

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.360 
turned on a stub and a four jaw Chuck
the<00:04:23.060> live<00:04:23.270> Center<00:04:23.690> here<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:24.110> well<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.710> when<00:04:25.340> I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
the live Center here as well and when I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.060 
the live Center here as well and when I
turned<00:04:25.640> it<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.060> cut<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.690> can<00:04:26.840> see<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.770> shiny

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
turned it I cut you can see the shiny

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.700 
turned it I cut you can see the shiny
metal<00:04:28.760> on<00:04:29.000> there<00:04:29.240> that<00:04:29.720> was<00:04:29.900> also<00:04:30.080> cut<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.590> be

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
metal on there that was also cut to be

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.830 
metal on there that was also cut to be
true<00:04:30.920> because<00:04:31.100> if<00:04:31.790> this<00:04:31.970> isn't<00:04:32.210> square<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:32.780> it

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
true because if this isn't square and it

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.030 
true because if this isn't square and it
bears<00:04:33.050> against<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:33.530> going<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.740> cause<00:04:33.890> the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
bears against this going to cause the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.730 
bears against this going to cause the
same<00:04:34.220> problem<00:04:34.610> as<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.730> receiver<00:04:35.200> so<00:04:36.200> it's<00:04:36.620> good

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
same problem as a receiver so it's good

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.640 
same problem as a receiver so it's good
to<00:04:36.770> have<00:04:36.950> all<00:04:37.100> such<00:04:37.400> all<00:04:38.060> parts<00:04:38.900> square<00:04:39.530> is

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
to have all such all parts square is

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.440 
to have all such all parts square is
possible<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.190> a<00:04:40.220> nice<00:04:40.400> common<00:04:41.000> concentric

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
possible to a nice common concentric

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.840 
possible to a nice common concentric
axis
