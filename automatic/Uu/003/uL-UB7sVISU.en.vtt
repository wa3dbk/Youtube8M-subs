00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.270
 Good day, dear friends 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.030
 call me perpetuum or alexander and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.210
 Today I have one 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.690
 I'm just a little pig in in in in in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.420
 in what in what happens to me 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.740
 seemed or saw it all 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.020
 does this giant exist 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.630
 a pig that's here for some reason flies 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.449
 I really donâ€™t know why in general 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.750
 guys this is again heading stupid games and 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.910
 Today I will play in the pig simulator 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 Apparently many developers were inspired 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140
 the success of the goat simulator which 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.870
 everyone liked the principle and decided to start 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 create your own games and not 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.370
 came up with nothing better how to create 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.890
 Pig simulator is true he of course 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.260
 It looks very strange but although it is possible 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 this is the whole trick of the game now I 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.530
 and find out this but before I run 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.190
 somewhere I'll just go up a little bit 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.329
 eat 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.710
 hi gilt how are you doing how are you 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.989
 hey hey hey piggy you okay 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.320
 why do you eat air such air 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.119
 delicious I would eat air too 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.650
 piglet so funny moves honestly 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.950
 saying okay try to eat us 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.000
 iron 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 tasty and iron okay basically 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.299
 In principle, they can for some reason eat 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.299
 okay, I'll run and see what's possible here 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.250
 do what you can and apparently here 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.509
 there are crazy pigs too my pig is not 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.759
 the only insane 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.590
 in this world, what is this 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
 giant pig i'm not really 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.579
 I know why she flies here in a pig 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.189
 the pig went against the system this 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.570
 revolution pork revolution now i'm 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.490
 free cheers cheers cheers cheers 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.220
 but it seems I became free and that to me 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.020

 get to play with these pigs 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.750

 ball and ball hi memory whomp whomp whomp whomp 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.410
 pumas pumas pumas pumas let you get rid of 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.100
 down a little pum pum pum pum pum pum 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.180
 pum-pum-pum pum-pum-pum pum-pum-pum 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.090
 great still a little bit and I would fall 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.920
 down well that there is some damn water here 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.650
 the pig swims funny for some reason water 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.630
 so harsh that she just she 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 just bends under my weight it 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.850
 strange more like some kind of jelly 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.410
 big pig decided to drink water was 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.780
 would be great if this big pig 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.460
 I could ride a little night 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.710
 she is obviously not feeling very well 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.390
 because she she probably went crazy 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.100
 or just under the influence of any 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.260
 substances or just drunk 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.000
 what's wrong with her maybe I need and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.010

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.550

 wall so let's see how cool and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.310

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.310
 i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready pig smash about 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.870
 god it's a pig learned to fly 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.820
 now it's a pig jesus or a pig 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.209
 Jesus is no longer visible from the fact that I 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.640
 said about art he deprived me 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.230
 divine gift and all mine now 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.570
 the pig can't imagine anything 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.239
 Only I can break it a little bench 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:47.910
 wow wow wow shop 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.600
 shop fine my piggy bit 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.120
 flew a 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.920
 very strange world and in fact I 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.810
 would even be well 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.910
 about this world on some small 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.250
 time interval of minutes at 5 10 I would 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.850
 would run along with the pigs would frolic 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.470
 with them would fly a little bit into the abyss 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.810
 now i'm reborn i'll appear 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.549
 re or all this end about appeared 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.720
 fine my pig teleported 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.970
 back to the pen ok 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.700
 shop went away i don't need me with 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.799
 I will not be friends with you 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.690
 all right all fuck 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.159
 only a pig is worth something in this world 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.180
 only pig here lord the king for 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.460
 so-so-so-so-so-so- all my piggy 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.169
 can not see if someone wants me suddenly 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.240
 kill he won't find me here ok 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.789
 I'll go run and tried to break into 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.129
 the house why the box does not fly apart 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.930
 I can only push it not always 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.810
 my it turns out to push him hard to 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.919
 he really flew away so box 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.719
 found himself in the abyss 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:51.030
 and and and from all the run fine 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.800
 we have in the house in the house there is darkness 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.409
 very fun and interesting cool but I 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.550
 I'm leaving here darkness I'm tired of darkness 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.770
 I will break down cost 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.419
 maybe these pigs still think that 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.789
 they are locked up in slavery well i 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.379
 freed them why they are not happy 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.419
 why don't they jump 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.199
 why they are not content with lives 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.729
 life so this one here and this here 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.550
 this is this 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.680
 I can't break how I spoke 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.080
 it turns out it does not work very strange 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.689
 okay, this fence is probably the last stronghold 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.669
 slavery on this earth is not in it 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.199
 space in this world try 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.779
 go there maybe there will be something 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.240
 on this hill maybe this hill is not 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.339
 something will tell and I will be able to know 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.139
 the truth of this world is what really 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.849
 here it happens how I got here and 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.159
 why is this pig so giant and 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.289
 so mad I still honestly 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.229
 saying it is not clear but nothing is my miracle 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.659
 swinger will do everything everyone will do guys 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.819
 don't be afraid i'll set you free i'll rip you off 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.889
 shackles of slavery and you will be free 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.139
 pigs and you too can run around 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.610
 green grass and enjoy life only 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.379
 hell for some reason my pig is not 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:04.460
 so cool to climb up 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:07.860
 oh oh wow the sliding pig slides 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.449
 because it does not work out as 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.169
 almost snowboarding 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.310
 rolling down this earth oh oh nothing 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.770
 it turns out to do 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.419
 Okay, in general, I'm even more honest 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.490
 saying I don't know what to do in this 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.710
 the game that can tell you about this 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.110
 I think it's worth finishing and what is the most 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.629
 interesting that this game is created on anril 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.729
 the third engineer is just the thing is 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.520
 usually this kind of stupid weird 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.500
 games create on unity3d because it 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.460
 very simple development environment 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.190
 games about for 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.889
 can open and close wow 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.160
 This is a super opportunity. 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.800
 and closes magic magic run away fucking 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.410
 son how can you eat so here and now 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.940
 the developers decided to go wisely 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.130
 create a game create an anril engineer 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.160
 third though because of this honestly 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.990
 nothing really happened well 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.750
 you were perpetuum or alexander 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.970
 pig with a moving piggy pig 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.949
 Jesus Pig Liberator Cinco 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.259
 revolutionary and piggy just good 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:10.490
 man and see you friends good luck 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.940

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.940
 and bye
