fabric and then what you're going to do

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.230 
fabric and then what you're going to do
is<00:02:04.710> take<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.159> fabric<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.939> you're<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
tear long strips so you end up with

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.540

into a tube so only the pattern is

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.729 
into a tube so only the pattern is
showing<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.170> then<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.349> can<00:02:43.500> start<00:02:43.769> adding
