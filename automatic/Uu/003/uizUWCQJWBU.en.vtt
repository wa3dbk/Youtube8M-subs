00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.959
 what's up everyone is a new video this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.809
 It's very important and very good I 'm going to 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.589
 demonstrate how to install what is or 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.209
 increase your ram memory in your s 3 mini 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.460
 I already got it after a lot of trouble 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.820
 that nobody that I have the rom a rom 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.910
 which is the fusion cat is testing and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 is very good and this is the one that I have 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.560
 I think it also works with the rom 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 this as a problem that nobody who is 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.630
 only confused with stock and roma 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 with this one does not have to raise the new 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.640
 kernel that is what supports what is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.260
 the swap but I'm going to leave what is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.040
 the download link of the page here what 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.790
 can have is called was carnal is this 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.800
 card in 1.2 and is what can be the 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.460
 possible so that is to put it that goes for 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.750
 what is the soldier in shows what 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.750
 we unload 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 and what we give him though dismount and what 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.070
 We normally offer as any 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.990
 another as if it were a room 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.500
 after this we are going to install what 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 is these two applications memory info and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.210
 super configuration this is the best 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.210
 info is to test if yes you can 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.000
 what is to do his paper and well 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.000
 shows you if you have it activated not this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.720
 You can also try what is the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 artist setsuv cpu the mind can pay 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.409
 with this problem depends on tastes 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.479
 well first of all this we download 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.450
 what is the secure by configuration 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.830
 from the place thor we can put it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.720
 as super 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.720
 and more what is this 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.800
 search download we will download the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.800
 application 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.950
 it's completely free so I do not know 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.840
 worry they're not going to battle with that here 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.460
 is in software fort road is the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.619
 we install and since the installed ones I can 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
 make them to what the icon is to see that 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.580
 they have installed it, we are going to open it and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.860
 we're just going to give you here in your 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.560
 dance position we put it in this dakar 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.470
 ex partition have to have a micro 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.840
 sd to be able to activate was 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.090
 because in the partition fuck does not work 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.580
 in what is the internal phone does not 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.709
 it works already I tried it they put it 50 and 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.860
 100 megabytes give you activate shopping 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.110
 wood and read in 6 wait waiting for the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.810
 say hello a window that is activated does not look 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.400
 and they only give him inside the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.640
 application to see if it is active or not 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.670
 here you can see 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.150
 where it says total swap says bears 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.660
 between 2 megs and soft 247 this does not improve 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.670
 for what is the exchange of data and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.470
 in countries as if it had more number of 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.170
 ram and then it is open more applications 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.650
 the go to virtual memory we can 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.070
 try with the other of tpv and here we 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.920
 let's open here what is the program 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.900
 we go where it says info and we go 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.480
 to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.569
 here also as you can see is in your 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.569
 app 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.550
 there it is and what I have free would be everything 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.530
 already after much testing and after 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.200
 search and search you can activate what 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.690
 is the software that you liked 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.620
 enlighten is an etcetera is mini this already you 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.140
 I said that you break in the 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.840
 description of the violin derailed from the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.970
 kernel and therefore the only one that will occupy 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.370
 the other application finds them in 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.870
 the track for free except the set is 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.600
 foresees that it can be found in apt 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.830
 and it detects so we see each other until the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.560
 next and I hope the video has them 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.210
 liked and subscribe cellay the video and 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.210
 we are to the other
