this<00:02:44.640> thigh<00:02:44.879> has<00:02:45.060> none<00:02:45.659> over<00:02:46.319> here<00:02:46.439> I<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.560> one

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.170 

over<00:02:51.569> here<00:02:51.810> have<00:02:51.989> one<00:02:52.260> tor<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.829> top<00:02:56.180> that's

so this is the new wiper blade refill
and<00:03:41.190> as<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.850> open<00:03:42.880> this<00:03:43.330> up<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.780> open<00:03:43.990> up<00:03:44.170> a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
and as you open this up you open up a

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.320 
and as you open this up you open up a
little<00:03:44.530> bit<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:46.570> can<00:03:46.750> see<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.020> groove<00:03:48.330> over

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
little bit you can see the groove over

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
little bit you can see the groove over
here<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:50.260> group<00:03:50.530> closer<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.310> edge

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
here is the group closer to the edge

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.570 
here is the group closer to the edge
over<00:03:53.350> here<00:03:53.880> there's<00:03:54.880> no<00:03:55.060> groove<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.620> this<00:03:57.400> one

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
over here there's no groove so this one

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:12.270 
over here there's no groove so this one
fits<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:01.060> place<00:04:01.270> slide<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.530> in

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.910 

that's<00:04:12.850> right<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.180> side<00:04:13.530> still<00:04:14.530> just

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
that's right this side still just

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.750 
that's right this side still just
double-check<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:16.989> get<00:04:17.140> group<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.760> closer

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
double-check so we get group is closer

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.840 
double-check so we get group is closer
start<00:04:19.480> further<00:04:19.810> from<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.200> edge<00:04:20.640> this<00:04:21.640> side

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
start further from the edge this side

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:37.209 
start further from the edge this side
goes<00:04:22.090> in<00:04:22.300> first

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.119 

when<00:04:37.879> you're<00:04:37.999> all<00:04:38.119> done<00:04:38.619> slide<00:04:39.619> it<00:04:39.770> back<00:04:39.919> into

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
when you're all done slide it back into

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.859 
when you're all done slide it back into
the<00:04:41.169> blade<00:04:42.169> part<00:04:42.429> so<00:04:43.429> we're<00:04:44.360> not<00:04:44.629> sure<00:04:44.749> where

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:44.869 
the blade part so we're not sure where

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:49.089 
the blade part so we're not sure where
you<00:04:44.929> call<00:04:45.169> this<00:04:45.379> I<00:04:45.529> guess<00:04:45.739> just<00:04:46.039> a<00:04:46.419> case<00:04:48.099> the

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
you call this I guess just a case the

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.059 
you call this I guess just a case the
housing

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.320 

so<00:04:53.610> since<00:04:53.849> my<00:04:54.059> right<00:04:54.270> wiper<00:04:54.479> sits<00:04:54.869> like<00:04:55.020> this

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
so since my right wiper sits like this

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:08.370 
so since my right wiper sits like this
I'm<00:04:57.330> just<00:04:57.599> going<00:04:57.779> to<00:04:57.809> slide<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.199> in<00:04:59.180> this<00:05:00.180> way

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.120 

make<00:05:08.950> sure<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.780> this<00:05:10.780> slot<00:05:11.110> slides<00:05:11.950> in

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
make sure that this slot slides in

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.460 
make sure that this slot slides in
perfectly<00:05:12.580> over<00:05:12.910> here<00:05:13.290> through<00:05:14.290> these

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
perfectly over here through these

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.960 
perfectly over here through these
ventures

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.880 

don't<00:05:22.570> readings<00:05:22.960> using<00:05:23.110> your<00:05:23.350> for<00:05:23.560> anything

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
don't readings using your for anything

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.860 
don't readings using your for anything
just<00:05:24.610> slides<00:05:25.270> right<00:05:25.480> in

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
just slides right in

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.680 
just slides right in
then<00:05:26.860> when<00:05:27.130> get<00:05:27.280> towards<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.640> edge<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:28.570> can

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
then when get towards the edge you can

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:36.780 
then when get towards the edge you can
see<00:05:28.840> over<00:05:28.960> here<00:05:29.320> just<00:05:29.560> push<00:05:29.920> down<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:31.000> snap<00:05:31.390> in

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.030 

that's<00:05:37.390> it<00:05:37.540> now<00:05:38.110> I<00:05:38.140> can<00:05:38.380> put<00:05:38.530> this<00:05:38.590> back<00:05:38.800> on<00:05:38.950> to

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
that's it now I can put this back on to

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.980 
that's it now I can put this back on to
the<00:05:39.130> car<00:05:40.470> it's<00:05:41.470> only<00:05:41.650> in<00:05:41.740> trizol<00:05:41.920> outside<00:05:42.430> but

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
the car it's only in trizol outside but

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.330 
the car it's only in trizol outside but
then<00:05:43.990> just<00:05:44.170> turn<00:05:44.350> on<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.470> wipers<00:05:44.740> see<00:05:45.250> how

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
then just turn on the wipers see how

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:52.250 
then just turn on the wipers see how
they<00:05:45.580> work<00:05:45.760> now<00:05:47.010> much<00:05:48.010> better<00:05:48.280> than<00:05:48.700> before

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.830 

there's<00:05:53.260> no<00:05:53.380> work<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.680> don't<00:05:53.740> see<00:05:53.980> any<00:05:54.130> streaks

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
there's no work I don't see any streaks

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.060 
there's no work I don't see any streaks
so<00:05:55.840> I'll<00:05:56.050> definitely<00:05:56.200> recommend<00:05:56.710> using<00:05:56.860> the

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
so I'll definitely recommend using the

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.410 
so I'll definitely recommend using the
OEM<00:05:57.280> Honda<00:05:58.060> part<00:05:59.550> because<00:06:00.550> one<00:06:01.210> they're

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
OEM Honda part because one they're

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.840 
OEM Honda part because one they're
cheaper<00:06:01.840> if<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:02.770> were<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.920> buy<00:06:03.040> in<00:06:03.340> a<00:06:03.580> whole

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
cheaper if you were to buy in a whole

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.210 
cheaper if you were to buy in a whole
blade<00:06:04.390> replacement<00:06:04.570> at<00:06:05.290> like<00:06:05.560> Pep<00:06:05.770> Boys<00:06:05.800> were

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
blade replacement at like Pep Boys were

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.600 
blade replacement at like Pep Boys were
all<00:06:06.340> autozone<00:06:06.820> about<00:06:07.300> ten<00:06:07.660> dollars<00:06:07.780> apiece

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
all autozone about ten dollars apiece

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.670 
all autozone about ten dollars apiece
whereas<00:06:09.610> with<00:06:10.300> just<00:06:10.600> a<00:06:10.720> wiper<00:06:10.990> blade<00:06:11.290> refills

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
whereas with just a wiper blade refills

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.120 
whereas with just a wiper blade refills

you can do it do it by yourself in less
than<00:06:15.310> 10<00:06:15.700> minutes<00:06:15.880> and<00:06:16.890> it<00:06:17.890> cost<00:06:18.160> you<00:06:18.340> anywhere
