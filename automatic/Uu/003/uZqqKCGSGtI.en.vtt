00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.480
 instead of judging the driver needs to have redoubled attention will be saved 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.330
 increase the chances of accidents mainly of rear-end collision in case 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.330
 of infringement is linked to our report 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.199
 afp 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.419
 but 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.179
 when she arrived from another hotter season of the year until July the 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.499
 as a consequence of 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.989
 already known problems of floods and floods in the streets and avenues of 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.239
 the number of car accidents these days tends to increase if the number of 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.989
 already requires permanent attention from drivers in good 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.290
 rainfall requires maximum concentration 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.540
 because the risks increase a lot so if the driver could regina life 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.640
 under rain postponing your shift is somewhat better 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.330
 if it can not be worth remembering that it is possible to do to maintain security 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.170
 the steering wheel can catch the low judge 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.390
 so it has to be changed and you will have many caveats on Tuesday 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.530
 nostalgic at the front to appear on the list 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.790
 became more careful I drove the safety car 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.590
 the many care action is not to keep mostly from a distance 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 car and other lowered attention redoubled in the care with the brakes eike 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 renato the low lights have to walk with attention god was given ter 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.920
 attention because the trail is slippery on and we 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.090
 with the car behind the front car 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.460
 and to pass in puddles of water forms the march of the wife who was already in the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.400
 second half is not so easy are many care so stay tuned 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.729
 to a few tips that will make it easier for you to drive your vehicle on 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.860
 rainy go slow 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.570
 decrease speed increase distances in relation to others 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.509
 charges 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.479
 the speed limits are set for the road conditions and the actual 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.009
 When young people are reduced visibility in 6 lose efficiency do not let the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.859
 car bashary glasses click and send fender rear window trim adjustments 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.119
 two of windshields at high speed and so the conditional nilmar 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.980
 accurate tuning to the windshield in several videos of the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.370
 driver and passenger if the car does not have equipment the leader 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.810
 exiled from the fish windows a little open and following the humidity of the glasses 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.700
 with the plateau or better still with the newspaper 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.290
 the tip of the newspaper today in 16th place is getting better here 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.560
 also to be more visible to other posts even though it is clear in the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 doubt not cross in a flooded area yesterday had another way and if not 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.880
 have had another alternative park the car and hopefully remember that the insurance 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.410
 generally does not cover damage caused by flooding, try to do the same 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.209
 path ahead of you 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.049
 I know that in the range most used by other vehicles can improve the traction and 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.299
 will avoid planing however your car aquaplanar the vat will decelerate and 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.489
 allow the force of gravity to come into contact with the asphalt if the 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.110
 visibility will be very dangerous car turn on the flashing alert 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.750
 I parked as soon as possible at a safer and preferably higher point 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.620
 if it is necessary for survivors fortis choose a location far from 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.659
 trees and power lines that can be felled 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.569
 I worked also is in the rule of the two points only that in case there is 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.700
 opposition mind until the purchase 4 1 3 that is to say I chose the corner craft in the track 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.430
 I hope the car in front of him was for him. 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.359
 recall for 4 seconds until your car arrives at the same source 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.489
 and if it will give more safety when driving the car in the rain then I like 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.049
 of the tips if all the accommodations were burned down with a large number of 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.709
 accidents that can be avoided said vazquez 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.480
 stay tuned
