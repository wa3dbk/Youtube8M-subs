00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to attack his base so I start off by

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.060 
to attack his base so I start off by
dropping<00:00:27.359> two<00:00:27.539> loons<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.619> take<00:00:28.830> out<00:00:28.949> this

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
have lost this raid because of these

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620 
have lost this raid because of these
Expos<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.210> hack<00:02:03.420> I

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
Expos and I don't think it's a hack I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.999 
Expos and I don't think it's a hack I
don't<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:03.990> people<00:02:04.200> would<00:02:04.380> hack<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> game

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
don't think people would hack the game

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.590 
don't think people would hack the game
so<00:02:05.280> again<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.820> think<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:06.390> even

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
so again I don't think I don't even

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
so again I don't think I don't even
think<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
think you can do that so then I have to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.070 
think you can do that so then I have to
kind<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.060> all<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.539> dropped<00:02:09.750> some

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
kind of go all out I dropped some

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.530 
kind of go all out I dropped some
balloons<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.099> her<00:02:11.190> rage<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
balloons of her rage and now I have to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.490 
balloons of her rage and now I have to
take<00:02:12.690> off<00:02:12.810> at<00:02:12.930> Expo

take off at Expo

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.980 
take off at Expo
cuz<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.800> taking<00:02:14.250> out<00:02:14.490> my<00:02:14.820> loons<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.360> can't<00:02:15.720> do

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
cuz it's taking out my loons I can't do

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.620

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
anything against it and this is really

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.870 
anything against it and this is really
frustrated<00:02:19.290> me<00:02:19.350> honestly<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.370> did<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:20.820> a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
frustrated me honestly but I did get a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.160 
frustrated me honestly but I did get a
decent<00:02:21.330> amount<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.540> gold<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.930> raid<00:02:22.140> I
