00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
better or maybe they're not better one

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
better or maybe they're not better one
is<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.440> better<00:00:40.590> than<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> other<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.370> some

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
is not better than the other but some

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.150 
is not better than the other but some
each<00:00:42.570> game<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.230> advantages<00:00:43.800> over<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
each game has some advantages over the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.920 
each game has some advantages over the
other<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> obviously<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> talk

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
other so obviously we are going to talk

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.090 
other so obviously we are going to talk
about<00:00:49.850> what<00:00:50.850> halo<00:00:51.239> reach<00:00:51.539> has<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.530> black<00:00:52.770> ops

in<00:00:53.820> terms<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> being<00:00:54.420> better<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.780> guess<00:00:55.010> during

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
in terms of being better I guess during

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.420 
in terms of being better I guess during
this<00:00:56.329> commentary<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> first<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.280> a

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.690 
go go check and see what metals you got
you<00:05:54.750> know<00:05:54.780> compared<00:05:55.349> with<00:05:55.440> friends<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.039> so<00:05:56.669> on

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
you know compared with friends and so on

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.440 
you know compared with friends and so on
and<00:05:57.000> so<00:05:57.060> forth<00:05:57.590> we<00:05:58.590> actually<00:05:59.030> lost<00:06:00.030> a<00:06:00.240> teammate

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
and so forth we actually lost a teammate

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.420 
and so forth we actually lost a teammate
there<00:06:00.780> so<00:06:01.050> i<00:06:01.080> might<00:06:01.470> actually<00:06:01.710> have<00:06:02.039> saved

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
there so i might actually have saved

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.649 
there so i might actually have saved
this<00:06:02.789> match<00:06:03.180> as<00:06:03.539> a<00:06:04.190> loss<00:06:05.190> but<00:06:05.700> obviously<00:06:06.270> i'm

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
this match as a loss but obviously i'm

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.020 
this match as a loss but obviously i'm
doing<00:06:07.169> really<00:06:07.409> well<00:06:07.650> that's<00:06:08.550> probably<00:06:08.820> the

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
doing really well that's probably the

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.420 
doing really well that's probably the
main<00:06:09.060> reason<00:06:09.240> it<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:10.010> kept<00:06:11.010> it<00:06:13.010> but<00:06:14.010> that<00:06:14.280> is

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
main reason it I kept it but that is

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.969 
main reason it I kept it but that is
about<00:06:14.580> it<00:06:16.010> my<00:06:17.010> black<00:06:17.520> ops<00:06:18.710> comparison<00:06:19.710> video

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
about it my black ops comparison video

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.370 
about it my black ops comparison video
is<00:06:20.190> going<00:06:20.340> to<00:06:20.400> be<00:06:20.490> team<00:06:20.880> deathmatch<00:06:21.450> and<00:06:21.810> it's

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
is going to be team deathmatch and it's

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.810 
is going to be team deathmatch and it's
going<00:06:22.530> to<00:06:22.620> be<00:06:22.740> ground<00:06:23.070> more<00:06:23.370> so<00:06:23.640> that's

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
going to be ground more so that's

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.850 
going to be ground more so that's
slightly<00:06:24.419> different<00:06:25.020> than<00:06:25.050> this<00:06:25.320> but<00:06:25.560> that's

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
slightly different than this but that's

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.089 
slightly different than this but that's
just<00:06:26.070> what<00:06:26.279> we<00:06:26.400> play<00:06:26.669> on<00:06:26.880> there<00:06:27.950> but<00:06:28.950> they're

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
just what we play on there but they're

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.940 
just what we play on there but they're
both<00:06:29.539> both<00:06:30.539> gameplays<00:06:31.080> are<00:06:31.320> you<00:06:31.500> know<00:06:31.620> get

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
both both gameplays are you know get

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.920 
both both gameplays are you know get
more<00:06:32.159> kills<00:06:32.550> than<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.940> other<00:06:33.060> team

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
more kills than the other team

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.719 
more kills than the other team
I<00:06:33.960> was<00:06:34.259> going<00:06:34.380> to<00:06:34.440> be<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.530> team<00:06:34.710> deathmatch<00:06:35.130> and

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729

this<00:06:36.060> is<00:06:36.210> a<00:06:36.240> SWAT<00:06:36.660> but<00:06:36.960> it's<00:06:37.110> it's<00:06:37.860> a<00:06:38.210> race<00:06:39.210> to

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
this is a SWAT but it's it's a race to

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.100

50<00:06:39.750> kills<00:06:39.990> and<00:06:40.199> SWAT<00:06:40.440> a<00:06:40.470> race<00:06:40.860> to<00:06:41.509> 75<00:06:42.509> kills<00:06:42.930> i

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
50 kills and SWAT a race to 75 kills i

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.320 
50 kills and SWAT a race to 75 kills i

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
think in ground war or no maybe it's a

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.180 
think in ground war or no maybe it's a
hundred<00:06:45.690> and<00:06:45.840> a<00:06:46.560> ground<00:06:46.830> more<00:06:46.949> team

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190

help<00:07:20.460> and<00:07:21.050> there's<00:07:22.050> the<00:07:22.349> loss<00:07:22.560> but<00:07:23.009> I<00:07:23.039> have<00:07:23.960> 25

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
help and there's the loss but I have 25

help and there's the loss but I have 25
kills<00:07:25.590> it<00:07:25.830> looks<00:07:26.039> like<00:07:27.080> pretty<00:07:28.080> sick<00:07:28.380> match

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
kills it looks like pretty sick match

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.080 
kills it looks like pretty sick match
for<00:07:29.070> sure<00:07:29.630> obviously<00:07:31.340> losing<00:07:32.340> really<00:07:32.789> sucks

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 
for sure obviously losing really sucks

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.230 
for sure obviously losing really sucks
but<00:07:33.389> if<00:07:33.599> you're<00:07:33.750> going<00:07:33.840> to<00:07:33.930> lose<00:07:34.910> this<00:07:35.910> is<00:07:36.120> the

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
but if you're going to lose this is the

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.640 
but if you're going to lose this is the
way<00:07:36.360> to<00:07:36.419> do<00:07:36.630> it<00:07:36.750> by<00:07:36.870> having<00:07:37.050> a<00:07:37.259> really<00:07:37.470> big

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
way to do it by having a really big

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.589 
way to do it by having a really big
match<00:07:37.830> like<00:07:38.070> that<00:07:38.099> 25<00:07:38.669> kills<00:07:38.909> 10<00:07:39.389> deaths
