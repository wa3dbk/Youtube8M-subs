00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.259 

and<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.470> also<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.740> think<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.760> whole<00:00:11.910> exercise

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and and also I think this whole exercise

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.940 
and and also I think this whole exercise
that<00:00:12.599> we've<00:00:12.750> gone<00:00:12.960> through<00:00:13.019> now<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.830> this

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
that we've gone through now with this

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.890 
that we've gone through now with this
one<00:00:14.190> chord<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.910> trying<00:00:15.209> to<00:00:15.269> rearrange<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
one chord and trying to rearrange the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.200 
one chord and trying to rearrange the
notes<00:00:16.139> trying<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.220> find<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> inversions

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
notes trying to find the inversions

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.450 
notes trying to find the inversions
trying<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> think<00:00:19.200> of<00:00:19.349> how<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.980> use<00:00:20.040> it<00:00:20.340> as

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
trying to think of how we can use it as

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.749 
trying to think of how we can use it as
all<00:00:20.580> these<00:00:20.700> other<00:00:20.759> chords<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:22.110> really

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
all these other chords it's really

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.339 
all these other chords it's really
basically<00:00:23.759> how<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> trap<00:00:24.360> try<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> practice

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
basically how I trap try to practice

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.349 
basically how I trap try to practice
whatever<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.910> whether<00:00:27.119> it's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
whatever I do you know whether it's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.279 
whatever I do you know whether it's
harmony<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.500> rhythm<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:29.689> what-have-you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
harmony or rhythm or what-have-you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.430 
harmony or rhythm or what-have-you
basically<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.970> method<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.809> me<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.199> always

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
basically the method for me it's always

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
basically the method for me it's always
to<00:00:34.559> try<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.100> kind<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> wood<00:00:35.820> lit<00:00:36.000> down<00:00:36.150> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to try and kind of wood lit down to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.460 
to try and kind of wood lit down to
something<00:00:36.720> really<00:00:36.900> small<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.410> really

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
something really small and really

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.579 
something really small and really
specific<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.660> know<00:00:39.720> exactly<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:40.500> I'm

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
specific so that I know exactly what I'm

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.819 
specific so that I know exactly what I'm
working<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.090> by<00:00:42.840> doing<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.680> me

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
working on and and by doing that for me

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.700 
working on and and by doing that for me
it's<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.969> easier<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:46.890> really

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
it's it's much easier to to really

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.529 
it's it's much easier to to really
really<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.129> full<00:00:50.370> sense<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> can

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
really get the full sense of what I can

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
really get the full sense of what I can
get<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.739> thing<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
get from that one little thing so you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
get from that one little thing so you
know<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.030> me<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> major<00:00:55.590> nine<00:00:55.860> chord

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
know for me you know a major nine chord

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.369 
know for me you know a major nine chord
I<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.820> practicing<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.449> four

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
I can I can be practicing that for four

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
I can I can be practicing that for four
weeks<00:00:58.559> four<00:00:58.860> months<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.489> know<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> once

weeks four months you know and and once

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.240 
weeks four months you know and and once
I'm<00:01:00.899> done<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.440> inversion<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I'm done with the inversion of that you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.729 
I'm done with the inversion of that you
know<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.600> rearrange<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.229> notes<00:01:04.440> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
know I can now rearrange the notes and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.230 
know I can now rearrange the notes and
and<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> inversions<00:01:09.119> are

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and and and and now the inversions are

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.430 
and and and and now the inversions are
gonna<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.509> different<00:01:09.690> you<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.080> everything's

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
gonna be different you know everything's

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.600 
gonna be different you know everything's
gonna<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.770> different<00:01:10.920> even<00:01:11.250> though<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
gonna be different even though it's the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.820 
gonna be different even though it's the
same<00:01:11.850> exact<00:01:12.330> set<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.660> notes<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
same exact set of notes so you know this

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.919 
same exact set of notes so you know this
this<00:01:14.550> kind<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.789> stuff<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.119> keep<00:01:15.539> you<00:01:15.660> go<00:01:15.810> on

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
this kind of stuff can keep you go on

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.589 
this kind of stuff can keep you go on
forever<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> even<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> main

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:18.599 
forever and even I think one of the main

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.380 
forever and even I think one of the main
things<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.959> also<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.410> try<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.649> just<00:01:20.030> do<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
things is also to try and just do it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.230 
things is also to try and just do it
every<00:01:22.380> time<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.709> practice<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.149> spend<00:01:24.149> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
every time you practice just spend a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.550 
every time you practice just spend a
little<00:01:24.270> bit<00:01:24.539> of<00:01:24.630> time<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:25.110> even<00:01:25.319> if<00:01:25.440> it's

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
little bit of time on it even if it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
little bit of time on it even if it's
five<00:01:25.800> minutes<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:27.209> doing<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
five minutes you know by doing it on a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.960 
five minutes you know by doing it on a
constant<00:01:28.619> basis<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.160> it's<00:01:29.399> like<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.759> ears

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
constant basis it's it's like your ears

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
constant basis it's it's like your ears
start<00:01:30.179> to<00:01:30.500> acclimate<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> even<00:01:32.369> when

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
start to acclimate and and and even when

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.820 
start to acclimate and and and even when
you're<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.289> when<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.380> don't<00:01:34.530> physically

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
you're not when you don't physically

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.510 
you're not when you don't physically
have<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.149> guitar<00:01:36.149> in<00:01:36.330> your<00:01:36.479> hands<00:01:37.520> you're

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
have the guitar in your hands you're

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.770 
have the guitar in your hands you're
still<00:01:38.789> sort<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.149> thinking<00:01:39.479> about<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:41.630> ways<00:01:42.630> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
still sort of thinking about the ways of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.059 
still sort of thinking about the ways of
using<00:01:42.929> it<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.349> back<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.679> your<00:01:43.800> mind

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
using it in the back of your mind

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.190 
using it in the back of your mind
another<00:01:44.880> thing<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:45.330> try<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.660> keep<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.929> mind<00:01:45.959> is

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
another thing to try and keep in mind is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.330 
another thing to try and keep in mind is
to<00:01:46.349> kind<00:01:47.160> of<00:01:47.280> keep<00:01:48.590> keep<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:50.039> to<00:01:50.069> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
to kind of keep keep going back to it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
to kind of keep keep going back to it
you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.209> you<00:01:51.450> spend<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:51.899> time<00:01:52.110> on

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you know like if you spend some time on

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.660 
you know like if you spend some time on
this<00:01:52.319> every<00:01:52.590> time<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> practice<00:01:53.099> even<00:01:53.580> if

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
this every time you practice even if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.660 
this every time you practice even if
it's<00:01:53.819> just<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.869> five<00:01:55.229> minutes<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.250> whatever

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it's just for five minutes of whatever

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.790

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
walking around you're still kind of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.700

thoughts<00:02:28.410> those<00:02:28.740> those<00:02:29.070> are<00:02:29.220> two<00:02:29.400> big<00:02:29.580> things

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
thoughts those those are two big things

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.480 
thoughts those those are two big things
for<00:02:30.030> me<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.480> trying<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.410> make<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.650> very<00:02:31.770> small

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
for me just trying to make it very small

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.990 
for me just trying to make it very small
very<00:02:32.790> specific<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:35.280> having<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.760> be

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
very specific and and and having it be

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390 
very specific and and and having it be
sort<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.420> constant<00:02:36.750> thing<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:38.190> you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
sort of a constant thing that that you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.850 
sort of a constant thing that that you
work<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.940> until<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.900> naturally<00:02:40.440> becomes<00:02:40.740> a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
work on until it naturally becomes a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.170 
work on until it naturally becomes a
part<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.160> playing

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.850
