00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
goal air mini die grinder took it off

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.850 
goal air mini die grinder took it off
with<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:35.030> sanding<00:01:36.030> disk<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.170> polished<00:01:37.679> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
with a sanding disk and then polished it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.510 
with a sanding disk and then polished it
with<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> brass<00:01:39.060> wheel<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:41.310> about<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
with a brass wheel so we're about to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.770 
with a brass wheel so we're about to
pull<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.700> tape<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.030> find<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:42.360> how<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.569> looks

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.080 

so<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:49.020> make<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.610> base<00:01:50.610> paint<00:01:50.909> off

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so they don't make the base paint off

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:13.559 
so they don't make the base paint off
about<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:54.200> yeah<00:01:55.200> famous<00:01:55.679> last<00:01:55.740> words<00:01:56.420> Wow

so you want 1,300 of course I got the 16
right<00:02:17.409> here<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.739> haven't<00:02:17.889> done<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.189> part

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
right here but I haven't done this part

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.410 
right here but I haven't done this part
yet<00:02:18.579> another<00:02:18.939> part<00:02:19.239> for<00:02:19.359> another<00:02:19.540> day<00:02:21.420> all

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
yet another part for another day all

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.080 
yet another part for another day all
right<00:02:22.569> back<00:02:22.780> working<00:02:23.139> on<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> Swift<00:02:24.090> just

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
right back working on the Swift just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.239 
right back working on the Swift just
realize<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.780> panels<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.469> I<00:02:26.590> got<00:02:26.829> even

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
realize that the panels that I got even

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.349 
realize that the panels that I got even
though<00:02:27.400> they<00:02:27.579> said<00:02:27.819> they<00:02:27.939> would<00:02:28.060> fit<00:02:28.329> the

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
though they said they would fit the

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.099 
though they said they would fit the
Swift<00:02:28.749> do<00:02:28.989> not<00:02:29.139> fit<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:29.469> with<00:02:29.739> because<00:02:30.189> the

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
Swift do not fit this with because the

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.899 
Swift do not fit this with because the
body<00:02:32.109> kit<00:02:32.409> holds<00:02:32.739> do<00:02:32.889> not<00:02:33.040> line<00:02:33.250> up<00:02:33.280> so

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
body kit holds do not line up so

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.349 
body kit holds do not line up so
possibly<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.569> little<00:02:34.810> bit<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:36.359> custom

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
possibly a little bit of custom

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.800 
possibly a little bit of custom
machining<00:02:37.480> I'll<00:02:37.930> be<00:02:38.049> all<00:02:38.170> right<00:02:38.290> oh<00:02:38.500> yeah

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
machining I'll be all right oh yeah

after the headlight restoration before

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.140 
after the headlight restoration before
big<00:02:44.319> difference<00:02:44.499> but<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.609> big<00:02:45.730> thing<00:02:45.760> once

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the lighting there is a 30 degree space

free<00:03:15.669> something<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.180> don't<00:03:16.389> care<00:03:16.469> it's<00:03:17.469> late

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:19.259 
free something I don't care it's late

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.140 
free something I don't care it's late
basically<00:03:20.259> that<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:21.280> had<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.699> put<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:21.970> at<00:03:22.060> an

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
basically that I had to put it at an

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.629 
basically that I had to put it at an
angle<00:03:22.319> because<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.439> manifold<00:03:23.919> the<00:03:24.040> turbos<00:03:24.609> is

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
angle because the manifold the turbos is

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.699 
angle because the manifold the turbos is
big<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.840> was<00:03:26.019> hitting<00:03:26.290> up<00:03:26.379> against<00:03:26.620> the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
big so it was hitting up against the

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.140 
big so it was hitting up against the
motor<00:03:26.889> mount<00:03:27.129> so<00:03:27.310> i<00:03:27.340> had<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.549> space<00:03:27.759> it<00:03:27.790> off<00:03:28.030> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
motor mount so i had to space it off the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.439 
motor mount so i had to space it off the
block<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:29.169> how<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.680> notch<00:03:30.009> the<00:03:30.220> lower<00:03:31.030> support

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
block so how to notch the lower support

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:35.460 
block so how to notch the lower support
just<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:31.750> little<00:03:31.989> bit<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.919> get<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.220> outlet<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
just a little bit to get the outlet the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.899 
just a little bit to get the outlet the
wastegate<00:03:35.799> actuator<00:03:36.099> I<00:03:36.489> was<00:03:36.639> kind<00:03:36.819> of<00:03:36.849> nervous

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
wastegate actuator I was kind of nervous

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.689 
wastegate actuator I was kind of nervous
that<00:03:37.299> wouldn't<00:03:37.629> fit<00:03:37.780> with<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.109> bumper<00:03:38.439> but<00:03:39.220> it

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
that wouldn't fit with the bumper but it

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.550 
that wouldn't fit with the bumper but it
literally<00:03:40.209> did<00:03:40.659> I<00:03:40.689> mean<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:41.169> fits<00:03:41.470> right

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
literally did I mean it just fits right

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.460 
literally did I mean it just fits right
in<00:03:41.799> there<00:03:41.949> perfectly<00:03:42.099> so<00:03:43.109> don't<00:03:44.109> know<00:03:44.229> if<00:03:44.349> any

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
in there perfectly so don't know if any

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.589 
in there perfectly so don't know if any
other<00:03:44.620> Swift's<00:03:45.040> are<00:03:45.129> running<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.459> super<00:03:45.759> 60<00:03:46.150> is

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
other Swift's are running a super 60 is

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.749 
other Swift's are running a super 60 is
probably<00:03:47.229> overkill<00:03:47.769> as<00:03:48.009> I<00:03:48.340> keep<00:03:48.549> mentioning

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759 
probably overkill as I keep mentioning

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.229 
probably overkill as I keep mentioning
but<00:03:49.479> it<00:03:50.470> is<00:03:50.620> what<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.829> is<00:03:50.919> we'll<00:03:51.699> probably<00:03:51.879> have

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
but it is what it is we'll probably have

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.210 
but it is what it is we'll probably have
a<00:03:52.269> really<00:03:53.139> hot<00:03:53.290> little<00:03:53.500> car<00:03:53.739> when<00:03:53.889> this<00:03:53.979> is<00:03:54.099> all

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
a really hot little car when this is all

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.609 
a really hot little car when this is all
said<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.519> done
