installation guide and some information
I<00:01:57.020> think<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:58.490> let's<00:01:58.640> lift<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.119> out<00:01:59.380> and<00:02:00.380> as

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
I think so let's lift this out and as

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.569 
I think so let's lift this out and as
you<00:02:00.590> can<00:02:00.740> send<00:02:00.920> an<00:02:01.009> if<00:02:01.130> there<00:02:01.310> was<00:02:01.399> another

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
you can send an if there was another

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.609 
you can send an if there was another
piece<00:02:01.849> of<00:02:02.229> packaging<00:02:04.329> and<00:02:05.329> just<00:02:06.079> a<00:02:06.259> box<00:02:06.409> to

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
piece of packaging and just a box to

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.530 
piece of packaging and just a box to
elevation<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:09.250> let's<00:02:10.250> open<00:02:10.399> up<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.910> SSD

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
elevation so let's open up the SSD

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:23.170 
elevation so let's open up the SSD
itself<00:02:21.370> discharge<00:02:22.370> my<00:02:22.489> static<00:02:22.819> electricity

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
itself discharge my static electricity

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.750 
itself discharge my static electricity
just<00:02:23.450> opposite<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.319> little<00:02:24.680> stream<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
just opposite of a little stream the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.569 
just opposite of a little stream the
safe<00:02:25.970> side<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:29.629> comes<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:30.950> see<00:02:31.099> it's

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
safe side to comes as you can see it's

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.160 
safe side to comes as you can see it's
2.5<00:02:32.209> inches<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:33.319> very<00:02:33.530> light<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.900> went<00:02:36.019> in

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
2.5 inches it's very light so we went in

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.190 
2.5 inches it's very light so we went in
there<00:02:36.349> is<00:02:37.310> SATA<00:02:37.760> 6<00:02:38.150> divides<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> second

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
there is SATA 6 divides the second

I<00:02:41.450> was<00:02:41.810> crucial<00:02:42.290> for<00:02:42.319> sending<00:02:42.709> yourselves<00:02:43.160> and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
I was crucial for sending yourselves and
