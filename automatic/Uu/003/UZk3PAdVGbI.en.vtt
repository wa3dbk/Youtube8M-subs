00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.040
 you anytime and I will for mine 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.780
 system behind it and told her that for 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.029
 apply machine range can you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 Great fan of thalgo you can lead 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
 his mistakes correspond to the stars 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.000
 quietly doing well I think is the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.949
 bad is super cool and me for 2008 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.349
 a book yes it sounds a lot now but 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.320
 I get up one morning and that lasts 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.340
 15 minutes maximum and although I look 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.750
 me on it for the first time on 1 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 basic values that I want to stick to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.200
 be so nice neighbor patiently diligent 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.090
 I can do things properly on time 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.340
 do not hold now I have to the first 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.930
 reads the biography of the skin, therefore, 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.360
 I actually have the idea that he 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.370
 his list of his tours 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.719
 made and ticked off every case 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 whether he fulfilled it or not 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.730
 was not and that has many years of the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.390
 done away and everything can and the idea 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.489
 I thought it was cool 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.049
 Since then I have a list with 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.580
 my do not age around a miner 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.840
 act and every right I am every 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.760
 said tomorrow, I'll take a look 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.990
 I would have known grateful and 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.689
 be meat I'll be neat 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.820
 not hurt no I cultivate 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.729
 I'll just be punctual as well 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.330
 whatever that is all about eur 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.140
 are so likely on the car so 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.729
 just not senna 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 what's green that's right in the morning 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.420
 Maria agrees so then I write too 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.180
 what I do today would be much more important 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.460
 but do not want to do anything 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.409
 I am not possible the morning person 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.170
 Honestly, I really do get over it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.180
 The first 45 minutes can not be 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.430
 So I know I'll use it 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.770
 which my calendar serum think that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.640
 you have to do everything and then look 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 I'm okay you do what you do 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.380
 You did it because the more the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.460
 Whole reasons probably my goals 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.030
 are and why I want to do that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.200
 oh right right right so that I 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.240
 I also do this little task myself 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310
 full annoying hour period which I 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.820
 I do not mind but then only 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.890
 to lose 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.030
 the why and my big goal was what 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.100
 namely to reach a few years 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.450
 Do not bring your head 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.520
 small to higher brings me she thinks 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.910
 give them a bit more like that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.290
 two weeks not why it works 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.120
 pretty fast for five minutes 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.730
 which many get up or take mostly 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.690
 no longer to lead and write in the evening 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.770
 I of course once on what I have there 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.900
 did what went well what 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.920
 has gone wrong but had his 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.810
 this is about the system 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.890
 Of course I have what you day 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.810
 have made or after I write 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.830
 always many things on our writing 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.600
 I am grateful 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.400
 for which I am grateful today because I drive 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.910
 mostly around the five things as well as 15 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.900
 letter was five things that I ask 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.310
 speaks what should work better tomorrow 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.120
 and next day should run better 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.520
 5 did not learn and how today 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.840
 Well, so if you can do it properly 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.750
 you've always got a crappy day 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.580
 do something good for example 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.080
 I really got up or okay 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.220
 A lot has happened to me but I have that 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.170
 good straight straight again 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.030
 now came from behind procedures 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.520
 to be totally crap but i want to cum 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.660
 you you will always find a sign said 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.280
 So I collect these so collect 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.290
 answer and of course what I am there 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.530
 I've been doing so off now 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.320
 really oldschool diary because 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.420
 is what special wants to happen 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.370
 Of course I hold on somewhere 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.640
 many people user photos clear i have to 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.780
 also mode obviously year 2014 as 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.920
 very cool things once 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.270
 write down if you can somehow 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.150
 a few years back to back and 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.160
 that does not really happen 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.600
 completely forgotten 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.010
 christa mental film yes that makes for 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.320
 I like that, I 'm just there 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.880
 now are not big in his stuff 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.070
 achieve whatever goal that is 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.190
 i just fall for me as negro but 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.500
 I also say for certain things 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.020
 for example training or behavior or 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.370
 college or work or nutrition 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.960
 certain things I made 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.840
 I have not done so have 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.970
 where I have certain mistakes then 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.290
 example many of you are here because 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.150
 It better and it will be or say 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.100
 I also write her in every day 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.480
 meeting on what you do that and then 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.070
 Do you see that if you do that over a four 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.200
 Weeks off exactly how your mistakes are 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.800
 if I now have two weeks of inactivity 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.290
 In any case, and always to know 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.640
 again on what I did and then 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.109
 even the two weeks me all simple 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.880
 through readings always a thing 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.260
 see 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.550
 ok so seen a big mistake and 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.000
 I see that a lot can each 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.200
 area after 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.940
 You can do that too if you say okay 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.000
 i never want better touch now 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.380
 have a fuck on it I have today 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.650
 so learned and now I care 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.490
 I've learned so today 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.910
 and then you noticed after two 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.920
 weeks 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.570
 ok where it depends most with me 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.980
 stayed where it depends, however , something 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.390
 I enjoyed the most and am 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.890
 best people have this synthesis where you 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.180
 most fun fit where you best 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.560
 where most remain in hanging 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.400
 I've already said a video at 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.260
 its over not long and it does not overhear 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.960
 is fun because the fans here probably 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.030
 evening so and what to I was like 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.780
 It is cool and I really learn 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.150
 fun does so but if we it and says 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.650
 this text that you know by heart 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.260
 clearly I know do it that does not make 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.230
 have fun like Michael and not 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.550
 I say drunkenness allow years 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.720
 I get and I do not learn so much 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.610
 I have to train myself that is 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.320
 You could abo system on every euro 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.790
 I also apply fitness to my area 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.740
 if you go to the gym the kermi 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.900
 hourly schedule or no specific one 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.860
 goal in front of you or not really yours 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.300
 progress documents this phenomenon 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.530
 that people are kidding every year - and always 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.390
 also somehow the same exercises 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.330
 start after the same weight and me 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:42.780
 think it will not be an important one 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.700
 so then if systems well I hope 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.520
 sometimes together in the morning sometimes none 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.000
 Tomorrow what I am doing today to mine 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.040
 A tunnel drew in the evening says 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.660
 I would thank you picture the things around the 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.910
 I ask that he say so again 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.710
 a bit of my goals a few things 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.550
 which also went well and few 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.530
 things I learned 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.910
 you must necessarily take over the number 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.370
 of rain necessarily has five-part 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.040
 my then ten such some 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.470
 days off on some 1 not perfect 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.330
 and generally just what you did 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.620
 was good what could be wrong 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.950
 you concentrate on one area 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.860
 be it flirting training nutrition 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.510
 quarterly and if that a few weeks 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.330
 Eight you see exactly on weak points 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:30.120
 Can you then systematically be cool 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.410
 Colleague very easy even cool there 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.669
 i would say people what today 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.090
 make thumbs up or thumb down 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:38.090
 shows the video yes
