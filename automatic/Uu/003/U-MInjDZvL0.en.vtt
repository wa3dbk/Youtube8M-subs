here's the 1979 Zenith system three

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.509 
here's the 1979 Zenith system three
circuit<00:00:06.450> warning<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.319> removed<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.069> out<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
circuit warning I removed it out of the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.060 
circuit warning I removed it out of the
cabinet<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:10.110> notice<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:10.920> this

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
cabinet and I notice that on this

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.129 
cabinet and I notice that on this
electrolytic<00:00:11.790> capacitor<00:00:12.509> there<00:00:12.719> was<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> bad

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
electrolytic capacitor there was a bad

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.070 
electrolytic capacitor there was a bad
solder<00:00:13.590> joint<00:00:14.269> let's<00:00:15.269> take<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> look<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
solder joint let's take a look at the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.370 
solder joint let's take a look at the
bottom<00:00:16.289> side<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> circuit<00:00:17.310> board<00:00:18.380> here's

the bad solder joint at the capacitor

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
the bad solder joint at the capacitor
not<00:00:22.500> sure<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:23.010> caused<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.259 

looks<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.179> there<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.480> some<00:00:27.539> arcing<00:00:28.259> there

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
looks like there was some arcing there

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.089 
looks like there was some arcing there
may<00:00:30.269> end<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.599> needing<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.079> new<00:00:31.109> capacitor<00:00:31.980> but

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
may end up needing a new capacitor but

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
may end up needing a new capacitor but
I'm<00:00:32.189> gonna<00:00:32.309> go<00:00:32.460> ahead<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.759> try<00:00:33.059> resaw<00:00:33.600> during

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I'm gonna go ahead and try resaw during

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.100 
I'm gonna go ahead and try resaw during
this<00:00:34.079> old<00:00:34.379> and<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.070> it'll<00:00:35.340> work<00:00:35.989> I'm<00:00:36.989> gonna

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this old and see if it'll work I'm gonna

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.049 
this old and see if it'll work I'm gonna
check<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> board<00:00:37.949> for<00:00:38.250> other<00:00:38.399> bad<00:00:38.670> solder

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
check the board for other bad solder

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.959 
check the board for other bad solder
joints<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.719> maybe<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.199> flyback<00:00:40.969> for

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
joints like maybe at the flyback for

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.410 
joints like maybe at the flyback for
other<00:00:42.120> points<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.050> are<00:00:43.199> large

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
other points where there are large

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.639 
other points where there are large
components<00:00:45.420> heavy<00:00:45.629> components<00:00:46.199> or<00:00:46.320> things

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
components heavy components or things

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550

which<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.949> produce<00:00:47.190> heat

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.500 

I'm<00:00:50.980> gonna<00:00:51.190> restore<00:00:51.640> that<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.240> then<00:00:52.360> we'll

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
I'm gonna restore that and then we'll

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.680 
I'm gonna restore that and then we'll
see<00:00:52.750> how<00:00:52.960> that<00:00:53.230> works

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
see how that works

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.450 
see how that works
now<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.720> restore<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.680> connection<00:00:56.830> and<00:00:57.400> I

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.440 

well<00:02:14.710> I<00:02:14.740> think<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.250> fixed<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.210> have<00:02:16.390> a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
well I think that fixed it now have a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.100 
well I think that fixed it now have a
normal-sized<00:02:17.170> raster<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.190> no<00:02:18.340> hum<00:02:18.640> bars<00:02:19.110> on

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
normal-sized raster and no hum bars on

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.070 
normal-sized raster and no hum bars on
the<00:02:20.260> side<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.770> picture<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.870> just

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
the side of the picture so now I just

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.200 
the side of the picture so now I just
got<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.500> rewire<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.160> power<00:02:24.400> chloride<00:02:25.030> I'd

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
got a rewire of the power chloride I'd

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.490 
got a rewire of the power chloride I'd
have<00:02:25.300> hooked<00:02:25.480> up<00:02:25.570> with<00:02:25.720> an<00:02:25.840> alligator<00:02:26.290> clip

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
have hooked up with an alligator clip

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.940 
have hooked up with an alligator clip
cord<00:02:26.890> now<00:02:27.450> because<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.750> old<00:02:29.140> power<00:02:29.410> cord<00:02:29.830> had

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
cord now because the old power cord had

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.310 
cord now because the old power cord had
been<00:02:29.980> spliced<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.300> I'm<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.660> redo<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
been spliced so I'm going to redo the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.850 
been spliced so I'm going to redo the
splice<00:02:32.650> job<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:34.270> solder<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.440> use<00:02:35.620> heat

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
splice job and solder it and I use heat

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.839 
splice job and solder it and I use heat

shrink tubing on

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.520 
shrink tubing on
and<00:02:38.150> I'll<00:02:38.269> go<00:02:38.420> ahead<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.750> take<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.080> out<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
and I'll go ahead and take it out to the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.860 
and I'll go ahead and take it out to the
I<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.790> get<00:02:40.909> it<00:02:41.000> hooked<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.510> DTV

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
I can get it hooked up to the DTV

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.170 
I can get it hooked up to the DTV
inverter<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.010> check<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.370> actual<00:02:43.760> picture

now<00:02:47.140> I'm<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> use<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.920> degaussing<00:02:48.310> coil

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
now I'm going to use the degaussing coil

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.509 
now I'm going to use the degaussing coil
on<00:02:49.209> edge<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:50.379> seems<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.830> have<00:02:51.010> there's<00:02:51.430> a

little bit of a tenth of the picture
there<00:03:01.720> was<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.230> more<00:03:02.409> I<00:03:02.470> used<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.129> degausser

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
there was some more I used the degausser

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.550 
there was some more I used the degausser
earlier<00:03:04.150> I'm<00:03:04.750> going<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.930> go<00:03:05.049> ahead<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.410> give

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
earlier I'm going to go ahead and give

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.490 
earlier I'm going to go ahead and give
it<00:03:05.709> another<00:03:05.950> try<00:03:06.280> here<00:03:06.930> I'm<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.049> slowly

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
it another try here I'm just slowly

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:18.120 
it another try here I'm just slowly
moving<00:03:09.099> around<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.670> CRT

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.899 

what<00:03:31.409> you<00:03:31.560> need<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.860> do<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.159> to<00:03:32.340> remove<00:03:32.730> it

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
what you need to do is to remove it

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.000 
what you need to do is to remove it
slowly<00:03:33.180> because<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.140> magnetic<00:03:34.739> field

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
slowly because the magnetic field

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.940 
slowly because the magnetic field
penetrates<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.200> while<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.860> were

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
penetrates for a while and if you were

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.369 
penetrates for a while and if you were
to<00:03:38.129> if<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:39.000> were<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.180> shut<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.569> off<00:03:39.720> right<00:03:39.989> near

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
to if you were to shut it off right near

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.390 
to if you were to shut it off right near
it<00:03:40.590> you'd<00:03:41.430> end<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.790> with<00:03:41.849> a<00:03:42.030> magnetize<00:03:42.780> CRT<00:03:43.440> so

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
it you'd end up with a magnetize CRT so

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.880 
it you'd end up with a magnetize CRT so
you<00:03:44.459> have<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.819> move<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.269> least<00:03:46.230> four<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:46.680> five

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
you have to move it a least four or five

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.839 
you have to move it a least four or five
feet<00:03:47.129> away<00:03:47.280> before<00:03:47.610> shutting<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.269> off<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:50.459> now

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
feet away before shutting it off so now

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.699 
feet away before shutting it off so now
I'm<00:03:51.000> gonna<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.420> take<00:03:51.629> it<00:03:51.690> out<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.230> we'll<00:03:52.319> test

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
I'm gonna go take it out and we'll test

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.080 
I'm gonna go take it out and we'll test

turning<00:04:57.330> chain<00:04:57.539> because<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.289> gives<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:58.650> a

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
turning chain because that gives it a
