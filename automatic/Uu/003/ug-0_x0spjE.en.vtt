00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.970
 gift a simple but refined 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.580
 Shrimp variation considered 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.679
 Giant shrimp wild garlic in tempera 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.379
 dough is a healthy and above all delicious 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:17.520
 Fastfood creation and I have it here 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:21.010
 already lime I have the dish 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.960
 but that was really cool 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.000
 number that you delivered me 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.640

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.190

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.679

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.929
 Of course it is good for my mother 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:38.440

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:41.699
 my brother too and I have until twelve 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.859
 already started real with something like that 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.749
 tell me so now I have sesame oil 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.609
 roasted sesame oil taken because of that 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.039
 I think personally gives better gives one 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.920
 wonderful taste nice aroma and 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.909
 the whole thing for me now 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.629
 bit soy sauce and of course 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.999
 I have a few herbs 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.010
 because you can take what you actually 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.500
 I like to have you here 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.000
 I think she said fits nicely with 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.520
 take over and then comes into the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.530
 marinade you do not want that 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.020
 butterfly cut has said yes yet 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.830
 so exactly flat lying tail yes 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:23.140
 Exactly exactly how I give you that 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:26.520
 herbs easily into the cup you too 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 Everything can be in there for you 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 the shrimp enjoy a dip in the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.539
 sesame soy herbs marinade during york 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.310
 already prepared the garlic 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.299
 I've marinated this time and now 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.729
 Although you have already seen if you 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.490
 smell it now attracts beautiful 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.409
 slowly through and the oil is called what 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.960
 Now we need the temporary part 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.950
 okay okay i think it's a relationship 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.750
 about 1 to 2 finds tempora dough 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.819
 mainly in the Asian 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.640
 kitchen use it largely consists 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:09.450
 from rice flour salt and water and is in 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:12.390
 made a flick that looks great 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.120
 I think we dip our shrimp 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.739
 pure and you surely know the old one 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.519
 wooden spoon trick when the ins 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.440
 holds and bubbles all around rise 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.569
 then you know it's hot enough 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.370
 That's a good guide you can get 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.739
 start and now I have mine here 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.930
 shrimp I just nice in here 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.030
 The pond is a dark and important 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.069
 really that one strips off the jesus and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.620
 then i can do the jesu butterfly 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.359
 moderate rhine give me great for the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.459
 Maybe I would have some dough 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.400
 of course he said we tasted 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.950
 we do not need because the gambas the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.600
 have already your own spices 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.380
 garlic and everything and that's it 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.569
 again a tip where it works and 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.000
 then I have my personal name now 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.709
 also likes the garlic them to 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.600
 once through the dough and give it 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.359
 just fried with it so nice 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.850
 garlic yes that's really delicious that 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:14.099
 oil is really nice at the same time 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:16.019
 Arranged, we briefly summarize as 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.450
 First the shrimp to the tail in 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.160
 halve and then marinate briefly 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.470
 let it go and while doing so 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.269
 Stir tempura tycoon seasoned 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.950
 The marinated shrimp then loose 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.450
 pull through the dough and along with 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.370
 fry garlic 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.750
 with a little deco you have a quick one 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.750
 great snack conjured
