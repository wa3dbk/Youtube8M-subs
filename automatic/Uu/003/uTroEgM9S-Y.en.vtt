00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
only be used at certain levels so you

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.870 
only be used at certain levels so you

lower<00:03:37.090> level<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.600> chance<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:39.730> they<00:03:40.240> don't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
lower level and chance but they don't

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.940

have any deposit costs which is one of
the<00:03:42.100> big<00:03:42.280> things<00:03:42.490> I<00:03:42.700> look<00:03:42.820> for<00:03:42.880> in<00:03:43.330> making<00:03:44.050> gold

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
the big things I look for in making gold

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.440 
the big things I look for in making gold
at<00:03:44.710> lower<00:03:44.950> levels<00:03:45.370> things<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.210> aren't<00:03:46.360> going

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
at lower levels things that aren't going

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.350 
at lower levels things that aren't going
to<00:03:46.540> cost<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.020> money<00:03:47.230> up<00:03:47.410> front<00:03:47.770> to<00:03:48.130> list<00:03:48.430> which

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
to cost you money up front to list which

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.120 
to cost you money up front to list which
means<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.080> can<00:03:50.200> actually<00:03:50.500> sell<00:03:50.770> more<00:03:50.980> at

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
means you can actually sell more at

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.340 
means you can actually sell more at
lower<00:03:51.310> levels<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.000> also<00:03:52.870> you're<00:03:53.020> not<00:03:53.170> going

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
lower levels and also you're not going

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.890 
lower levels and also you're not going
to<00:03:53.410> lose<00:03:53.590> money<00:03:53.860> if<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:55.240> know<00:03:55.360> your<00:03:55.570> auction

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
to lose money if you know your auction

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.120 
to lose money if you know your auction
doesn't<00:03:56.200> sell<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.850> look<00:03:58.180> for<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> lot

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
