00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
135 but here's the situation here I

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.050 
135 but here's the situation here I
don't<00:02:13.319> think<00:02:13.379> he<00:02:13.680> touches<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> Richard<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.819> real

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
don't think he touches a Richard of real

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.559 
don't think he touches a Richard of real
fight<00:02:15.510> or<00:02:16.010> bar<00:02:17.010> Getty<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.700> that's<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
fight or bar Getty with that's just a

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.480 
fight or bar Getty with that's just a
step<00:02:18.840> backwards<00:02:19.500> i<00:02:19.590> believe

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
step backwards i believe

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.490 
step backwards i believe
I<00:02:20.580> think<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> baskets<00:02:22.230> fight<00:02:23.010> at<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:24.750> at<00:02:25.760> 135

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
I think the baskets fight at one at 135

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.390 
I think the baskets fight at one at 135
