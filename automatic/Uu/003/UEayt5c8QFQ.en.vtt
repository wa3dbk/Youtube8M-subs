00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.639
 carbohydrates are the basis of yours 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.050
 slimming 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.210
 I know it 's a statement that goes 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.370
 surely against the current may 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.460
 seem strange to you, but that's how it is 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.510
 works the first time I meet a 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.750
 customer 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.759
 I personally investigate his habits 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.279
 food making some questions well 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.710
 precise to understand what are his 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.009
 rules and in most cases 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.260
 there is a factor a rule we say that 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.260
 unites the vast majority of 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.550
 people or the terror for i 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.530
 carbohydrates 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.719
 yes because even though it may seem 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.300
 strange to all of us we give the rules 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.360
 from the point of view of food then 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 they become a habit and become like this 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.530
 an integral part of ours 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.420
 power supply without realizing it 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.500
 and I bet it's for you too 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.960
 exactly like that 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.660
 the problem is that not always these 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.359
 habits are correct and beneficial to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.160
 your health and I notice it from 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.500
 answers given to me when 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.830
 I ask some simple questions ad 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.930
 example the pasta you eat it and eat it 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.500
 during meals maybe together with 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.900
 vegetables the answer is usually little 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.140
 well but I try to avoid eating them 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.509
 as little as possible and even pasta avoids 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 to eat it every day all 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.829
 times I feel like doing this 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.509
 affirmation give this answer from the 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.700
 patient than in front 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.130
 I smile for the way he comes 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.310
 said as if we were talking about one 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.770
 illness to avoid the belief that 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.049
 doing so and not eating large bread 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.509
 you are doing the right thing e 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.840
 absolutely a lot of conviction 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.100
 very frequent and this training 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.479
 it is almost always done with 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.009
 customer satisfaction of the 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.619
 person in front of me 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.439
 in the series you saw how good I am 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.229
 don't eat bread and pasta if you want 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.350
 lose weight does not give dough bread pizza 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.100
 in short, it avoids all that derives from 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 carbohydrates are wrong and fundamental 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.490
 introduce carbohydrate tours 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.700
 day because it accelerates yours 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.860
 metabolism is the gasoline for your 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.300
 your body and your muscles 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.910
 it allows you to train intensely 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.460
 therefore to consume more calories when 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.950
 you train and therefore favor yours 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.410
 slimming is thought to eat 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.270
 carbohydrates make you fat but it is not 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.000
 absolutely so 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.470
 if taken in the right amount 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.070
 within a daily diet 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.170
 balanced tendencies are indispensable 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.130
 to replace carbohydrates with proteins 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.260
 then meat fish cheeses but 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.570
 it is absolutely not the same thing for 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.950
 journalism especially in terms of 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.840
 results 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.250
 also precisely because your body 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.230
 absolutely needs carbohydrates 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.020
 introducing only proteins anyway 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.630
 higher protein triggers gods 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.230
 mechanisms such as glycolysis 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.810
 to transform carbohydrate proteins with 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.330
 unpleasant consequences for example yes 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.430
 slows metabolism reduction 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.730
 of the main energy source for 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.640
 train yourself therefore resulting in fatigue 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.850
 and overload of some organs such as ad 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.739
 example the kidneys now without entering the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.020
 detail of the quantity of 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.360
 carbohydrates that you would like to introduce 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.230
 in the day you need to know that anyway 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.480
 about 50 percent of food 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.200
 then calories introduced during 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.630
 the day 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.940
 they must be of glucidic origin 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.410
 then the inter follow some simple ones 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.030
 rules 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.700
 eat pasta at least once a 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.300
 day however a right alternative 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.260
 then spelled rice barley corn pasta 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.410
 integral fairies 2 if you eat pasta lunch 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 you will not eat it in the evening or vice versa 3 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.450
 when eating vegetables always eat the 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.830
 bread or anyway an alternative like it 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.730
 for example crackers 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.110
 whole wheat bread rice cakes 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.160
 four in the snacks that later during 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.620
 the day 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.680
 you can eat a packet of Greek 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.030
 or rusks in order to 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.810
 further integrate the contribution of 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.050
 carbohydrates 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.660
 during the day then try to 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.110
 enter this correct habit in the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.170
 your food and you will see that you will hear 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.420
 certainly benefits especially also 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.250
 in terms of weight loss 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.320
 even for today it's all we feel 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.710
 early and good workout 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.710
