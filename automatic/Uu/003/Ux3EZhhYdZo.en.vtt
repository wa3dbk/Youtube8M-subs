cut the slot using a biscuit joint these

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.410 
cut the slot using a biscuit joint these
will<00:03:03.290> ensure<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.430> joint<00:03:04.730> stays<00:03:05.030> flush

with the connecting bolts the finished

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.319 
with the connecting bolts the finished
joint<00:03:16.459> should<00:03:17.269> be<00:03:17.420> virtually<00:03:18.139> invisible
