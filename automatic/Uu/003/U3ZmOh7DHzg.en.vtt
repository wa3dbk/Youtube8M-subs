hey guys how's it going um I've been
debating<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.510> long<00:00:03.780> time<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.319> should<00:00:04.620> do

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
debating a long time what I should do

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.210 
debating a long time what I should do
and<00:00:06.200> because<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.290> haven't<00:00:07.560> posted<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.890> video<00:00:08.010> in

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
and because I haven't posted a video in

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.560 
and because I haven't posted a video in
a<00:00:08.309> while<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.490> think<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.940> last<00:00:09.090> time<00:00:09.240> was<00:00:09.420> this

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
a while I think the last time was this

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.629 
a while I think the last time was this
summer<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.710> still<00:00:10.950> used<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.190> same<00:00:11.429> horse

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
summer and I still used the same horse

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.749 
summer and I still used the same horse
in<00:00:11.910> d<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.110> decided<00:00:13.320> since<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.429> Indy

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
in d and so I decided since I have Indy

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.670 
in d and so I decided since I have Indy
ash<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.120> something<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.199> green

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
ash to do something to do with green

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.689 
ash to do something to do with green

but things that if you just even do them
all<00:00:37.079> together<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:38.250> it'll<00:00:38.399> improve<00:00:38.850> your

doing this in a saddle with another
horse<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.840> demonstrating<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.439> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
horse I would be demonstrating all this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.310 
horse I would be demonstrating all this
in<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.860> saddle<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:09.030> she's<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.140> enough

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
in a saddle but she's just good enough

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.190 
in a saddle but she's just good enough
where<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.010> without<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.909> saddle<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
where I can do it without the saddle and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.570 
where I can do it without the saddle and
also<00:01:13.950> I'll<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> halter<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
also I'll be right here in a halter I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
also I'll be right here in a halter I
usually<00:01:17.580> when<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.330> training<00:01:18.570> voices<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> put

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
usually when I'm training voices I put

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.140 
usually when I'm training voices I put
them<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> hackmore<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.820> switched

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
them in a hackmore and then I switched

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.120 
them in a hackmore and then I switched
to<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> snap<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:22.110> after<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.590> 10<00:01:22.890> rides

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
to the snap a bit after about 10 rides

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
to the snap a bit after about 10 rides
but<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> am<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.170> writing<00:01:25.380> her<00:01:25.680> in

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but right now I am just writing her in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
but right now I am just writing her in
the<00:01:25.890> halter<00:01:26.450> because<00:01:27.450> I've<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.900> been<00:01:28.049> too

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the halter because I've just been too

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.200 
the halter because I've just been too
lazy<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.740> switcher<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> Snapple<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.939> will

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
lazy just switcher to the Snapple I will

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
lazy just switcher to the Snapple I will
switch<00:01:30.540> her<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.869> Snapple<00:01:31.320> cuz<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.560> believe<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
switch her to a Snapple cuz I believe I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
switch her to a Snapple cuz I believe I
gets<00:01:32.220> I'll<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> softer<00:01:33.750> response<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
gets I'll get a softer response out of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340 
gets I'll get a softer response out of
her<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.880> believe<00:01:36.150> snaefells<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
her because I believe snaefells just I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
her because I believe snaefells just I
know<00:01:37.829> they<00:01:38.189> connect<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> horse<00:01:39.210> better

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
know they connect to the horse better

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
know they connect to the horse better
and<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.840> feel<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.590> they'll<00:01:40.740> respond

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and they can feel it so they'll respond

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
and they can feel it so they'll respond
better<00:01:41.990> as<00:01:42.990> soon<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.649> pressure<00:01:44.930> so

how to do them I'll just demonstrate
them<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.570> number<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.439> flexing<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
them so number one is flexing and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.839 
them so number one is flexing and
disengaging<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.540> hindquarters<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.849> you're

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
disengaging the hindquarters so you're

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.460 
disengaging the hindquarters so you're
gonna<00:02:08.970> flex<00:02:09.270> their<00:02:09.509> head<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> disengage

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
gonna flex their head and disengage

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.360 
gonna flex their head and disengage
their<00:02:10.709> hindquarters<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.550> will

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.630 

okay

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
okay

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.240 
okay
and<00:02:15.909> so<00:02:16.420> flexing<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.079> lateral<00:02:17.500> flexing<00:02:18.099> and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
and so flexing this lateral flexing and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.449 
and so flexing this lateral flexing and
you<00:02:19.090> do<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.420> left<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:19.840> right<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.430> just

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you do it left and right and you just

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.410 
you do it left and right and you just
want<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.939> repeat<00:02:22.239> doing<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:24.159> horse

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
want to repeat doing that and the horse

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.199 
want to repeat doing that and the horse
should<00:02:25.420> move<00:02:25.780> off<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.769> super<00:02:27.489> little

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
should move off of like super little

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.809 
should move off of like super little
pressure<00:02:29.370> okay<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.939> that<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.450> helps<00:02:31.720> them

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
pressure okay and that just helps them

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.750 
pressure okay and that just helps them
get<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.879> better<00:02:33.970> Bend<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.609> become<00:02:36.609> more

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
get a better Bend and become more

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.849 
get a better Bend and become more
flexible<00:02:36.939> so<00:02:37.359> they're<00:02:37.540> softer<00:02:38.109> and<00:02:38.620> that's

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
flexible so they're softer and that's

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.339 
flexible so they're softer and that's
just<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.220> start<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.579> it<00:02:39.730> also<00:02:40.540> disengaging

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
just the start of it also disengaging

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.440 
just the start of it also disengaging
the<00:02:41.470> hindquarters<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.640> gets<00:02:43.030> them<00:02:43.299> moving

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
the hindquarters it gets them moving

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.180 
the hindquarters it gets them moving
their<00:02:43.750> back<00:02:43.930> end<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:44.440> you'll<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:44.980> you'll

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
their back end but you'll do is you'll

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.390 
their back end but you'll do is you'll
get<00:02:45.940> your<00:02:46.060> foot<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:47.170> will<00:02:47.379> move<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.220> back

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
get your foot and you will move it back

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.149 
get your foot and you will move it back
and<00:02:48.700> next<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.659> their<00:02:49.810> flank<00:02:50.170> while<00:02:50.799> their<00:02:50.980> head

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
and next to their flank while their head

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.940 
and next to their flank while their head
is<00:02:51.310> flexed<00:02:51.909> the<00:02:52.120> same<00:02:52.329> way<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.739> they

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
is flexed the same way and what they

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.710 
is flexed the same way and what they
want<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.310> do<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.639> they<00:02:54.790> want<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.090> pivot<00:02:55.389> their

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
want to do is they want to pivot their

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.349 
want to do is they want to pivot their
whole<00:02:55.959> their<00:02:56.920> pivot<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.459> their<00:02:57.849> front<00:02:58.090> foot

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
whole their pivot on their front foot

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.149 
whole their pivot on their front foot
and<00:02:58.629> that<00:02:58.780> front<00:02:59.109> pushes<00:02:59.409> they<00:02:59.590> planted<00:03:00.010> while

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
and that front pushes they planted while

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.649 
and that front pushes they planted while
their<00:03:00.310> whole<00:03:00.430> back<00:03:00.639> and<00:03:01.680> moves<00:03:02.680> around<00:03:02.889> it

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
their whole back and moves around it

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.899 
their whole back and moves around it
okay<00:03:04.659> and<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.620> just<00:03:05.920> loosens<00:03:06.310> them<00:03:06.459> up<00:03:06.670> and

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
okay and that just loosens them up and

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.069 
okay and that just loosens them up and
it<00:03:07.590> gets<00:03:08.590> them<00:03:09.599> listening<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:10.720> moving<00:03:10.959> their

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
it gets them listening and moving their

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.110 
it gets them listening and moving their
back<00:03:11.230> end<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.329> next<00:03:13.659> number<00:03:14.560> two<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:15.430> walk

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
back end and so next number two is walk

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.420 
back end and so next number two is walk
trot<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.780> lope<00:03:19.230> okay<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.680> want<00:03:21.280> your

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
trot and lope okay so you want your

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
because I don't want them to get sticky

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.430 
because I don't want them to get sticky
feet<00:03:33.669> I<00:03:33.790> want<00:03:34.000> them<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.209> know<00:03:34.449> that<00:03:34.480> writing<00:03:35.139> is

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
feet I want them to know that writing is

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.449 
feet I want them to know that writing is
that<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.739> walk<00:03:35.980> trot<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.280> lope<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:38.459> write

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
that a walk trot and lope so I write

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.330 
that a walk trot and lope so I write
them<00:03:39.699> at<00:03:39.940> those<00:03:40.180> gates<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.810> lot<00:03:41.139> that<00:03:41.650> out<00:03:41.799> elope

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
them at those gates a lot that out elope

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.339 
them at those gates a lot that out elope
I<00:03:42.370> will<00:03:42.699> lope<00:03:43.329> them<00:03:43.569> for<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.780> long<00:03:43.959> period<00:03:44.319> of

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
I will lope them for a long period of

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.939 
I will lope them for a long period of
time<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.889> they<00:03:45.239> get<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.419> idea<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.949> loping

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
time so they get the idea that loping

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.649 
time so they get the idea that loping
isn't<00:03:48.280> something<00:03:48.639> about<00:03:48.940> going<00:03:49.180> fast<00:03:49.389> they

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
isn't something about going fast they

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.210 
isn't something about going fast they
want<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.959> control<00:03:50.290> their<00:03:50.440> speed<00:03:50.709> because<00:03:51.099> they

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
want to control their speed because they

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.659 
want to control their speed because they
could<00:03:51.400> be<00:03:51.549> loping<00:03:51.940> for<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.239> long<00:03:52.449> while<00:03:53.669> okay

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
could be loping for a long while okay

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.729 
could be loping for a long while okay
and<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.870> just<00:03:56.079> helps<00:03:56.349> them<00:03:56.500> with<00:03:56.620> their

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
and that that just helps them with their

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.819 
and that that just helps them with their
control<00:03:57.250> speed<00:03:57.729> and<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.090> doesn't<00:03:58.409> get<00:03:59.409> them<00:03:59.650> to

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
control speed and it doesn't get them to

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.119 
control speed and it doesn't get them to
have<00:03:59.979> sticky<00:04:00.519> feet<00:04:02.970> okay<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.239> number<00:04:04.510> three

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
have sticky feet okay and number three

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.439 
have sticky feet okay and number three
is<00:04:06.129> while<00:04:06.579> you're<00:04:06.729> riding<00:04:06.879> them<00:04:07.120> bring<00:04:07.329> them

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
is while you're riding them bring them

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.020 
is while you're riding them bring them
around<00:04:07.690> random<00:04:08.049> objects<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.739> have<00:04:09.519> all<00:04:09.879> these

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
around random objects I have all these

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.589 
around random objects I have all these
random<00:04:10.239> stuff<00:04:10.690> set<00:04:11.049> up<00:04:11.079> in<00:04:11.349> my<00:04:11.530> arena<00:04:12.129> and<00:04:12.879> I

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
random stuff set up in my arena and I

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.920 
random stuff set up in my arena and I
will<00:04:13.810> trot<00:04:14.199> her<00:04:14.349> up<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.650> things<00:04:14.889> sit<00:04:15.459> back<00:04:15.930> look

when she gets a perfect Bend I mean till

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.210 
when she gets a perfect Bend I mean till
she<00:04:23.860> softens

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
she softens

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.820 
she softens
and<00:04:25.370> then<00:04:25.970> her<00:04:26.600> head<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.140> has<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> good<00:04:27.560> bed

and then her head and has a good bed

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.280 
and then her head and has a good bed
going<00:04:28.160> around<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:29.150> I'm<00:04:29.450> not<00:04:29.600> pulling<00:04:30.050> on<00:04:30.140> her

going around and I'm not pulling on her

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.680 
going around and I'm not pulling on her
head<00:04:30.470> trying<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.860> get<00:04:30.980> her<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.220> turn<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:32.480> she's

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
listening to me and then I'll stop and

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.080 
listening to me and then I'll stop and
let<00:04:35.240> her<00:04:35.330> go<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:36.530> drop<00:04:36.920> somewhere<00:04:37.700> else<00:04:37.850> and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
let her go and drop somewhere else and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.970 
let her go and drop somewhere else and
then<00:04:38.330> I'll<00:04:38.570> repeat<00:04:39.020> come<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.710> different

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
then I'll repeat come to different

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.210 
then I'll repeat come to different
objects<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:41.050> go<00:04:42.050> around<00:04:42.200> my<00:04:42.470> optics<00:04:42.890> with

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
objects it go around my optics with

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.070 
objects it go around my optics with
shooting<00:04:43.490> directions<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:44.630> object<00:04:44.990> I

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
shooting directions so one object I

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.690 
shooting directions so one object I
might<00:04:45.230> go<00:04:45.350> right<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.740> other<00:04:45.950> object<00:04:46.340> I'll<00:04:46.520> go

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
might go right the other object I'll go

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.570 
might go right the other object I'll go
left<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.780> I'll<00:04:48.290> do<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.770> same<00:04:48.950> thing<00:04:49.010> when<00:04:49.430> she

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
left and I'll do the same thing when she

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.040 
left and I'll do the same thing when she
softened<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.240> will<00:04:51.730> release<00:04:52.730> let<00:04:53.000> her<00:04:53.090> go<00:04:53.270> and

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
softened I will release let her go and

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.440 
softened I will release let her go and
that<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.740> helps<00:04:55.010> them<00:04:55.130> bend<00:04:55.670> their<00:04:55.910> body<00:04:56.150> and

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
that just helps them bend their body and

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.270 
that just helps them bend their body and
think<00:04:57.110> because<00:04:57.500> they<00:04:57.770> don't<00:04:57.980> know<00:04:58.100> when

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
think because they don't know when

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.620 
think because they don't know when
you're<00:04:58.370> gonna<00:04:58.430> stop<00:04:58.850> them<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.210> have<00:04:59.360> them<00:04:59.480> go

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
you're gonna stop them and have them go

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.750 
you're gonna stop them and have them go
around<00:04:59.870> another<00:05:00.140> object<00:05:00.410> so<00:05:01.370> they'll<00:05:01.580> think

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
around another object so they'll think

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.680 
around another object so they'll think
and<00:05:02.980> we'll<00:05:03.980> get<00:05:04.160> softer<00:05:04.580> in<00:05:04.670> the<00:05:04.790> head<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.210> it

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
and we'll get softer in the head and it

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.970 
and we'll get softer in the head and it
helps<00:05:05.900> them<00:05:05.990> bend<00:05:06.200> their<00:05:06.320> body<00:05:07.480> okay<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:09.560> so

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
helps them bend their body okay and so

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.180 
helps them bend their body okay and so
then<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.880> fourth<00:05:11.150> thing<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.690> when<00:05:12.440> stopping

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
then the fourth thing is when stopping

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.870 
then the fourth thing is when stopping
and<00:05:13.850> backing<00:05:14.270> up<00:05:14.390> so<00:05:14.720> stop<00:05:14.990> back<00:05:15.470> up<00:05:15.880> whenever

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
and backing up so stop back up whenever

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.020 
and backing up so stop back up whenever
I<00:05:17.000> stop<00:05:17.480> a<00:05:17.510> green<00:05:17.930> horse<00:05:18.200> I<00:05:18.530> will<00:05:19.430> back<00:05:19.700> them<00:05:19.910> up

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
I stop a green horse I will back them up

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.910 
I stop a green horse I will back them up
right<00:05:20.270> afterwards<00:05:20.630> because<00:05:21.110> that's<00:05:21.710> actually

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
right afterwards because that's actually

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.070 
right afterwards because that's actually
the<00:05:22.160> foundation<00:05:22.670> of<00:05:23.000> your<00:05:23.150> slide<00:05:23.420> stop<00:05:23.690> so

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
the foundation of your slide stop so

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.000 
the foundation of your slide stop so
just<00:05:24.770> be<00:05:24.920> riding<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.520> know<00:05:25.670> I<00:05:25.910> stop<00:05:26.770> sit<00:05:27.770> back

just be riding you know I stop sit back

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.300 
just be riding you know I stop sit back
and<00:05:28.450> back<00:05:29.450> them<00:05:29.660> up<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:30.500> they<00:05:30.890> have<00:05:31.010> to<00:05:31.130> back

and back them up and they have to back

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.860 
and back them up and they have to back
up<00:05:31.570> for<00:05:32.570> as<00:05:32.630> long<00:05:32.840> as<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:33.140> want<00:05:33.380> them<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.590> and
