 Hello and welcome to this new video blog gain-de-largent-grace-aux-paris-sportifs.fr 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.530
 In this new video, we will see together how to make a paid bet, so everything 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.580
 just a draw + a team refunded. Since I mentioned this in other 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.030
 videos, there are different sites or Facebook pages that are also 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.250
 this type of prognosis. Congratulations because it's really something that I 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.010
 recommend you do. I also received a lot of questions about 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.760
 this topic because I was told "yes, but I do not know about this or that bookmaker, 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.480
 I do not know what it's called. I will explain with a specific example 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.489
 and concrete how to achieve a draw + a team refunded on any 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.620
 which bookmaker, whether you are on bookmakers.co.uk or bookmakers.com. 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.079
 I film my screen and I explain all that. At once for you to understand 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.499
 a draw bet + a team refunded. Here's how to draw 

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:13.270
 + a team reimbursed. We will take two examples to illustrate my remarks. If you 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.709
 want to make this type of bets, be it on Bwin.fr, bookmakers ARJEL or bookmakers.com 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:28.569
 like Pinnacle, we'll see him together. Regarding Bwin.fr, there is the title of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 bet. If you want to draw + Manchester City refund for example, you go on 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.999
 the bet 1-2 bet refunded if the match ends with a home win in 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:48.999
 the regulation times, if there is a tie, you win a rating of 1.78 and if 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.719
 There is victory in Manchester City, you are refunded. 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:02:00.459
 If you do not have Bwin.fr, but you have Unibet.fr, Parionsweb, the bookmakers ARJEL 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.539
 or the bookmakers.com, here you see a small screenshot of the different 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.340
 bookmakers.com. I use Pinnacle, so I show you via Pinnacle. 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.980
 Manchester odds are 2.38 and the odds are 3.59. We take 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.980
 the example on a stake of 100 euros. 100 euros divided by 2.38, take the calculator, 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.890
 you make 100 euros divided by the Manchester City rating 2.38. You know that you 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.030
 must bet 42 euros and 1 centime to be refunded in case of Manchester victory 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.790
 City. You do not cash money, but you do not lose money, so you 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.250
 recover your bet as if you had not played. 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.290
 If there is a draw: we take the 100 euros, and we make 100 - 42.01 euros, that 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.410
 so is 57.99 euros. The 57.99 euros, you put the odds of 3.59. You do 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:12.470
 57.99 euros x 3.59, that's 208,18 euros gain less the 100 euros of stake, so 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.520
 the 42.01 euros and 57.99 euros, which equates to 108.18 euros in profits. 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.469
 So you know you have a final score of 2.08. It means that you have match 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:33.649
 unsold at 2.08 + Manchester City refunded where you get your bet. Of course, 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:40.299
 you lose the bet if Arsenal wins. That's how you can do a 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.310
 draw + a team reimbursed on any bookmaker, according to the bookmakers that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.959
 you have. I take a second example between Monaco and 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.969
 Lorient. I really advise you to play odds 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.889
 greater than 1.70. That's what I do if you join my private club Sportsbook 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.450
 or my Winning Betting Training, bet like a pro, you will have this type of odds if you 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.109
 copy one day my predictions. I also know that there are followers who 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:15.269
 like to play odds at 1.30, 1.40 or 1.50, and if so, I also invite you 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.760
 to do this technique. So I took the match between Monaco and Lorient. If you 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.570
 play draw + Monaco refunded, the odds are 1.33 on Bwin. By the way, you have 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.950
 could see the odds difference. We had on Bwin.co.uk 1.78 on Manchester City 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.540
 and 2.08 on Pinnacle, so 0.30 of difference. For a simple bet of 100 euros, you win 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.010
 30 euros more on Pinnacle, so we really see the huge difference in odds between 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.910
 bookmakers.fr and bookmakers.com. And there too, there is a capture concerning 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.430
 the bookmakers.com. Quickly, why do I evoke the idea 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.530
 to draw + a team refunded? If you do the opposite, if you say 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:12.450
 Monaco + match paid, you have a rating of 1.06 instead of 1.33. You know like 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.890
 me when the favorite does not win, it is very very common that he makes a match 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.920
 no one and he will lose very rarely. We take again the screenshot of Monaco. 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.170
 The odds are 1.40, the draw is 4.76, you can see the draw. Same, we take 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:38.210
 100 euros of stake. We divide by 1.40, it's a bet of 71.43 euros. do not hesitate 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.900
 not to take the calculator. You know that by betting 71.43 euros on this odds at 1.40, 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.190
 you will be refunded if there is victory of Monaco. 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.260
 If you make 100 euros minus 71.43 euros, you have 28.57 euros to put on the 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.800
 odds of the draw at 4.76, which equals 135.99 euros gain less than 100 euros 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:16.930
 (71.43 + 28.57), or 35.99 euros in profits. So it's almost a 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.890
 rated at 1.36. We see that the odds difference when they are small odds is 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.790
 Not huge, we have 1.33 on Bwin.fr and 1.36 on Pinnacle. 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.650
 I recommend you do what I just explained. I know there are 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.360
 sites on the net that now do this method because they joined my training 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.980
 Winning bettors, my private club Paris sports, so I invite you to do it. I received 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.380
 also a lot of questions about that. See that it's very simple. If you 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.950
 bet 5 euros, you do the same thing. 5 euros divided by the rating. If you have 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:57.230
 10 euros, or 15 euros, idem. No need to do Bac + 5 to establish this, because 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:05.260
 it is very simple. You may have noticed that it is very simple. In a few seconds, 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.010
 with a simple calculator, you can make a refunded bet. Now, do not forget 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:18.640
