00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 here we are back after the red tip 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.600
 I take a black tip and go to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 dirty the hairline on it 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.650
 lower lashes so just like if 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.970
 I don't want to comb my eyelashes 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.710
 don't even try it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.289
 this effect of slight definition 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.539
 in the inner rim of the eye I take the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.310
 sweet gabbana designer in color 9 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.669
 what a nice flesh-colored so we go to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.190
 light up the eye even if I tell you already 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.020
 you with what it costs I prefer others 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.960
 flesh-colored pencils that write a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.360
 little more he writes is because he is not 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 though I don't write, it's always a bit dry 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.309
 see how thousand cream the eye to make 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.020
 shopping 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.670
 so it imposes on us now we take the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 beautiful mascara with passion eyes in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.559
 indigo blue color and this curved if 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.680
 you want the review you find a little 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.899
 back in my videos and let's go to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.180
 applying plenty of it is a tonal black 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.939
 given it is not a bluff flash and therefore stands 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.590
 beautifully with this look because 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.540
 it just keeps right in the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.540
 speech neck explotion palette 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.750
 curving your eyelashes very well giving them 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.409
 however definition a little bit too 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.409
 in the lower lashes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.520
 now I take my sweet and gabbana 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.040
 browsing duo where we have inside the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.659
 land 15 and the land 30 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.060
 I do not want to do contouring want 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.070
 only a slightly warmed effect 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 of the complexion I take the 15 which is the most 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.470
 clear and use the technique as if i 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.740
 I made a contouring but not against and me 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.710
 I 'll put it all right to heat it all up 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.899
 cheekbone without getting to the point where then 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:02.180
 I will apply the illuminant with an effect 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.180
 really soft and without graphic lines 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.869
 the same is good for the attachment of the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.869
 hair 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.049
 nose chin and forehead and now the piece also 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.959
 nicer than the collection along with the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.610
 gym that is blush for you lovers 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.769
 blush girl give him good 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:46.260
 look at the raspberry color is from 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:50.310
 fear pecks true a geranium fuchsia 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.709
 super writing beautiful opaque raspberry 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:00.299
 and I'm going to apply it with small touches 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:02.069
 because it is very cold that he has us 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.530
 consider that I downloaded the brush 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.109
 on the hand so practically not there 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:15.810
 product and this is already the yield with the 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:17.629
 beautiful quarterback this one again 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.590
 even when you are just barely 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:25.950
 get tanned or put on the illuminant 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.040
 number 6 is repeated in the collection that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.579
 it is this is a very illuminating one 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.329
 particular because rather dark 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.769
 I'm going to apply in the upper part 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.660
 keeps this under typical warm tone 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.419
 of the whole look and I find that it is a lot 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.609
 suitable for this illuminating skin 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:51.470
 rather dark because I sometimes use it 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:54.359
 also right on the whole face lips 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.859
 I go with the lipstick I told you about 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.500
 which there is no number however a 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:03.859
 classic crane of this color is a news 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.859
 very nice I take off the conditioner 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.010
 after which to give definitions e 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.680
 contours and give him some more funds ta 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.710
 opening the pencil the sweet lip liner 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.710
 gabbana number 9 which is a pink brown 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.480
 private brown draw the outlines 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.480
 heating the corners over lipstick 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.700
 as you can see the effect is an outline 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.440
 soft but much more defined guys 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.090
