00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.010 
I guess square if you use in a ps3
controller<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> hold<00:02:02.700> e<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.719> use

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
limitations though as I mentioned a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.130 
limitations though as I mentioned a
little<00:02:46.739> bit<00:02:46.860> earlier<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.660> wanted<00:02:48.989> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
little bit earlier like if you wanted to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.400 
little bit earlier like if you wanted to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
pick this up you can at all because you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.740 
pick this up you can at all because you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.559 
would need actually you can't pick it up
at<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.049> because<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.560> can't<00:02:55.799> equip<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.370> if<00:02:57.239> you

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
at all because you can't equip it if you

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.680 
at all because you can't equip it if you
have<00:02:57.840> let's<00:02:58.380> say<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.650> class<00:02:59.160> mod<00:02:59.549> that's<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.510> the
