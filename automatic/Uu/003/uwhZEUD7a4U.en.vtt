to<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> pond<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> see<00:00:28.290> how<00:00:28.440> well

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
to look at the pond and see how well

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.970 
to look at the pond and see how well
it's<00:00:28.800> doing<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.340> year<00:00:29.610> for<00:00:29.820> 2013<00:00:30.690> in<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it's doing this year for 2013 in the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.800 
it's doing this year for 2013 in the
spring<00:00:32.310> we<00:00:32.520> went<00:00:32.820> ahead<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> drained<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
spring we went ahead and drained the

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.600 
spring we went ahead and drained the
pond<00:00:33.990> like<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.380> normally<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.190> cleaned<00:00:35.489> off

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
pond like we normally do and cleaned off

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.910 
pond like we normally do and cleaned off
all<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> old<00:00:36.510> debris<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.290> stuff<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.739> had

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
all the old debris and stuff that had

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.460 
all the old debris and stuff that had
accumulated<00:00:38.790> over<00:00:39.330> the<00:00:39.480> winter<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
accumulated over the winter with the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.380 
accumulated over the winter with the
leaves<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> had<00:00:41.070> fallen<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:42.120> went<00:00:42.330> ahead

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
leaves that had fallen in we went ahead

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
leaves that had fallen in we went ahead
and<00:00:42.660> did<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.380> we<00:00:43.500> were<00:00:43.650> again<00:00:44.160> seeing

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and did that then we were again seeing

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
and did that then we were again seeing
issues<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> algae<00:00:45.840> bloom<00:00:45.870> blooms

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
issues with the algae bloom blooms

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.799 
issues with the algae bloom blooms
throughout<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.400> summer<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.450> did<00:00:48.600> some

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
throughout the summer we did some

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.750 
throughout the summer we did some
investigation<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.430> found<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
investigation and we actually found a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
investigation and we actually found a
electronic<00:00:53.760> meter<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.230> release

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
electronic meter that's going to release

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.450 
electronic meter that's going to release
specific<00:00:55.800> metal<00:00:56.519> ions<00:00:57.000> into<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> water

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
specific metal ions into the water

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.640 
specific metal ions into the water
that's<00:00:59.460> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.269> kill<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.870> algae<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
that's going to kill the algae and

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.740 
that's going to kill the algae and
hopefully<00:01:02.400> benefit<00:01:02.970> and<00:01:03.150> keep<00:01:03.330> this<00:01:03.540> our

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
hopefully benefit and keep this our

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
hopefully benefit and keep this our
water<00:01:04.170> clean<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.949> we've<00:01:05.670> had<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.090> place

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
water clean it's we've had it in place

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
water clean it's we've had it in place
for<00:01:06.690> about<00:01:06.870> four<00:01:07.200> weeks<00:01:07.230> now<00:01:07.740> we're<00:01:08.400> seeing

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
for about four weeks now we're seeing

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.930 
for about four weeks now we're seeing
great<00:01:09.030> improvement<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.290> algae<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.070> was

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
great improvement on the algae that was

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.899 
great improvement on the algae that was
actually<00:01:12.659> already<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.580> there's<00:01:14.580> no

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
actually already in there there's no

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.930 
actually already in there there's no
algae<00:01:15.390> blooming<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.440> blooms<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.460> any<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
algae blooming on it blooms on any of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.020 
algae blooming on it blooms on any of
the<00:01:18.210> Falls<00:01:18.840> we're<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:20.040> excited<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
we can see the bottom again and we

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.719 
we can see the bottom again and we
haven't<00:01:23.790> had<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.149> remove<00:01:24.420> any<00:01:24.719> algae<00:01:25.229> blooms

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
haven't had to remove any algae blooms

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
haven't had to remove any algae blooms
huge<00:01:26.729> algae<00:01:27.149> blooms<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> past

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
