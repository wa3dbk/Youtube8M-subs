us work some of their gestures so you've
got<00:01:32.760> a<00:01:32.940> lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.210> gesture<00:01:33.690> information<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
got a lot of the gesture information to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.440 
got a lot of the gesture information to
do<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:34.950> handset<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.790> there's<00:01:36.270> some

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
do in this handset so there's some

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
do in this handset so there's some
thinking<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.720> device<00:01:37.080> called<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.560> view<00:01:37.800> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
thinking this device called a view so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
thinking this device called a view so
using<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.940> finger<00:01:39.300> we<00:01:39.420> introduced<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.080> air

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
using your finger we introduced the air

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740 
using your finger we introduced the air
view<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.710> note<00:01:41.070> 2<00:01:41.370> with<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.610> spm<00:01:42.090> with

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
view into the note 2 with the spm with

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.740 
view into the note 2 with the spm with
this<00:01:42.960> device<00:01:43.260> if<00:01:43.710> I've<00:01:44.010> got<00:01:44.250> say<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.640> example

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
this device if I've got say for example

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.390 
this device if I've got say for example
multiple<00:01:45.750> windows<00:01:46.440> open<00:01:46.920> or<00:01:47.040> multiple

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
multiple windows open or multiple

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.850 
multiple windows open or multiple
different<00:01:47.580> folders<00:01:48.150> using<00:01:48.960> my<00:01:49.110> air<00:01:49.350> view<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
different folders using my air view it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770 
different folders using my air view it
brings<00:01:50.160> up<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.430> body<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.880> every<00:01:51.450> single

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
brings up the body of every single

Turpin particular image to make an

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
Turpin particular image to make an
omelet<00:01:54.030> any<00:01:54.180> device<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.960> actually

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
omelet any device and I'm not actually

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
omelet any device and I'm not actually
touching<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.680> device<00:01:55.980> so<00:01:56.190> again<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.490> will

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
touching the device so again I will

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640 
touching the device so again I will
scroll<00:01:57.030> along<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:58.050> does<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> exact<00:01:58.620> same

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
scroll along and it does the exact same

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.430 
scroll along and it does the exact same
thing<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.760> I'm<00:02:00.030> into<00:02:00.480> a<00:02:00.510> an<00:02:00.990> image<00:02:01.260> and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
thing that if I'm into a an image and

thing that if I'm into a an image and
I'm<00:02:01.530> into<00:02:01.770> my<00:02:01.860> gallery<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.400> I'm<00:02:02.460> looking<00:02:02.820> at

I'm into my gallery and I'm looking at

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.160 
I'm into my gallery and I'm looking at
my<00:02:03.000> gallery<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.510> wanted<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> view

my gallery and I wanted to view
different<00:02:04.560> villages<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.310> would<00:02:05.940> use<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.090> air

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
different villages I would use my air

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.870 
different villages I would use my air
gesture<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.440> hover<00:02:07.680> over<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> sensor<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.790> the

top of the device and is scrolling

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.080 
top of the device and is scrolling
between<00:02:10.890> every<00:02:11.340> single<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:12.240> if<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.570> can<00:02:12.720> take

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090

touching<00:02:33.810> my<00:02:34.020> device<00:02:34.440> into<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.070> then<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.880> have

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
touching my device into and then we have

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.910 
touching my device into and then we have
something<00:02:36.450> that's<00:02:36.630> called<00:02:36.900> your<00:02:37.410> smart<00:02:37.709> score

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
something that's called your smart score

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
something that's called your smart score
but<00:02:38.070> with<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.430> with<00:02:38.910> tilting<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.450> well<00:02:39.660> now

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
but with your with tilting as well now

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.509 
but with your with tilting as well now
so<00:02:40.140> what<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.350> does<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.650> looks<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.340> my

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
so what it does is it looks for my

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.060 
so what it does is it looks for my
particular<00:02:41.820> eyes<00:02:42.150> as<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:43.140> found<00:02:43.380> my<00:02:43.620> eyes<00:02:43.830> on
