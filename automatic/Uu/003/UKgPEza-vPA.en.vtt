 we need you to beat someone one 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 the likelihood that we will win it 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.080
 much higher so let's choose 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.590
 start one of them 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.250
 for example which of them are they already throwing about 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.710
 something shorter for me an hour shorter too 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:28.189
 Trinid answer down somewhere they will score 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:55.860

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.630
 always think so mean what 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.509
 the bad thing is that a little bit because of ping 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.460
 like beating it down went away and no longer 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.920
 beating 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:22.300
 I don't have everything okay so here it is 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.300
 in this in the green mask so are we 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.060

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.680
 what it was of course not this I blame on 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.120
 really damn bad of them and writes 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.510
 okay guys we study 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.550

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.320
 we looked at the team 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.950
 here you see some server for help 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.110
 In my opinion 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.630
 Mainplex there was visible command immediately 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.620
 right on the shovel loomed here he 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:11.240
 nothing is written but therefore we are shorter 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:13.970
 sleep so well who is against us at least 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.000
 same as we were against us because 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.280
 what to lose 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.079

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.180
 kidnapped we will do ran under the bridge they 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.970
 on reached and stage run there I 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.320
 I think that they are under the bridge and it is easier from the bridge 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.170
 shoot oh well ok ok rolls and 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.970
 same tactic strategy some kind of military 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.090
 need to . somewhere higher hire and from there 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.870
 just shoot all the squirrels while I'm 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.310

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.260
