only<00:01:59.110> been<00:01:59.320> four<00:02:00.130> hundred<00:02:00.160> years<00:02:00.400> less<00:02:01.090> than

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
only been four hundred years less than

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.130 
only been four hundred years less than
so<00:02:01.740> things<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:03.790> changed<00:02:04.330> in<00:02:04.510> such<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.780> rapid

has a chance to see that and you know
you<00:02:22.540> look<00:02:22.660> at<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.930> other<00:02:23.140> blue<00:02:23.410> lines<00:02:23.680> out

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you look at the other blue lines out

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.860 
you look at the other blue lines out
there<00:02:24.070> that's<00:02:24.280> what<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.600> waterfront<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.720> used

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
there that's what the waterfront we used

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
there that's what the waterfront we used
to<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.739> we<00:02:27.010> didn't<00:02:27.190> have<00:02:27.280> all<00:02:27.520> these

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to be and we didn't have all these

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.040 
to be and we didn't have all these
buildings<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.510> forth<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:28.959> have

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
buildings and so forth it would have

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:38.229 
buildings and so forth it would have
been<00:02:29.110> underwater

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.229 

if<00:02:39.239> we<00:02:39.390> are<00:02:39.450> walking<00:02:39.689> along<00:02:39.930> here<00:02:41.209> 4,500<00:02:42.209> years

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
if we are walking along here 4,500 years

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.729 
if we are walking along here 4,500 years
ago<00:02:42.420> there<00:02:42.780> would<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.019> structure<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.530> this

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
ago there would be a structure like this

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.819 
ago there would be a structure like this
that<00:02:44.549> we<00:02:44.670> could<00:02:44.849> see<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.540> title<00:02:45.719> area<00:02:46.049> we

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
that we could see in the title area we

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.020 
that we could see in the title area we
wouldn't<00:02:47.099> be<00:02:47.159> grass<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.879> they'd

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
wouldn't be grass like this they'd

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.059 
wouldn't be grass like this they'd
actually<00:02:48.150> be<00:02:48.329> looking<00:02:48.659> out<00:02:48.810> over<00:02:48.989> here<00:02:49.500> at<00:02:49.859> the

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
actually be looking out over here at the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.449 
actually be looking out over here at the
ocean<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:50.969> this<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.359> fish<00:02:51.689> we're<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
ocean but this is a fish we're a

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.009 
ocean but this is a fish we're a
rebuilding<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.609> fish<00:02:53.790> we're<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.659> based

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
rebuilding of a fish we're that's based

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.890 
rebuilding of a fish we're that's based
on<00:02:55.430> some<00:02:56.430> structures<00:02:56.879> they<00:02:57.060> start<00:02:57.420> discover

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
on some structures they start discover

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.890 
on some structures they start discover
in<00:02:58.200> 1911<00:02:59.010> over<00:02:59.819> here<00:03:00.000> at<00:03:00.090> boylston<00:03:00.480> street<00:03:00.599> lee

in 1911 over here at boylston street lee

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.390 
in 1911 over here at boylston street lee
when<00:03:01.200> they<00:03:01.319> were<00:03:01.379> digging<00:03:01.709> for<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.040> subway

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
when they were digging for the subway

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.509 
when they were digging for the subway
and<00:03:02.609> they<00:03:03.359> were<00:03:03.420> down<00:03:03.859> 27<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:05.099> 40<00:03:05.340> feet<00:03:05.459> below

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
and they were down 27 to 40 feet below

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.250 
and they were down 27 to 40 feet below
the<00:03:05.849> surface<00:03:05.879> they<00:03:06.299> started<00:03:06.629> finding<00:03:06.959> wooden

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
the surface they started finding wooden

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.020 
the surface they started finding wooden
stakes<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.250> little<00:03:08.370> ones<00:03:08.609> like<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.909> but

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
stakes not the little ones like this but

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.580 
stakes not the little ones like this but
more<00:03:09.239> big<00:03:09.480> ones<00:03:09.659> maybe<00:03:09.959> an<00:03:10.169> inch<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.560> half

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
more big ones maybe an inch and a half

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.589 
more big ones maybe an inch and a half
two<00:03:11.040> inches<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.310> diameter<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.939> they<00:03:12.329> first

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
two inches in diameter and they first

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.300 
two inches in diameter and they first
started<00:03:12.840> finding<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.260> few<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.680> them<00:03:13.859> yeah<00:03:14.129> and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
started finding a few of them yeah and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.619 
started finding a few of them yeah and
they<00:03:14.430> found<00:03:14.579> tens<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.120> them<00:03:15.269> then<00:03:15.510> they

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
they found tens of them then they

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.300 
they found tens of them then they
started<00:03:15.900> finding<00:03:16.290> thousands<00:03:17.129> of<00:03:17.220> these

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
started finding thousands of these

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.399 
started finding thousands of these
wooden<00:03:17.609> sticks<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.359> they<00:03:18.930> were<00:03:18.989> thinking<00:03:19.319> you

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
wooden sticks and they were thinking you

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.780 
wooden sticks and they were thinking you
know<00:03:19.500> maybe<00:03:19.650> these<00:03:19.889> were<00:03:20.040> part<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.489> fence

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
know maybe these were part of a fence

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.479 
know maybe these were part of a fence
for<00:03:21.060> Native<00:03:21.900> Americans<00:03:22.439> or<00:03:22.980> something<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
for Native Americans or something and

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.640 
for Native Americans or something and
then<00:03:23.879> with<00:03:24.060> subsequent<00:03:24.750> archaeological<00:03:25.469> work

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
then with subsequent archaeological work

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.990 
then with subsequent archaeological work
they<00:03:25.829> started<00:03:26.189> to<00:03:26.250> understand<00:03:26.639> these<00:03:26.849> were

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
they started to understand these were

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.440 
they started to understand these were
part<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.810> seasonal<00:03:28.560> fishing<00:03:28.980> structure

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
part of a seasonal fishing structure

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.839 
part of a seasonal fishing structure
they<00:03:30.450> were<00:03:30.659> built<00:03:30.959> at<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:32.010> time<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.430> year<00:03:32.579> than

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
they were built at the time of year than

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.119 
they were built at the time of year than
the<00:03:32.939> Wampanoag<00:03:33.359> culture<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.439> fish<00:03:34.650> returned

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
the Wampanoag culture the fish returned

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.220 
the Wampanoag culture the fish returned
to<00:03:35.280> spawn<00:03:35.549> when<00:03:35.879> they<00:03:36.000> say<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.419> fishery

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
to spawn when they say the fishery

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.720 
to spawn when they say the fishery
turned<00:03:37.439> to<00:03:37.560> spawn<00:03:37.799> when<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.129> oak<00:03:38.250> leaf<00:03:38.549> is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
turned to spawn when the oak leaf is

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.330 
turned to spawn when the oak leaf is
about<00:03:38.939> as<00:03:39.090> big<00:03:39.299> as<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.540> mouse's<00:03:39.810> ear<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:41.159> if<00:03:41.250> you

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
about as big as a mouse's ear so if you

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.580 
about as big as a mouse's ear so if you
look<00:03:41.459> around<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.090> see<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.599> oakleys<00:03:43.349> just

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
look around and you see the oakleys just

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.619 
look around and you see the oakleys just
beginning<00:03:43.979> at<00:03:44.669> that<00:03:44.790> time<00:03:45.000> that's<00:03:45.269> when<00:03:45.479> the

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
beginning at that time that's when the

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.229 
beginning at that time that's when the
same<00:03:45.979> part<00:03:46.979> of<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.129> season<00:03:47.310> when<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.760> fish

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
same part of the season when the fish

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.610 
same part of the season when the fish
would<00:03:48.389> return<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.720> spawn<00:03:49.049> know<00:03:49.319> what<00:03:49.409> kind<00:03:49.560> of

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
would return to spawn know what kind of

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.289 
would return to spawn know what kind of
fish<00:03:49.799> are<00:03:49.889> we<00:03:49.979> talking<00:03:50.340> about<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.269> a

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
fish are we talking about you know is a

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.869 
fish are we talking about you know is a
small<00:03:52.260> things<00:03:52.530> similar<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.129> herring<00:03:53.609> or<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
small things similar to a herring or a

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.330 
small things similar to a herring or a
mummy<00:03:54.359> chod<00:03:54.689> or<00:03:55.169> kind<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:55.949> what<00:03:56.069> we<00:03:56.159> were<00:03:56.250> to

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
mummy chod or kind of what we were to

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.729 
mummy chod or kind of what we were to
think<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.579> as<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.699> bait<00:03:56.879> fish<00:03:57.150> now<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.930> they

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
think of as a bait fish now and they

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.129 
think of as a bait fish now and they
would<00:03:58.889> come<00:03:59.129> in<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.239> high<00:04:00.389> tide<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:01.019> they

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
would come in on the high tide and they

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.369 
would come in on the high tide and they
was<00:04:01.319> school<00:04:01.590> around<00:04:01.859> in<00:04:02.129> this<00:04:02.220> area<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.939> up

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
was school around in this area on the up

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.929 
was school around in this area on the up
this<00:04:04.379> sort<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.859> shore<00:04:05.220> side<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.729> the<00:04:05.790> fish

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
this sort of up shore side of the fish

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.210 
this sort of up shore side of the fish
we're<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.389> then<00:04:06.810> as<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.259> ocean<00:04:07.769> would<00:04:07.889> go<00:04:08.040> out

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
we're and then as the ocean would go out

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.610 
we're and then as the ocean would go out
the<00:04:08.669> water<00:04:08.939> would<00:04:09.150> filter<00:04:10.019> out<00:04:10.229> through<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the water would filter out through the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.349 
the water would filter out through the
structure<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.669> certain<00:04:11.909> number<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.180> fish

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
structure and a certain number of fish

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.819 
structure and a certain number of fish
were<00:04:12.509> left<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.900> wasn't<00:04:13.169> that<00:04:13.290> efficient<00:04:13.769> I

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
were left it wasn't that efficient I

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.289 
were left it wasn't that efficient I
mean<00:04:13.949> it<00:04:14.040> might<00:04:14.129> catch<00:04:14.430> ten<00:04:14.849> percent<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.239> the

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
mean it might catch ten percent of the

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.689 
mean it might catch ten percent of the
fish<00:04:15.449> that<00:04:15.659> were<00:04:15.750> schooling<00:04:16.109> around<00:04:16.349> but<00:04:17.159> for

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
fish that were schooling around but for

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.460 
fish that were schooling around but for
a<00:04:17.729> subsistence<00:04:18.239> culture<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:18.959> if<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.199> caught

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
a subsistence culture that if you caught

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.860 
a subsistence culture that if you caught
five<00:04:20.310> or<00:04:20.489> ten<00:04:20.639> percent<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.180> what<00:04:21.509> was<00:04:21.659> there

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
five or ten percent of what was there

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.080 
five or ten percent of what was there
that<00:04:22.079> was<00:04:22.139> enough<00:04:22.500> for<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.770> daily<00:04:23.159> catch<00:04:23.340> me<00:04:23.699> and

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
that was enough for a daily catch me and

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.629 
that was enough for a daily catch me and
the<00:04:24.870> thought<00:04:25.050> was<00:04:25.259> that<00:04:25.289> these<00:04:25.560> were<00:04:25.770> built<00:04:26.370> by

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
the thought was that these were built by

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.850 
the thought was that these were built by
family<00:04:27.240> groups<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:28.590> maybe<00:04:29.389> 35<00:04:30.389> 50<00:04:31.169> people<00:04:31.650> in<00:04:31.740> a

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
family groups so maybe 35 50 people in a

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.010 
family groups so maybe 35 50 people in a
family<00:04:32.190> plan<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.419> kids<00:04:33.659> the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
family plan it be the kids the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.970 
family plan it be the kids the
grandparents

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
grandparents

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.840 
grandparents
parents<00:04:36.980> everybody<00:04:37.310> would<00:04:37.490> be<00:04:37.520> sort<00:04:37.790> of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
parents everybody would be sort of

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.600 
parents everybody would be sort of
involved<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:38.540> making<00:04:39.170> this<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.830> they<00:04:40.490> would

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
involved in making this and they would

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.910 
involved in making this and they would
have<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.820> for<00:04:41.260> during<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.320> spawning<00:04:42.650> season

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
have it for during the spawning season

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.580 
have it for during the spawning season
so<00:04:43.280> most<00:04:43.550> of<00:04:43.760> may<00:04:44.060> into<00:04:44.600> june<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.110> then<00:04:45.500> they

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
so most of may into june and then they

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.840 
so most of may into june and then they
would<00:04:45.740> leave<00:04:45.920> it<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.190> then<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.520> next<00:04:46.640> year

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
would leave it and then the next year

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.030 
would leave it and then the next year
they<00:04:47.000> would<00:04:47.150> come<00:04:47.270> back<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.720> maintain<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.860> and

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
they would come back and maintain it and

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.850 
they would come back and maintain it and
from<00:04:50.030> what<00:04:50.150> we<00:04:50.300> know<00:04:50.510> over<00:04:50.990> here<00:04:51.290> in<00:04:51.410> back<00:04:51.590> bay
