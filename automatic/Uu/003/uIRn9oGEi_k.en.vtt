00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 he will stay with format like 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.570
 a pudding and or the shape is smeared and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.610
 It's sprinkled with flour, okay? Let's go. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.620

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:06.810
 two tablespoons butter 5 whole eggs 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.360
 800 ml of milk in or stop the milk is just 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.250
 separatist yesterday about 800 ml 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.640
 Here I am going to use the cheese curd 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.119
 but the use is optional of each 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 slap fi can use the grated type 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.020
 Parmesan 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.170
 does not work with cheese or use it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.939
 it works as white cheese, I've already 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.140
 What looks good would be the cheese 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.970
 rennet or small radio or parmesan're 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.890
 but this is optional is not required to 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.100
 put it's ok, let's start 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.100
 direct the milk here is the pain 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:05.460
 the eggs can put everything together at once 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:25.560
 people do not need and not a little bit 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:28.040
 bit in the flour and butter 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.040
 sugar 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:53.490
 Let's knock some people 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.100
 from 5 to 10 minutes that the more the 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.310
 people hit our pasta - that taste 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.710
 Egg will be as good and more I will 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.210
 start here and I'll edit this part 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.980
 here when I had beaten I come back 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.980
 for complete recipe 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:17.730
 I could about 56 minutes 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.280
 good, right? 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.170
 people to mine that I hit at speed 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.660
 5 more 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.480
 If you have one that only a two 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.760
 three position yours use the latter there 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.320
 because otherwise you can not beat the dough 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.320
 It's very heavy, is not it good? 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.940
 now let's add our shape 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:00.940
 And now I'm going to start the cheese cheese. 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.209
 Picture is like I said there is not 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:09.520
 need if you do not want you 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:11.920
 You can use ours only, I will too. 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.570
 can add if they have no cheese 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.139
 rennet can add Parmesan cheese 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:24.419
 the preheated oven at the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:27.580
 210 180 from the moment I started to 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.590
 prepare an obvious since the fire fire 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.370
 that is to say, what is going to happen to 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.660
 15 minutes is the temperature of 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.320
 already expects the ideal 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:48.070
 now I'm going to add to our aquino robot 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:50.919
 was going to bake for about 40 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.650
 minutes or less 50 minutes 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.229
 according to the strength of each one like me 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.410
 I usually rob a 50 minute 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.849
 I do not know what you said 'you will 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.099
 happen it will get browned 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:09.409
 Then you can take it off but I'm going 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:13.990
 show how the 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:17.929

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.360

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.479
