00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.560 
been wondering how you can actually get
access<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.400> some<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.330> may<00:03:09.450> have

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
access to this some of you may have

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.080 
access to this some of you may have
caught<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.200> fact<00:03:10.230> there<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.310> one<00:03:11.670> a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
caught on to the fact there is one a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.780 
caught on to the fact there is one a
youtube<00:03:12.570> link<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.830> screen<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.310> didn't<00:03:14.610> put

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
youtube link on the screen I didn't put

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.760 
youtube link on the screen I didn't put
that<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.510> was<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.870> guy<00:03:16.020> who<00:03:16.080> made<00:03:16.500> this

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
that in that was the guy who made this

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.340 
that in that was the guy who made this
kind<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.340> map<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.420> content<00:03:18.840> creator<00:03:19.110> map

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
kind of map it's a content creator map

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.890 
kind of map it's a content creator map
and<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:20.030> capture<00:03:21.030> job<00:03:21.240> I<00:03:21.390> believe<00:03:21.660> and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
and it's a capture job I believe and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.710 
and it's a capture job I believe and
basically<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.800> spawn<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.100> by<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> mouth<00:03:24.390> shop

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
basically you spawn in by the mouth shop

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.860 
basically you spawn in by the mouth shop
on<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> beach<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.700> you've<00:03:26.700> basically<00:03:27.360> spawn

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
on the beach and you've basically spawn

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.330 
on the beach and you've basically spawn
around<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.200> load<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.500> hydras<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.130> things

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
around a load of hydras and things

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.590 
around a load of hydras and things
actually<00:03:29.550> I'll<00:03:29.790> throw<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.180> clip<00:03:30.360> on<00:03:30.570> the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
actually I'll throw up a clip on the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.080 
actually I'll throw up a clip on the
screen<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.410> see<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:32.090> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
screen so you can see it and you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.720 
screen so you can see it and you
basically<00:03:33.270> go<00:03:33.660> off<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.230> fly<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.920> where<00:03:35.490> it<00:03:35.640> is

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
basically go off and fly to where it is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.400 
basically go off and fly to where it is
it's<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.270> same<00:03:36.450> place<00:03:36.720> as<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.990> was<00:03:37.020> in<00:03:37.320> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
it's in the same place as it was in the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.800 
it's in the same place as it was in the
campaign<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.130> believe<00:03:38.460> all<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.910> heist<00:03:39.420> mission

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.490 
campaign I believe all the heist mission
so<00:03:40.560> yeah<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.850> basically<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.780> and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
so yeah you you basically go to it and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.800 
so yeah you you basically go to it and
it's<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.130> there<00:03:44.490> so<00:03:44.790> that's<00:03:45.210> the<00:03:45.300> only<00:03:45.480> way

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
it's it's there so that's the only way

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.690 
it's it's there so that's the only way
you<00:03:46.410> can<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:46.740> currently<00:03:47.190> I'll<00:03:47.340> put<00:03:47.460> a<00:03:47.490> link

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
personally I don't see as much of an

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.930 
personally I don't see as much of an
issue<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:04.950> they<00:04:05.100> might<00:04:05.310> have<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.520> problem<00:04:05.850> with

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
issue but they might have a problem with

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.460 
issue but they might have a problem with
it<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.180> if<00:04:06.570> that's<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.870> case<00:04:07.080> they<00:04:07.320> will

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it and if that's the case they will

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.220 
it and if that's the case they will
remove<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.160> you'll<00:04:08.610> just<00:04:08.850> have<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.300> use

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
