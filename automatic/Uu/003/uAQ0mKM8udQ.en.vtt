00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 to cut out the foil you take on 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.859
 best a nice bright light what you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.330
 in the trunk behind it turns and 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.309
 so we can from the outside beautiful the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.370
 screen printing recognizes the border from where 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.070
 Cutting is important is taking 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 a cold light cold light means it 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.660
 looks like a halogen radiator 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 but equipped with energy-saving lamps 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 not hot when he is one 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 halogen lamp then take exists here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.060
 the danger that the interior that 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 something is burning stuff or 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.440
 fairing parts and that would be natural 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.879
 fatal for narrower sedans 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.320
 For example, you can do small kitchens 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.899
 land the one under the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.670
 Cabinets in the kitchen builds are 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.360
 quite flat and can be very good at 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.649
 Sedans in the back area 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.699
 push in to light the foil 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.289
 or the screen printing if you then 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.039
 necessarily cut for each 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.510
 slice take a new blade it is 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.949
 simply the danger of being too big that you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.359
 a scratch on the disk when 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.070
 you cut with the old blade because 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 Of course this blade will eventually 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.549
 stump more on glass cuts and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.020
 either you have a scratch in there 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.000
 the disk or the film is not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.770
 cut through and then you would have to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.119
 to cut the whole film again 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.090
 otherwise you can see the light 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 shift right left anyway 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.490
 open the hood a bit around that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.820
 better to see 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 that does not matter here in the combo 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.360
 is it really right you can see 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.970
 It all very well and can the lamps 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 have him standing in the spot 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.420
 is actually very good if it is so 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.130
 works because then you have to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.880
 knife when cutting not so often 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.159
 settle and can reasonably with 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.869
 few cut or in a few times 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.869
 cut off the foil cut 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.080
 is just about if you the rest 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.090
 then deduct from the film what you 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.540
 did not cut that off yet 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.650
 somewhere hangs and you maybe the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.690
 important part of the film 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.690
 damaged or a small crack 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.399
 Nice clean cuts are important 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.010
 clean cuts because of the customer 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.590
 Of course, they also see the foil from them 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 the edge and then louder then 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:24.200
 and corners are then cut in 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:27.350
 It does not look pretty, but it does 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.570
 with time simply with the exercise and 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.570
 then you can cut the foil nicely 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.129
 Look at the interior of your hand beforehand 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.840
 how much distance you have how much here 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.540
 can survive if you the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.900
 foil cuts there are vehicles that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.040
 it really only a millimeter to 2 mm 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.120
 can survive and you have to 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.849
 already know that you then 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.349
 have to cut as precisely as possible when 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.030
 you've cut the previous shape 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.010
 give them a piece of power 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.970
 a cut in the top and then you can 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:20.329
 you take it off slowly and now 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.190
 again, check the foil whether 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.950
 once again formed small noses 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.480
 then have to this easy again with 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.459
 to refill the hair dryer 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.099
 as I said the better the foil now 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.359
 is so easy is the nara im 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.359
 interior to install 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.580
 a corner comes off a bit 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.870
 when filling and then high then stands 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.940
 you can just do something again 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.530
 cleaning solution including spraying and 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.890
 This corner edge then holds it 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.260
 again 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.260
 then it is easy to lead too 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.340
 do not check this again anywhere 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.060
 you have blurred again too much 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.650
 or have cut off too little and then 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.350
 can you do the light again? 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.980
 Take out of the interior and 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.980
 turn off 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.100
 The film should be clean and smooth on the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.790
 then you are done 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.780
 and then you can do that 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.580
 Otherwise, I say 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.890
 Thank you so much I hope you have it

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:28.020
 more videos and I wish you much 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.020
 have fun trying for yourself 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.990
 To look clean makes the tire right 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.990
 what's up
