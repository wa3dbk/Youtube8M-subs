00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.710
 intel has declared during computex 2013 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.910
 that the next generation of handsets will be 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 Two in one 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.109
 the proposal is that the only 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.390
 can solve all your problems 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.820
 becoming a tablet for the moments 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 or a notebook for when you 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 to work 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.510
 however, we do not have to wait for 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 next generation to check this type of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
 novelty 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.690
 the current models available in the market 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.700
 even with simpler settings already 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.809
 able to meet this need for 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.890
 consumer 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.870
 is the case of lg slide pad 160 model 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.359
 which can be considered as input 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 within this category we test the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.559
 south car convertible notebook 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.580
 and the result of our analysis is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.580
 What you check now? 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.380
 the slide pad h 160 has little more than one 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.049
 What positively attracts attention 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.299
 if we analyze it as a tablet the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.340
 weight is above average but here 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.750
 We are talking about a convertible with 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.360
 keyboard included 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.149
 in this way the weight of the whole set 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 ends up becoming a pleasant surprise 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.530
 ideal to be taken to any 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.149
 In addition, the unit comes with a 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.479
 leather to protect it during 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.479
 transport 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.409
 slide-style design is not a 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.599
 novelty no invention of lg 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.149
 however it seems to be one of the 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.700
 more intelligent and logical ways of 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.220
 if you produce a product convertible to 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.189
 portable word applies with a lot of 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.409
 property to pay 160 and enjoyable 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.399
 the smooth transition of the product from 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.500
 notebook tablet 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.840
 the plastic construction design in the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.840
 white and gray colors also 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.880
 sober and elegant rubber tips 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.280
 wear at points where 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.799
 the back of the screen with the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.859
 top of keyboard 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.350
 the led display with the ips panel 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.600
 This guarantees good image quality. 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.400
 sufficient at least to reproduce the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.319
 resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels without 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.799
 no problem 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.569
 the response to the screen touches is accurate 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.909
 at times when there is some kind of 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.790
 delay or blocking, the fault lies 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.099
 exclusively on the software 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.069
 Brightness and brightness controls are 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.639
 even against the sun or against 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.829
 the light 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.599
 conditions of visibility do not 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.450
 to be desired at all 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.829
 the two speakers are positioned 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.500
 on the base of the appliance 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.209
 more precisely above the keyboard 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.280
 when in tablet mode they are 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.459
 covered so that the sound becomes 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.260
 makes it a little more stuffy 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.900
 however with the notebook mode device 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.540
 the positioning is appropriate 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.010
 the distinction between bass and treble is 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.469
 clean and crystal clear 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.379
 even with the volume at maximum levels there 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:27.469
 low distortion the battery life is 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.000
 another great trump card slide pad 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.849
 according to the information provided 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.069
 by the manufacturer the apparatus is capable of 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.269
 support up to 12 hours uninterrupted 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.699
 operation 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.500
 in our tests we could not 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.349
 reach that number but still 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.599
 we achieved excellent performance with the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.579
 Moderate use having Wi-Fi enabled 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.409
 accessing e-mails text editor and 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:58.489
 social networks it was possible to work 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:04:00.530
 for nine hours with the appliance 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.949
 slide function is certainly the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.569
 smart for the convertible model 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:08.209
 slide the screen to reveal the keyboard 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.939
 saves a lot of space and denotes a design 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.430
 modern in the meantime for this 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.139
 characteristic is actually efficient and 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.539
 I need to redouble my attention with 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:21.289
 finish and details 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.229
 in the case of slide pad h 160 the largest 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.360
 problem is due to the fittings 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.039
 when enclosed in tablet format they 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.870
 not very firm 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.259
 unless you force the two sides 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.210
 for the perfect fit a bad fit 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.400
 quite common in daytime driving 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.960
 the device can open the 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.110
 any time situation that 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.870
 we often face 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.760
 sold as a hybrid, it is natural that the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.400
 think that when you want to 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.010
 will be in front of a complete notebook 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.080
 however the lack of a touchpad or even 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.610
 a trackpad can be a disappointment to 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.640
 many people 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.430
 in fact the touch screen on most of the 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.130
 functions that would be natural to a mouse 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.900
 yet still in many moments 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.790
 You'll get the feeling that 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.770
 something was missing 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.080
 the impossibility of controlling certain 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.760
 functions from the keyboard as the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.310
 volume and brightness make it 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.020
 somewhat frustrating feature 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.120
 we were surprised with small 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.340
 treatments in activities that can be 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.500
 considered simple as extending the 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.850
 browser window or perform a 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.910
 full hd video 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.560
 in the first case the delay to extend 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.380
 manually a window can be 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.570
 the movement very clearly. 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.580
 browser simply does not 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.860
 finger touch speed 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.950
 already in the second case to watch a video 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.940
 in 1080p has become the pastime 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.780
 unpleasant because of the lack of 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.460
 fluidity 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.460
 even with the video already loaded 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.169
 without a doubt, the models 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.690
 hybrids came to stay 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.820
 in the coming months the Brazilian market 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.220
 must receive several other devices 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.660
 of the genre many of them with configurations 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.250
 but this characteristic 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.280
 definitely not the case of this lg 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.470
 160 pad slide a hybrid between tablet 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.780
 and notebook aimed at those who 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.520
 want to enter this segment more 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.470
 still are not willing to 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.260
 high prices that the products of the 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.389
 category must present here 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.229
 the device has intel atom c 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:31.229
 27 60 1.8 gigahertz 2 gb of memory 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.180
 ram and ssd 64gb 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.250
 the setting is more than enough 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.440
 for you to use the functions of a 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.210
 tablet but leaves a little to be desired 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.460
 when it comes to using your computer 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.100
 in notebook mode 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.139
 the absence of a trackpad or touchpad 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.330
 obliges the user to access some 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.760
 resources only via touch screen 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.729
 touch what makes the use experience 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.950
 incomplete notebook 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.110
 we are also frustrated to see a 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.419
 below average performance 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.479
 simple functions such as magnifying 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:05.430
 a browser window costing around 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.710
 two thousand and five hundred reais 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.740
 the model can be considered as input 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.510
 in category 2 in 1 that on one hand he 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.150
 is at an affordable price for the 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.150
 segment by another it leaves to be desired 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.949
 by offering little for its value 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.080
 clearly the one who invests in a 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.539
 product like this is paying for the 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.490
 mobility and the possibility of having 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.750
 two types of handsets in one 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.849
 you can
