00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.850
 hello welcome on coco tv 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.150
 today a ventirad is noted here 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.350
 the silver euros and tx2 at thermalright 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.720
 then 6 20 euros 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.940
 we have it here as we can 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.770
 to see that remains a very big template 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.489
 imposing especially that we have a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.379
 fan by 140 by 150 mm then at 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.360
 put the box aside and we're going 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.530
 linger a little bit on the glove 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.670
 that you could see there is one 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 second in fact it's simply 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.800
 bundled like that we do not let 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.840
 no fingerprints on the super 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 nicolaj black radiator on the other hand 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.090
 election - the hand she goes so far 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.979
 so the gloves are a bit small that's 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.660
 pity but the idea is good then but 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.979
 that aside the bundle for the rest is 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.170
 very classic and we will linger a 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.940
 little bit about the fan that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.330
 is red so we give up the colors 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.390
 usual brown and green mark 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.550
 we will say it was not very very pretty 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.640
 the red we'll say it's classic but 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.440
 this red to something special 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 they simply agree with 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.009
 asus rog colors so if you have a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.679
 asus rog motherboard 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.789
 we think in particular of the itx and well 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.440
 normally it goes 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.830
 perfectly with the red that there is on 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.630
 the map 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.720
 and that's an idea that's 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.119
 interesting marty of atr so 240 by 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.640
 150 mm understand our little plug 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.229
 to tell you it will turn to 2300 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 1300 rpm so a place that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.720
 wm that has been reviewed 300 it's going really low 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.009
 it should not make any noise at all 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.349
 if there is no noise at 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.330
 engine level 1300 rpm 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.330
 we know it's reasonable 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 the radiator here it is so they tmx 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.759
 we said it's still big here we find 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.989
 the cut that will follow the shape of the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.360
 fan and that helps not to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.890
 block the memory but more than the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.110
 memory we talk about ethics that means 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.540
 question but the radiator in this sense 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.060
 with a graphics card here the socket 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.959
 and there on an idx elections motherboard 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 a few close to the pci express 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.970
 normally it does not block and the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.950
 memory will be able to pass from this side to 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.959
 conditions at first sight to be sure of the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.500
 low profile or a bar with a 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:40.080
 classic radiator and not exuberance 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.530
 asus rog card so normally cards 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.080
 graphics possible here what is it and 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.940
 vrm here we remember that about 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.420
 cards asus on there is and x at least the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.580
 top of the line 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.230
 we have a feeding stage that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.209
 is reinstalled on a vertical map 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.250
 and the memory is going to be here since we 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.610
 we only have one fan 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.950
 was worth in the middle hop 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.140
 while normally on the server at 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.970
 classics that are extreme or not we 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.950
 have a second fan the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.870
 finish so we are on black 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.060
 nickeled it's very clean not big 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.340
 to say little hoods in 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.800
 plastic it changes but it goes rather 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.820
 well 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.360
 we now have if they can 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.130
 so small reduction at this level the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.700
 ceni q the blacks on the basis on the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.310
 heatpipes 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.930
 there is really nothing to say the test 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.510
 of course we will see if it goes on 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.970
 deserved cards x with pro socks 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.230
 specie express and on an asus in 7 77 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.910
 so with the small power card 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.400
 for the drm and we're going of course 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.220
 we test on the 980x with overclock 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.810
 tower clock we realize in all 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.880
 honesty that belly 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.269
 the radiator normally should pass 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.090
 the processor is a bit oversized 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.950
 since there is no 2011 of 13.66 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.890
 that we could put in italy so we 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.540
 will instead go on the a 47 70 case where a 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.130
 90 cases for example that will heat 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.360
 much less but it will allow us 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.420
 to push the radiator into its 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.700
 last entrenchments because after all 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.160
 it is beautiful why despite his name he 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.010
 would not go on a micro-atx motherboard 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.489
 wade x we ​​will see that very quickly good 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.489
 day to all
