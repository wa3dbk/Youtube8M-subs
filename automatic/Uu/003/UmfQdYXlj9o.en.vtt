now<00:00:40.079> first<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.890> all<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.610> few<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.210> tips

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
now first of all a few little tips

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.360 
now first of all a few little tips
before<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.320> actually<00:00:43.469> hop<00:00:43.710> into<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.129> major

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
before we actually hop into the major

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
before we actually hop into the major
one<00:00:45.350> number<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.530> would<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:47.840> sensitivity

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
one number one would be your sensitivity

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.330 
one number one would be your sensitivity
so<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.050> play<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:49.860> low<00:00:50.010> sensitivity

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so I play on a really low sensitivity

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.130 
so I play on a really low sensitivity
around<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.879> six<00:00:51.270> which<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
around a six which is like it's kind of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560 
around a six which is like it's kind of
a<00:00:52.230> medium<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.980> too<00:00:53.219> high<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:54.270> advanced

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
a medium not too high in advanced

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
a medium not too high in advanced
warfare<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:54.930> pretty<00:00:55.170> low<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.680> honest

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
warfare that's pretty low to be honest

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.869 
warfare that's pretty low to be honest
with<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> people<00:00:56.340> plant<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> very

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
with you a lot of people plant a very

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.360 
with you a lot of people plant a very
high<00:00:57.059> much<00:00:57.750> higher<00:00:57.780> sensitivity<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.100> our<00:00:59.190> plan

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
high much higher sensitivity so our plan

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.790 
high much higher sensitivity so our plan
on<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> sensitive<00:00:59.940> sensitivity<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> six<00:01:01.320> which

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
on a sensitive sensitivity of six which

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.889 
on a sensitive sensitivity of six which
gives<00:01:02.010> me<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> arm<00:01:02.460> ability<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.660> able<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
gives me the arm ability to be able to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.410 
gives me the arm ability to be able to
turn<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.199> enemies<00:01:04.680> still<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> also<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.390> able

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
turn on enemies still and also be able

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.410 
turn on enemies still and also be able
to<00:01:06.630> still<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.130> accuracy<00:01:08.580> downrange<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to still have that accuracy downrange I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
to still have that accuracy downrange I
don't<00:01:09.600> miss<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.140> shots<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.100> plant<00:01:11.610> accuracy

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
don't miss my shots so I plant accuracy

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.080 
don't miss my shots so I plant accuracy
sensitivity<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> six<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.439> see<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.650> guys<00:01:13.799> know

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
sensitivity of six you see you guys know

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
sensitivity of six you see you guys know
now<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> guys<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:16.560> snipers

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
now if you guys are more snipers

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.200 
now if you guys are more snipers
probably<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> high<00:01:17.549> sensitivity<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.150> be

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
probably a high sensitivity will be

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.630 
probably a high sensitivity will be
better<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.780> honest<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:20.280> as

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
better to be honest with you but as as

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
better to be honest with you but as as
you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.360> i<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.840> snipe<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.320> much

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you can see i don't really snipe as much

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679 
you can see i don't really snipe as much
i<00:01:22.860> normally<00:01:23.220> use<00:01:23.250> my<00:01:23.460> shot<00:01:23.700> rifle<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> um<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
i normally use my shot rifle and um a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
i normally use my shot rifle and um a
single<00:01:25.560> shot<00:01:25.680> weapon<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.790> why<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.000> like

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
single shot weapon so that's why i like

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.469 
single shot weapon so that's why i like
using<00:01:27.570> okay<00:01:27.960> medium<00:01:28.380> TR<00:01:28.770> sensitivity<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:30.090> tip

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
using okay medium TR sensitivity now tip

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.440 
using okay medium TR sensitivity now tip
number<00:01:30.720> two<00:01:31.520> would<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.000> set<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.270> obviously

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
number two would be to set up obviously

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
number two would be to set up obviously
your<00:01:33.750> class<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.290> more<00:01:34.439> accurate<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
your class to be more accurate so if you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640 
your class to be more accurate so if you
got<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.030> your<00:01:36.390> class<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.320> ability<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
got if your class has the ability of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340 
got if your class has the ability of
adding<00:01:37.979> grip<00:01:38.299> trust<00:01:39.299> me<00:01:39.450> put<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.079> happy

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
adding grip trust me put it on or happy

a quick little tip would be to warm up

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
a quick little tip would be to warm up
just<00:01:50.700> before<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.030> hop<00:01:51.180> into<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.450> game<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.960> what

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
just before you hop into a game so what

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.819 
just before you hop into a game so what
i<00:01:52.200> mean<00:01:52.380> by<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.680> hop<00:01:53.369> into<00:01:54.619> like<00:01:55.619> a

single-shot weapon and just try and
obviously<00:02:06.570> win<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> game<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.009> by

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
obviously win the game and it just be by

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.790 
obviously win the game and it just be by
yourself<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:09.020> uverse<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> bots<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.530> then

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
yourself so uverse the bots and then

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.260 
yourself so uverse the bots and then
they<00:02:11.310> say<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.520> get<00:02:11.700> more<00:02:11.790> accurate<00:02:12.120> because

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
they say you get more accurate because

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.910 
they say you get more accurate because
if<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.959> play<00:02:13.170> against<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.500> bots

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
if you play against the bots

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.990 
if you play against the bots
you<00:02:14.069> get<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.370> warmed<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.910> they've

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
you get you warmed up and they've

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.160 
you get you warmed up and they've
obvious<00:02:15.330> if<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> die<00:02:15.690> then<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:16.050> fine

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
obvious if you die then it's fine

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.360 
obvious if you die then it's fine
because<00:02:16.380> you're<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:16.800> online<00:02:17.040> so

different<00:03:08.580> with<00:03:08.819> Adam<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.620> reason<00:03:10.920> is

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
different with Adam and the reason is

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.890 
different with Adam and the reason is
because<00:03:11.640> if<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> look<00:03:12.209> at<00:03:12.360> controller<00:03:12.660> now

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
because if you look at controller now

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.620 
because if you look at controller now
the<00:03:13.739> movement<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.850> thumbsticks<00:03:15.239> now<00:03:15.360> are

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the movement on the thumbsticks now are

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.319 
the movement on the thumbsticks now are
very<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.620> very<00:03:16.709> limited<00:03:17.430> as<00:03:17.819> soon<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> go

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
very it's very limited as soon as you go

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.610 
very it's very limited as soon as you go
back<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> left<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.109> pretty<00:03:19.350> much<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
back to the left it's pretty much at the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.690 
back to the left it's pretty much at the
end<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.920> controller<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.430> there's<00:03:20.579> no

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
end of the controller so there's no

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.520 
end of the controller so there's no
really<00:03:21.000> no<00:03:21.420> real<00:03:21.630> movement<00:03:21.900> within<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
really no real movement within the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.460 
really no real movement within the
thumbsticks<00:03:22.920> well<00:03:23.130> adding<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:24.750> control

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
yup so you give me more precise down

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.470 
yup so you give me more precise down
range<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:34.350> instead<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.680> moving<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:36.329> whole

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
range so instead of moving the whole

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.640 
range so instead of moving the whole
thumb<00:03:36.750> stick<00:03:36.989> when<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.230> want<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.410> aim<00:03:37.500> at

thumb stick when you want to aim at

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.170 
thumb stick when you want to aim at
someone<00:03:37.950> when<00:03:38.130> using<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.549> sniper<00:03:38.790> down<00:03:38.940> range

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
someone when using a sniper down range

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.030 
someone when using a sniper down range
you<00:03:39.359> move<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.630> maybe<00:03:39.780> half<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.079> way<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.590> you

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
you move it maybe half the way and you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.580 
you move it maybe half the way and you
can<00:03:41.910> be<00:03:42.000> more<00:03:42.209> accurate<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.660> more<00:03:42.959> precise<00:03:43.320> so

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
can be more accurate and more precise so

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.979 
can be more accurate and more precise so
