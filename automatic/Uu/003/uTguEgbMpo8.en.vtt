doesn't<00:01:32.079> taste<00:01:32.349> too<00:01:32.469> good<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.099> mean<00:01:33.130> you

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
doesn't taste too good and I mean you

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.760 
doesn't taste too good and I mean you
know<00:01:33.609> it's<00:01:33.819> kind<00:01:34.029> of<00:01:34.119> hard<00:01:34.329> to<00:01:34.450> mask<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.740> taste

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
know it's kind of hard to mask the taste

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.589 
know it's kind of hard to mask the taste
of<00:01:36.279> of<00:01:36.490> Geo<00:01:36.880> PLC<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.359> agmatine<00:01:37.509> sulfate

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:37.599 
of of Geo PLC and agmatine sulfate

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.599 
of of Geo PLC and agmatine sulfate
anyway<00:01:38.499> so<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.679> wasn't<00:01:38.889> really<00:01:39.069> too<00:01:39.279> surprised

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
anyway so I wasn't really too surprised

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.219 
anyway so I wasn't really too surprised
with<00:01:39.759> that<00:01:39.880> but<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.179> doesn't<00:01:40.359> taste<00:01:40.599> good<00:01:40.869> but

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
with that but it doesn't taste good but

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.719 
with that but it doesn't taste good but
I<00:01:41.380> guess<00:01:41.529> if<00:01:41.679> you<00:01:41.799> mix<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.130> with<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.279> pre-workout

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
I guess if you mix it with a pre-workout

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.629 
I guess if you mix it with a pre-workout
it<00:01:43.119> tastes<00:01:43.479> decent<00:01:44.409> you'll<00:01:44.920> be<00:01:45.099> alright<00:01:45.279> but

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
it tastes decent you'll be alright but

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.370 
it tastes decent you'll be alright but
we<00:01:46.119> don't<00:01:46.240> really<00:01:46.329> care<00:01:46.450> about<00:01:46.569> taste<00:01:46.959> song<00:01:47.200> as

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
we don't really care about taste song as

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.819

we get results in terms of results man

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.419 
we get results in terms of results man
this<00:01:51.130> stuff<00:01:51.399> is<00:01:51.609> is<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.630> really<00:01:53.409> potent<00:01:54.099> nitric
