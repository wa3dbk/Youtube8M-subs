preview of xai 3.4 i'll be focusing on

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.940 
preview of xai 3.4 i'll be focusing on
the<00:00:21.599> battle<00:00:21.869> mechanics<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.439> how<00:00:22.560> well<00:00:22.770> the

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
the battle mechanics and how well the

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.460 
the battle mechanics and how well the
xai<00:00:23.279> uses<00:00:23.790> those<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.720> I've<00:00:24.869> done<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.170> is

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
xai uses those what I've done here is

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.170 
xai uses those what I've done here is
captured<00:00:25.920> some<00:00:26.070> in-game<00:00:26.310> footage<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.000> both

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
captured some in-game footage of both

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
captured some in-game footage of both
the<00:00:27.390> vanilla<00:00:27.869> AI<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.560> xai<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.699> quick

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the vanilla AI and xai for quick

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.600 
the vanilla AI and xai for quick
comparison<00:00:30.500> I'll<00:00:31.500> briefly<00:00:32.010> go<00:00:32.220> over<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
comparison I'll briefly go over the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
comparison I'll briefly go over the
vanilla<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:33.989> into<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.260> more<00:00:34.500> detailed

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
vanilla I then go into a more detailed

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
vanilla I then go into a more detailed
dissection<00:00:35.699> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> xai<00:00:36.590> let's<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.739> ahead<00:00:37.949> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
dissection of the xai let's go ahead and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
dissection of the xai let's go ahead and
get<00:00:38.160> started<00:00:38.370> I've<00:00:39.180> used<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.780> map<00:00:40.019> la<00:00:40.260> village

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
get started I've used the map la village

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.439 
get started I've used the map la village
for<00:00:40.830> both<00:00:41.010> battles<00:00:41.549> and<00:00:41.790> both<00:00:42.030> battles

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
for both battles and both battles

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.100 
for both battles and both battles
contain<00:00:42.809> very<00:00:43.049> similar<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.799> same<00:00:43.979> units

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
contain very similar or the same units

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.509 
contain very similar or the same units
okay<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.320> Union<00:00:46.589> placement<00:00:47.129> I've<00:00:47.220> gone<00:00:47.309> with

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
okay with Union placement I've gone with

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.180 
okay with Union placement I've gone with
a<00:00:47.549> very<00:00:47.820> basic<00:00:48.409> setup<00:00:49.409> here<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.650> mean<00:00:49.830> let's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
a very basic setup here I mean let's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
a very basic setup here I mean let's
face<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.549> the<00:00:50.640> vanilla<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.210> doesn't<00:00:51.540> wire<00:00:51.809> much

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
face it the vanilla I doesn't wire much

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.259 
face it the vanilla I doesn't wire much
in<00:00:52.290> that<00:00:52.320> department<00:00:53.089> basically<00:00:54.089> what's

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
in that department basically what's

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.939 
in that department basically what's
happening<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:54.930> both<00:00:55.140> armies<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.680> lining

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
happening here as both armies are lining

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.829 
happening here as both armies are lining
up<00:00:56.159> toe-to-toe<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.059> we're<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> shoot

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
up toe-to-toe and we're going to shoot

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.200 
up toe-to-toe and we're going to shoot
it<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.110> for<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> while<00:00:58.589> now<00:00:59.309> ultimately<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.089> AI

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it out for a while now ultimately the AI

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.509 
it out for a while now ultimately the AI
is<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> disadvantage<00:01:00.839> here<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:02.250> i<00:01:02.280> have

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
is at a disadvantage here because i have

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.690 
is at a disadvantage here because i have
three<00:01:02.790> archers<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.629> his<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.430> what

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
three archers to his to all in all what

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
three archers to his to all in all what
ends<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:05.970> happening<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.810> decimate<00:01:07.350> his

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
ends up happening is I decimate his

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.980 
ends up happening is I decimate his
military<00:01:07.770> force<00:01:08.400> by<00:01:08.909> two-thirds<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> size

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.140 
being now my Calvary is weaker than
theirs<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.280> have<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.489> keep<00:03:48.639> that<00:03:48.819> in<00:03:48.969> mind

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
theirs so I have to keep that in mind

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.179 
theirs so I have to keep that in mind
and<00:03:49.449> I<00:03:49.569> have<00:03:49.719> to<00:03:49.840> adjust<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.260> court<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:51.010> my

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
and I have to adjust the court on my

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.890 
and I have to adjust the court on my
right<00:03:51.459> flank<00:03:51.730> I've<00:03:52.000> decided<00:03:52.359> to<00:03:52.540> move<00:03:52.689> my

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
right flank I've decided to move my

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.379 
right flank I've decided to move my
spearmen<00:03:53.439> and<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.980> attack<00:03:54.310> his<00:03:54.549> Calvary<00:03:55.150> on

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
spearmen and to attack his Calvary on

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.599 
spearmen and to attack his Calvary on
the<00:03:55.569> right<00:03:55.750> flank<00:03:56.049> on<00:03:56.469> my<00:03:56.590> left<00:03:56.919> flank<00:03:57.189> I

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
the right flank on my left flank I

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.920 
the right flank on my left flank I
really<00:03:58.030> don't<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.389> option<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.840> using

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
really don't have the option of using

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.110 
really don't have the option of using
the<00:03:59.230> spearmen<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.219> I've<00:04:00.310> decided<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.819> take<00:04:00.939> my

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
the spearmen so I've decided to take my

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.300 
the spearmen so I've decided to take my
general<00:04:01.599> over<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.199> help<00:04:02.379> them<00:04:02.500> out

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
general over and help them out

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.100 
general over and help them out
now<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:03.849> point<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.330> battle<00:04:04.569> lines<00:04:04.750> are<00:04:04.900> just

now this point the battle lines are just

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.949 
now this point the battle lines are just
about<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.500> clash<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.370> lock<00:04:06.580> up<00:04:06.780> since<00:04:07.780> my
