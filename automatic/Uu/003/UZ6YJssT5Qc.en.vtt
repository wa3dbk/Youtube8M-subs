00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.260
 is the one that 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.730
 the memory 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.470
 for me 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.470
 kids here we are once again in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.240
 new video gamer kong art to comment 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.700
 the good thing in this new video of the 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.810
 panel sanz I bring the adults that I 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.920
 I use in about 120 there are not some at 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.350
 that already uses anna new videos but for 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.150
 the subject of which ends a laughing at 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.210
 Sociologists already finishing using them 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.030
 but I have I have some that are 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
 essential that good I use it a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 general for the visual theme not what it is 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.070
 the game's interface so it's done 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.229
 easier long to play good 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.479
 hard rock in the following for 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.710
 start we have the page the backlog is 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.899
 one is a blue for the bag or the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 what it does is that it opens all 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.910
 the bags that you have, you can have 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.460
 what is a better 80 or 100 a space 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.440
 what is going to tell you about all those spaces 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.780
 in a single bag of sardines when opening 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.660
 a giant bag with all things 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.700
 have the bags depending on the 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.530
 amount you have for example if 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.080
 you have a weapon in 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 in the last bag can be weapon 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.830
 you will get below the whole let's say 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.400
 the stage I like a lot is one of the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.980
 flavors that I need to always have in 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.500
 any pride 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.500
 in parliament I do not have to have it 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.020
 because none of that has to open a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.810
 bag or a column to look for something 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.550
 that I need because I do not prefer to do 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.420
 just one click and do it in 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.970
 a single bag because all is not something that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 we know it's simple and it does not make me any more 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.850
 easy when looking for things what 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.010
 that we have him going to lay four is a 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.050
 adult who completely changes the interface 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.270
 of the game you can put it as download 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.640
 the comb the truth that is pretty 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.560
 well it's knots although I like it more because 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.860
 you can modify the bars and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.180
 spells put them where quality from there 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.370
 you can do what you want with 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.220
 all against the bars with all the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.460
 wide to be able to put them where you want and the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.040
 truth that is quite a year 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.100
 The catheter matter is that it does not have a 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 album for the theme of mining and with 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.040
 that invades to tell you what it is 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.080
 measures 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.060
 on the map I think it also serves to 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.340
 other things but I'm not very informed 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.260
 because they are who already have that area 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.630
 a long time ago because I what is the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.880
 of the issue of mining what are the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.130
 professions of more than anything I do not use it 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.760
 as well as they left but I do not tell you 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.310
 who used it is worth the gel bottle hepburn 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.950
 is a is a pretty good for the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.010
 general since it helps a lot 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.200
 time to generate this this angle that 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.900
 does that on the screen 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.400
 with this memory with all the names 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.580
 of the people who are in the group or 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.349
 band not with just a click or if you 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.290
 you see that in one of them he has little life 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.280
 Now they are coming down with just one click 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.650
 he cures him be right since you all 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.360
 it houses the entry options and you put 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.310
 that by clicking left over 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.670
 of the name I take for example and 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.319
 top uninstall according or 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.299
 Right click to put the pomp 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.969
 things and not for example had to be 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.540
 is killing these vidiago 's 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.950
 left and asked for superior healing 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.620
 who are also going down by click 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.060
 right and I tell them the tip which 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.849
 feel they give the button or nothing 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.159
 right - click pop and has done so 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.950
 that the example is pretty good 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.659
 I have methods that now I stopped one 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.349
 but at the end of turned into the tank 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.389
 because to me in the pvp health - in focus 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.160
 and I'm not like god and I can not 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.720
 although, but it's good that you can 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.360
 you want that pretty in degrees in that for 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.210
 yes yes you are from heller 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.759

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.780
 adult since it is like a kind of 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.370

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.340

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.800
 give us a click and make us a great variety 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.720
 they do not know all the armors of the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.880
 version in which we are if we are 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.770
 25 points 4.2 than we are now 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.199
 same town goes out to the last set 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.180

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.770
 peak and seven milestone you will find it in

 this album is sometimes a search engine 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.120
 ie mushrooms you start looking you are 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.659
 He says this is the way I like him

 from the store or the weapon or whatever and you 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.000
 puts the location and where it drops where or 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.190
 that is to be able to be a boss can already 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.220
 being an elite can already be an issue or 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.130
 they directly block it in breeches 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.840
 this where it says where you can find 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.930

 here we will find figurations 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.650
 intouch and balls and such this one still does not 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.110
 whether or not it should be true 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.060
 the monk pretty good 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.480

 repurchase ps to see if I'm 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.590
 improving I'm getting worse not because I 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.780
 I give the example because changing a 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.080
 little by little they changed them will point in 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.940
