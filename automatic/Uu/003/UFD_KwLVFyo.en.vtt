00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
kind of want to make spirals and curves

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.899 
kind of want to make spirals and curves
and<00:00:55.040> but<00:00:56.040> at<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.790> of

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
and but at this one I'm kind of

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.170 
and but at this one I'm kind of
integrating<00:00:57.479> some<00:00:58.699> geometrical<00:00:59.699> pyramid

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
integrating some geometrical pyramid

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
integrating some geometrical pyramid
designs<00:01:00.659> and<00:01:01.080> triangular<00:01:01.650> designs<00:01:02.010> and

designs and triangular designs and
organic<00:01:03.089> shapes<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.940> kind<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:05.970> trying<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
organic shapes and kind of trying to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
organic shapes and kind of trying to
make<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.720> unified<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.370> some

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
make it all unified I think it's some

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.410 
make it all unified I think it's some
way<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> almost<00:01:09.120> looks<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.930> piece<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:11.420> all

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
