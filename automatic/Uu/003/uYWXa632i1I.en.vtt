case<00:00:05.700> from<00:00:05.910> 50<00:00:06.649> 360-degree<00:00:07.649> rotational<00:00:08.179> as

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
case from 50 360-degree rotational as

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.330 
case from 50 360-degree rotational as
you<00:00:09.269> can<00:00:09.389> see<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.960> case<00:00:10.230> has<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> strap<00:00:11.160> that

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
little hole right here on this side this

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.900 
little hole right here on this side this
you<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.650> match<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> device<00:00:23.609> in

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
can see the free 380 rotational easy to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
can see the free 380 rotational easy to
use<00:01:03.390> make<00:01:04.019> sure<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> don't<00:01:04.229> plug<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.070> it

pop<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.439> there's<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> plastic

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
pop it right back in there's a plastic

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390 
pop it right back in there's a plastic
ring<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.490> holds<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> together<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> AA

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
ring that holds it together the AA

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
ring that holds it together the AA
feature<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.240> fully<00:01:12.479> accessible<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.960> well<00:01:13.020> when

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
feature is fully accessible as well when

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
feature is fully accessible as well when
you<00:01:13.710> close<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.460> device<00:01:14.729> turns<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.150> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you close it the device turns off we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
you close it the device turns off we
open<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.720> again<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.259> device<00:01:16.409> will<00:01:16.680> turn<00:01:16.799> right

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
open up again the device will turn right

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.679 
open up again the device will turn right
back<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
back on

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.789 
back on
but<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.840> also<00:01:18.990> works<00:01:19.259> both<00:01:19.710> ways<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.799> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
but this also works both ways like so it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.080 
but this also works both ways like so it
turns<00:01:23.009> off<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.150> turns<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.799> Wow<00:01:26.090> alright

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
turns off and turns back on Wow alright

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690 
turns off and turns back on Wow alright
let's<00:01:27.330> view<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.170> standing<00:01:28.619> features<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.549> has

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
let's view the standing features it has

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.280 
let's view the standing features it has
two<00:01:29.970> grooves<00:01:30.180> right<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.840> sure<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> put

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
two grooves right here make sure you put

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.660 
two grooves right here make sure you put
the<00:01:31.409> bottom<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> device<00:01:31.979> wherever<00:01:32.520> you're

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the bottom of the device wherever you're

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.149 
the bottom of the device wherever you're
going<00:01:32.930> into<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> grooves<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.710> make<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> fully

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
going into the grooves to make it fully

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.770 
going into the grooves to make it fully
functional<00:01:35.990> like<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:38.030> free<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.150> hands<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
functional like so see free of hands you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.530 
functional like so see free of hands you
do<00:01:39.900> whatever<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.979> no<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.369> I'm<00:01:41.700> 360

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
do whatever you want in no time I'm 360

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.630 
do whatever you want in no time I'm 360
degree<00:01:42.750> rotation<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:44.070> way<00:01:44.189> wherever<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.579> turn

degree rotation that way wherever I turn
the<00:01:45.149> device<00:01:45.450> will<00:01:45.630> turn<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:46.020> me<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the device will turn with me and this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
the device will turn with me and this
will<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:47.579> work<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:48.000> portrait<00:01:48.420> form<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.960> just

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
will also work in portrait form you just
