this<00:00:06.240> ge<00:00:07.040> water<00:00:08.040> heater<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> gas<00:00:09.059> water

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
this ge water heater this is a gas water

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.900 
this ge water heater this is a gas water
heater<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.280> what<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.309> noticed<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> other<00:00:11.820> day

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
heater and what I noticed the other day

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.110 
heater and what I noticed the other day
is<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:13.019> I'm<00:00:13.230> getting<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.590> leak<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.280> it's

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
is that I'm getting a leak and it's

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.359 
is that I'm getting a leak and it's
coming<00:00:15.450> from<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.809> valve<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:16.770> traditionally

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
coming from the valve not traditionally

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.670 
coming from the valve not traditionally
where<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.670> would<00:00:17.910> come<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.410> typically<00:00:19.410> when

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
where it would come from typically when

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.439 
where it would come from typically when
your<00:00:19.830> valves<00:00:20.250> doing<00:00:20.550> its<00:00:20.699> job

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
your valves doing its job

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.750 
your valves doing its job
this<00:00:21.900> pipe<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.590> which<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.920> your<00:00:23.189> overflow

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
this pipe here which is your overflow

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.480 
this pipe here which is your overflow
pipe<00:00:24.140> you'd<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.289> water<00:00:25.619> leaking<00:00:26.010> out<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
pipe you'd have water leaking out of it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.450 
pipe you'd have water leaking out of it
what<00:00:27.240> you'll<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.980> actually

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
what you'll see here is it's actually

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.920 
what you'll see here is it's actually
coming<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.140> fitting<00:00:31.650> itself<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.809> we

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
coming from the fitting itself so if we

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.360 
coming from the fitting itself so if we
remove<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.440> bushing<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.730> little<00:00:36.329> fitting

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
remove this bushing a little fitting

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.260 
remove this bushing a little fitting
you'll<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:40.489> looks<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.790> don't<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:42.000> I'm

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you'll see looks like I don't know I'm

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.770 
you'll see looks like I don't know I'm
hoping<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.320> bad<00:00:44.280> city<00:00:44.879> bad<00:00:45.270> fitting

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
hoping it's just a bad city bad fitting

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
hoping it's just a bad city bad fitting
in<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> by<00:00:47.309> replacing<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.969> maybe<00:00:48.210> I'll

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
in there so by replacing it maybe I'll

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.090 
in there so by replacing it maybe I'll
take<00:00:48.600> care<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.350> save<00:00:49.649> me<00:00:49.800> having<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
take care of it and save me having to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.450 
take care of it and save me having to
buy<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> whole<00:00:50.610> new<00:00:50.640> water<00:00:51.180> heater<00:00:52.100> okay<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
buy a whole new water heater okay so the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
buy a whole new water heater okay so the
first<00:00:53.610> thing<00:00:53.760> we're<00:00:53.969> gonna<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> shut<00:00:55.140> off

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
first thing we're gonna do is shut off

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.799 
the intake of water which will be up
here<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> cold<00:01:00.090> water<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.480> comes

shut off gas to the unit now our next

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
shut off gas to the unit now our next
step<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> drain<00:01:41.430> some<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
step is gonna be to drain some of the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.020 
step is gonna be to drain some of the
water<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.840> we've<00:01:42.990> got<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
water out here what we've got to do is

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
make sure the water level is below blow

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.520 
make sure the water level is below blow
this<00:01:48.270> pot<00:01:48.479> right<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:48.930> because<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.380> take

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this pot right here because when we take
