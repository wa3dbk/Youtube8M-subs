I'm going to hold the top thread I'm

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.989 
I'm going to hold the top thread I'm
just<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> grab<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:32.369> bottom<00:01:32.789> loop

running the risk of cutting a hole in

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.969 
running the risk of cutting a hole in
the<00:01:42.420> fabric<00:01:42.569> which<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:43.259> sure<00:01:43.469> everyone<00:01:43.859> has

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the fabric which I'm sure everyone has

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.860 
the fabric which I'm sure everyone has
done<00:01:44.159> before<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.639> just<00:01:47.850> clip<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> loop

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.260 

and<00:01:52.440> just<00:01:52.650> keep<00:01:52.770> pulling<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.940> makes<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and just keep pulling it it makes it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.190 
and just keep pulling it it makes it
really<00:01:54.600> easy<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.410> clean<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.750> cut<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
really easy and really clean to cut that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.700 
really easy and really clean to cut that
off<00:01:59.600> of<00:02:00.600> course<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> other<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.530> was

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
off of course the other way that I was

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.880 
off of course the other way that I was
just<00:02:01.860> talking<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:03.530> putting<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.740> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
just talking about is putting it in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.110 
just talking about is putting it in
between<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:08.340> scene<00:02:09.860> with<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.890> red<00:02:11.220> ball<00:02:11.760> down

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.160 
between the scene with the red ball down
and<00:02:13.100> then<00:02:14.100> running<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.180> holding<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> back

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and then running it and holding the back

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.710 
and then running it and holding the back
side<00:02:16.440> running<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.570> run

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
side running it like this but you do run

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.750 
side running it like this but you do run
the<00:02:18.780> risk<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.320> cutting<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:20.070> fabric<00:02:20.580> and
