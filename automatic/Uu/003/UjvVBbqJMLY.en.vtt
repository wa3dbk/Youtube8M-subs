lucky<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.070> match<00:02:35.660> even<00:02:36.660> though<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
lucky in this match even though the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.110 
lucky in this match even though the
hydro<00:02:37.380> pump<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.950> gengar<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:38.670> I'm<00:02:38.910> guessing

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
hydro pump is on gengar but I'm guessing

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.090 
hydro pump is on gengar but I'm guessing
my<00:02:39.360> focus<00:02:39.690> was<00:02:39.840> sated<00:02:40.290> makes<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
my focus was sated makes up for it I

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.880 
my focus was sated makes up for it I
guess<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.660> gonna<00:02:42.900> bring<00:02:43.080> his<00:02:43.350> scizor

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
guess that is gonna bring his scizor

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.430 
guess that is gonna bring his scizor
again<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.730> I'm<00:02:45.300> gonna<00:02:45.450> switch<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.410> I
