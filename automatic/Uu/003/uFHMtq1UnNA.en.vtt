classic<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.039> rig<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
classic this rig is not good to have it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.220 
classic this rig is not good to have it
up<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.739> thin<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> FIP

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
up here because it's a very thin the FIP

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
up here because it's a very thin the FIP
is<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.620> thin<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> material<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.460> very<00:00:53.610> thin

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
is very thin the material is very thin

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
is very thin the material is very thin
so<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.329> how<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> whole<00:00:54.719> thing<00:00:54.750> moves

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so you can see how the whole thing moves

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.939 
so you can see how the whole thing moves
but<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> works<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.199> better

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949

these<00:01:04.860> were<00:01:05.100> dialed<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.939> design

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
these were dialed in on this design

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.030 
these were dialed in on this design
would<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.140> design<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.680> making<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
would like to design we're making them a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560 
would like to design we're making them a
little<00:01:08.189> shorter<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.760> though<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> leave<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
little hole on the bottom so you can

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
little hole on the bottom so you can
rinse<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.430> mud<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.790> stuff<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.840> now<00:01:13.020> I'm

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
rinse the mud and stuff out but now I'm
including<00:01:13.650> two<00:01:13.830> feet<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> paracord<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
including two feet of paracord so you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
including two feet of paracord so you
can<00:01:15.479> tie<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.979> I've

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
can tie it down like I have it here I've

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
can tie it down like I have it here I've
got<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.729> back<00:01:17.970> end<00:01:18.240> tied<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:18.990> vest

got this back end tied down to my vest

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
got this back end tied down to my vest
so<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> doesn't<00:01:20.369> flop<00:01:20.549> around<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:21.509> got<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
so it doesn't flop around they got a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
small as possible that way once you

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.689 
small as possible that way once you
deploy<00:04:09.259> your<00:04:09.379> flash<00:04:09.769> bang<00:04:10.099> this<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.489> going<00:04:10.639> to

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
deploy your flash bang this is going to

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.009 
deploy your flash bang this is going to
be<00:04:10.790> empty<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.359> don't<00:04:11.509> want<00:04:11.659> these<00:04:11.750> big

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019

pieces to get snagged up on I think it's

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.390 
pieces to get snagged up on I think it's
a<00:04:14.750> very<00:04:14.840> superior<00:04:15.229> design<00:04:15.500> again<00:04:16.009> it's<00:04:16.159> using

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
a very superior design again it's using

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.699 
a very superior design again it's using
the<00:04:16.430> taxable<00:04:17.180> Taylor<00:04:17.419> malice<00:04:17.870> clip<00:04:18.139> and<00:04:18.380> this
