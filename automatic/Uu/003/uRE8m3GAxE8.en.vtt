average is kind of stayed around 300 and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730 
average is kind of stayed around 300 and
290<00:00:12.269> that's<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.960> decent<00:00:13.110> average<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.650> my

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
290 that's a decent average in my

290 that's a decent average in my
opinion<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.099> think<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.460> can<00:00:14.519> definitely

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
opinion I think that I can definitely

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.140 
opinion I think that I can definitely
use<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:16.460> convince<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> manager<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.090> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
use that to convince the manager that I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.910 
use that to convince the manager that I
stay<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.600> my<00:00:18.630> position<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.560> well<00:00:19.800> as

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
stay in my position as well as

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.380 
stay in my position as well as
defensively<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:21.000> bad<00:00:21.180> i<00:00:21.210> mean

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
defensively it's not bad i mean

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.660 
defensively it's not bad i mean
defensively<00:00:21.869> amad<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.350> some<00:00:22.470> troubles<00:00:22.800> I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
defensively amad with some troubles I

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.000 
defensively amad with some troubles I
noticed<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.660> second<00:00:25.080> base<00:00:25.199> when<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> feel

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
noticed that second base when you feel

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.380 
noticed that second base when you feel
the<00:00:26.160> ground<00:00:26.369> ball<00:00:26.550> unless<00:00:26.880> you're<00:00:27.029> running

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the ground ball unless you're running

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.089 
the ground ball unless you're running
toward<00:00:27.660> second<00:00:28.080> base<00:00:28.170> you're<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
toward second base you're not going to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
toward second base you're not going to
be<00:00:29.160> able<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.460> get<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> double<00:00:29.970> play<00:00:30.199> hardly

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
be able to get the double play hardly

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.270 
be able to get the double play hardly
ever<00:00:31.399> because<00:00:32.719> whenever<00:00:33.719> i<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> wear<00:00:35.010> my

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
ever because whenever i have to wear my

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160 
ever because whenever i have to wear my
momentum<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.969> carrying<00:00:36.360> me<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.630> first<00:00:36.899> base

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
momentum is carrying me to first base

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.709 
momentum is carrying me to first base
and<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.800> throw<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> second<00:00:38.760> base<00:00:38.910> my<00:00:39.540> dude

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and I throw it to second base my dude

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
and I throw it to second base my dude
takes<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.260> 20<00:00:40.739> minutes<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.160> turn<00:00:41.309> himself

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
takes like 20 minutes to turn himself

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.029 
takes like 20 minutes to turn himself
around<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.570> does<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.590> work<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
around and it just does not work so I

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.299 
around and it just does not work so I
started<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:49.309> things

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
started to you know get some things

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
started to you know get some things
going<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.180> head<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
going in my head so that I can be a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.840 
going in my head so that I can be a
better<00:00:52.379> 2nd<00:00:52.890> baseman<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.610> definitely

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
better 2nd baseman but it's definitely

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.459 
better 2nd baseman but it's definitely
not<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:56.210> smoothly<00:00:57.210> let's<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.350> say

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
not going very smoothly let's just say

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.349 
not going very smoothly let's just say
that<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> allergist<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> strong<00:01:00.090> so

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that but the allergist and strong so

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.849 
that but the allergist and strong so
hopefully<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> average<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.530> compensate

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hopefully the average will compensate

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.160 
hopefully the average will compensate
for<00:01:02.129> my<00:01:02.250> defense<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.329> won't<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
for my defense and I won't get like and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
for my defense and I won't get like and
the<00:01:04.650> manager<00:01:05.010> won't<00:01:05.159> switch<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.610> positions

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the manager won't switch my positions

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880 
the manager won't switch my positions
are<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.299> third<00:01:06.540> base<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:07.080> catcher<00:01:07.530> or

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
are like third base or catcher or

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
are like third base or catcher or
something<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.299> guy<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:09.840> friends<00:01:10.140> list

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
something I I one guy on my friends list

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.770 
something I I one guy on my friends list
who<00:01:10.530> told<00:01:10.770> me<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> he<00:01:11.520> started<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
who told me that he started off as a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.690 
who told me that he started off as a
center<00:01:13.409> fielder<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.100> got<00:01:14.369> put<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
center fielder and then got put as a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
center fielder and then got put as a
catcher<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.689> he<00:01:16.020> couldn't<00:01:16.170> cut<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
catcher because he couldn't cut a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.640 
catcher because he couldn't cut a
senator<00:01:16.890> field<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.380> managers<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
senator field so the managers in this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
senator field so the managers in this
game<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> computer<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.970> decides

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
game or the computer just decides

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.450 
game or the computer just decides
bringing<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.080> places<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.560> put<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.950> it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
bringing them places to put you it's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
bringing them places to put you it's
kind<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.060> crazy<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.290> wasn't<00:01:25.470> even<00:01:25.590> his

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
kind of crazy and that wasn't even his

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
kind of crazy and that wasn't even his
secondary<00:01:26.310> position<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:26.970> would<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.210> like

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
secondary position there would it's like

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.580 
secondary position there would it's like
you're<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:27.689> even<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:28.080> into<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> field

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
