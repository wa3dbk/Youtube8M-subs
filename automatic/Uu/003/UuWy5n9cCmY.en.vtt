 Hi, my name is Nadya Gritskevich 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:20.509
 I sing in a group of nadya in 2010 with us 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:24.800
 album out 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:28.569
 tricky to armani groups and from that in general 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.699
 then began our such a serious big 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:39.890
 passion for music and now we sing on 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:44.390
 Russian and that I would say myself 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.350
 what we do alternative plus 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.670
 You would be a group who would say of course that 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.670
 so will 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.940
 the best year for the group nadya was the first 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.309
 group year 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.820
 I am proud of the amount of work that we 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.720
 done the speed with which we 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.259
 recorded an album 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.640
 I think that a year has passed very 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.640
 fruitful for us 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.810
 performed at a very large number 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.740
 festivals including we were our hands 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.319
 from the festival in Stockholm 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:41.369
 went with Masha to brazil even on 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:44.549
 week I'm sorry about the same than I am fit 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.469
 I regret that we recorded the album so 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.390
 I quickly regret that we are very much 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.370
 released material 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.370
 and yet something will happen 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 I think that modern Russian 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.909
 medicine a lot of people 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:14.550
 most of them are nice faces 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.550
 I think it's cool life 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.299
 Yes 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.989
 I once read an interview with Samse Hummer 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.700
 in which he said that of course always 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.129
 there will be people who do not like you 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.099
 because it's not a kitty for everyone 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:35.469
 I like to adhere to this 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.469
 wishes i am not a kitten 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:57.730
 the trap song I wrote seems to me 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:01.050
 about 5 years ago and when we agreed 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.300
 take part in gyoza fire festival 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.050
 thought it would be in format 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:12.780
 most suitable for celebration 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.780
 women's day song and recorded you 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.959
 I think we could be much 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.959
 more 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.830
 men 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.130
 many nice faces of the Russian see 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.610
 languages will condemn you at the festival 9 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.910
 March in the rap club where I invite everyone 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.970
 and also subscribe to buy on these 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.170
 sashimi 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.170
 buying music is right
