okay so let's go ahead and do store some

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.380 
okay so let's go ahead and do store some
enemies<00:01:36.070> right<00:01:36.310> here<00:01:36.550> then<00:01:36.730> we'll<00:01:36.880> be<00:01:37.060> able<00:01:37.150> to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
enemies right here then we'll be able to

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.100 
enemies right here then we'll be able to
move<00:01:37.540> forward<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.940> there's<00:01:40.750> some<00:01:40.990> more

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
to get two torpedoes there you go now

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.800 
to get two torpedoes there you go now
that<00:02:12.220> should<00:02:12.430> release<00:02:12.820> our<00:02:13.030> forcefield<00:02:13.390> right
