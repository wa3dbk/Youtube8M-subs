the<00:01:05.250> mental<00:01:05.610> beast<00:01:05.820> inside<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.450> head<00:01:07.040> which

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the mental beast inside my head which

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.910 
the mental beast inside my head which
I'm<00:01:08.280> sure<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.880> know<00:01:09.119> about<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:10.409> think

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I'm sure you all know about it I think

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.780 
I'm sure you all know about it I think
sometimes<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.740> reason<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.040> got<00:01:14.220> fat<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
sometimes the reason I got fat is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
sometimes the reason I got fat is
because<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.869> didn't<00:01:16.350> fight<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.159> didn't<00:01:17.430> wrestle

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
because I didn't fight I didn't wrestle

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.200 
because I didn't fight I didn't wrestle
that<00:01:18.450> mental<00:01:18.869> beast<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.439> gave<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.670> took<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that mental beast I gave up I took the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.899 
that mental beast I gave up I took the
path<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.630> least<00:01:21.689> resistance<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.700> path

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
path of least resistance and that path

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
path of least resistance and that path
and<00:01:24.180> police<00:01:24.479> resonances<00:01:25.020> didn't<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:26.009> for

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and police resonances didn't do much for

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.270 
and police resonances didn't do much for
me

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.570 

and<00:01:33.369> then<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.000> had<00:01:34.180> weight-loss<00:01:34.420> surgery

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.330 

and<00:01:38.590> I've<00:01:39.590> worked<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:40.190> hard<00:01:41.680> both<00:01:42.680> physically

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
and I've worked so hard both physically

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.330 
and I've worked so hard both physically
and<00:01:43.370> mentally<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.900> mental<00:01:48.380> work<00:01:48.620> you

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and mentally and not mental work you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.110 
and mentally and not mental work you
have<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.550> face<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:52.280> cannot<00:01:52.610> walk<00:01:52.850> away

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
have to face it you cannot walk away

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.600 
have to face it you cannot walk away
from<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:54.560> cannot<00:01:54.890> take<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.250> path<00:01:55.460> of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
from it you cannot take the path of

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
from it you cannot take the path of
least<00:01:55.670> resistance<00:01:55.940> so<00:01:58.360> when<00:01:59.360> there's<00:01:59.540> a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
least resistance so when there's a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.170 
least resistance so when there's a
choice<00:01:59.840> to<00:02:00.110> be<00:02:00.260> made<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.800> choice<00:02:01.610> about<00:02:01.850> what
