Volkswagen<00:00:21.010> van<00:00:21.160> again<00:00:21.430> I'm<00:00:21.880> looking<00:00:22.150> through

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
Volkswagen van again I'm looking through

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.480 
Volkswagen van again I'm looking through
the<00:00:22.390> steering<00:00:22.600> wheel<00:00:22.900> here<00:00:23.200> and<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:24.340> is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
the steering wheel here and this is

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.010 
the steering wheel here and this is
where<00:00:24.700> you<00:00:25.060> would<00:00:25.180> usually<00:00:25.360> see<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.869> gauge

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
where you would usually see the gauge

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.180 
where you would usually see the gauge
cluster<00:00:26.529> I<00:00:28.230> brought<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.380> van<00:00:29.500> back<00:00:29.770> here<00:00:30.039> and

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
cluster I brought the van back here and

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.290 
cluster I brought the van back here and
I<00:00:30.220> had<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.370> couple<00:00:30.550> other<00:00:30.640> things<00:00:30.760> to<00:00:31.000> do<00:00:31.180> this

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
I had a couple other things to do this

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.299 
I had a couple other things to do this
afternoon<00:00:31.840> one<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.320> which<00:00:32.440> was<00:00:32.710> I<00:00:33.040> had<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.220> go

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
afternoon one of which was I had to go

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.799 
afternoon one of which was I had to go
to<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.489> junkyard<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.030> get<00:00:34.239> some<00:00:34.450> parts<00:00:34.720> for

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
to the junkyard to get some parts for

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.180 
to the junkyard to get some parts for
the<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.100> legacy<00:00:36.370> project<00:00:36.940> car<00:00:37.180> over<00:00:37.660> here

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the for the legacy project car over here

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.939 
the for the legacy project car over here
didn't<00:00:39.190> really<00:00:39.520> find<00:00:39.699> what<00:00:39.970> I<00:00:40.000> needed<00:00:40.420> but<00:00:41.350> I

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
didn't really find what I needed but I

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.460 
didn't really find what I needed but I
saw<00:00:42.790> something<00:00:43.210> in<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.809> junkyard<00:00:44.080> that<00:00:44.290> I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
saw something in the junkyard that I

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.110 
saw something in the junkyard that I
usually<00:00:44.949> never<00:00:45.159> see<00:00:45.430> in<00:00:45.610> that's<00:00:45.820> another

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
usually never see in that's another

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.140 
usually never see in that's another
Vanagon<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.800> Vanagon<00:00:48.250> was<00:00:48.460> in<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.820> junkyard

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
Vanagon the Vanagon was in the junkyard

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.509 
Vanagon the Vanagon was in the junkyard
due<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.900> an<00:00:49.989> engine<00:00:50.170> fire<00:00:50.589> thankfully<00:00:51.370> they

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
due to an engine fire thankfully they

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.340 
due to an engine fire thankfully they
caught<00:00:51.790> it<00:00:51.820> relatively<00:00:52.479> early<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:53.019> was<00:00:53.110> kind

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
caught it relatively early it was kind

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
caught it relatively early it was kind
of<00:00:53.409> localized<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.100> engine<00:00:54.339> compartment

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
of localized to the engine compartment

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.820 
of localized to the engine compartment
and<00:00:54.940> some<00:00:55.180> scorching<00:00:55.750> along<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.760> along<00:00:57.760> the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
and some scorching along the along the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.770 
and some scorching along the along the
the<00:01:00.479> driver's<00:01:01.479> side<00:01:01.690> rear<00:01:02.699> panel<00:01:03.699> going<00:01:04.510> up<00:01:04.629> by

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
the driver's side rear panel going up by

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.880 
the driver's side rear panel going up by
the<00:01:04.839> air<00:01:05.019> vent<00:01:07.500> obviously<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.560> know<00:01:08.620> all<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the air vent obviously you know all the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.440 
the air vent obviously you know all the
end<00:01:09.040> all<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.670> wiring<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.240> engine

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
end all the wiring the engine

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.560 
end all the wiring the engine
compartment<00:01:10.600> was<00:01:10.900> toasted<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.479> the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
compartment was toasted so but the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.020 
compartment was toasted so but the
interior<00:01:14.020> was<00:01:14.200> pretty<00:01:14.470> much<00:01:14.530> unscathed<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.340> I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
interior was pretty much unscathed and I

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.630 
interior was pretty much unscathed and I
actually<00:01:16.590> grabbed<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.799> gauge<00:01:18.009> cluster<00:01:18.520> out

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
actually grabbed the gauge cluster out

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.429 
actually grabbed the gauge cluster out
of<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:18.880> van<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:21.420> let<00:01:22.420> me<00:01:22.539> explain<00:01:22.840> why<00:01:23.140> this

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
of that van and let me explain why this

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.980 
of that van and let me explain why this
is<00:01:24.009> actually<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.430> base<00:01:24.820> model<00:01:25.119> van<00:01:25.479> again<00:01:25.630> it's

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
is actually a base model van again it's

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.789 
is actually a base model van again it's
not<00:01:26.170> even<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.500> GL<00:01:27.899> one<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.140> bigger

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
not even the GL one of the bigger

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.209 
not even the GL one of the bigger
differences<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.210> gauge<00:01:31.780> cluster

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
differences is that the gauge cluster

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.190 
differences is that the gauge cluster
that<00:01:33.219> came<00:01:33.460> with<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.759> van<00:01:34.000> just<00:01:34.990> has<00:01:35.170> a

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
that came with this van just has a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.080 
that came with this van just has a
speedometer<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.420> an<00:01:37.420> analogue<00:01:37.990> clock<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
speedometer and an analogue clock you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.480 
speedometer and an analogue clock you
know<00:01:40.179> plus<00:01:40.390> with<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:41.100> regular<00:01:42.100> things<00:01:42.310> like

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
know plus with the regular things like

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.730 
know plus with the regular things like
the<00:01:42.579> fuel<00:01:42.820> gauge<00:01:43.200> coolant<00:01:44.200> temperature<00:01:44.560> gauge

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
the fuel gauge coolant temperature gauge

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.679 
the fuel gauge coolant temperature gauge
that<00:01:45.490> sort<00:01:45.729> of<00:01:45.759> thing<00:01:47.340> anyhow<00:01:48.390> I've<00:01:49.390> been

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
that sort of thing anyhow I've been

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.690 
that sort of thing anyhow I've been
keeping<00:01:50.020> my<00:01:50.049> eye<00:01:50.140> out<00:01:50.259> for<00:01:50.469> a<00:01:50.740> long<00:01:50.920> time<00:01:51.219> for

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
keeping my eye out for a long time for

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.700 
keeping my eye out for a long time for
an<00:01:52.000> original<00:01:55.109> gauge<00:01:56.109> cluster<00:01:56.530> with<00:01:56.679> a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
an original gauge cluster with a

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.340 
an original gauge cluster with a
tachometer<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:58.749> fan<00:01:58.960> didn't<00:01:59.259> have

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
tachometer because this fan didn't have

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.389 
tachometer because this fan didn't have
one<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:01.329> actually<00:02:02.229> did<00:02:02.619> have<00:02:02.859> it<00:02:02.979> installed

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
one I actually did have it installed

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.669 
one I actually did have it installed
already<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.509> tested<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:05.350> everything

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
already and I tested it and everything

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:06.950 
already and I tested it and everything
worked<00:02:05.859> just<00:02:05.950> fine

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
worked just fine

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.730 
worked just fine
apparently<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.929> don't<00:02:11.110> have<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.319> do<00:02:11.440> anything

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
apparently you don't have to do anything

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.990 
apparently you don't have to do anything
in<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.920> engine<00:02:12.160> compartment<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.700> really

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
in the engine compartment you really

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.150 
in the engine compartment you really
just<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:14.470> know<00:02:14.560> plug<00:02:14.860> in<00:02:15.100> all<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:17.069> cables<00:02:18.069> and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
just you know plug in all the cables and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.870 
just you know plug in all the cables and
wires<00:02:18.400> from<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.980> original<00:02:20.980> cluster<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
wires from the original cluster and the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.210 
wires from the original cluster and the
tachometer<00:02:22.270> works<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.710> van<00:02:23.860> must<00:02:24.040> be

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
tachometer works so the van must be

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.990 
tachometer works so the van must be
wired<00:02:24.610> for<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.030> already<00:02:25.300> which<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.900> fantastic

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
wired for it already which is fantastic

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.610 
wired for it already which is fantastic
but<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.150> one<00:02:28.300> thing<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.570> really<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.320> is

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
but the one thing I really have to do is

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.230 
but the one thing I really have to do is
swap<00:02:29.950> over<00:02:30.400> my<00:02:30.610> speedometer<00:02:31.420> with<00:02:31.930> odometer

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
swap over my speedometer with odometer

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.400 
swap over my speedometer with odometer
the<00:02:34.240> one<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.140> junkyard<00:02:35.860> van<00:02:36.250> had<00:02:37.350> said<00:02:38.350> I

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
the one in the junkyard van had said I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.100 
the one in the junkyard van had said I
can<00:02:38.560> show<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.830> here<00:02:42.210> had<00:02:43.210> two<00:02:43.570> hundred<00:02:43.870> thirty

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
can show you here had two hundred thirty

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.520 
can show you here had two hundred thirty
two<00:02:44.170> thousand<00:02:44.710> miles<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:46.230> where<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.350> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
two thousand miles on it where is the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.560 
two thousand miles on it where is the
one<00:02:48.330> from<00:02:49.330> my<00:02:49.360> van<00:02:49.920> has<00:02:51.000> 100,000<00:02:52.000> o99

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
one from my van has 100,000 o99

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.260 
one from my van has 100,000 o99
now<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.930> have<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> replacement<00:02:53.680> odometer<00:02:54.370> that's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
now I have a replacement odometer that's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.990 
now I have a replacement odometer that's
not<00:02:55.480> original<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.080> van<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:57.760> want<00:02:57.970> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
not original to the van but I do want to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.470 
not original to the van but I do want to
keep<00:02:58.120> my<00:02:58.270> mileage<00:02:58.600> consistent<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.620> I<00:03:00.360> had<00:03:01.360> to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
keep my mileage consistent so I had to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.080 
keep my mileage consistent so I had to
swap<00:03:01.690> those<00:03:01.900> between<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.440> clusters<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.730> like

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
swap those between the clusters and like

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.430 
swap those between the clusters and like
I<00:03:04.180> said<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.360> had<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.690> all<00:03:04.780> installed<00:03:05.140> already

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
I said I had it all installed already

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.250 
I said I had it all installed already
and<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:05.890> fired<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.370> fired<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.210> up<00:03:07.300> Technologist

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
and I fired the fired it up Technologist

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.470 
and I fired the fired it up Technologist
fine<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:09.340> then<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.640> noticed<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.270> there's<00:03:10.420> a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
fine but then I noticed that there's a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.120 
fine but then I noticed that there's a
little<00:03:10.660> piece<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.810> broken<00:03:11.050> plastic<00:03:11.710> in<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
little piece of broken plastic in the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.720 
little piece of broken plastic in the
section<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.910> gauge<00:03:13.090> cluster<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
section of the gauge cluster with the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.590 
section of the gauge cluster with the
speedometer<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:15.910> took<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.150> all<00:03:16.240> apart<00:03:16.480> again

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
speedometer so I took it all apart again

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.030 
speedometer so I took it all apart again
to<00:03:16.840> get<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:16.990> out<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.440> do<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> little<00:03:17.740> bit<00:03:17.950> of

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
to get that out and do a little bit of

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.740 
to get that out and do a little bit of
cleaning<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.670> I'm<00:03:19.210> pretty<00:03:19.390> much<00:03:19.480> ready<00:03:19.630> to
