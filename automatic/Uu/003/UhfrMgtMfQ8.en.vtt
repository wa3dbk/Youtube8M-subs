Grumman Studios owner Perez Ferris odd
recently<00:00:02.850> took<00:00:03.030> patch<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.629> tour<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:03.929> Grumman

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
recently took patch on a tour of Grumman

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.070 
recently took patch on a tour of Grumman
studios<00:00:05.190> in<00:00:05.460> Bethpage<00:00:05.810> studios<00:00:06.810> are

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
studios in Bethpage studios are

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.580 
studios in Bethpage studios are
basically<00:00:07.770> large<00:00:08.269> boxes<00:00:09.269> with<00:00:09.840> high<00:00:10.019> ceilings

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
basically large boxes with high ceilings

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.570 
basically large boxes with high ceilings
without<00:00:10.889> columns<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.620> and<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.920> soundproof

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
without columns and and the soundproof

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.279 
without columns and and the soundproof
basically<00:00:15.059> need<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.570> two<00:00:15.690> good<00:00:15.990> walls

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
basically need to have two good walls

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.830 
basically need to have two good walls
and<00:00:16.500> plenty<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.890> electricity<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.210> they<00:00:18.420> could

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
and plenty of electricity so they could

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.480 
and plenty of electricity so they could
go<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.140> there<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.410> create<00:00:19.619> anything<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.160> for

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
go in there and create anything that for

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.380 
go in there and create anything that for
example<00:00:20.789> when<00:00:21.170> assault<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.439> shot<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:23.330> here

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
example when assault was shot in here

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.880 
example when assault was shot in here
they<00:00:24.810> built<00:00:25.080> parts<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> CIA<00:00:26.130> part<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
they built parts of the CIA part of the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.759 
they built parts of the CIA part of the
White<00:00:28.890> House<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.970> build<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.050> barge<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
White House they build a barge and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.160 
White House they build a barge and
they're<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:33.090> built<00:00:33.390> basement<00:00:34.110> of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
they're you know they built basement of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.580 
they're you know they built basement of
a<00:00:34.260> church

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
a church

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.860 
a church
so<00:00:35.190> basically<00:00:35.730> could<00:00:35.969> create<00:00:36.210> anything<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so basically could create anything that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.569 
so basically could create anything that
they<00:00:37.140> want<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
they want you know and it's on the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.139 
they want you know and it's on the
outside<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> looks<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.600> PI<00:00:40.410> wooden<00:00:40.969> two<00:00:41.969> by

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
outside it looks like PI wooden two by

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
outside it looks like PI wooden two by
fours<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.780> two<00:00:42.899> by<00:00:43.079> sixes<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.559> when<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> go

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
fours and two by sixes but when you go

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
fours and two by sixes but when you go
inside<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:45.090> made<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:46.020> make<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.829> real

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
inside they made it they make it so real

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.119 
inside they made it they make it so real
that<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:49.110> unbelievable<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.039> have

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that it's it it's unbelievable you have

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.660 
that it's it it's unbelievable you have
a<00:00:50.190> vast<00:00:50.520> area<00:00:51.020> we<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.620> said<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.340> this

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
a vast area we have it said this this

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.510 
a vast area we have it said this this
this<00:00:54.300> facilities<00:00:54.870> 30<00:00:55.170> acres<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.860> 750

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this facilities 30 acres we have 750

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.110 
this facilities 30 acres we have 750
seven<00:00:57.410> stages<00:00:58.410> okay<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.760> probably<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
seven stages okay it's probably the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.590 
seven stages okay it's probably the
largest<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> Northeast<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:03.390> what

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
largest of the Northeast and that's what

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
largest of the Northeast and that's what
makes<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.960> unique<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.729> going

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
makes this unique and if they're going

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
makes this unique and if they're going
to<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> big<00:01:06.240> movie<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to do a big movie and they want to be in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.030 
to do a big movie and they want to be in
under<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.460> roof<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> good

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
candidate for it and be also plenty of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
candidate for it and be also plenty of
production<00:01:13.439> officers<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.760> plenty<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
production officers you know plenty of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
production officers you know plenty of
power<00:01:15.810> because<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.830> facility<00:01:17.280> yeah

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
power because it's this facility yeah

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
power because it's this facility yeah
was<00:01:18.000> used<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.659> manufacturing<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.530> there's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
was used in manufacturing so there's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
was used in manufacturing so there's
plenty<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.220> power<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.810> need

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
plenty of power here and they need

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.130 
plenty of power here and they need
plenty<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.070> amperage<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.119> power<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.930> they

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
plenty of amperage and power when they

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.390 
plenty of amperage and power when they
should<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.130> moved

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
should have moved

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.810 
should have moved
we<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.479> stages<00:01:27.960> ranging<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:28.770> 8,000<00:01:29.549> square

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
we have stages ranging from 8,000 square

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.780 
we have stages ranging from 8,000 square
feet<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.470> 37,000<00:01:31.470> square<00:01:31.560> feet<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.130> our<00:01:32.340> larger

spaces 37,000 square feet 120 by 310
it's<00:01:37.049> probably<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> largest<00:01:37.740> stages

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it's probably one of the largest stages

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.149 
it's probably one of the largest stages
on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.850> Northeast<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> stage<00:01:40.979> 7<00:01:43.159> it's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
on the Northeast this is stage 7 it's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.560 
on the Northeast this is stage 7 it's
roughly<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.960> 19<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.079> 20,000<00:01:46.860> square<00:01:47.130> feet

was<00:03:52.090> 55<00:03:52.690> feet<00:03:52.930> high<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:53.440> they<00:03:53.859> build<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.340> the

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
was 55 feet high so they build it on the

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.390 
was 55 feet high so they build it on the
outside<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.859> then<00:03:56.859> there<00:03:56.980> was<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.100> helicopter
