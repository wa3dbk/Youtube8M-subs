00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
other for many years which is very

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.219 
other for many years which is very
important<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.710> competition<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
important as a competition like this I

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.300

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.279 
think that a group that works together
has<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> better<00:01:54.060> chance<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> progress<00:01:54.840> than<00:01:55.200> a

side's<00:05:36.030> effort<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.690> thought<00:05:37.680> that<00:05:37.889> we<00:05:38.130> had<00:05:38.400> a

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
side's effort I thought that we had a

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.890 
side's effort I thought that we had a
good<00:05:38.639> game<00:05:38.820> plan<00:05:38.880> to<00:05:39.270> win<00:05:39.419> a<00:05:39.449> game<00:05:39.690> and<00:05:39.840> that

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
good game plan to win a game and that

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.779 
good game plan to win a game and that
was<00:05:40.080> going<00:05:40.199> to<00:05:40.289> be<00:05:40.409> aggressive<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.669> was

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
was going to be aggressive and it was

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.390 
was going to be aggressive and it was
going<00:05:41.909> to<00:05:41.970> be<00:05:42.090> having<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.750> ball<00:05:42.930> now<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.130> I

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
going to be having the ball now the I

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.980 
going to be having the ball now the I
think<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:44.970> difficult<00:05:45.389> part<00:05:45.570> is<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:45.810> we<00:05:45.930> were

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
think the difficult part is that we were

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.930 
think the difficult part is that we were
playing<00:05:46.169> Spain<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.740> Spain<00:05:47.280> is<00:05:47.580> usually<00:05:47.909> a

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
playing Spain and Spain is usually a

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.629 
playing Spain and Spain is usually a
team<00:05:48.180> that<00:05:48.330> has<00:05:48.449> the<00:05:48.630> ball<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:50.340> they<00:05:50.460> make

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
team that has the ball and and they make

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.460 
team that has the ball and and they make
things<00:05:50.970> difficult<00:05:51.270> for<00:05:51.599> us<00:05:51.690> as<00:05:51.810> well<00:05:52.020> so<00:05:52.260> I

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
things difficult for us as well so I

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.279 
things difficult for us as well so I
think<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.669> know<00:05:53.820> number<00:05:54.389> one<00:05:54.419> I'm<00:05:54.750> happy<00:05:54.990> with

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
think you know number one I'm happy with

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.930 
think you know number one I'm happy with
the<00:05:55.470> effort<00:05:55.590> of<00:05:55.800> our<00:05:56.159> players<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.729> of<00:05:56.789> our

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
the effort of our players and of our

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.480 
the effort of our players and of our
team<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.330> but<00:05:58.139> unfortunately<00:05:58.889> I<00:05:58.919> think<00:05:59.310> the

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
team and but unfortunately I think the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.300 
team and but unfortunately I think the
result<00:06:00.360> doesn't<00:06:00.539> show<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.800> doesn't<00:06:02.130> reflect

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
result doesn't show it doesn't reflect

the effort or the play that we had
Spain<00:06:05.500> were<00:06:05.740> heating<00:06:06.040> up<00:06:06.130> nicely<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.760> one
