00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 arslan vladimir what is the secret of combat 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.520
 the spirit of the militia of the army of new Russia is just 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.319
 sometimes they say 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.480
 especially the liberal media that is not clear 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.330
 what are they fighting for? 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.790
 inspired by russia what is the secret well a 1 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.910
 I think that there are no secrets because 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.660
 what if volunteers come to fight 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 for their cities it is clear that they are 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.060
 know about what they are going and they 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.260
 know that they protect greeting people 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.820
 motivated and this is firstly secondly 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.100
 the principle of the army of new Russia was created 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.379
 long enough but unlike those 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.180
 armed formations who threw 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.160
 on novorosii 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 their she really was created as 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.020
 full 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.600
 Army structure will not build 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 assumptions who helped there but not 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.699
 how did I really help 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.670
 You know no Colonel Niger game 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.379
 can't create an army just because 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.239
 necessary rear specialists 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.809
 necessary specialists general 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.240
 headquarters 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.189
 need commanders but 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.130
 even for you to have three 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.380
 brigades or four or how much their tank 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.090
 on baros we need to have three 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.500
 full brigade headquarters and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 full-fledged headquarters of the army corps 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.040
 to lead them all these 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.439
 specialists they are not born from the plow 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.780
 not from the levers of the tractor and for a long time 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.220
 prepare although I understand that such 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.720
 specialists could be opposite 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 novorosii wishes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.070
 so here is the time when the DNI and LNR 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.390
 waged heavy defensive battles 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.000
 own learning was happening 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.720
 creating this army by the way is not this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.810
 did not hide and in the month of May spoke 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.600
 that their main forces are now on 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 preparing them for a mouse but not introducing 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 fight then it could be considered 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.700
 or suggest that this campaign 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.560
 the moment is given here we were able to see that on 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.649
 in fact they really cooked 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.450
 their parts but it's understandable when people go to 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.899
 fight already prepared paired 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.000
 knocked down when they feel 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.420
 comrade's elbow when they got used to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 work in these units then this too 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.280
 plus morale because even 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.290
 Now it is clear from reports from the advanced 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.599
 many pieces that were thrown court 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.780
 Kiev, they were recruited from mountain to 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.769
 Pine them almost never trained them 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.430
 practically 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.609
 who both armed and not all even 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.480
 Said they do not go to war well except 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.069
 in addition it is necessary again considering cues has 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.859
 some highly motivated and parts 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.599
 consisting of neo-nazis but he has 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.129
 a large number of parts that 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.040
 just typed by call 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.989
 these parts are mixed together they 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.299
 often do not trust each other here 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.579
 now defeat the army 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.170
 accuses the national guard 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.909
 the national guard blames the army for everything 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.430
 together I blame territorial 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.329
 battalions and so on well and then on 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.959
 morale 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.970
 affects the credibility of his command 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.889
 Ukrainian units have every reason not to 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.669
 trust your command because 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.650
 they were driven into battle despite losing it 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.959
 years often out of meaningless 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.060
 offensive in order to here to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.169
 certain dates get certain 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.959
 results for example poroshenko 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:30.139
 it was necessary here at 24 number at 25 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.389
 when he was going to dissolve the kin at 26 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.760
 when he was going to meet in Minsk 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.139
 he had to go out with some big ones 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.040
 victories in order to have 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.690
 opportunity to dictate their services and 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.639
 troops pursued an offensive despite 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.680
 what is your offensive potential and 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.829
 really scooped the way the same 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.169
 happened to the Germans near Moscow at that 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.810
 while the generals suggested 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:56.030
 stop regroup and 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.010
 explained that the shock groups already 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.810
 practically can not occur dolph they 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.510
 ripped off their shock potential 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.669
 Hitler demanded to take Moscow we know 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.859
 how did it end here now poroshenko 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.810
 demanded to take Donetsk it ended 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.870
 about the same as the Germans ended 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.229
 under Moscow, in principle, if we drop 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.209
 become time lag accordingly 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:20.120
 other weapons fewer 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.160
 troops in general is an operation which 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.710
 the militia was held 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.930
 she completely copies counter attacks 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.610
 Soviet troops under Moscow that is 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.100
 shock groups exhausted 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.080
 and continued to advance already narrow front 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.130
 and were crushed as a result 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.710
 flank attacks 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.710
 pieces of counter-offensive
