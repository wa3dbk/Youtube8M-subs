together a model car it's like that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.000 
together a model car it's like that
you've<00:02:24.480> got<00:02:24.659> several<00:02:24.959> different<00:02:25.319> pieces<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you've got several different pieces and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.809 
you've got several different pieces and
if<00:02:26.939> you're<00:02:27.329> not<00:02:27.480> patient<00:02:27.750> at<00:02:28.019> all<00:02:28.609> you're<00:02:29.609> not

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
if you're not patient at all you're not

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.220 
if you're not patient at all you're not

going to be able to get this thing on

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.339 
going to be able to get this thing on
here<00:02:31.560> it's<00:02:31.799> just<00:02:31.939> very<00:02:32.939> very<00:02:33.090> tough<00:02:33.629> I<00:02:33.959> mean

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
here it's just very very tough I mean

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.690 
here it's just very very tough I mean
because<00:02:34.560> you've<00:02:34.980> got<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:35.189> many<00:02:35.459> different

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
because you've got so many different

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.729 
because you've got so many different
edges<00:02:36.090> around<00:02:36.180> here<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.319> one<00:02:37.500> thing<00:02:37.680> that

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
edges around here and the one thing that

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.830 
edges around here and the one thing that
I<00:02:37.889> think<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.939> of<00:02:39.030> threw<00:02:39.299> me<00:02:39.329> off<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.599> little

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
I think kind of threw me off a little

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.660 
I think kind of threw me off a little
bit<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.109> the<00:02:40.230> fact<00:02:40.439> that<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.739> was<00:02:41.159> used<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.459> doing

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
bit is the fact that I was used to doing

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.240 
bit is the fact that I was used to doing
this<00:02:41.939> on<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.599> I've<00:02:43.230> done<00:02:43.469> if<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.920> ipod

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
this on the I've done if on the ipod

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.929 
this on the I've done if on the ipod
touch<00:02:44.280> 2g<00:02:44.670> I've<00:02:44.909> never<00:02:45.090> applied<00:02:45.389> a<00:02:46.760> shield<00:02:47.760> to

touch 2g I've never applied a shield to

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.569 
touch 2g I've never applied a shield to
any<00:02:48.780> other<00:02:48.930> kind<00:02:49.139> of<00:02:49.260> device<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.829> with<00:02:50.400> this

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
any other kind of device and with this

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.369 
any other kind of device and with this
you<00:02:50.849> got<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.090> use<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.269> little<00:02:51.419> bit<00:02:51.599> less<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.109> the

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
you got to use a little bit less of the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.009 
you got to use a little bit less of the
spray<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.340> you've<00:02:54.060> got<00:02:54.209> I'll<00:02:54.359> rely<00:02:54.629> more<00:02:54.959> on

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
spray and you've got I'll rely more on

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.089 
spray and you've got I'll rely more on
your<00:02:55.799> placement<00:02:56.239> because<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:58.620> order<00:02:58.799> for<00:02:58.919> the

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
your placement because in order for the

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.270 
your placement because in order for the
stick<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.780> liquid<00:03:01.500> kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.769> has<00:03:01.889> to<00:03:01.919> dry<00:03:02.250> a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
stick that liquid kind of has to dry a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.520 
stick that liquid kind of has to dry a
little<00:03:02.519> bit<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> used<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.019> little<00:03:04.200> bit<00:03:04.379> too

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
little bit so I used a little bit too

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.770 
little bit so I used a little bit too
much<00:03:04.680> spray<00:03:04.980> at<00:03:05.099> times<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:06.060> as<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.629> see

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
much spray at times but as you can see

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.449 
much spray at times but as you can see
it<00:03:06.900> kind<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.109> came<00:03:07.260> out<00:03:07.409> pretty<00:03:07.530> good<00:03:07.680> let<00:03:08.370> me

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
it kind of came out pretty good let me

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.879 
it kind of came out pretty good let me
go<00:03:08.549> ahead<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.730> open<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.150> up<00:03:09.359> and<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:10.709> can

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
go ahead and open this up and you can

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.009 
go ahead and open this up and you can
see<00:03:11.099> there's<00:03:11.400> as<00:03:12.060> far<00:03:12.329> as<00:03:12.419> this<00:03:12.540> top<00:03:12.810> piece

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
see there's as far as this top piece

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.990 
see there's as far as this top piece
here<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.829> only<00:03:14.069> part<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.340> protected<00:03:14.879> as<00:03:14.969> a

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
here the only part that's protected as a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.330 
here the only part that's protected as a
screen<00:03:15.419> they<00:03:16.019> don't<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.439> anything<00:03:16.650> else<00:03:17.159> um

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
screen they don't have anything else um

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.670 
screen they don't have anything else um
on<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:18.000> top<00:03:18.209> here<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:19.260> think<00:03:19.470> mainly

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
on the top here and I think mainly

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.229 
on the top here and I think mainly
because<00:03:20.010> you've<00:03:20.340> got<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.579> speakers<00:03:21.030> there

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
because you've got the speakers there

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.849 
because you've got the speakers there
and<00:03:21.540> they<00:03:22.049> don't<00:03:22.199> want<00:03:22.379> any<00:03:22.500> kind<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.709> liquid

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
and they don't want any kind of liquid

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.250 
and they don't want any kind of liquid
getting<00:03:23.250> around<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.579> not<00:03:24.419> a<00:03:24.449> you<00:03:24.989> know<00:03:25.079> not

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
the L button which is kind of to be

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
expected everything on the edge is

expected everything on the edge is
everything<00:06:22.600> all<00:06:22.720> around<00:06:22.900> here<00:06:23.050> except<00:06:23.350> for

everything all around here except for

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.860 
everything all around here except for
the<00:06:24.280> SD<00:06:24.640> card<00:06:24.670> slot<00:06:25.240> and<00:06:25.270> right<00:06:25.480> around<00:06:25.570> here<00:06:25.810> I

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.270

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
just think that that would been a little

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.440 
just think that that would been a little
ridiculous<00:06:27.880> for<00:06:28.330> them<00:06:28.450> to<00:06:28.540> cut<00:06:28.720> that<00:06:28.870> out

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
ridiculous for them to cut that out

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.370 
ridiculous for them to cut that out
everything<00:06:31.450> on<00:06:31.480> the<00:06:31.600> back<00:06:31.780> except<00:06:32.350> for
