so I'm going to start with the snare I'm
going<00:00:07.729> to<00:00:07.960> put<00:00:08.960> a<00:00:08.990> new<00:00:09.170> head<00:00:09.349> on<00:00:09.530> and<00:00:09.800> do<00:00:09.889> some

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
going to put a new head on and do some

going to put a new head on and do some
juice<00:00:10.370> in<00:00:10.490> tuning<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.090> and<00:00:11.840> give<00:00:12.830> you<00:00:12.890> an<00:00:12.950> idea

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
juice in tuning and and give you an idea

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.910 
juice in tuning and and give you an idea
of<00:00:13.340> what<00:00:13.430> we<00:00:14.420> need<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.690> do<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:14.930> get<00:00:15.080> a<00:00:15.320> good

snare sound but also different snare
sound<00:00:18.920> different<00:00:19.250> different<00:00:19.429> heads<00:00:19.670> change

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
sound different different heads change

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.200 
sound different different heads change
the<00:00:20.510> sound<00:00:20.720> of<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.869> drum<00:00:21.110> so<00:00:22.039> but<00:00:22.940> I<00:00:22.970> don't<00:00:23.119> do

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
the sound of the drum so but I don't do

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.750 
the sound of the drum so but I don't do
the<00:00:23.300> base<00:00:23.480> of<00:00:23.660> basic<00:00:24.020> setup<00:00:24.380> so<00:00:24.470> I'm<00:00:24.560> going<00:00:24.680> to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
the base of basic setup so I'm going to

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.800 
the base of basic setup so I'm going to
snare<00:00:25.760> drum<00:00:25.910> off<00:00:26.060> here<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:27.650> I'm<00:00:27.770> going<00:00:27.980> to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
snare drum off here and I'm going to

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.779 
snare drum off here and I'm going to
grab<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.140> one<00:00:30.350> it's<00:00:30.529> got<00:00:30.619> no<00:00:30.800> head<00:00:31.010> on<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:31.730> it

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
grab this one it's got no head on so it

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.069 
grab this one it's got no head on so it
just<00:00:31.820> gives<00:00:32.059> me<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.210> chance<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.480> start<00:00:32.780> with<00:00:32.840> the

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
just gives me a chance to start with the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.950 
just gives me a chance to start with the
with<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.070> box<00:00:34.399> head<00:00:34.699> which<00:00:35.239> is<00:00:35.269> kind<00:00:35.930> of

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
with the box head which is kind of

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.490 
with the box head which is kind of
important<00:00:36.470> it's<00:00:36.710> often<00:00:37.010> neglected<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.930> as

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
important it's often neglected so as

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.830 
important it's often neglected so as
with<00:00:39.829> any<00:00:40.010> snare<00:00:41.620> bottom<00:00:42.620> head<00:00:42.950> sneers<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.750> we

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
with any snare bottom head sneers so we

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
with any snare bottom head sneers so we
need<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.020> get<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.170> tuning<00:00:45.469> on<00:00:45.559> this<00:00:45.680> right

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
need to get the tuning on this right

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.110 
need to get the tuning on this right
first<00:00:46.160> before<00:00:46.399> we<00:00:46.489> even<00:00:46.550> look<00:00:46.790> at<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:46.969> top

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
first before we even look at the top

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.410 
first before we even look at the top
head<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:47.540> I've<00:00:47.630> left<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.899> top<00:00:48.050> pedal<00:00:49.270> so<00:00:50.270> what

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
head so I've left the top pedal so what

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.500 
head so I've left the top pedal so what
I'm<00:00:50.510> going<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.690> do<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:52.059> kind<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.180> good<00:00:53.300> way<00:00:53.450> to

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
I'm going to do is kind of good way to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.860 
I'm going to do is kind of good way to
this<00:00:53.930> is<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.850> loosen<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.090> snares<00:00:56.360> off<00:00:56.600> and

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
this is to loosen the snares off and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.830 
this is to loosen the snares off and
just<00:00:56.960> pop<00:00:57.140> stick<00:00:57.590> underneath<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.420> we<00:00:59.510> do<00:00:59.629> that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
just pop stick underneath so we do that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.810 
just pop stick underneath so we do that
then<00:01:00.350> obviously<00:01:00.530> these<00:01:01.250> snares<00:01:01.520> aren't

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
then obviously these snares aren't

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.160 
then obviously these snares aren't
affecting<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.300> tuning<00:01:02.600> on<00:01:02.690> this<00:01:02.809> bottom<00:01:02.989> head

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
affecting the tuning on this bottom head

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.480 
affecting the tuning on this bottom head
what<00:01:06.170> I'm<00:01:06.259> going<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.409> do<00:01:06.590> I'm<00:01:06.829> going<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.070> I'm

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
what I'm going to do I'm going to I'm

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.239 
what I'm going to do I'm going to I'm
going<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:07.759> slacken<00:01:08.270> off<00:01:08.359> the<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.979> drumhead

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
going to slacken off the the drumhead

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.539 
going to slacken off the the drumhead
the<00:01:10.999> bottom<00:01:11.270> stay<00:01:11.600> here<00:01:11.840> now<00:01:12.740> it's<00:01:13.369> really

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
the bottom stay here now it's really

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.109 
the bottom stay here now it's really
important<00:01:13.999> the<00:01:14.090> bottom<00:01:14.450> snare<00:01:14.719> head<00:01:14.929> is<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:16.119> new

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
important the bottom snare head is a new

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.359 
important the bottom snare head is a new
head<00:01:17.719> the<00:01:18.439> misconception<00:01:19.039> is<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.189> you

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
head the misconception is that you

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.679 
head the misconception is that you
change<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.670> top<00:01:19.849> heads<00:01:20.060> out<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.359> the<00:01:20.420> bottom

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279 
important to the sound and it's really

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.370 
important to the sound and it's really
important<00:01:25.609> there's<00:01:25.729> no<00:01:25.759> dents<00:01:26.149> or<00:01:26.539> Dinks<00:01:27.200> in

important there's no dents or Dinks in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.249 
important there's no dents or Dinks in
the<00:01:27.529> bottom<00:01:27.829> in<00:01:28.039> the<00:01:28.579> bottom<00:01:28.880> head<00:01:29.079> few<00:01:30.079> little

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
the bottom in the bottom head few little

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.330 
the bottom in the bottom head few little
things<00:01:30.289> like<00:01:30.499> this<00:01:30.590> are<00:01:30.740> fine<00:01:31.009> but<00:01:31.039> there's

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
things like this are fine but there's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.949 
things like this are fine but there's
any<00:01:31.429> real<00:01:31.700> dense<00:01:32.029> and<00:01:32.209> it's<00:01:32.450> going<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.599> affect

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
any real dense and it's going to affect

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.679 
any real dense and it's going to affect
the<00:01:33.649> way<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.799> tune<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.159> drum<00:01:34.509> so<00:01:35.509> what<00:01:35.599> I'm

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
the way you tune the drum so what I'm

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.389 
the way you tune the drum so what I'm
going<00:01:35.779> to<00:01:35.840> do<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:36.409> I'm<00:01:37.069> just<00:01:37.130> going<00:01:37.369> to

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
going to do is just I'm just going to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.050 
going to do is just I'm just going to
slacken<00:01:37.849> off<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:39.799> bottom<00:01:40.130> head<00:01:40.369> down<00:01:40.789> to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
slacken off the bottom head down to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.230 
slacken off the bottom head down to
basically<00:01:41.779> finger<00:01:42.200> tight<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:42.709> you<00:01:42.969> just<00:01:43.969> turn

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
basically finger tight so you just turn

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.739 
basically finger tight so you just turn
the<00:01:44.389> drum<00:01:44.569> key<00:01:44.840> until<00:01:45.819> you<00:01:46.819> get<00:01:49.539> pretty<00:01:50.539> much

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
the drum key until you get pretty much

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.219 
the drum key until you get pretty much
an<00:01:51.139> even<00:01:52.179> pitch<00:01:53.179> all<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.509> way<00:01:53.630> around<00:01:53.810> the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
an even pitch all the way around the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.620 
an even pitch all the way around the
drum<00:01:54.529> you<00:01:55.279> can<00:01:55.399> kind<00:01:55.549> of<00:01:55.579> test<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:55.999> you<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.569> do

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
drum you can kind of test it you can do

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.450 
drum you can kind of test it you can do
it<00:01:56.689> with<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> drumstick

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.599 

so<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.520> want<00:02:01.700> kind<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.119> in<00:02:02.299> even<00:02:03.249> pitch<00:02:05.259> on

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
so you want kind of in even pitch on

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:14.020 
so you want kind of in even pitch on
each<00:02:07.609> leg<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.149> drum

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.550 

the<00:02:14.300> picture<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.840> picture<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.230> drum<00:02:15.410> is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the picture and the picture the drum is

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.960 
the picture and the picture the drum is
is<00:02:15.970> important<00:02:16.970> because<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.240> will<00:02:17.330> affect<00:02:17.660> how

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
is important because it will affect how

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.740 
is important because it will affect how
deep<00:02:19.970> or<00:02:20.209> high<00:02:20.780> pitch<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.910> snare<00:02:23.630> is

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
deep or high pitch the the the snare is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.660 
deep or high pitch the the the snare is
it<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.930> same<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.260> Tom's<00:02:24.500> as<00:02:24.680> well<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.370> bottom

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
it is same with Tom's as well the bottom

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.820 
it is same with Tom's as well the bottom
head<00:02:25.819> does<00:02:26.030> affect<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:27.140> pitch<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.620> drum

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
head does affect the pitch of the drum

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.990 
head does affect the pitch of the drum
so<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.640> can<00:02:28.730> kind<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:28.880> make<00:02:29.000> make<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> call<00:02:29.720> on

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
so you can kind of make make the call on

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.180 
so you can kind of make make the call on
on<00:02:32.000> how<00:02:32.870> tight<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.290> want<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.650> tend<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.950> have

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
on how tight you want it I tend to have

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.850 
on how tight you want it I tend to have
as<00:02:34.459> my<00:02:35.420> rule<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.690> thumb<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.200> always<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.770> have

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
as my rule of thumb is always to have

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.370 
as my rule of thumb is always to have
the<00:02:36.950> bottom<00:02:37.250> head<00:02:37.400> tighter<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.959> top<00:02:39.170> head

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the bottom head tighter and the top head

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.770 
the bottom head tighter and the top head
often<00:02:39.709> by<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.830> back<00:02:40.040> maybe<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.640> third<00:02:41.209> in<00:02:41.510> pitch

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
often by a back maybe a third in pitch

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.170 
often by a back maybe a third in pitch
but<00:02:42.110> again<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.160> don't<00:02:43.610> have<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.819> do<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.060> exactly

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
but again I don't have to do it exactly

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.080 
but again I don't have to do it exactly
it<00:02:44.690> tends<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.959> be<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:46.370> know<00:02:46.430> each<00:02:46.610> drum<00:02:46.940> has

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
it tends to be you know each drum has

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.500 
it tends to be you know each drum has
its<00:02:47.300> own<00:02:49.930> range<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.170> sounds<00:02:51.470> really<00:02:51.620> good

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
its own range what it sounds really good

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.270 
its own range what it sounds really good
so<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.720> tend<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.019> do<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.200> just<00:02:54.320> now<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.010> get

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
so what I tend to do is just now you get

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.520 
so what I tend to do is just now you get
to<00:02:55.400> know<00:02:55.550> certain<00:02:55.790> drums<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:57.050> just<00:02:57.230> just

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
to know certain drums and you just just

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.530 
to know certain drums and you just just
kind<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.739> tune<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.819> drum<00:02:58.910> up<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.150> down<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.480> it

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
kind of tune the drum up and down to it

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.640 
kind of tune the drum up and down to it
feels<00:02:59.810> good<00:03:00.050> really<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:02.440> what<00:03:03.440> I'm<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.620> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
feels good really but what I'm going to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.540 
feels good really but what I'm going to
do<00:03:03.769> with<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.830> bottom<00:03:06.830> head<00:03:06.980> on<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.280> this

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
do with with this bottom head on on this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.729 
do with with this bottom head on on this
is<00:03:07.940> like<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> six<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.480> half<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.989> six<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.709> a

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
is like a six and a half to six and a

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.570 
is like a six and a half to six and a
half<00:03:09.800> inch<00:03:10.630> wood<00:03:11.630> shell<00:03:11.930> snare<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:13.400> been<00:03:13.550> a

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
half inch wood shell snare this been a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.910 
half inch wood shell snare this been a
six<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.940> half<00:03:13.970> instrum<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:15.230> can<00:03:15.680> actually

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
six and a half instrum you can actually

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.039 
six and a half instrum you can actually
afford<00:03:16.069> after<00:03:16.550> head<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.730> little<00:03:17.120> bit<00:03:17.269> tighter

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
afford after head a little bit tighter

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.630 
afford after head a little bit tighter
on<00:03:18.260> here<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.799> drums<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:19.340> deeper

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
on here the drums going to be deeper

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.910 
on here the drums going to be deeper
anyway<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.959> what<00:03:21.260> I'm<00:03:21.350> doing<00:03:21.650> at<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.769> moment

is just pulling up the picture this
bottom<00:03:25.280> head<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:28.040> we're<00:03:28.190> getting<00:03:28.400> somewhere

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
bottom head so we're getting somewhere

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.750 
bottom head so we're getting somewhere
close<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:32.829> what<00:03:33.829> I'm<00:03:33.920> going<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.070> do<00:03:34.220> now<00:03:34.430> I'm

pinstripe heads but i'm but i'm using

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.719 
pinstripe heads but i'm but i'm using
the<00:04:16.400> double<00:04:16.669> play<00:04:16.820> on<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.390> top<00:04:17.720> snare<00:04:18.729> because

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
the double play on the top snare because

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.149 
the double play on the top snare because
i<00:04:19.760> want<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:19.970> slice<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.419> thicker<00:04:20.919> sound<00:04:21.919> and

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
i want to slice so thicker sound and

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.430 
i want to slice so thicker sound and
it's<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.880> good<00:04:23.090> general<00:04:23.479> purpose<00:04:23.870> head<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.169> use

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
it's a good general purpose head to use

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.080 
it's a good general purpose head to use
so<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.070> everybody's<00:04:25.430> quite<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:25.729> much<00:04:25.849> damping

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
so you everybody's quite so much damping

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.010 
so you everybody's quite so much damping
on<00:04:26.360> there

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
on there

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.689 
on there
so<00:04:27.379> I'm<00:04:27.470> going<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.740> end<00:04:27.919> I'm<00:04:28.340> going<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.550> pop

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
so I'm going to end I'm going to pop

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.059 
so I'm going to end I'm going to pop
this<00:04:28.849> on<00:04:29.030> here<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:32.110> see<00:04:33.110> this<00:04:33.319> this<00:04:33.530> applies<00:04:33.889> to

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
this on here so see this this applies to

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.290 
this on here so see this this applies to
pretty<00:04:34.220> much<00:04:34.370> any<00:04:34.610> drum<00:04:34.910> you're<00:04:35.060> going<00:04:35.210> to

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
pretty much any drum you're going to

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.749 
pretty much any drum you're going to
where<00:04:35.449> you're<00:04:36.080> going<00:04:36.259> to<00:04:36.319> tune<00:04:36.530> up<00:04:39.550> I'm<00:04:40.550> going

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
where you're going to tune up I'm going

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.969 
where you're going to tune up I'm going
to<00:04:40.819> finger<00:04:41.060> tighten<00:04:42.909> this<00:04:44.800> all<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.919> way

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
to finger tighten this all the way

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.800 
to finger tighten this all the way
around<00:04:47.919> it's<00:04:48.919> important<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.490> we<00:04:49.520> M<00:04:49.759> that<00:04:50.690> you

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
around it's important that we M that you

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.899 
around it's important that we M that you
stretch<00:04:51.289> drum<00:04:51.740> heads<00:04:51.949> out<00:04:52.159> as<00:04:52.340> well<00:04:52.490> because

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
stretch drum heads out as well because

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.760 
stretch drum heads out as well because
like<00:04:53.090> guitar<00:04:53.659> strings<00:04:53.990> really<00:04:54.199> they're<00:04:54.590> going

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
like guitar strings really they're going

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.110 
like guitar strings really they're going
to<00:04:55.539> go<00:04:56.539> into<00:04:56.690> lower<00:04:57.440> in<00:04:57.650> pitch<00:04:58.000> once<00:04:59.000> you've

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
to go into lower in pitch once you've

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.420 
to go into lower in pitch once you've
been<00:04:59.240> paid<00:04:59.449> in<00:04:59.479> a<00:04:59.690> little<00:04:59.900> bit<00:05:00.130> there's<00:05:01.130> a<00:05:01.190> few

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
been paid in a little bit there's a few

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.350 
been paid in a little bit there's a few
ways<00:05:01.580> round<00:05:01.909> this<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:03.970> get<00:05:04.970> this<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.330> work

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
ways round this to get this to work

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.059 
ways round this to get this to work
roughly<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:09.110> heads<00:05:09.380> or<00:05:09.530> finger<00:05:09.800> tightened

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
roughly that heads or finger tightened

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.909 
roughly that heads or finger tightened
all<00:05:10.159> the<00:05:10.220> way<00:05:10.340> around<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.880> as<00:05:11.449> you<00:05:11.539> can<00:05:11.690> see

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
all the way around and as you can see

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.180 
all the way around and as you can see
it's<00:05:12.919> not<00:05:13.069> the<00:05:13.220> greatest<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.639> sounds<00:05:15.190> it's

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
it's not the greatest it sounds it's

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.529 
it's not the greatest it sounds it's
kind<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.460> not<00:05:16.789> really<00:05:16.819> how<00:05:17.120> you<00:05:17.180> want<00:05:17.419> the

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
kind of not really how you want the

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:24.189 
kind of not really how you want the
sound<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:20.770> what<00:05:21.770> we<00:05:21.860> need<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.009> do<00:05:22.219> to<00:05:22.990> bed<00:05:23.990> this

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
sound so what we need to do to bed this

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.879 
sound so what we need to do to bed this
head<00:05:24.409> in<00:05:24.560> is<00:05:24.770> get<00:05:25.129> some<00:05:25.430> tension<00:05:25.819> I<00:05:25.909> it<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:27.860> I

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
head in is get some tension I it so I

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.120 
head in is get some tension I it so I
just<00:05:28.039> give<00:05:28.190> every<00:05:28.580> leg<00:05:28.990> but<00:05:29.990> go<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:30.740> parallel

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
just give every leg but go in parallel

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.770 
just give every leg but go in parallel
across<00:05:31.159> the<00:05:31.520> drum<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.090> don't<00:05:32.300> get<00:05:32.389> kinks

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
across the drum so you don't get kinks

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.719 
across the drum so you don't get kinks
in<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.960> head<00:05:33.139> so<00:05:33.979> you<00:05:34.039> just<00:05:34.219> you<00:05:34.370> start<00:05:34.669> on

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
in the head so you just you start on

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.610 
in the head so you just you start on
this<00:05:34.819> one<00:05:35.030> you<00:05:35.270> go<00:05:35.389> to<00:05:35.449> the<00:05:35.630> one<00:05:35.750> this<00:05:35.870> parallel

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
this one you go to the one this parallel

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.469 
this one you go to the one this parallel
across<00:05:36.830> from<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.159> there<00:05:37.849> are<00:05:37.909> some<00:05:38.030> schools<00:05:38.270> of

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
across from it there are some schools of

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.879 
across from it there are some schools of
thought<00:05:38.599> to<00:05:38.690> say<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:38.900> tune<00:05:39.169> around<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.710> drum

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
thought to say you tune around the drum

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.730 
thought to say you tune around the drum
but<00:05:40.099> I<00:05:40.159> tend<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.539> this<00:05:41.539> is<00:05:41.719> the<00:05:42.169> way<00:05:42.560> that<00:05:42.680> I

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
but I tend to this is the way that I

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.379 
but I tend to this is the way that I
tend<00:05:43.009> to<00:05:43.069> do<00:05:43.190> it<00:05:45.729> we<00:05:46.729> work<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.060> power<00:05:47.240> that

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
tend to do it we work and power that

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.209 
tend to do it we work and power that
across<00:05:47.750> getting<00:05:48.469> some<00:05:48.620> really<00:05:48.800> good<00:05:48.949> tension

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
across getting some really good tension

00:05:49.219 --> 00:06:00.999 
across getting some really good tension
on<00:05:49.610> on<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:51.139> snare<00:05:59.590> so<00:06:00.590> this<00:06:00.710> is<00:06:00.800> going<00:06:00.889> to<00:06:00.949> end

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
on on the snare so this is going to end

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.850 
on on the snare so this is going to end
up<00:06:01.159> way<00:06:01.430> tighter<00:06:01.759> than<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.060> actually<00:06:02.180> want<00:06:02.509> it

little bit of a little bit of wd-40 on

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.930 
little bit of a little bit of wd-40 on
them<00:06:12.590> in<00:06:12.680> a<00:06:12.740> little<00:06:12.919> bit<00:06:13.039> stiff<00:06:13.310> but<00:06:13.460> I<00:06:13.550> tend<00:06:13.849> to

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
them in a little bit stiff but I tend to

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.129 
them in a little bit stiff but I tend to
leave<00:06:14.150> them<00:06:14.300> a<00:06:14.360> little<00:06:14.509> bit<00:06:14.719> like<00:06:14.900> that

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
leave them a little bit like that

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.870 
leave them a little bit like that
because<00:06:15.319> it<00:06:15.949> actually<00:06:16.069> holds<00:06:16.340> the<00:06:16.550> tuning

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
because it actually holds the tuning

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.610 
because it actually holds the tuning
better<00:06:17.090> it's<00:06:17.840> not<00:06:17.960> that<00:06:18.020> great<00:06:18.349> for<00:06:18.409> the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
better it's not that great for the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.610 
better it's not that great for the
threads<00:06:18.949> but<00:06:19.250> it<00:06:19.520> does<00:06:20.110> rather<00:06:21.110> than<00:06:21.259> keep<00:06:21.500> oil

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
threads but it does rather than keep oil

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.129 
threads but it does rather than keep oil
in<00:06:21.860> them<00:06:22.449> find<00:06:23.449> that<00:06:23.569> a<00:06:23.599> little<00:06:23.779> bit<00:06:23.990> of

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
in them find that a little bit of

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:32.770 
in them find that a little bit of
resistance<00:06:24.919> does<00:06:25.729> help<00:06:26.029> with<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:26.750> tuning

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.890 

so<00:06:33.780> not<00:06:34.500> to<00:06:34.650> worry<00:06:34.680> about<00:06:34.980> even<00:06:35.720> tuning<00:06:36.720> at<00:06:36.840> the

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
so not to worry about even tuning at the

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.790 
so not to worry about even tuning at the
moment<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:39.930> go<00:06:40.170> around<00:06:40.550> clockwise<00:06:41.550> year<00:06:42.090> okay

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
moment and go around clockwise year okay

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.960 
moment and go around clockwise year okay
after<00:06:43.800> a<00:06:43.830> while<00:06:43.950> you<00:06:44.010> get<00:06:44.220> it<00:06:44.370> you<00:06:44.520> get<00:06:44.670> to<00:06:44.790> kind

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
after a while you get it you get to kind

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.470 
after a while you get it you get to kind
of<00:06:45.000> feel<00:06:46.580> where<00:06:47.580> all<00:06:47.790> the<00:06:47.880> tuning<00:06:48.210> should<00:06:48.360> be

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
of feel where all the tuning should be

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.660 
of feel where all the tuning should be
on<00:06:48.630> each<00:06:48.720> leg<00:06:49.020> the<00:06:49.890> firms<00:06:50.130> are<00:06:50.220> still<00:06:50.430> sound

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
on each leg the firms are still sound

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.650 
on each leg the firms are still sound
pretty<00:06:50.910> terrible<00:06:51.450> ready<00:06:53.360> sound<00:06:54.360> a<00:06:54.390> bit<00:06:54.420> more

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
pretty terrible ready sound a bit more

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.660 
pretty terrible ready sound a bit more
like<00:06:54.810> a<00:06:54.840> drum<00:06:55.110> now<00:06:58.100> so<00:06:59.100> what<00:06:59.220> I'm<00:06:59.310> going<00:06:59.430> to<00:06:59.490> do

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
like a drum now so what I'm going to do

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:07.370 
like a drum now so what I'm going to do
is<00:07:00.440> take<00:07:01.440> it<00:07:01.500> off<00:07:01.740> here<00:07:05.870> put<00:07:06.870> it<00:07:06.930> on<00:07:07.020> the<00:07:07.110> floor

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
is take it off here put it on the floor

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:15.140 
is take it off here put it on the floor
and<00:07:08.330> then<00:07:09.330> leave<00:07:09.480> it<00:07:09.510> on<00:07:09.660> it<00:07:09.810> I<00:07:13.910> know<00:07:14.910> it<00:07:15.030> looks

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
and then leave it on it I know it looks

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.630 
and then leave it on it I know it looks
a<00:07:15.300> bit<00:07:15.419> a<00:07:15.630> bit<00:07:15.720> dangerous<00:07:16.140> especially<00:07:16.740> when

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:17.640 
a bit a bit dangerous especially when

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.810 
a bit a bit dangerous especially when
you're<00:07:17.760> not<00:07:17.850> that<00:07:18.030> small<00:07:18.360> like<00:07:18.570> myself<00:07:18.780> it's<00:07:19.470> a

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
you're not that small like myself it's a

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.790 
you're not that small like myself it's a
but<00:07:20.820> it's<00:07:20.940> the<00:07:21.090> best<00:07:21.270> way<00:07:21.390> to<00:07:21.450> get<00:07:21.660> a<00:07:21.900> turn<00:07:22.710> if

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 
but it's the best way to get a turn if

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.520 
but it's the best way to get a turn if
you<00:07:22.860> can<00:07:22.980> actually<00:07:23.250> hear<00:07:24.140> you<00:07:25.140> can<00:07:25.260> hear<00:07:25.440> the

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
you can actually hear you can hear the

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.650 
you can actually hear you can hear the
head<00:07:25.650> cracking<00:07:26.090> its<00:07:27.090> basis<00:07:27.360> just<00:07:27.390> all<00:07:27.570> the

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
head cracking its basis just all the

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.740 
head cracking its basis just all the
reading<00:07:27.900> it's<00:07:28.410> just<00:07:28.590> sort<00:07:28.740> of<00:07:29.419> just<00:07:30.419> holding

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:30.750 
reading it's just sort of just holding

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.600 
reading it's just sort of just holding
their<00:07:30.900> head<00:07:31.140> on<00:07:31.169> to<00:07:31.590> the<00:07:32.090> vm<00:07:33.090> the<00:07:33.360> rim<00:07:34.610> just

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
their head on to the vm the rim just

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.530 
their head on to the vm the rim just
evening<00:07:36.060> out<00:07:36.210> really<00:07:36.540> I<00:07:36.660> just<00:07:38.300> you<00:07:39.300> can<00:07:39.450> do

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:39.540 
evening out really I just you can do

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.880 
evening out really I just you can do
this<00:07:39.660> with<00:07:39.720> your<00:07:39.930> hands<00:07:40.320> or<00:07:40.500> you<00:07:40.560> can<00:07:40.680> do<00:07:40.800> it

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:40.890 
this with your hands or you can do it

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.310 
this with your hands or you can do it
even<00:07:41.810> firms<00:07:42.810> I<00:07:43.460> just<00:07:44.460> want<00:07:44.610> to<00:07:44.640> get<00:07:44.760> a<00:07:44.820> good<00:07:45.320> bit

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:46.320 
even firms I just want to get a good bit

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.770 
even firms I just want to get a good bit
of<00:07:49.430> the<00:07:50.430> drums<00:07:50.640> already<00:07:50.910> detuned<00:07:51.360> you<00:07:51.630> can

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 
of the drums already detuned you can

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.350 
of the drums already detuned you can
actually<00:07:52.020> hear<00:07:52.140> that
