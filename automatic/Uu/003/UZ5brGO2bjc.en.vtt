Courtney<00:04:25.880> than<00:04:26.690> normally<00:04:27.199> because<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.590> had<00:04:28.190> to

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
Courtney than normally because I had to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.559

click<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.080> circuit<00:04:30.560> as<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.190> probably

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
click on the circuit as you probably

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.159 
click on the circuit as you probably
seen<00:04:31.759> there's<00:04:32.000> been<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.210> lot<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.569> yellow<00:04:32.810> square

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
seen there's been a lot of yellow square

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.950 
seen there's been a lot of yellow square
so<00:04:33.590> it's<00:04:34.340> taking<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.759> lot<00:04:34.940> lighter<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.690> it

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
so it's taking a lot lighter and it

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.860 
so it's taking a lot lighter and it
normally<00:04:36.110> doesn't<00:04:36.560> do<00:04:37.360> I'm<00:04:38.360> very<00:04:38.419> pleased

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
but the first day here I mean it is a

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.719 
but the first day here I mean it is a
very<00:05:16.930> very<00:05:17.199> impressive<00:05:17.499> circuit<00:05:18.279> to<00:05:18.460> sort<00:05:18.699> of

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
very very impressive circuit to sort of

very very impressive circuit to sort of

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
go down the face of 235 to 240 and then

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.879 
go down the face of 235 to 240 and then
try<00:05:22.569> and<00:05:22.719> make<00:05:22.870> yourself<00:05:23.229> turn<00:05:23.439> into<00:05:23.770> that

try and make yourself turn into that

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.739 
try and make yourself turn into that
corner<00:05:24.339> flat<00:05:24.610> out<00:05:24.819> without<00:05:24.999> lifting<00:05:25.330> at<00:05:25.689> the

corner flat out without lifting at the

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.339 
corner flat out without lifting at the

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
moment there's no way and I've seen the

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.670 
moment there's no way and I've seen the
computer<00:05:29.830> traces<00:05:30.309> of<00:05:30.719> one<00:05:31.719> piglet<00:05:32.110> maryada

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.950 
computer traces of one piglet maryada
two<00:05:32.860> days<00:05:33.069> ago<00:05:33.309> and<00:05:34.240> he<00:05:34.270> went<00:05:34.509> into<00:05:34.719> turn<00:05:34.900> four

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
two days ago and he went into turn four

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.679 
two days ago and he went into turn four
flat<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:36.490> there's<00:05:36.699> the<00:05:36.849> Eternity<00:05:37.389> dude<00:05:37.539> day

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 
flat but there's the Eternity dude day

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:38.700 
flat but there's the Eternity dude day
as<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.900> pattern<00:05:38.379> here

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
as a pattern here

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.540 
as a pattern here
2:23<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:40.379> today<00:05:41.379> poor<00:05:41.680> traces<00:05:42.129> the<00:05:42.219> quickest

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
2:23 and today poor traces the quickest

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.610 
2:23 and today poor traces the quickest
of<00:05:42.580> 224<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:43.629> it's<00:05:43.779> probably<00:05:44.020> been<00:05:44.199> through<00:05:44.409> two

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
of 224 so it's probably been through two

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.879 
of 224 so it's probably been through two
turns<00:05:44.889> flat<00:05:45.249> at<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.330> moment<00:05:46.719> I<00:05:46.870> mean<00:05:47.259> I'm<00:05:47.680> not

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
turns flat at the moment I mean I'm not

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.369 
turns flat at the moment I mean I'm not
going<00:05:48.099> through<00:05:48.219> any<00:05:48.399> turn<00:05:48.639> flats<00:05:49.029> there<00:05:49.379> but

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:50.379 
going through any turn flats there but

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.059 
going through any turn flats there but
then<00:05:50.589> I'm<00:05:50.740> very<00:05:51.039> happy<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:51.990> think<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.710> be<00:05:53.830> here

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
then I'm very happy I think to be here

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.769 
then I'm very happy I think to be here
to<00:05:54.339> sporting<00:05:54.789> days<00:05:55.059> after<00:05:55.479> the<00:05:55.569> major
