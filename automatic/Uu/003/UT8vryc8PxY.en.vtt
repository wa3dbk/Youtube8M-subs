00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.399
 and 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.980
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.670
 the rising 2 case west is another expansion 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.820
 of rising 2 as you already know well this I 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.040
 I'm playing it in xbox, it's worth it 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.619
 in xbox is where I have all the 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.140
 expansions of this game wrong so 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.240
 well this is tea rising 2 case west and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.490
 well this is the beginning of the game 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.829
 when we started here here we started in 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.210
 this piece of here we have to kill a 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.820
 bunch of zombies and then we go out here 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.050
 It is not right where I am now because 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.170
 well what we have to do is catch 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.820
 the bookshelf until we'll see out there 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.210
 there are quite a few things worth because we can 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.550
 pick up a little as the bookshelf is 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.199
 metal and we have to place it right here 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.790
 ahead it's worth kot to do as a 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.940
 kind of ramp 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.980
 to then be able to come up with the car worth 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.690
 and so you can leave the map 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.830
 now you will see at the beginning it costs me a 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.200
 little because I did not know well how to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.590
 place it and just that is more or less 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.520
 so they make a kind of ramp 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.560
 and the next thing you have to do is 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.700
 take a pallet of these here is worth 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.180
 wood 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.909
 ok and just put it in front 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.570
 from the shelf on the floor so that 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.630
 do a little bit like 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.979
 like the soil not so that it stops so 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.780
 then when we add with the car be 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.410
 easier, but many times 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.990
 I tried sometimes with the car you give 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.790
 so strong to the shelf that it breaks 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.770
 the car does not stay there with the wheels 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.200
 rises but does not get to rise at all 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.090
 what you have to do is climb the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.210
 pull or if it does not rise whole it does not work 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.210
 you are welcome 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.220
 now you will see that I go up there is already 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.689
 easy what sometimes breaks and there's no 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.619
 that put the car here then in this 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.270
 corner and when you get out of the car 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.700
 by the back of the car it's worth 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.019
 because otherwise I could not climb or climb 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 on top of the car and traspasa is the wall 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.550
 this 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.860
 and now we are supposedly out of the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.990
 map not that we are out of the sea but 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.060
 we are inside but we are in an area 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.300
 in which it has not yet been unlocked 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.970
 or as you see the partner can not not 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.230
 it can happen because the machine does not know 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.060
 leave the map because it is as if the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.880
 good machine the partner stays 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.960
 inside and good this area here is 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.880
 all this area is what I say that 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.740
 then as you play you will 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.230
 unblock and then you can be by this 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.780
 area what happens that this whole area is 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.700
 plagued by zombies is worth it and now as 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.380
 we have jumped because there is not a single 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.330
 Valuable zombie we can be freely 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.220
 all over the map where we want to 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.780
 there is not a zombie the door is here and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.090
 now fair 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.380
 right behind it's worth right now 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.750
 closed but then as it goes 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.390
 playing that opens up then you can 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.870
 move wherever you want but as I say 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.060
 right now there is no one 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.830
 this is to contribute what I said that 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.709
 door then it opens then you can 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.510
 go come and go as you like it 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.770
 what I say now that we have jumped 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.570
 we can be relatively 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.430
 we are not off the map but as if 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.370
 we were, since we are not in a 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.080
 zone where there are no zombies except those from 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.090
 there they are well closed that they do not 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.439
 they can leave 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.989
 surely good on my second channel 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.030
 there will be some gameplays on about this 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.129
 expansion and you'll see that this whole area 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.749
 from here it's all riddled with zombies 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.219
 worth and there is also no human the 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.030
 Humans how good they try 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:53.300
 shoot they try to kill us too 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.360
 so good the truth is that I like 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.770
 plus the other expansion the 300 case 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.840
 zero but good is also very 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.420
 all right 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.080
 This is longer is longer than the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.660
 another one to others much shorter but good 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.120
 and well there is no more secret worth 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.010
 just be here doing the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.680
 Cocoon out there just because there's nobody 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.690
 there is nothing left to kill or anything 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.170
 do simply then be out there 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.420
 circling 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.590
 and nothing was just a curiosity 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.380
 more than more than a trick of these so 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.720
 it was not even how to get off the map but it's still 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.040
 without leaving valencia we are in an area 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.860
 which, as I say, has not yet been 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.410
 unlocked and I still assume you do not 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.260
 we can be or we should not be in 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.750
 this area is still valid until a 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.200
 as certain things happen in what 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.300
 it's the story because we can not be 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.610
 here and little better because neither 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.050
 it has more secret so good I hope 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.700
 that you liked the video if it has 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.230
 liked to vote i like favorites and we 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.530
 we see in the next video greetings to 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.530
 everyone
