00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.420 
along my jawline and down the neck a
little<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:19.530> now<00:04:19.650> i'm<00:04:19.770> just<00:04:19.800> going<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> bust

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
little so now i'm just going to bust

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.990 
little so now i'm just going to bust
those<00:04:20.730> sharp<00:04:21.120> lines<00:04:21.390> out<00:04:22.520> pushing<00:04:23.520> up<00:04:23.820> and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
those sharp lines out pushing up and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.870 
those sharp lines out pushing up and
down<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.540> then<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.810> do<00:04:24.870> kind<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.380> an<00:04:25.500> up<00:04:25.740> up<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
down and then I do kind of an up up and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.730 
down and then I do kind of an up up and
down<00:04:26.940> jagged<00:04:27.570> motion<00:04:27.930> just<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.230> kind<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.500> blow

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
down jagged motion just to kind of blow

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.470 
down jagged motion just to kind of blow
it<00:04:28.890> out<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.040> little<00:04:29.310> bit<00:04:29.400> focusing<00:04:30.240> more<00:04:30.420> on

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
it out a little bit focusing more on

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.020 
it out a little bit focusing more on
brushing<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.290> up<00:04:31.500> just<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:32.370> that<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.640> lift<00:04:32.880> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
brushing it up just so that we lift the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.000 
brushing it up just so that we lift the
cheeks<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:35.780> then<00:04:36.780> i'm<00:04:36.990> taking<00:04:37.020> my<00:04:37.500> face<00:04:37.710> brush

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
cheeks and then i'm taking my face brush

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.380 
cheeks and then i'm taking my face brush
and<00:04:38.190> just<00:04:38.280> kind<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.550> blending<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.060> all

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
and just kind of blending that all

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.850 
and just kind of blending that all
together<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:39.990> we<00:04:40.080> don't<00:04:40.260> have<00:04:40.410> any<00:04:40.620> viewer

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
together so we don't have any viewer

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.680 
together so we don't have any viewer
harsh<00:04:41.160> lines<00:04:41.460> with<00:04:41.790> all<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.030> contouring

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
harsh lines with all of that contouring

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.900 
harsh lines with all of that contouring
and<00:04:42.870> bronzing<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.890> gotta<00:04:44.070> blend<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.430> face<00:04:44.610> to

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
and bronzing you gotta blend the face to

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.260 
and bronzing you gotta blend the face to
give<00:04:45.300> on<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.570> eyes<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.710> blend<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.040> face

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.510 

and<00:04:49.510> now<00:04:50.080> i'm<00:04:50.320> taking<00:04:50.350> where<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.070> blushes<00:04:51.490> in

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
and now i'm taking where the blushes in

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.760 
and now i'm taking where the blushes in
the<00:04:51.700> pallets<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.210> blush<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:53.020> like<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.710> one

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
the pallets of blush I like this one

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.160 
the pallets of blush I like this one
because<00:04:54.160> it's<00:04:54.490> more<00:04:54.670> of<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:54.880> neutrally<00:04:55.600> fleshy

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
because it's more of a neutrally fleshy

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.100 
because it's more of a neutrally fleshy
pink<00:04:57.160> color<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:58.360> didn't<00:04:58.660> really<00:04:58.750> want<00:04:59.020> to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
pink color and I didn't really want to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.020 
pink color and I didn't really want to
have<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.350> cheek<00:04:59.830> color<00:05:00.040> that<00:05:00.250> was<00:05:00.400> overwhelming

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
have a cheek color that was overwhelming

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.810 
have a cheek color that was overwhelming
so<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.330> neutral<00:05:01.870> kind<00:05:02.200> of<00:05:02.380> flush<00:05:03.190> is<00:05:03.490> really

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
so this neutral kind of flush is really

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.790 
so this neutral kind of flush is really
good<00:05:03.970> for<00:05:04.120> this<00:05:04.270> book<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:04.810> then<00:05:05.500> I'm<00:05:05.590> taking

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
good for this book and then I'm taking

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.160 
good for this book and then I'm taking
that<00:05:06.010> same<00:05:06.490> burgundy<00:05:07.210> color<00:05:07.480> that<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.840> put

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
that same burgundy color that I put

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.140 
that same burgundy color that I put
right<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:09.040> crease<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.760> am<00:05:09.820> putting

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
right in the crease and I am putting

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.360 
right in the crease and I am putting
that<00:05:10.360> on<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.660> bottom<00:05:10.780> lash<00:05:11.110> line<00:05:11.140> not<00:05:12.010> taking

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
that on the bottom lash line not taking

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.780 
that on the bottom lash line not taking
it<00:05:12.490> any<00:05:12.670> farther<00:05:12.970> than<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.510> center<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.290> then

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
it any farther than the center and then

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.950 
it any farther than the center and then
doing<00:05:15.790> the<00:05:15.910> same<00:05:16.120> thing<00:05:16.360> on<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.540> other<00:05:16.570> eye

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
doing the same thing on the other eye

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.020 
doing the same thing on the other eye
and<00:05:17.380> then<00:05:17.800> on<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:17.980> inner<00:05:18.160> corner<00:05:18.700> I'm<00:05:18.880> going

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
and then on the inner corner I'm going

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.900 
and then on the inner corner I'm going
to<00:05:19.150> take<00:05:19.390> that<00:05:19.450> color<00:05:20.080> zoom<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:21.040> green<00:05:21.640> color

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
to take that color zoom the green color

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.000 
to take that color zoom the green color
that<00:05:22.180> is<00:05:22.210> on<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.660> center<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:22.990> my<00:05:23.260> lid<00:05:23.470> I'm

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010

going<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.250> go<00:05:24.370> ahead<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.640> pop<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.660> on<00:05:25.960> the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
going to go ahead and pop that on the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:40.710 
going to go ahead and pop that on the
inner<00:05:26.770> part<00:05:27.280> of<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.640> bottom<00:05:28.090> lash

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.130 

and<00:05:41.370> I<00:05:42.370> did<00:05:42.610> feel<00:05:42.850> like<00:05:42.910> my<00:05:43.450> outer<00:05:43.630> corners

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
and I did feel like my outer corners

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.110 
and I did feel like my outer corners
needed<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:44.770> be<00:05:44.920> deep<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.280> up<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.580> little<00:05:45.730> bit<00:05:45.880> so
