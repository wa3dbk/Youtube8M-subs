 and another part as a martial art that is a bit more confident announced that it also 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.130

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.130
 practice more people 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.070
 what he is doing 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.690

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.170
 raise your arms so that bercy 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.900
 tai chi basically consists of changing the rates from one leg to the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.770
 other 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.110
 and a correct body structure pull out and put in a certain way 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.839
 to be able to practice it the head has to be suspended from above 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.770
 the back has to be relaxed the pelvis and the cures and forward of form 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.640
 let the children make out 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.660
 you have to lower the weight rounded joints 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.450
 if you have to maintain these this structure throughout all the 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.450
 movements throughout the day 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.060
 buzzi due to its smoothness and circular movements and so on is a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 activity that is recommended 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 for all the world the recent war no 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 specify physical condition neither by sex nor by age precisely not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.590
 Recommended mostly for older people 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 not for nothing but because other types of physical activities 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.990
 maybe they are more vigorous and of greater impact 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.030
 with which it is good for us to practice this because it is much more 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 slower softer 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 the risk of injury is practically null and people give him the real contribution 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.810
 mind very healthy benefits 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.159
 Slim domit comes in handy for example for topics of toporosi echoes is happening 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.539
 human or arthritis 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.440
 that kind of thing because it reinforces a lot from the innermost 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.620
 externally that is to say the musculature works to the tendons a lot 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
 this one after the crack 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.720
 this for example is called keeping to the left every movement of the form 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.040
 has a man now they are going to make the next move to choose the tail 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.069
 of the sparrow

 which consists of four other movements 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.199
 min 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.569
 own door the way beneficial as that 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.569
 in the case of older people for example coordination agility 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.590
 stability balance recovery of movement as that people each improvement 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.819
 It has some kind of operation although it lost mobility, so the arm or 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.769
 will start better with a class and can not 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.049
 moderation up here 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.549
 and little by little that move is recovering not like a thesis hour and 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.139
 not as a constant practice 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.249
 in front of 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.249
 a long period of time afp
