forward<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.110> trying<00:05:15.320> these<00:05:15.440> I<00:05:15.800> got<00:05:16.430> these<00:05:16.610> in

forward to trying these I got these in

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.430 
forward to trying these I got these in
eighth<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.930> quarter<00:05:19.900> it's<00:05:20.900> nice<00:05:21.050> about<00:05:21.289> these

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
eighth and quarter it's nice about these

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.499 
eighth and quarter it's nice about these
is<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.830> hook<00:05:21.979> I<00:05:22.130> think<00:05:22.340> just<00:05:22.550> because<00:05:22.669> your

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
is the hook I think just because your

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.999 
is the hook I think just because your
normal<00:05:23.780> chicky<00:05:24.020> has<00:05:24.169> got<00:05:24.349> that<00:05:24.470> real<00:05:24.620> big<00:05:24.770> barb

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
normal chicky has got that real big barb

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.640 
normal chicky has got that real big barb
on<00:05:25.190> it<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.460> your<00:05:25.580> worms<00:05:25.789> tend<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.180> tear<00:05:26.650> quite

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
on it and your worms tend to tear quite

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.439 
on it and your worms tend to tear quite
often<00:05:27.830> or<00:05:28.669> I<00:05:28.699> don't<00:05:28.789> think<00:05:29.000> they'll<00:05:29.120> tear<00:05:29.300> on

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
often or I don't think they'll tear on

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.050 
often or I don't think they'll tear on
these<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.860> let's<00:05:31.250> get<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.520> app<00:05:31.639> should<00:05:31.849> hold

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
these so let's get the app should hold

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.339 
these so let's get the app should hold
that<00:05:32.120> worm<00:05:32.360> up<00:05:32.539> there<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:33.770> guys<00:05:33.949> can<00:05:34.099> see<00:05:34.220> that

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
that worm up there you guys can see that

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.270 
that worm up there you guys can see that
so<00:05:36.349> I<00:05:36.500> think<00:05:36.590> these<00:05:36.770> should<00:05:36.919> work<00:05:36.979> pretty<00:05:37.220> good

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
so I think these should work pretty good

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.320
