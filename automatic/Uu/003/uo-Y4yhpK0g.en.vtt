00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
than it used to be so that being said a

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.810 
than it used to be so that being said a
lot<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> people<00:00:40.260> used<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> use<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.640> then

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
lot of people used to use it but then

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
lot of people used to use it but then
stopped<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.530> too<00:00:43.739> common

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
stopped it's really not too common

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.889 
stopped it's really not too common
anymore<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.940> still<00:00:45.149> has<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> good<00:00:45.360> move<00:00:45.660> set

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
anymore it still has a good move set

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389 
anymore it still has a good move set
that<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.230> still<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> pretty<00:00:46.860> fun<00:00:47.039> weapon<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that one is still a pretty fun weapon to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
that one is still a pretty fun weapon to
use<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.149> also<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.450> believe<00:00:48.690> has<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> slightly

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
use it also I believe has a slightly

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.439 
use it also I believe has a slightly
faster<00:00:49.590> swing<00:00:50.309> speed<00:00:50.610> than<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.820> other<00:00:51.059> great

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
faster swing speed than the other great

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.630 
faster swing speed than the other great
x<00:00:51.660> class<00:00:51.960> weapons<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.039> definitely<00:00:53.489> got

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
x class weapons and it's definitely got

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
x class weapons and it's definitely got
more<00:00:53.789> reach<00:00:54.059> than<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.449> others<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
more reach than the others so that's a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
more reach than the others so that's a
good<00:00:55.710> thing<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.360> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> makes

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
good thing and you know it kind of makes

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.180 
good thing and you know it kind of makes
sense<00:00:57.989> why<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.260> patched<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:58.949> doing

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
sense why they patched it it was doing

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
sense why they patched it it was doing
way<00:00:59.340> more<00:00:59.609> than<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.000> should<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.449> been<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:01.020> my

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

to<00:01:55.290> hit<00:01:55.380> someone<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.799> them<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.329> do

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to hit someone with them but when you do

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810 
to hit someone with them but when you do
the<00:01:58.259> feeling<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.100> worth<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.490> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the feeling you get it's worth it so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.330 
the feeling you get it's worth it so
that's<00:02:00.750> why<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.740> them<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> lot

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that's why I like to go for them a lot

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
that's why I like to go for them a lot
well<00:02:02.729> entertaining<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.360> than<00:02:03.750> just

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
well entertaining this than just

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.480 
well entertaining this than just
pressing<00:02:04.110> r1<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.770> day<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.189> know

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
pressing r1 all day you know

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.240 
pressing r1 all day you know
so<00:02:06.439> anyway<00:02:07.439> getting<00:02:07.890> started

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so anyway getting started

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.750 
so anyway getting started
the<00:02:09.760> biggest<00:02:10.210> pro<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:11.350> weapon<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.040> would

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
the biggest pro of this weapon I would

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.820 
the biggest pro of this weapon I would
have<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.030> say<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> biggest<00:02:13.900> pro<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
have to say that the biggest pro of the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.540 
have to say that the biggest pro of the
weapon<00:02:15.130> would<00:02:15.370> be<00:02:15.870> probably<00:02:16.870> its<00:02:17.320> reach<00:02:17.710> now

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
weapon would be probably its reach now

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.820 
weapon would be probably its reach now
that's<00:02:19.240> kind<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.690> strange<00:02:19.990> thing<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.620> say

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
that's kind of a strange thing to say

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.490 
that's kind of a strange thing to say
for<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.490> great<00:02:22.090> x-class<00:02:22.570> weapon<00:02:22.960> but<00:02:23.200> think

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
for a great x-class weapon but think

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.970 
for a great x-class weapon but think
about<00:02:23.680> it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
about it

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.070 
about it
it's<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.490> great<00:02:24.700> axe<00:02:24.910> this<00:02:25.330> thing<00:02:25.540> has<00:02:25.750> some

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
it's a great axe this thing has some

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.550 
it's a great axe this thing has some
pretty<00:02:26.320> big<00:02:26.740> reach<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.000> mean<00:02:28.560> it's

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
pretty big reach to it I mean it's

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.100 
pretty big reach to it I mean it's
really<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.430> really<00:02:30.520> good<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.510> got<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
really it's really good it's got the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.140 
really it's really good it's got the
longest<00:02:32.680> reach<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.100> all<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.490> great<00:02:33.670> x-class

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
longest reach of all the great x-class

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.570 
longest reach of all the great x-class
weapons<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:35.440> still<00:02:35.860> hits<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.130> fair<00:02:36.340> amount<00:02:36.460> of

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
weapons it still hits a fair amount of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.670 
weapons it still hits a fair amount of
damage<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.570> can't<00:02:37.870> say<00:02:38.020> that's<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.260> con<00:02:38.440> it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
damage so you can't say that's a con it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.410 
damage so you can't say that's a con it
does<00:02:38.860> hit<00:02:39.040> less<00:02:39.190> than<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.460> used<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:40.180> it

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
does hit less than it used to but it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.210 
does hit less than it used to but it
still<00:02:40.690> hits<00:02:40.900> pretty<00:02:41.050> good<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:42.070> got<00:02:42.190> a

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
still hits pretty good it's got a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.370 
still hits pretty good it's got a
slightly<00:02:42.520> faster<00:02:42.640> swing<00:02:43.240> speed<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:44.290> that's

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
slightly faster swing speed so that's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.370 
slightly faster swing speed so that's
also<00:02:44.920> pretty<00:02:45.190> good<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:46.600> move<00:02:46.780> set<00:02:47.020> leaves<00:02:47.260> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
also pretty good the move set leaves a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.770 
also pretty good the move set leaves a
little<00:02:47.590> bit<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.800> be<00:02:47.890> desired<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.700> yeah<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.600> is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
little bit to be desired but yeah it is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.510 
little bit to be desired but yeah it is
what<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.440> would<00:02:50.800> be<00:02:50.830> nice<00:02:51.070> if<00:02:51.130> it's<00:02:51.370> our

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
what it is it would be nice if it's our

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.490 
what it is it would be nice if it's our
2s<00:02:51.760> were<00:02:51.910> easier<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.360> hit<00:02:52.480> with<00:02:52.660> but<00:02:52.960> then<00:02:53.140> it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
2s were easier to hit with but then it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.470 
2s were easier to hit with but then it
wouldn't<00:02:53.770> be<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.220> satisfying<00:02:54.880> or<00:02:55.120> fun<00:02:55.360> to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
wouldn't be so satisfying or fun to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.110 
wouldn't be so satisfying or fun to
attempt<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.740> there's<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:59.490> have<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.520> decent

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
attempt so there's that I have a decent

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.670 
attempt so there's that I have a decent
bit<00:03:01.240> of<00:03:01.330> luck<00:03:01.510> with<00:03:01.840> hitting<00:03:02.080> people<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.530> their

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
bit of luck with hitting people in their

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.410 
bit of luck with hitting people in their
instability<00:03:03.310> frames<00:03:03.610> with<00:03:03.850> this<00:03:04.030> weapon<00:03:04.330> I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
instability frames with this weapon I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.450 
instability frames with this weapon I
don't<00:03:04.570> know<00:03:04.660> why<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.200> or<00:03:05.560> what's<00:03:06.100> causing

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
don't know why it is or what's causing

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.980 
don't know why it is or what's causing
it<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.760> happen<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.210> just<00:03:07.240> have<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.600> bit<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.870> luck

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
it to happen I just have a bit of luck

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.240 
it to happen I just have a bit of luck
with<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.520> maybe<00:03:09.520> that's<00:03:09.730> just<00:03:09.880> me<00:03:11.250> another

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
with it maybe that's just me another

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.640 
with it maybe that's just me another
good<00:03:12.640> thing<00:03:12.670> about<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.239> it's<00:03:13.450> rolling<00:03:14.350> attacks

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
good thing about it it's rolling attacks

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.520 
good thing about it it's rolling attacks
you<00:03:15.310> can<00:03:15.489> dangle<00:03:15.850> them<00:03:16.120> incredibly<00:03:16.780> easily<00:03:16.989> so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
you can dangle them incredibly easily so

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.949 
you can dangle them incredibly easily so
you<00:03:17.830> just<00:03:18.550> sort<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.820> roll<00:03:19.090> towards<00:03:19.420> them<00:03:19.600> pull

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
you just sort of roll towards them pull

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.810 
you just sort of roll towards them pull
back<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> controller<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.100> unlock<00:03:21.489> and

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
back on the controller and unlock and

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.979 
back on the controller and unlock and
then<00:03:21.940> you'll<00:03:22.090> die<00:03:22.239> dangle<00:03:22.570> someone<00:03:22.900> if

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
then you'll die dangle someone if

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.479 
then you'll die dangle someone if
they've<00:03:23.140> got<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.410> shield<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.650> works<00:03:24.070> really

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
they've got the shield that works really

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.080 
they've got the shield that works really
well<00:03:24.610> really<00:03:25.180> easily<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.980> good<00:03:27.910> for

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
well really easily and is good for

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.550 
well really easily and is good for
people<00:03:28.360> who<00:03:28.390> turtle<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.080> lot<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:29.980> there's<00:03:30.430> that

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
people who turtle a lot so there's that

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.860 
people who turtle a lot so there's that
let's<00:03:32.560> see<00:03:32.800> other<00:03:33.070> pros<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.239> weapon<00:03:36.870> yeah

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
let's see other pros of the weapon yeah

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.979 
let's see other pros of the weapon yeah
that<00:03:38.050> pretty<00:03:38.290> much<00:03:38.440> actually<00:03:38.890> sums<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.280> up<00:03:39.340> so

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
that pretty much actually sums it up so

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.540 
that pretty much actually sums it up so
moving<00:03:40.989> into<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.290> cons<00:03:41.560> right<00:03:41.860> now<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.100> would

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
moving into the cons right now I would

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.759 
moving into the cons right now I would
have<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.760> say<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.330> biggest<00:03:43.780> con<00:03:44.050> of<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
have to say that the biggest con of the

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.310 
have to say that the biggest con of the

that you can't get it very easily if you

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.830 
that you can't get it very easily if you

let's talking about the cons of the
weapon<00:04:49.180> now<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.020> biggest<00:04:50.169> con<00:04:50.470> I

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
weapon now so the biggest con I

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.860 
weapon now so the biggest con I
mentioned<00:04:51.100> other<00:04:51.790> kinds<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.450> weapon<00:04:52.720> I

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
mentioned other kinds of the weapon I

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.510 
mentioned other kinds of the weapon I
would<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.290> say<00:04:53.440> would<00:04:53.590> be<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.770> r2s<00:04:54.280> and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
would have to say would be the r2s and

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.469 
would have to say would be the r2s and
how<00:04:54.610> difficult<00:04:55.120> they<00:04:55.210> are<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.570> hit<00:04:55.870> with<00:04:56.050> and

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
how difficult they are to hit with and

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.750 
how difficult they are to hit with and
from<00:04:58.479> there<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:59.290> would<00:04:59.830> have<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.130> say<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.610> next

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
from there I would have to say the next

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.150 
from there I would have to say the next
con<00:05:01.150> would<00:05:01.419> probably<00:05:01.840> be<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.020> weight<00:05:02.229> 16

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
con would probably be the weight 16

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.370 
con would probably be the weight 16
units<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.639> not<00:05:03.880> bad<00:05:04.120> especially<00:05:04.419> for<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.080> Black

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
units is not bad especially for a Black

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.740 
units is not bad especially for a Black
Knight<00:05:05.410> weapon<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.160> especially<00:05:07.090> for<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.479> great

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
Knight weapon and especially for a great

X but that being said not everyone can

X but that being said not everyone can
use<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.229> it's<00:05:11.410> not<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.770> lightest<00:05:12.130> weapon<00:05:12.520> in

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
use it it's not the lightest weapon in

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.890 
use it it's not the lightest weapon in
the<00:05:12.700> game<00:05:12.820> by<00:05:13.090> any<00:05:13.300> stretch<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.750> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
imagination so that's something to keep

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.420 
imagination so that's something to keep
in<00:05:16.510> mind<00:05:16.570> you'll<00:05:17.140> probably<00:05:17.530> need<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.890> bill<00:05:18.280> that

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
in mind you'll probably need a bill that

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.100 
in mind you'll probably need a bill that
can<00:05:18.550> handle<00:05:18.729> a<00:05:19.000> lot<00:05:19.180> of<00:05:19.240> weight<00:05:19.570> in<00:05:19.750> order<00:05:19.870> to

can handle a lot of weight in order to

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.990 
can handle a lot of weight in order to
use<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:20.470> which<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:20.919> not<00:05:21.130> necessarily<00:05:21.640> a<00:05:21.820> bad

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
use it which is not necessarily a bad

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.950 
use it which is not necessarily a bad
thing<00:05:22.650> now<00:05:23.650> as<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.250> can<00:05:24.370> see<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.880> am<00:05:25.600> NOT
