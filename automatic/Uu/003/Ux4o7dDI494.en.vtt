to sleep into an armhole and putting the

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.590 
to sleep into an armhole and putting the
sleeve<00:00:19.750> into<00:00:19.990> this<00:00:20.260> top<00:00:20.700> the<00:00:21.700> top<00:00:21.970> itself<00:00:22.330> is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
sleeve into this top the top itself is

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.870 
sleeve into this top the top itself is
wrong<00:00:23.530> side<00:00:23.830> out<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:26.140> sleeve<00:00:26.440> is<00:00:26.830> right<00:00:27.610> side

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
wrong side out the sleeve is right side

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.269 
wrong side out the sleeve is right side
out<00:00:27.910> you<00:00:28.300> can<00:00:28.480> see<00:00:28.600> the<00:00:28.630> print<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.260> I<00:00:29.920> have<00:00:30.130> the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
out you can see the print and I have the

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.729 
out you can see the print and I have the
sleeve<00:00:30.520> inserted<00:00:31.180> into<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.020> armhole<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:32.619> it's

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
sleeve inserted into the armhole so it's

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.049 
sleeve inserted into the armhole so it's
inside<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.790> garment<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.980> there<00:00:36.730> are<00:00:36.850> a<00:00:36.910> lot

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
inside the garment and there are a lot

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.119 
inside the garment and there are a lot
of<00:00:37.090> landmarks<00:00:37.840> along<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.620> way<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:38.830> help<00:00:39.040> you

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
of landmarks along the way that help you

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.920 
of landmarks along the way that help you
to<00:00:39.220> line<00:00:39.400> this<00:00:39.580> up<00:00:39.820> I<00:00:40.030> start<00:00:40.629> with<00:00:40.780> the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
to line this up I start with the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.210 
to line this up I start with the
underarm<00:00:41.379> seam<00:00:41.970> so<00:00:42.970> I'm<00:00:43.650> put<00:00:44.650> placing<00:00:45.100> the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
underarm seam so I'm put placing the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.160 
underarm seam so I'm put placing the
underarm<00:00:45.640> seams<00:00:45.850> together<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.629> I'll<00:00:46.900> pin<00:00:47.140> it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
underarm seams together and I'll pin it

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.950 
underarm seams together and I'll pin it
the<00:00:48.160> reason<00:00:48.400> you<00:00:48.460> have<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.760> top<00:00:49.120> wrong<00:00:49.690> side

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
the reason you have the top wrong side

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960 
the reason you have the top wrong side
out<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.380> sleeve<00:00:51.010> right<00:00:51.220> side<00:00:51.550> out<00:00:51.579> so<00:00:51.880> you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
out and the sleeve right side out so you

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.750 
out and the sleeve right side out so you
can<00:00:52.090> put<00:00:52.239> these<00:00:52.390> right<00:00:52.540> sides<00:00:52.810> together<00:00:53.020> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
can put these right sides together and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.650 
can put these right sides together and
so<00:00:54.760> this<00:00:54.880> ends<00:00:55.090> up<00:00:55.149> being<00:00:55.210> right<00:00:55.420> side

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
so this ends up being right side

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.870 
so this ends up being right side
together<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.110> I<00:00:56.140> always<00:00:56.350> pin<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.800> in<00:00:57.010> the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
together and I always pin it in the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.380 
together and I always pin it in the
sleeve<00:00:58.120> so<00:00:58.450> it's<00:00:58.570> on<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.780> inside<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:01.270> you

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
sleeve so it's on the inside then you

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.840 
sleeve so it's on the inside then you
have<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.600> notch<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.890> double<00:01:03.219> notches<00:01:03.370> at<00:01:03.700> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
have a notch there double notches at the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.030 
have a notch there double notches at the
back<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.930> see<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.170> double<00:01:05.470> notches<00:01:05.649> in<00:01:05.950> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.210 

now<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.990> between<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.470> might<00:01:53.650> have<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:53.830> little

now in between you might have a little

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.390 
now in between you might have a little
bit<00:01:54.370> more<00:01:54.640> fullness<00:01:55.300> in<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.660> sleeve<00:01:56.140> cap<00:01:56.440> than

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
bit more fullness in the sleeve cap than

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.090 
bit more fullness in the sleeve cap than
you<00:01:57.520> do<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.910> armhole<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.860> for<00:02:00.070> a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
you do in the armhole that's for a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.490 
you do in the armhole that's for a
little<00:02:00.280> bit<00:02:00.370> of<00:02:00.430> ease<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.790> movement<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:02.410> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
little bit of ease of movement so to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.740 
little bit of ease of movement so to
distribute<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.310> ease<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.910> start<00:02:04.570> in<00:02:04.660> the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
distribute that ease I start in the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.590 
distribute that ease I start in the
middle<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:06.040> sleeve<00:02:06.310> cap<00:02:06.550> in<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.330> middle

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
middle of the sleeve cap in the middle

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.660 
middle of the sleeve cap in the middle
of<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.020> armhole<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.979> middle<00:02:09.220> being<00:02:09.369> between

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
of the armhole the middle being between

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.870 
of the armhole the middle being between
these<00:02:09.880> two<00:02:10.149> other<00:02:11.080> pins<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.810> pin<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
these two other pins and pin that and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.920 
these two other pins and pin that and
then<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.060> do<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.330> couple<00:02:16.450> more<00:02:16.660> times<00:02:18.930> just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
then you do it a couple more times just

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.660 
then you do it a couple more times just
to<00:02:20.110> smooth<00:02:20.410> out<00:02:20.560> as<00:02:20.770> much<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.160> can

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
to smooth out as much as you can

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.820 
to smooth out as much as you can
I'll<00:02:22.540> reduce<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:24.370> extra<00:02:24.760> fullness<00:02:25.830> you're

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
I'll reduce that extra fullness you're

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.340 
I'll reduce that extra fullness you're
just<00:02:27.040> distributing<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.820> evenly<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.170> don't

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
just distributing it evenly so you don't

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
just distributing it evenly so you don't
have<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.709> pleat<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:30.220> one<00:02:30.430> point<00:02:31.890> or<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:33.100> bunch<00:02:33.310> of

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
have a pleat at one point or a bunch of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.630 
have a pleat at one point or a bunch of
fullness<00:02:33.670> all<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:33.970> one<00:02:34.120> place<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.490> can<00:02:36.580> see

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
fullness all in one place so you can see

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.300 
fullness all in one place so you can see
it<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:36.940> takes<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.209> few<00:02:37.390> extra<00:02:37.450> pins<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.980> you

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
it just takes a few extra pins and you

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.000 
it just takes a few extra pins and you
have<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:40.300> fits<00:02:40.570> pretty<00:02:40.750> nicely<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.709> does

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
have that it fits pretty nicely it does

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.690 
have that it fits pretty nicely it does
look<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.280> you've<00:02:42.580> got<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> little<00:02:42.970> bit<00:02:43.180> of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
look like you've got a little bit of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.810 
look like you've got a little bit of
kind<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.790> ruffling<00:02:46.180> here<00:02:46.709> but<00:02:47.709> when<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:48.640> sew

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
kind of ruffling here but when you sew

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.640 
kind of ruffling here but when you sew
it<00:02:48.940> together<00:02:49.080> it'll<00:02:50.080> work<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.350> just<00:02:50.410> fine

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
it together it'll work out just fine

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.320 
it together it'll work out just fine
it'll<00:02:51.070> look<00:02:51.490> just<00:02:51.790> fine

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
it'll look just fine

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.660 
it'll look just fine
do<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.050> same<00:02:53.230> thing<00:02:53.470> here<00:02:53.830> on<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.160> front<00:02:54.459> and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
do the same thing here on the front and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.490 
do the same thing here on the front and
there's<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> little<00:02:55.660> bit<00:02:55.810> less<00:02:56.020> of<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
there's a little bit less of it in the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.780 
there's a little bit less of it in the
front<00:02:56.680> there's<00:02:56.890> usually<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.220> little<00:02:57.370> bit<00:02:57.610> more

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
front there's usually a little bit more

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.220 
front there's usually a little bit more
fullness<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.360> back<00:02:58.510> then<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.989> front

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
fullness in the back then in the front

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.850 
fullness in the back then in the front
because<00:03:00.070> that's<00:03:00.250> really<00:03:00.459> where<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.790> need<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
because that's really where you need the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.210 
because that's really where you need the
extra<00:03:03.370> for<00:03:03.700> movement<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:07.360> again<00:03:07.630> here<00:03:08.220> I'll

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
extra for movement and again here I'll

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.290 
extra for movement and again here I'll
show<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.489> think<00:03:09.670> I'm<00:03:09.760> going<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:09.970> move<00:03:10.060> that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
show you think I'm going to move that

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.089 
show you think I'm going to move that
down<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.570> bit<00:03:11.820> move<00:03:12.820> this<00:03:13.120> down<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.450> bit

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.539 

and<00:03:16.670> another<00:03:17.090> pin<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.540> here<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.430> don't<00:03:19.430> have

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
and another pin in here I don't have

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.339 
and another pin in here I don't have
that<00:03:19.849> distributed<00:03:20.450> pretty<00:03:20.689> well<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:24.079> then<00:03:24.230> you

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
that distributed pretty well so then you

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.349 
that distributed pretty well so then you
have<00:03:24.590> your<00:03:25.340> sleeve<00:03:25.639> pinned<00:03:25.999> into<00:03:26.239> your

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
have your sleeve pinned into your

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.099 
have your sleeve pinned into your
armhole<00:03:26.719> stick<00:03:27.079> another<00:03:27.290> pin<00:03:27.620> here<00:03:28.959> just<00:03:29.959> to

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
armhole stick another pin here just to

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.319 
armhole stick another pin here just to
make<00:03:30.260> sure<00:03:30.290> everything's<00:03:30.769> lined<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.189> don't<00:03:32.180> be

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
make sure everything's lined up don't be

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.780 
make sure everything's lined up don't be
afraid<00:03:32.599> of<00:03:32.719> pinning<00:03:33.079> things<00:03:33.430> if<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.609> need

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
afraid of pinning things if you need

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.149 
afraid of pinning things if you need
pins<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.329> hold<00:03:35.540> things<00:03:35.689> together<00:03:35.930> go<00:03:36.920> ahead

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
pins to hold things together go ahead

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.069 
pins to hold things together go ahead
and<00:03:37.280> do<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.389> there<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.629> have<00:03:38.659> it<00:03:38.840> pinned

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
and do it so there you have it pinned

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.020 
and do it so there you have it pinned
together<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:39.709> I'm<00:03:40.099> going<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.400> take<00:03:40.579> it<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.790> my

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
together and I'm going to take it to my

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.830 
together and I'm going to take it to my
machine<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.530> sew

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.449 

I<00:03:51.030> started<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.150> underarm<00:03:52.510> seam<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:54.160> put<00:03:54.370> it

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
I started the underarm seam just put it

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.790 
I started the underarm seam just put it
into<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.819> machine<00:03:55.230> my<00:03:56.230> half<00:03:56.410> inch<00:03:56.590> seam

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
into the machine my half inch seam

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.979 
into the machine my half inch seam
allowance<00:03:58.560> take<00:03:59.560> out<00:03:59.739> that<00:03:59.950> pin<00:04:00.870> because<00:04:01.870> you

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
allowance take out that pin because you

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.369 
allowance take out that pin because you
don't<00:04:02.200> want<00:04:02.379> to<00:04:02.530> be<00:04:02.940> try<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.000> avoid<00:04:04.379> stitching

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
don't want to be try to avoid stitching

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.259 
don't want to be try to avoid stitching
over<00:04:05.500> pins<00:04:05.950> because<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.090> break<00:04:07.239> your

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
over pins because you can break your

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:15.170 
over pins because you can break your
needle<00:04:07.540> you'll<00:04:07.900> certainly<00:04:08.080> Bend<00:04:08.470> your<00:04:08.590> pins

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.909 

you<00:04:16.180> don't<00:04:16.419> really<00:04:16.600> need<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.900> stitch<00:04:17.709> right

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
you don't really need to stitch right

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:43.650 
you don't really need to stitch right
over<00:04:41.430> I'm<00:04:42.430> getting<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.030> area<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.389> was<00:04:43.630> a

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
over I'm getting to that area that was a

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.020 
over I'm getting to that area that was a
little<00:04:43.870> bit<00:04:43.990> fuller<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:45.729> see<00:04:45.880> that

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
little bit fuller but you can see that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.960 
little bit fuller but you can see that
as<00:04:46.180> I'm<00:04:46.360> stitching<00:04:50.520> it's<00:04:51.520> going<00:04:51.789> through

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
as I'm stitching it's going through
