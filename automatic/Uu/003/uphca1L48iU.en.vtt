out go there possible yeah it's a

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.970 
out go there possible yeah it's a
possible<00:02:41.930> tornado<00:02:42.080> that's<00:02:42.530> where<00:02:42.830> we're

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
possible tornado that's where we're

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.069

actually<00:02:45.829> stir<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.370> time<00:02:46.549> so<00:02:46.760> just<00:02:46.910> subtract

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
actually stir in time so just subtract

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.530 
actually stir in time so just subtract

tornado safety propriety necessary is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.869 
tornado safety propriety necessary is
where<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.530> possible<00:03:10.010> tornado<00:03:10.459> could<00:03:10.730> be

where the possible tornado could be

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.170 
where the possible tornado could be
let's<00:03:11.840> take<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.079> look<00:03:12.319> at<00:03:12.819> okay<00:03:13.819> right<00:03:14.030> now

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
let's take a look at okay right now

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.379 
let's take a look at okay right now
we're<00:03:14.390> not<00:03:14.420> seeing<00:03:14.540> any<00:03:14.900> shear<00:03:15.200> with<00:03:15.349> that<00:03:15.530> so

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
elevated which means that it probably

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.490 
elevated which means that it probably
won't<00:04:19.700> create<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.209> tornado<00:04:20.780> at<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.079> present
