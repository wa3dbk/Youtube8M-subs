00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.160
 Year nine people 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.120
 I would like 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.959
 with this video a new he he is in early May a new video series and indeed 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.729
 for the best routes ban Finest 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.309
 for a us chain 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.850
 and we have quite a few people owning an Owner Torch 4gb team 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.200
 is a part of 4g bought who of course synonymous hd streams there 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.380
 I'm also trying a few others to make and bring in for the old one 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.249
 iPod 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.869
 but then Rostock op 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.560
 pull the first one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.669
 Menz point of view 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.870
 One was SAP for like to Reach the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.980
 it's depriving her of available for I believe $ 3 or something 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.290
 and I have to say 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.660
 as the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.600
 Zeiser 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.479
 and Kenya have really put a lot of work into it 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.920
 you look beautiful that's the lock-screen yours 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.479
 just like that 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.089
 this is how your lock-screen looks like 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.300
 and all this is animated in html5 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.330
 that means it's not a video 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.260
 but that it all html5 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.350
 and that's why hardly any Orco consumes more than a normal moped 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050
 and I'm pretty cool 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.430
 So what you see here is once 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.619
 You can also set a fixed background image of yours 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.540
 then Jobe's new real wallpaper on the home screen 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.640
 here in this box you see yours 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.790
 normal to Bob has something set for the lock-screen 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.340
 and the uncertain animated faithfully easy 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.479
 Incidentally, what moves this one to one can also be his wish 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.510
 to adjust 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.050
 if you go around 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.280
 eg to attract 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.350
 with which we then 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.790
 Ing ours 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.250
 Fame on our homepage hardly penetrates the first thing that strikes Dr as a little 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.149
 animated 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.780
 then you animated around our wallpaper the project is called that one 

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.359
 just below zero I am and then that was and already we have in the 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.470
 Westerbauer 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.960
 at this English may be from one can change it to degrees Celsius 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.159
 and then of course that has to 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.000
 to adapt to us there one just goes on 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.540
 Wohlrab and Georg u point come 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.659
 enter his city there and then copy from the Jurahalle 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.920
 his gmx giggs address 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.360
 and then you have to fall into a falling team of prisoners 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 Configuration file Woitas can change 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.219
 so could go there 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.549
 that the men, as I said, allow a certain fidelity to arise 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.479
 you see 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:21.519
 the ICANN are square nice animated wallpaper I have 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.379
 Yes, we have shown that we are getting so free of charge that is from these 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
 Many I promised to do a review 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.980
 I have to say it is a lot of ICANN filmed it and I have not 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.339
 arranged every year 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:35.299
 I just wanted a few 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.419
 to show you this completely once 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.729
 you also see up here 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.249
 it filmed completely filmed 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.539
 The w-lan own completely filmed and Steger distribution we have really is 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:50.709
 a lot of people liked it so much so you can get 9 percent of it one or two 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.169
 ICANN board with four Beck 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.169
 the palm is missing nothing 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.189
 but 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.540
 in the settings the loading screens of many applications are filmed 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:08.199
 Percent agree most settings here to turn everything on and off 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.129
 yes what you need it will still jump prudence and although I'm on 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.449
 the homescreen goes there he puts her on the clock and the clock 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.199
 could remove wisdom with lock-screen 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.339
 if I did not do that now then that would be the whole thing 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.439
 So here to just like clock overwrite and then not right 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.839
 work that would be stupid I can not even show how the whole without 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.909
 lock-screen Clock looks old 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.309
 I could just Renzi the store 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:35.699
 the whole looks on 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.590
 so empty 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.440
 Worrying about a rotation and of course that's stupid that bothers them 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.509
 not alone 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.509
 Everyone had so to speak, 2 million time so that would have to be removed 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.349
 About St "It's a terrific job what the two themes are here 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.609
 everything is really very good I show it 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.589
 a few different shot now 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:59.119
 which you can set a colorful bot so easy and open immediately 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.989
 and then you can see the different settings of the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.659
 Finisher out of everything you need this 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.819
 EA plans set their HD 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.579
 He also heard one flee 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.109
 here and now not everything but here 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.409
 The whole is available in different colors 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.279
 one can 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.799
 a time still up 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.799
 because this I have to show you in the test as easy 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.009
 we still have different animated Springboks 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.999
 That's what I showed you 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.169
 "And I just think it's the 10th 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.439
 To indicate that there are many add-ons on the OWD painting page 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.619
 So maybe thousands of haze he fills in addition here 800 missing 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.139
 Chandhok sites and there are quite a few add-ons 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.159
 and of course I think that's really cool 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.460
 So look at the tiger's everything if you do that someday 

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:46.290
 download 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.349
 and then I'll do it here 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.969
 then the Asus one at a time 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.169
 Of course there are many more nice memories they have 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.689
 Now one more jump the man on the Mad Men as old ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.009
 around the Emssee Schwoerer Bates lock-screen 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.909
 and there you have it 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.189
 Just a few women directly showing how the weather is now making its appearance 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.760
 he follows 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.240
 I have already shown many photos of the film 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.470
 If we attract the whole animal percent, I still have another one now 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.889
 picked up about 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.370
 the point is on women now 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.240
 in this example 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.279
 but there are 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.409
 just a lot of Eltons for all the stuff here 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.550
 there is still a metric sovereign 11 below that I can quite easily do it for him 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.580
 also seemed 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.229
 and around 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.850
 yes, there are just so many things 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.370
 heaps of it 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.819
 Bad weather stuff 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.990
 i can be very different blasting weeks in his home 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.629
 Springboard 5 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.639
 and maybe he will be able to produce this product 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.110
 and just a lot of stuff 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.119
 Percent where you can just look and try 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.810
 Well not say who is watching 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.450
 Prof Famous is a Mast Halfing it just looks awesome 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.529
 cool 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.819
 and that's really it 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.639
 because it's running smoothly is running fine 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.639
 "And I just think it's wonderful 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.909
 the people who make such a movie 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.409
 "I'm working very hard 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.689
 this one bus was to make teams 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.200
 and that's why I ask you 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.750
 Respect this work and buy such a team too 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.449
 if you like that 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.529
 Consecration when DICE people work on it to make their money USA is there 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:33.010
 Not 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.569
 for example, people do not earn their money Metz 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:38.839
 and 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:43.209
 Year when you know all this beautiful things EHEC stretches his commercial know 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.980
 much more 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.839
 and secondly 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:49.309
 People do not support four workers of Yemen once a year 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.589
 here's four workers the race is you want her even financier money for it 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.319
 to have 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.550
 the whole theme of the episodes I saw did not seem to fill him with torture 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.930
 that is if you have any questions about the movie 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.270
 then it could just post in the comments below and I'll 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.940
 try to answer the questions or the tests 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.659
 and I also know a few tests 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:11.800
 if you say that 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.150
 yes i'm sorry i do not have any money i really can not handle it easily and it is 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.789
 really like that 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.729
 then the opera Sutum give a 2 1 victories 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.620
 but I just ask you not to smooth the theme 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.639
 I will not help people 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.990
 because I just for the legal 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.020
 Way I have my team too 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.289
 acquired legally 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:35.279
 I just wanted to show the team again that was the first part 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:38.349
 my the app is just turbo queens video series 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.520
 I hope you liked it when year why too 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.029
 a comment 

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.969
 and it 

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:44.580
 see you later
