last year now it's all about the chalk I
think<00:03:01.930> personally<00:03:02.470> if<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:02.980> were<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.430> design

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
think personally if I were to design

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.560 
think personally if I were to design
this<00:03:04.810> drink<00:03:05.260> myself<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:06.220> would<00:03:06.940> think<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.480> I

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
this drink myself I would think and I

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
this drink myself I would think and I
don't<00:03:07.600> know<00:03:07.750> if<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.900> would<00:03:08.020> work<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.290> you

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
don't know if it would work but you

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.850 
don't know if it would work but you
could<00:03:08.740> try<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:08.950> at<00:03:09.160> home<00:03:09.630> put<00:03:10.630> some<00:03:11.140> some

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
could try this at home put some some

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.980 
could try this at home put some some
grenadine<00:03:12.040> down<00:03:12.520> here<00:03:12.820> on<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.450> bottom<00:03:13.540> and

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
grenadine down here on the bottom and

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.380 
grenadine down here on the bottom and
layer<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.500> on<00:03:14.710> top<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:15.280> think<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.150> would<00:03:16.300> be

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
layer this on top I think that would be

almond mixed in the almond is very

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.830 
almond mixed in the almond is very
subtle<00:04:15.220> kind<00:04:15.820> of<00:04:15.970> comes<00:04:16.090> near<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.390> end<00:04:16.540> but

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
subtle kind of comes near the end but

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.289 
subtle kind of comes near the end but
