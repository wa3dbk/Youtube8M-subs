00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 there had been a great doubt in all 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.769
 the fans of twilight fredys which is 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 who killed the five children 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.789
 I think it was you when you played in 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:23.519
 end when giving credits I say this for the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:26.760
 theory that says it this is made up of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.210
 the following way when you have already 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.510
 played all night until you reach the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 night 7 where you put the difficulty of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 every animatronic and you put girl 20 to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.149
 thole girl 20 and handle 20 leaving 0 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.789
 to the others in the end if you spend tonight 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.180
 you are fired and they tell you the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.660
 reasons one by manipulating those 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.070
 animatronics what do you mean 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 this man who are you manipulated the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.450
 animatronics in the first delivery and the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.130
 another smell that concludes with this that is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.740
 killed the children and put them in the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.860
 animatronic what are the old ones by 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.790
 that was the bad smell of these in the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 first room but there is a doubt because in 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.490
 night 7 if all this has happened behind 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.910
 this theory tells us that night 7 of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.330
 second game is number one of this 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.480
 same 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.840
 that's the reason why paper 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.800
 which has a note says in the first 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.700
 work day seriously so after 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.720
 of this he fled until they were 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.690
 account of the bad smell in the first game 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.080
 so you do not miss the nights 7 in 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.900
 file aid and ready 2 would be the night 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.100
 next after all the game of 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.130
 fight night 8 fredes 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.320
