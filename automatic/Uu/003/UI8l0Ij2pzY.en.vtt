00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.369
 Attention fire on board 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.939
 This year Flint unfortunately the damage to the fir forest and Vilnius are now in 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.529
 first part of our film series about it 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.500
 where fire hazards aboard their yacht are lurking among others the 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.509
 Electrics then turn the gas system and in the engine room under the microscope 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.970
 as cause number one on the track the goal of the 12th 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.160
 Today we want the electric system of a motor yacht 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.170
 and especially where to pay special attention here 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.090
 the guests of honor of preventive detention 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.610
 watching and later on from the back 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 because it appears this time I am already surprised 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.230
 get them and wiring them 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.609
 most fires occur optionally 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.639
 through through controlled diesel engines or through impurities 

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.020
 write contact 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660
 so it's important now 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.100
 I come to contact me 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.820
 such as giving 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.790
 or like Strano Comedy 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 from below you can see them at five to twelve and fourteen 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.390
 When checking the electrical system it is important to also so in Cardiff fell 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.510
 by 2 8% the cable is sure to have content 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.110
 the Straub and makes contacts 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.680
 clean and free from Kuoni 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.880
 Corrosion places lead to increased transition resistances and as well as 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 before an agreement, the tenth injury and lead to possible locations 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.300
 can emblematically the contacts want to investigate the choice 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.410
 check and this also for clean 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.150
 are so govern 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.190
 Candidates make up as well as he does 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.110
 What would be desirable here was the goal to continue with cable ties 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.760
 and the holders are that these are less vibrations 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.150
 are exposed 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 no flaws isolation great understood 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.600
 Here we see the 22 new plant 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.290
 in which the yacht is supplied with traction current or optionally via a 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.520
 Generator is supplied 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.830
 we will look at these on the back right where are the connections 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.560
 and check the city contacts of the respective backup copies 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.459
 we have the 220 volt analytical festival 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.380
 or seen from the other side of the city side here we see the 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.549
 Connected load screw connections 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.900
 These are due to care and short-term progress of the four parts 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.150
 Automatic circuit breakers of the city council had the on Weichel courses and arrears 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.199
 or soiling 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.819
 Proud to cause residue or corrosion suggests he wants the remains 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:40.939
 the pose 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.319
 which in the consequence to overheating 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.519
 can lead our viewers full 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.249
 at the same time he emphasized 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:51.299
 whether the kp-guide is clean and a defect provide insulation 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.299
 the shooters can lead 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.879
 another area 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.189
 for potential fire danger there is the Petry 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.589
 Here it can happen that clubs overflowed by flammable 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.849
 Endanger liquids or oil 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.640
 These ignite on the Cass flame or on an electric one 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.039
 Cooktop by mere convince self-ignite 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.569
 and to show off 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.880
 important here is in the pantry one of the cities 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.779
 to have at hand 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:26.169
 and these should preferably not above the range of hobs 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.149
 so that you do not burn yourself 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:32.589
 in case that happened and who came to a fire 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.829
 Weidmann again sees strength pulls her out of her head and puts her over 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.109
 to smother the fire in the docks 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.650
 To prevent impossible barley explosion on board it is important that both 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:46.269
 not operating the kitchen equipment allergens are closed 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.649
 that means the children directly at the stove 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:52.359
 a main tap Dr supervised the overall care of the herd 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.869
 and the main currencies at the gas bottles 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:04.109
 as long as the pantry area is not in operation should the main tap 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.099
 the songwriter is completely closed here you can find it directly on the Gass 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.629
 tightened 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.659
 Furthermore, it would be important that the gas system is checked regularly 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.219
 by an auditor of the DVGW 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:20.519
 can recognize the maintenance intervals or inspection intervals on the sticker 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.720
 with the respective expiration date printed on the sticker 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:28.120
 September will be on its products from 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.270
 also put the gas system there that means it gets pressure in the trade 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.559
 carried out 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.180
 another five percent 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.270
 with 4 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.960
 The tube guide felt that way though, Thatcher are taken 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.120
 are intact 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.870
 I did not want to greet you 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.340
 percent 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.229
 are up to their tasks 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.430
 A test certificate is issued when the gas system is tested 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.169
 that the individual components 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.270
 represents the exam 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.210
 further it is important that the gas has come up called the drain to the outside 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.900
 On board, that means escaping gas in the gas cylinder in any case 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.059
 a ship can enter 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.240
 the procedure must 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.889
 be ventilated by ventilation grille 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.889
 and a drain at the lowest point 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.870
 exploit the processes 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.900
 he himself the process outward post 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.639
 the gas 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.780
 Should a leak be present could be free from the procedure 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.650
 Leaks can be fresh air 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.150
 through two touchdowns the club 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
 and that the word 2 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.120
 at least now out of service should be equipped the capitalists 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.120
 his 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.150
 vital in the equipment of a ship 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.909
 for the wrong answer 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.580
 which points out to the number of followers on the crowd 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.479
 Ship size is adjusted 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.660
 It is also important that they are placed so wrong that they 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.909
 easy to reach are impossible center rich are placed 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.929
 emanating from the potential fire hazards that would be the engine room 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.389
 Pantry and the electrical system 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.389
 suitable extinguishing agents morning mail from yachts are essentially Vollborn 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:09.710
 co2 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.569
 co2 is preferably used for fires in electrical installations or in 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.569
 to make closed rooms 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.909
 Further areas have been driven for potential wall they machinery equipments 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.619
 to pay attention to the first essentials 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:27.950
 Fuel lines 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.889
 are important 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.080
 Fuel can not run on trip components 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.210
 such as aprÃ¨s plant chocolate 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:38.659
 away from 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.220
 When checking the exhaust system it is important to make sure that the 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.749
 Cooling water supply is intact 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:47.379
 That's the case with most yachts 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.240
 that the exhaust gases are cooled down by the injection of cooling water 

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:55.109
 to be transported later with flexible hoses to the outside box 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:07:00.529
 Most of these components are designed for consistently high bonuses 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:03.529
 If the cooling water supply fails, it could come to a fire here 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.330
 in machinery plants must continue to use the electrical 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.520
 Municipalities are checked in particular the contrary information they have 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.300
 Power consumption works 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.159
 is a 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.009
 potential out of bus reason for joy 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.919
 make sure that the cable management was intact 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:31.229
 without isolation, weaknesses or damage was present 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.719
 had and Festina is Anhalt 

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.349
 Also, it continues to create a potential fire hazard 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:38.979
 heating system 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.689
 Clark had his car are either fuel or "guest" 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:44.270
 operated 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.729
 Here are also the electrical components as well as fuel too 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:48.759
 guide 

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:51.869
 and to control the exhaust system 

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:53.460
 this does not just apply to 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.090
 referred to the component or the design 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.530
 in itself in the engine room also the exhaust system to the outside what do I have 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.530
 will be the first 

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:06.249
 to safety 

00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:09.800
 the equipment of a ship belongs to Sebastian Vettel these are on board 

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:14.189
 dry and frost-resistant to wear at the destination of a third party
