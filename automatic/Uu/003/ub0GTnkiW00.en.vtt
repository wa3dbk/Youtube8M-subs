about that in a minute it really doesn't

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.020 
about that in a minute it really doesn't
matter<00:03:39.840> because<00:03:40.400> there's<00:03:41.400> only<00:03:41.610> four

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
matter because there's only four

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.990 
matter because there's only four
products<00:03:42.510> here<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:44.190> one<00:03:44.489> has<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
