knives that I've handled but the pivot
is<00:02:18.459> now<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.819> feels<00:02:20.120> nice<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.480> smooth<00:02:21.430> that's

about it there's nothing that it does
remarkably<00:03:01.040> well

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
remarkably well

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.509 
remarkably well
although<00:03:02.510> there<00:03:03.349> are<00:03:03.470> no<00:03:03.709> remarkable

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
with that and you cannot reverse it to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.090 
with that and you cannot reverse it to
the<00:03:28.430> side<00:03:28.639> either<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:29.590> very<00:03:30.590> very

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
the side either it's very very

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.379 
the side either it's very very
restricted<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:32.989> I'm<00:03:33.200> not<00:03:33.380> fond<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:34.389> well

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
restricted so I'm not fond of that well

restricted so I'm not fond of that well
there<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.690> actually<00:03:35.870> one<00:03:36.230> other<00:03:36.440> thing<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:36.859> I

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
there is actually one other thing that I

remarkable about it either positive or
negative<00:04:23.169> it's<00:04:25.000> pretty<00:04:26.000> plain<00:04:26.270> looking<00:04:26.810> in<00:04:26.960> my

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
negative it's pretty plain looking in my

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.100 
negative it's pretty plain looking in my
opinion<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.789> handle<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.570> not

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
opinion the the handle is not

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.310
