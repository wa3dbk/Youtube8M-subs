00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.710
 i's home again this time 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.400
 I think that I would like to assemble the lobby this time in the lobby 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.530
 It's the name issue of the set 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.070
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:21.960
 So yes I think I want to immediately introduce the current parts 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.470
 Then I think that I would like to introduce this part first 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.430
 First is the left ear This is this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.720
 This is the left ear base 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.800
 next 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.690
 The left you back cover This is a little smaller is the left ear back bundle 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.460
 In this black thing this is 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.719
 Right forearm cover right Imagination cover is one 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.320
 And the screw is m 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.700
 4.5 mm flat-head screws to be applied to Japan 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:59.370
 And 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:01.780
 6 mm flat-head screws to be applied to the m is raw this finger it is to say that one 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.700
 I will use it later 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:09.470
 The previous parts stored parts assembled in 45 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.710
 After the right ear 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.840
 Eastern assembled at 45 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.920
 And 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 It is a head stand assembled with 65 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.680
 In the part that was attached this time 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.060
 The right front arm cover it this is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.950
 It was that Please keep so do not use this time 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 This is I think I want to save you think would like to assemble it in immediately 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.810
 So first I would like to attach the back cover to the left ear 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.070
 As a mounting method 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.230
 This is the other side 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.630
 I'd done even whole to this 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.970
 In this way 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.470
 There is a hole here, so this hole 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.770
 This screw 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:05.689
 It is to stop it, I hope to stop it . 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:10.830
 It is such a feeling that I stopped It is now possible to attach the back cover 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.510
 Then go to the next is a process called put the ear to the head 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.530
 By screw 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.790
 The ear It is the right ear 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.769
 In this way fit 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:27.030
 Here are three holes here 123 on the right and left 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:32.129
 Into the screw hole is that stop in this screw 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.520
 I would like to attach this to both left and right ears 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.790
 Yes 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:42.010
 It is such a feeling that both were attached Yes 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:47.439
 At last I came out with this Robi-kun likeness . 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.620
 One Nde two or rather this day where brown of 3 is not a still with 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:54.860
 I still think that something goes into this 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.190
 Yes I'm looking forward to it again 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:04.270
 Such a feeling is a lot during 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.270
 I think I want to go to the next step you in So 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.290
 Then the next step is to attach the head to this body 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.349
 Yes 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.370
 At the top even if a little confusing for you is I here shaft I think there is a 9 shaft 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.829
 May be 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.069
 (1) The shape is different. It is not round, but if it says that the place is a little concave 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.090
 I mean 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:35.200
 The shape is different and looking behind this day 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.999
 I'm attaching the shaft here but here it is also taste-shaped 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.739
 Please attach according to this shape It is attached firmly to the back 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.739
 I want to enter or put 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.290
 These I will chai pretty huge Hey soil dolls were able to or mounting I wish 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.379
 It feels like 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.120
 It is approaching the form of the great corridor day you 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.990
 But I think that the sensibility of 2 wards has hardly been done yet 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.209
 this 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:12.480
 This body is also a borrowed body County with a board for this test 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.280
 It is in but comes with this part also now serve motor of the head obtain Prying here d lite 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.930
 Follow me 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.330
 I do not know a little more detail wonder if maybe something the sensor enters also here after 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.170
 Has assembled a head in true little by little to reverse'm Well I think that there is still a process 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:32.920
 I think I'm in a state of 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:37.750
 Try a little iron this swing but I was also doing the last time after I of this last is entered 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:43.300
 I wondered if I did not have this ear for something to say 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:46.170
 But I think I want to do I'm awkward and looking Nde not be various I still here 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.170
 Well this 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.770
 Test and set Button Force and head down and let's look from behind 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.580
 Of whether Mon blue or zip strange movement was funny 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.370
 Yes If the front is go in like this 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.370
 I can go 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:15.840
 It feels like this. Yes, I'm sorry I do not like all Kanto, but it is the same way 

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:19.500
 Speaking lightly this time 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.770
 It was the issue of this test movement 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.919
 Yes, but I was chucking Furaingushi I bus the last time went last week 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:31.400
 Just with this the instructions for assembling the Lovi 75 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.400
 By opening the addition or with it hope you next time
