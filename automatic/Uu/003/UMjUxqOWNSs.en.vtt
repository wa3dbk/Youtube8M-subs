other verner panton like these are
people<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:54.530> design<00:00:54.920> like<00:00:55.190> very<00:00:55.430> futuristic

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
people that design like very futuristic

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.000 
people that design like very futuristic
worlds<00:00:56.600> not<00:00:56.809> just<00:00:57.019> like<00:00:57.170> an<00:00:57.290> individual<00:00:57.830> piece

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
worlds not just like an individual piece

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.759 
worlds not just like an individual piece
of<00:00:58.220> furniture<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:58.850> for<00:00:59.570> me<00:00:59.720> that<00:01:00.019> this<00:01:00.470> car

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
of furniture and for me that this car

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.770 
of furniture and for me that this car
and<00:01:01.129> other<00:01:01.460> cars<00:01:01.760> like<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:02.239> from<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.540> era

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
and other cars like it from that era

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.660 
and other cars like it from that era
they<00:01:03.440> really<00:01:03.710> fit<00:01:03.979> into<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:04.339> whole

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
they really fit into that whole

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.660 
they really fit into that whole
aesthetic<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.810> like<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.650> Space<00:01:06.950> Age<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.580> of

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
aesthetic of like the Space Age and of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.600 
aesthetic of like the Space Age and of
the<00:01:07.940> kind<00:01:08.690> of<00:01:08.780> boundless<00:01:09.710> possibility<00:01:10.460> of

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
the kind of boundless possibility of

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.940 
the kind of boundless possibility of
that<00:01:10.820> time<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.170> really<00:01:12.380> what<00:01:12.500> attracted

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
that time that was really what attracted

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.210 
that time that was really what attracted
to<00:01:13.010> me<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.400> these<00:01:14.060> bertone<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.600> wedge<00:01:15.049> cars<00:01:21.220> this

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
to me to these bertone a wedge cars this

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.390 
to me to these bertone a wedge cars this
particular<00:01:22.820> car<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.119> actually<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:24.130> two<00:01:25.130> liter

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
particular car is actually a two liter

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.330 
particular car is actually a two liter
engine<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.210> 308<00:01:27.080> gt4<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.159> more

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
engine the 308 gt4 is the more

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.580 
engine the 308 gt4 is the more
well-known<00:01:28.760> version<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.689> car<00:01:29.930> which<00:01:30.409> has

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
well-known version of the car which has

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.950 
well-known version of the car which has
a<00:01:30.619> three<00:01:30.860> liter<00:01:31.040> engine<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.490> basically<00:01:32.450> for

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
a three liter engine and basically for

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.620 
a three liter engine and basically for
the<00:01:33.049> Italian<00:01:33.470> market<00:01:33.650> they<00:01:34.330> deboard<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.510> to

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
the Italian market they deboard it to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.200 
the Italian market they deboard it to
two<00:01:35.780> liters<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.620> avoid<00:01:36.920> attacks<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.610> cars<00:01:37.910> over

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
two liters to avoid attacks on cars over

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.480 
two liters to avoid attacks on cars over
over<00:01:38.630> two<00:01:38.780> liters<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.860> this<00:01:40.010> this<00:01:40.280> particular

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
over two liters so this this particular

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.670 
over two liters so this this particular
example<00:01:41.060> was<00:01:41.300> made<00:01:41.540> specifically<00:01:42.380> for<00:01:42.470> the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
example was made specifically for the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.850 
example was made specifically for the
Italian<00:01:43.070> market<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:45.140> result<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.710> two

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
Italian market and as a result the two

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.520 
Italian market and as a result the two
liter<00:01:46.010> engine<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.460> not<00:01:46.640> terribly<00:01:47.120> fast<00:01:47.480> but<00:01:48.260> it

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
liter engine is not terribly fast but it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.190 
liter engine is not terribly fast but it
sounds<00:01:49.010> actually<00:01:49.160> a<00:01:49.340> little<00:01:49.460> sweeter<00:01:49.820> and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
sounds actually a little sweeter and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.330 
sounds actually a little sweeter and
it's<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.920> very<00:01:51.950> satisfying<00:01:53.800> v8<00:01:54.800> engine

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's a it's a very satisfying v8 engine

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:08.030 
it's a it's a very satisfying v8 engine
note<00:01:55.550> at<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.820> very<00:01:56.000> small<00:01:56.300> v8<00:01:56.810> engine

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.859 

it<00:02:09.040> really<00:02:09.280> takes<00:02:09.700> corners<00:02:10.180> beautifully<00:02:10.690> it's

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
it really takes corners beautifully it's

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.750 
it really takes corners beautifully it's
very<00:02:11.110> neutral<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.920> has<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.190> little<00:02:12.460> bit<00:02:12.670> of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
very neutral it has a little bit of

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.670 
very neutral it has a little bit of
understeer<00:02:13.270> at<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.780> entry<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.380> corner

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
understeer at the entry of the corner

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.200 
understeer at the entry of the corner
but<00:02:14.830> then<00:02:15.010> once<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.400> hooks<00:02:15.580> off<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:16.030> really

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
but then once it hooks off it really

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.770 
but then once it hooks off it really
like<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.230> really<00:02:17.620> feel<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.600> gripping<00:02:19.600> as

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
like you can really feel it gripping as

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.780 
like you can really feel it gripping as
laterally<00:02:20.680> as<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.010> go<00:02:21.190> through<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.430> corner

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
laterally as you go through the corner

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.520 
laterally as you go through the corner
and<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.090> very<00:02:22.330> confidence-inspiring

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and it's very confidence-inspiring

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.430 
and it's very confidence-inspiring
so<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.030> very<00:02:25.270> entertaining<00:02:25.750> car<00:02:26.320> to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
so it's it's a very entertaining car to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.430 
so it's it's a very entertaining car to
drive<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.150> very<00:02:28.390> modern<00:02:28.630> considering

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
drive and it's very modern considering

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.580 
drive and it's very modern considering
it's<00:02:29.620> from<00:02:30.010> 1976<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.090> still<00:02:31.630> soaks<00:02:32.140> up<00:02:32.350> bumps

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
it's from 1976 it still soaks up bumps

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.070 
it's from 1976 it still soaks up bumps
like<00:02:33.070> just<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.240> highway<00:02:34.600> if<00:02:34.870> you're

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
like just a on the highway if you're

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.630 
like just a on the highway if you're
just<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.470> over<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.740> rough<00:02:35.980> pavement

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
just going over a rough pavement

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.210 
just going over a rough pavement
it's<00:02:36.970> very<00:02:37.240> supple<00:02:37.600> very<00:02:38.020> refined<00:02:38.410> ride<00:02:38.770> for<00:02:39.190> a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
it's very supple very refined ride for a

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.280 
it's very supple very refined ride for a
car<00:02:39.550> that's<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.180> whole

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.690 

another<00:02:46.290> thing<00:02:46.469> I<00:02:46.560> love<00:02:46.739> about<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:47.069> car<00:02:47.370> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
another thing I love about this car is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.580 
another thing I love about this car is
the<00:02:48.000> interior<00:02:48.420> particularly<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.140> instrument

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the interior particularly the instrument

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.890 
the interior particularly the instrument
cluster<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.189> really<00:02:51.030> one<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.480> coolest

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
cluster is really one of the coolest

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.020 
cluster is really one of the coolest
instrument<00:02:52.140> clusters<00:02:52.829> not<00:02:53.280> oval<00:02:53.519> not<00:02:53.760> only<00:02:53.939> of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
instrument clusters not oval not only of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.179 
instrument clusters not oval not only of
any<00:02:54.180> Ferrari<00:02:54.629> but<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.989> think<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.409> any<00:02:55.530> car<00:02:55.890> of

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
any Ferrari but I think of any car of

place to sit and it's really it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.020 
place to sit and it's really it
surrounds<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.189> and<00:03:08.220> then<00:03:08.430> each<00:03:08.579> instrument

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
and it's a very it's just a really

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:24.780 
and it's a very it's just a really
nicely<00:03:14.370> executed<00:03:15.049> instrument<00:03:16.049> panel

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.500 

I<00:03:24.989> wanted<00:03:25.989> something<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:27.150> really<00:03:28.150> was<00:03:28.390> like

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
I wanted something that really was like

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.839 
I wanted something that really was like
stepping<00:03:28.780> into<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.140> other<00:03:29.409> era<00:03:29.849> stepping

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
stepping into that other era stepping

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.959 
stepping into that other era stepping
into<00:03:30.969> another<00:03:31.060> time<00:03:31.450> period<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.099> I<00:03:33.099> guess<00:03:33.700> in

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:33.969 
into another time period and I guess in

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.449 
into another time period and I guess in
a<00:03:34.120> way<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.299> was<00:03:34.540> sort<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.840> like<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:36.129> beginning

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
a way it was sort of like the beginning

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.580 
a way it was sort of like the beginning
of<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.730> Italian<00:03:37.120> Job<00:03:37.359> when<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:38.500> have

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
of the Italian Job when the you have

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.500 
of the Italian Job when the you have
this<00:03:38.680> Italian<00:03:39.459> mafioso<00:03:40.090> guy<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.420> he's

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
this Italian mafioso guy and he's

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.360 
this Italian mafioso guy and he's
smoking<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.230> cigarette<00:03:41.409> and<00:03:41.769> he's<00:03:41.890> driving

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
smoking a cigarette and he's driving

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.729 
smoking a cigarette and he's driving
with<00:03:42.459> his<00:03:42.579> sunglasses<00:03:43.209> in<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.450> Alps<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.049> I

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
with his sunglasses in the Alps and I

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.500 
with his sunglasses in the Alps and I
I've<00:03:44.980> always<00:03:45.099> loved<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.609> scene<00:03:45.939> and<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.269> just

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
I've always loved that scene and it just

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.349 
I've always loved that scene and it just
somehow<00:03:46.989> really<00:03:47.790> strikes<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.909> chord<00:03:49.180> with<00:03:49.329> me

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
somehow really strikes a chord with me

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.509 
somehow really strikes a chord with me
and<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:50.170> guess<00:03:50.319> I<00:03:50.470> wanted<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.859> kind<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.159> be<00:03:51.430> able

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
and I guess I wanted to kind of be able

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.610 
and I guess I wanted to kind of be able
to<00:03:51.670> feel<00:03:51.879> that<00:03:51.909> way<00:03:52.269> when<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.900> wanted<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.439> I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
to feel that way when I wanted to I

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.800 
to feel that way when I wanted to I
wanted<00:03:53.889> to<00:03:54.010> escape<00:03:54.280> into<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.939> feeling<00:03:55.359> when

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
wanted to escape into that feeling when

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.880 
wanted to escape into that feeling when
when<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.290> had<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.590> chance<00:03:56.829> to
