00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
the sim card goes inside so if you old I

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.370 
the sim card goes inside so if you old I
can<00:03:27.579> show<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.030> side<00:03:28.209> exactly<00:03:29.110> where

Z<00:03:32.319> back<00:03:32.500> out<00:03:32.849> somebody<00:03:33.849> like<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.239> don't<00:03:34.420> know<00:03:34.540> if

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
Z back out somebody like I don't know if

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.819 
Z back out somebody like I don't know if
I<00:03:34.690> mentioned<00:03:34.810> in<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.049> last<00:03:35.110> video<00:03:35.379> but<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.709> is

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
I mentioned in the last video but it is

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.550 
I mentioned in the last video but it is
a<00:03:35.860> waterproof<00:03:36.599> waterproof<00:03:37.599> design<00:03:38.079> our<00:03:38.349> water

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
a waterproof waterproof design our water

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.559 
a waterproof waterproof design our water
resistant<00:03:38.980> side<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.700> dust<00:03:39.940> resistant<00:03:40.360> design

resistant side and dust resistant design

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.670 
resistant side and dust resistant design
so<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:40.870> rated<00:03:41.170> for<00:03:41.200> ip55<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.010> 90<00:03:42.340> 57

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
so it's rated for ip55 a 90 57

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.589 
so it's rated for ip55 a 90 57
what<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.430> means<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.969> can<00:03:45.090> be<00:03:45.180> some<00:03:45.390> merge

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
what that means is it can be some merge

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.869 
what that means is it can be some merge
up<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.079> meter<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.439> water<00:03:46.469> for<00:03:47.250> 30<00:03:47.549> minutes

background<00:04:25.980> this<00:04:26.220> guy<00:04:26.370> feels<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:26.880> little

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
background this guy feels a little

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.060 
background this guy feels a little
smaller<00:04:27.420> so<00:04:27.780> feels<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.440> little<00:04:28.530> bit<00:04:28.710> slow<00:04:28.860> know

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
smaller so feels a little bit slow know

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.370 
smaller so feels a little bit slow know
what's<00:04:29.310> why<00:04:29.580> those<00:04:29.790> order<00:04:30.360> what's<00:04:31.110> really

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
what's why those order what's really

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.840 
what's why those order what's really
cool<00:04:31.530> about<00:04:31.590> this<00:04:31.890> guy<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.160> Xperia<00:04:32.550> is<00:04:32.640> that

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
cool about this guy the Xperia is that

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.090 
cool about this guy the Xperia is that
now<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.720> screen<00:04:33.990> footprint<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:34.680> the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
now is the screen footprint so the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.740 
now is the screen footprint so the
device<00:04:35.400> feel<00:04:35.730> smaller<00:04:36.090> but<00:04:36.270> they<00:04:36.360> both<00:04:36.540> are<00:04:36.720> on

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
device feel smaller but they both are on

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.930 
device feel smaller but they both are on
five-inch<00:04:37.140> street<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.130> reduced<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.670> frame

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
five-inch street so we reduced the frame

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.030 
five-inch street so we reduced the frame
all<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> way<00:04:39.270> around<00:04:39.360> this<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.720> about<00:04:39.840> 75%<00:04:40.500> of

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
all the way around this is about 75% of

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.040 
all the way around this is about 75% of
your<00:04:41.520> front<00:04:41.760> real<00:04:41.940> estate<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.300> your<00:04:42.390> device<00:04:42.600> is

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
your front real estate on your device is

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.930 
your front real estate on your device is
your<00:04:43.260> screen<00:04:43.530> whereas<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:44.340> guy<00:04:44.520> falls<00:04:44.790> in
