00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
my main switch for the e-tec I have to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.029 
my main switch for the e-tec I have to
auxilary<00:00:27.029> charging<00:00:27.720> motors<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.380> motor<00:00:28.680> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
auxilary charging motors this motor is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.790 
auxilary charging motors this motor is
producing<00:00:29.760> electricity<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.660> driving<00:00:31.619> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
producing electricity and driving this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.729 
producing electricity and driving this
motor<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.300> e-tec<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.840> driven<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:34.290> batteries

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
motor the e-tec is driven by batteries

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.479 
motor the e-tec is driven by batteries
in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> case<00:00:35.540> there's<00:00:36.540> my<00:00:36.809> controller<00:00:37.489> my

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
in the case there's my controller my

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.650 
in the case there's my controller my
pedal<00:00:39.320> my<00:00:40.320> pipes<00:00:41.870> headlights<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.480> come

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
pedal my pipes headlights and so we come

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.850 
pedal my pipes headlights and so we come
around<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:47.149> there's<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.390> e-tec<00:00:48.860> driving

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
around here there's the e-tec driving

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.360 
around here there's the e-tec driving
both<00:00:50.070> motors<00:00:50.719> with<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> chain<00:00:52.829> tensioner

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
both motors with the chain tensioner

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:11.270 
both motors with the chain tensioner
here<00:00:54.559> let's<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.010> got

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.330 

looks<00:01:12.280> pretty<00:01:12.580> good<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:17.800> notice<00:01:18.310> here

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
looks pretty good as you notice here

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.720 
looks pretty good as you notice here
this<00:01:19.000> motor<00:01:19.390> this<00:01:20.160> is<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.770> motor<00:01:24.070> make

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
this motor this is this motor make

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.640 
this motor this is this motor make
electricity<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.510> helping<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.990> drive<00:01:26.230> with<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
electricity to helping to drive with the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.330 
electricity to helping to drive with the
e-type<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:29.140> give<00:01:29.500> her<00:01:29.620> a<00:01:29.680> little<00:01:29.860> more

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
e-type just give her a little more

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:46.030 
e-type just give her a little more
lawyer

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.240 

that<00:01:46.280> was<00:01:46.520> full<00:01:46.760> speed<00:01:47.620> while<00:01:48.620> producing

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
that was full speed while producing

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.330 
that was full speed while producing
electricity<00:01:49.730> I'm<00:01:50.270> going<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.810> unhook<00:01:51.340> this

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
electricity I'm going to unhook this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.140 
electricity I'm going to unhook this
motor<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.890> we're<00:01:55.070> not<00:01:55.190> dragging<00:01:55.490> trying<00:01:56.060> to

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
motor so we're not dragging trying to

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:07.000 
motor so we're not dragging trying to
produce<00:01:56.330> electricity

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.070
