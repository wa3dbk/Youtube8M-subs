00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello today, a review of the legendary 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.340
 game feed gi dong that came to us with 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.990
 very old consoles and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.360
 already a lot of positive 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.130
 No reviews have been written for this game. 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.859
 I did a review right away because I did not think that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
 what will go on my device and 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.900
 really what you see now on 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.180
 the screen is launch 1 but this is not the first 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.720
 game menu performance that is me 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.669
 I had to take the phone to sleep 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.969
 and only after that the game did not work 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.950
 I know what was connected with Iyos 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
 devices in particular on the iphone and on 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 ipad 4 there were no such problems well 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.080
 still apple 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 axis and android and completely different things 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.600
 there is even to compare but we do not review 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.650
 gaming 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.739
 according to the forms but still a review of this racing 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.960
 so omega cool simulator will not 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.820
 grew up praising him in particular here 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.160
 just those who say yours before 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.040
 played it was the best game was 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.720
 cool I had not played here is that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.820
 see on the screen then i'm before 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 turned on a little train understood how here 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.150
 management by the way mention here is not the most 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 the best 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.830
 many said that writing any 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.710
 the creatures were an order of magnitude easier 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 much more interesting to manage right there 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.250
 they give us more well how how 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.410
 tell us give acceleration right side 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.320
 This is the gas pedal thomas pedal thank you 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.820
 cap a little lower is the handbrake which 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.500
 especially do not work, or some that sometimes 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.660
 didn't even understand shorter taps pressure they still 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.340
 It was not occur on the left side completely 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.470
 not comfortable turning buttons you need 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.050
 cut down as you can see on the screen 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.479
 they stand but when bending high 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.830
 adventures they just don't work then 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.930
 there is essentially to deploy 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.110
 the car and drive it takes pretty 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.270
 good basil 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.400
 and yes i thought i would break the traffic light 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.170
 The game has definitely not broken 10 and at least 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.910
 for making the story of that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.010
 legendary feed gi dong which was 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.649
 still on prehistoric consoles which 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.840
 everyone liked a lot of people just 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.290
 ran any free time tried 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.050
 we still have to go through the level 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.750
 10 on cool lot even from my 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.660
 friends in this toy played when she 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.400
 went to the platform that's a dream it will be 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.130
 iphone owners they all started 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.890
 rejoice and come here to feed gi dong 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.989
 android and pretty well done 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.600
 Honestly there is no lag well with game not 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.310
 they certainly nakosyachili 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.030
 uniquely on an iPhone 10 out of 10 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.860
 on android i put somewhere 7 and 10 7 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.709
 unambiguous game 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.959
 and 0 out of 3 it just could not 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.730
 port this game to android though i 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.440
 I do not think that the ax is a full game 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.520
 Of course, but the management is all one to one 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.100
 optimized not bad but there are small 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.019
 shoals of tactical centuries okay enough 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.870
 litter this game is shorter 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.580
 anyway it's worth trying not just 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.280
 see the review there rather what wow 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.230
 shit or review shit just stop by and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.290
 play by yourself 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.700
 I'm not a professional I do not know if this is a game 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.069
 should not so much like me 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.870
 I definitely recommend downloading all 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.019
 download subscribe to the channel before 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.019
