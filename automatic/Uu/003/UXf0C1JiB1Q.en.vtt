00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
but it looks pretty good on the sim got

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.240 
but it looks pretty good on the sim got
the<00:00:47.489> most<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.969> there<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> keyboard<00:00:49.950> I

the unit itself I've got it on some
furniture<00:01:19.110> slide<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:20.040> slide<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
furniture slide so I can slide it in and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.480 
furniture slide so I can slide it in and
out<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> work<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:22.009> really<00:01:23.009> super<00:01:23.310> happy

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
out to work on it really super happy

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
out to work on it really super happy
with<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.000> turned<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.830> built<00:01:25.830> all

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
with the way it turned out I built all

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
with the way it turned out I built all
the<00:01:26.130> parts<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.000> C&amp;C<00:01:27.360> had<00:01:27.840> designed<00:01:28.170> them

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the parts on the C&amp;C had designed them

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.190 
the parts on the C&amp;C had designed them
all<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.820> cad<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.180> cut<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:30.900> all<00:01:31.020> out<00:01:31.170> on

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
all in cad and then cut them all out on

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.469 
all in cad and then cut them all out on

from<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> simulator<00:01:41.189> plans<00:01:41.520> found<00:01:42.360> online

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
from the simulator plans found online

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.649 
from the simulator plans found online
the<00:01:43.530> username<00:01:43.799> simulator<00:01:45.079> here's<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
the username simulator here's the the

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.389 
the username simulator here's the the
backbone<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.020> displays<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.860> big

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
backbone for the displays it's a big

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.920 
backbone for the displays it's a big
chunk<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.409> C<00:01:52.970> aluminum<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> spray<00:01:54.630> painted

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
chunk of C aluminum that I spray painted

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870 
chunk of C aluminum that I spray painted
black<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.350> well<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:56.490> pretty<00:01:56.610> heavy

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
black as well it's actually pretty heavy

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
black as well it's actually pretty heavy
and<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.420> expensive<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and it was really expensive but at the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.800 
and it was really expensive but at the
time<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.490> couldn't<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.360> think<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.689> good

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
time I couldn't really think of a good

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.389 
time I couldn't really think of a good
way<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> solve<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.799> amount<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> mount

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
way to solve the amount the mount

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.490 
way to solve the amount the mount
monitors<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.780> ended<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.110> doing<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
monitors so I just ended up doing that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.160 
monitors so I just ended up doing that
got<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> track<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.329> there

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
got the track I are up there

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.320 
got the track I are up there
it's<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.560> earlier<00:02:09.160> version<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.970> but<00:02:10.149> it

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
it's a earlier version of it but it

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.600 
it's a earlier version of it but it
works<00:02:10.539> quite<00:02:10.810> well<00:02:10.840> for<00:02:11.319> for<00:02:12.099> viewing<00:02:12.400> along

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
works quite well for for viewing along

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.320 
works quite well for for viewing along
with<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> headset<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:15.180> listening<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.270> air

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
with a headset for listening to air

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.690 
with a headset for listening to air
traffic<00:02:16.720> control<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> I'm<00:02:18.220> running<00:02:18.370> flight

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
traffic control so I'm running flight
