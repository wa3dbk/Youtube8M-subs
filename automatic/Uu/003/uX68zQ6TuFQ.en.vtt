00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
it was a wonderful experience of

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.199 
it was a wonderful experience of
searching<00:02:23.200> Mexico<00:02:23.709> for<00:02:23.950> things<00:02:24.219> that<00:02:24.670> we

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
searching Mexico for things that we

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.970 
searching Mexico for things that we
really<00:02:25.450> thought<00:02:25.659> would<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:25.959> appropriate<00:02:26.079> that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
really thought would be appropriate that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.149 
really thought would be appropriate that

ranchito<00:02:30.790> was<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.180> Mexico<00:02:31.659> so<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.079> Onyx<00:02:32.439> is

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
ranchito was in Mexico so the Onyx is

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
ranchito was in Mexico so the Onyx is
from<00:02:32.739> Mexico<00:02:33.280> some<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.120> chandeliers<00:02:34.329> are

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930

from tasco there they specialize in

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.440 
from tasco there they specialize in
silver<00:02:38.139> so<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:38.889> did<00:02:39.069> as<00:02:39.219> many<00:02:39.639> things<00:02:40.030> as<00:02:40.269> we

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
silver so we did as many things as we

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.839 
silver so we did as many things as we
possibly<00:02:40.989> could<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.889> that<00:02:42.040> we<00:02:42.129> were<00:02:42.280> true<00:02:42.609> to

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
possibly could so that we were true to

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.650 
possibly could so that we were true to
the<00:02:42.939> Mexican<00:02:43.389> tradition

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660
