00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
how to apply video but the perfect

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.040 
how to apply video but the perfect
cutout<00:00:39.129> helped<00:00:39.520> a<00:00:39.610> lot<00:00:39.940> in<00:00:40.150> aligning<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.750> skin

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
cutout helped a lot in aligning the skin

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.320 
cutout helped a lot in aligning the skin
and<00:00:41.290> yes<00:00:42.040> I<00:00:42.250> did<00:00:42.400> miss<00:00:42.580> align<00:00:42.790> it<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.030> couple<00:00:43.180> of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
and yes I did miss align it a couple of

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.869 
and yes I did miss align it a couple of
times<00:00:43.600> but<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:44.080> still<00:00:44.440> sticked<00:00:44.739> well<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.699> it<00:00:45.850> is

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
times but it still sticked well so it is

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.189 
times but it still sticked well so it is
not<00:00:46.150> something<00:00:46.510> like<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.660> screen<00:00:47.050> protector

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199

there<00:01:21.820> are<00:01:22.000> two<00:01:22.240> main<00:01:22.390> reasons<00:01:22.689> why<00:01:23.020> I'm

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
there are two main reasons why I'm

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.410

really liking the skin first of all it

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.200 
really liking the skin first of all it
adds<00:01:25.689> a<00:01:26.020> slightly<00:01:26.470> more<00:01:26.860> grip<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.670> hell

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
adds a slightly more grip to that hell

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.630 
adds a slightly more grip to that hell
of<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.450> slippery<00:01:28.930> phone<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.590> number<00:01:30.250> two<00:01:30.430> is
