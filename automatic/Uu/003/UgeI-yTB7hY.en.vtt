look back far enough you find it and you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
look back far enough you find it and you
may<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.840> find<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.380> played<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
may not find it played like in the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
very simple drawing and it's an

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
very simple drawing and it's an
archetypal<00:01:07.530> idea<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.509> frame<00:01:10.610> make<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
archetypal idea to take a frame make a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.510 
archetypal idea to take a frame make a
circle<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.749> put<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.289> skin<00:01:13.649> over<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.249> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
circle and put the skin over it and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.380 
circle and put the skin over it and
there's<00:01:15.179> all<00:01:15.479> these<00:01:15.899> other<00:01:16.200> sizes<00:01:17.390> but

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
there's all these other sizes but

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.529 
there's all these other sizes but
basically<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.890> circle<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
basically it's just a circle and the

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.899 
basically it's just a circle and the
diameter<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> head<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.979> much<00:01:23.280> bigger<00:01:23.640> than

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
diameter of the head is much bigger than

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.849 
diameter of the head is much bigger than
the<00:01:24.210> death<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.719> show<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.590> makes

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
the death of the show that's what makes

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.239 
the death of the show that's what makes
haha<00:01:26.749> so<00:01:27.749> people<00:01:28.109> all<00:01:28.289> over<00:01:28.319> the<00:01:28.649> world<00:01:28.679> to

was<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.230> queen<00:02:23.610> Himiko<00:02:24.720> who<00:02:25.720> played<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.080> frame

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
was a queen Himiko who played the frame

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.820 
was a queen Himiko who played the frame
drum<00:02:26.739> now<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> she<00:02:27.700> was<00:02:27.850> an<00:02:28.000> oracular<00:02:28.830> queen

just like in the Mediterranean world and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.710 
just like in the Mediterranean world and
then<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:33.640> we're<00:02:33.820> finding<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
then what we're finding out in the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.470 
then what we're finding out in the
research<00:02:35.110> was<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.440> queen<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.489> Miko<00:02:36.850> wasn't

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
so we must research that oh I hope to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.020 
so we must research that oh I hope to
help<00:02:53.040> yeah<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.760> forget<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:54.990> what<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.280> know<00:02:56.850> you

briefly<00:02:57.780> mention<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.320> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:58.890> what<00:02:59.580> is

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
briefly mention a little bit but what is

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.390 
briefly mention a little bit but what is
the<00:03:00.090> relationship<00:03:00.660> between<00:03:01.100> goddesses<00:03:02.100> and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the relationship between goddesses and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.450 
the relationship between goddesses and
frame<00:03:03.060> long<00:03:03.390> well<00:03:04.140> what<00:03:04.770> I've<00:03:04.920> been<00:03:05.130> able<00:03:05.190> to

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
frame long well what I've been able to

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.420 
frame long well what I've been able to
determine<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.290> womb<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:08.130> first

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
determine is that in the womb the first

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.120 
determine is that in the womb the first
sound<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:09.030> hear<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.290> pulse<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.860> our

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
sound that we hear is the pulse of our

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.670 
sound that we hear is the pulse of our
mother's<00:03:11.550> blood<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.900> not<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.320> heartbeat

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
mother's blood it's not the heartbeat

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.520 
mother's blood it's not the heartbeat
assist<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:17.000> all<00:03:18.000> my<00:03:18.210> research<00:03:18.660> has<00:03:18.720> led<00:03:19.140> me<00:03:19.410> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
assist and all my research has led me to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.400 
assist and all my research has led me to
believe<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:20.250> these<00:03:20.820> goddesses<00:03:21.600> hold<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
believe that these goddesses hold the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.090 
believe that these goddesses hold the
frame<00:03:22.650> drum<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.390> or<00:03:24.870> they<00:03:25.440> hold<00:03:25.740> it<00:03:25.950> in

frame drum like this or they hold it in

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.700 
frame drum like this or they hold it in

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
civilization so my workshops I'm

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.190 
civilization so my workshops I'm
teaching<00:05:04.100> people<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.490> learn<00:05:05.150> all<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.870> strokes

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
teaching people to learn all the strokes

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.580 
teaching people to learn all the strokes
on<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.560> drum<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.750> try<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.020> teach<00:05:09.380> them

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
on the drum and try and I teach them

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.500 
on the drum and try and I teach them
everything<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:10.160> know<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.640> all<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.479> my

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
everything I know and all of my

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.779 
everything I know and all of my
workshops<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.410> then<00:05:12.560> they<00:05:13.070> have<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.280> practice

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
workshops and then they have to practice

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.140 
workshops and then they have to practice
to<00:05:14.360> learn<00:05:14.510> it<00:05:14.750> but<00:05:15.440> that's<00:05:15.650> in<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.729> way<00:05:16.910> of

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
to learn it but that's in a way of

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.810 
to learn it but that's in a way of
teaching<00:05:17.419> energy<00:05:18.140> practices<00:05:18.490> but<00:05:19.490> I'm<00:05:19.640> also

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
teaching energy practices but I'm also

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.520 
teaching energy practices but I'm also
teaching<00:05:20.150> them<00:05:20.390> to<00:05:20.539> play<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.960> drum<00:05:21.200> and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
teaching them to play the drum and

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.370 
teaching them to play the drum and
people's<00:05:22.370> lives<00:05:22.669> are<00:05:23.000> transformed<00:05:23.240> with<00:05:23.810> a

never make money from it but they

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.440 
never make money from it but they
transform<00:05:30.740> themselves<00:05:30.950> and<00:05:31.700> they<00:05:31.790> often<00:05:32.300> go

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
transform themselves and they often go

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.080 
transform themselves and they often go
on<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:32.990> get<00:05:33.500> better<00:05:33.830> jobs<00:05:34.190> or<00:05:34.670> do<00:05:34.820> something

specific materials I make materials for

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.510 
specific materials I make materials for
my<00:06:25.960> students<00:06:26.380> there's<00:06:26.650> many<00:06:26.949> teachers<00:06:27.220> who

my students there's many teachers who
are<00:06:27.550> making<00:06:27.789> materials<00:06:28.389> but<00:06:28.479> you<00:06:28.600> want

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
are making materials but you want

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.000 
are making materials but you want
materials<00:06:29.320> that<00:06:29.470> you're<00:06:29.590> going<00:06:29.710> to<00:06:29.770> work

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
materials that you're going to work

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.870 
materials that you're going to work
through<00:06:30.430> an<00:06:30.639> organized<00:06:31.240> way<00:06:31.449> I<00:06:32.669> insist<00:06:33.669> that

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
through an organized way I insist that

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.689 
through an organized way I insist that
my<00:06:34.270> students<00:06:34.690> work<00:06:34.840> for<00:06:35.020> the<00:06:35.080> metronome<00:06:35.699> so

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
my students work for the metronome so

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.719 
my students work for the metronome so
they<00:06:37.030> develop<00:06:37.479> their<00:06:37.660> sense<00:06:37.930> of<00:06:38.020> time<00:06:38.729> so

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
they develop their sense of time so

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.580 
they develop their sense of time so
there's<00:06:39.940> a<00:06:40.090> basic<00:06:40.510> things<00:06:40.750> and<00:06:41.169> then<00:06:41.289> I<00:06:41.380> like

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
there's a basic things and then I like

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.379 
there's a basic things and then I like
for<00:06:41.800> them<00:06:41.949> to<00:06:41.979> play<00:06:42.310> and<00:06:42.789> walk<00:06:43.030> at<00:06:43.270> the<00:06:43.330> same

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
for them to play and walk at the same

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.900 
for them to play and walk at the same
time<00:06:43.810> and<00:06:44.110> sing<00:06:44.440> the<00:06:44.590> patterns<00:06:45.070> that<00:06:45.729> the

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
time and sing the patterns that the

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.879 
time and sing the patterns that the
claim<00:06:46.180> and<00:06:46.479> that<00:06:47.669> furthers<00:06:48.669> this<00:06:49.030> mind-body

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
claim and that furthers this mind-body

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.560 
claim and that furthers this mind-body
synchronization<00:06:50.889> and<00:06:51.550> it<00:06:51.820> helps<00:06:52.120> us<00:06:52.240> to<00:06:52.419> get

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
synchronization and it helps us to get

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.890 
synchronization and it helps us to get
more<00:06:52.810> in<00:06:53.050> our<00:06:53.139> bodies<00:06:53.620> and<00:06:54.060> it<00:06:55.060> helps<00:06:55.449> us<00:06:55.599> to
