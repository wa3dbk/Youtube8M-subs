00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.210
 hello everyone today we just decided 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.040
 pampered and collected computer on 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.530
 enough 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.410
 cheap configuration very strange 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.740
 take account of what else is currently 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.269
 turn on bandicam used 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.090
 pentium g32 20 processor is used 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.060
 motherboard by 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.610
 85a 4 1 out of 50 cm 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.430
 natural to memory module 4 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:42.239
 gigabyte to sare johns is not used and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.730
 at a frequency of 1333 megahertz as in food 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:51.210
 600 is not supported by this process. 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.469
 so we play in stock as well 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.829
 graphics card im for its lebanese file 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:03.809
 7770 hd played on the operating system 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.240
 81 professionally 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.299
 that of the 4 discharge naturally as 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 8 gigabytes of operating systems to be different 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:20.860
 the game would not play would not go on 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.260
 32-bit system as you can see 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.950
 and childhood is very inhibitory 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:36.159
 about this is 15 plus 15-20 fps battles 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.890
 with lots of creatures characters 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.990
 one processor clearly does not win to win 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.490
 principle you can if you put the whole 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.159
 minimum on minimum salary 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.289
 everything is now on average without 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.690
 smoothing 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:57.370
 we decided to make fun of the system 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.040
 it was interesting to us so we decided here 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.460
 so let's say this game as it was 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.530
 many questions that can be done as 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.030
 lose on what is the beginning of what will be bad 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.840
 decided to collect just a sheet 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.720
 components that were configuration 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.950
 we have not used just lay 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.390
 Components here assembled such a system 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.150
 it was interesting to play if not 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.430
 use 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.510
 filler nikita program on the floor 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.769
 just like the wild just turn everything off 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.280
 absolutely all programs do not need 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.360
 knock out 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.220
 and just play fuck you can 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.200
 who would not say aport principle there 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.080
 of course you will not achieve on such a system 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.420
 need at least oh 35 to put something 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.850
 such processors obviously cannot cope 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.680
 even with the capabilities of this video card 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.230
 although they are pretty low even at 128 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.220
 bit wearing 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.140
 you can play can be long put 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.570
 just do not forget the operating system 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.350
 what should be 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.710
 64-bit but today with the boss 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.240
 finish off 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:24.430
 bye all the best 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:30.400
 I hope it was interesting though I do not know 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.400
 we had fun bye bye
