00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm Niels I'm 24 years old

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I come from Lyon

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's where I start free running

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It was 8 years ago

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
At the beginning I took it for a game

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And it soon became a way of life

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Everything is an excuse to move

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
A cable, a fence, a wall

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Each new movement is a new sensation

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
For me this makes me move forward in everyday life

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The Xtreme Gravity is the first championship of its kind in France

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It will be an opportunity for me to test myself in a new context

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Because each situation is different and we never stop moving
