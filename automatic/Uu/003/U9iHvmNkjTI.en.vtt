00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.970
 the skype development area is that 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.429
 implemented another facility to its 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.079
 customers to kelley each to the terminal 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.019
 of taxation before June 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:23.160
 we will demonstrate a delicate since 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:25.740
 terminal with ethernet connection 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.620
 here illustratively updating the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.880
 mobile recharge sale system 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:37.680
 the current version is 01.07 which will be 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.900
 updated to 01.08 after connecting the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.900
 ecosystem enter the password 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.380
 once inside the application of sale of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.930
 recharge and people even with the game of old 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:03.090
 to have access to the terminal menu 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:05.989
 So people look for option number 29 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.989
 by the load 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.780
 press the green key to have a little 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 according to the system it will be updated as 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:28.740
 the crowd follow the line 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:32.750
 dashed after download 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.750
 the bel air reset 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:07.940
 confirm the system update by the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:10.280
 display version 01.08 life so the 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.970
 entry to return the sales menu 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.070
 recharge and the handset is already 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.220
 ready and upgraded to perform the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.220
 sale 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:29.750
 we will now demonstrate a technique still 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.750
 with traces 520 gprs connection 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.970
 we will illustratively update 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.829
 of the recharge sale system of 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:50.180
 the application will be updated from the 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.180
 version 01.07 to 01.08 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.380
 after connection of the terminal the network introduces 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.380
 the entry password to the recharge system 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.500
 once in the recharging system 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.459
 enter the old game key to have 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.640
 access to the terminal menu 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.640
 type the password 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:45.769
 look for option number 29 for the load and 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.769
 enter the green key to have 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.930
 you can follow the update of the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.930
 system through dashed line 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.340
 the update will be faster as 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.740
 better the signal of gt r s available in the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.740
 where pf is installed 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.140
 load- update application endpoint 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.840
 terminals in a field made of 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.390
 fast simple and very economical way 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.220
 because it prevents the displacement of a technician 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.220
 to the west in the field 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:26.060
 networks using the terminal should be 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.639
 stay in between 20 and can now count 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.680
 with this facility and perform the 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.250
 update between applications with 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.250
 a lot of agility 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.980
 after giving 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.980
 another role is whether it will be 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.460
 I trust in updating the system by 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.460
 display version 01.08 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.610
 type the password entry System 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:18.760
 sale of recharges and the terminal was already 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.490
 ready and upgraded to make a sale 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.650
 this is another facility in the area of 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.130
 development of scar available test 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.130
 to the market
