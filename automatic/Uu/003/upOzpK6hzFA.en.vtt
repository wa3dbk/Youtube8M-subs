watch in the world that we've found that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.230 
watch in the world that we've found that
has<00:01:27.780> stand-up<00:01:28.619> tritium<00:01:29.100> tubes<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:30.090> does

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
has stand-up tritium tubes what does

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
has stand-up tritium tubes what does
that<00:01:30.270> mean<00:01:30.750> okay<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:31.140> gonna<00:01:31.259> show<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.139 
tritium tubes usually lay flat
absolutely<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.439> you're<00:01:46.829> hiding<00:01:47.100> part<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
absolutely so you're hiding part of the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.550 
absolutely so you're hiding part of the
illumination<00:01:48.570> shot<00:01:50.090> 360<00:01:51.090> 360<00:01:51.960> degree<00:01:52.229> lumen

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
illumination shot 360 360 degree lumen

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.010 
illumination shot 360 360 degree lumen
not<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.579> look<00:01:53.790> inside<00:01:54.020> you'll

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
not just that if you look inside you'll

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
not just that if you look inside you'll
see<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.799> candle<00:01:56.280> holder

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
see it's like a little candle holder

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.020 
see it's like a little candle holder
there's<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> reflective<00:01:57.540> coating<00:01:58.500> inside<00:01:59.030> so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
there's a reflective coating inside so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
there's a reflective coating inside so
you<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.869> maximum<00:02:01.619> illumination<00:02:02.369> from

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you get the maximum illumination from

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.520 
you get the maximum illumination from
the<00:02:03.509> tube<00:02:04.040> not<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.250> we're<00:02:05.430> aware<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
the tube not that we're aware that is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.059 
the tube not that we're aware that is
come<00:02:06.860> along<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.340> say<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.640> know<00:02:07.790> what<00:02:09.069> you

movements we've got the NH 35 in the in
the<00:02:47.810> automatic<00:02:48.500> which<00:02:48.620> everybody's<00:02:49.160> aware<00:02:49.340> of

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
the automatic which everybody's aware of

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.699 
the automatic which everybody's aware of
familiar<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:50.239> right<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.470> then<00:02:51.620> this

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
familiar with here right and then this

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.190 
familiar with here right and then this
is<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.010> 6s<00:02:52.430> 30<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.269> other<00:02:53.420> which<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.019> the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
is the 6s 30 in the other which is the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.500 
is the 6s 30 in the other which is the
split<00:02:54.650> second<00:02:55.040> chronograph<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.819> it<00:02:55.910> also<00:02:56.090> has

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
split second chronograph and it also has

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.040 
split second chronograph and it also has
jewels

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
jewels

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.750 
jewels
it's<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.350> jeweled<00:02:57.620> movement<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.160> court<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:58.670> it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
it's a jeweled movement in a court so it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.420 
it's a jeweled movement in a court so it
gives<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.200> sweep<00:03:00.650> of<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.040> second

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
gives you the the sweep of the second

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.880 
gives you the the sweep of the second
hand<00:03:01.640> as<00:03:01.880> opposed<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.540> tick<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.620> course

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
hand as opposed to the tick of a course

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.229 
hand as opposed to the tick of a course
so<00:03:04.340> again<00:03:05.230> everything<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.709> 100%<00:03:07.670> professional

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the but helium release valve as well

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.410 
the but helium release valve as well
yeah<00:03:12.620> yeah<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.400> has<00:03:13.519> an<00:03:13.640> automatic<00:03:14.000> healing
