00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
that I'm using right now and the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.100 
that I'm using right now and the
hardware<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.889> used<00:00:11.130> back<00:00:11.429> when<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.670> started<00:00:12.179> so

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
hardware are used back when I started so

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530 
hardware are used back when I started so
when<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.380> began<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.070> used<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.460> waken<00:00:14.790> bamboo<00:00:15.120> fun

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
when I began I used to waken bamboo fun

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.439 
when I began I used to waken bamboo fun
which<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.350> actually<00:00:16.890> pretty<00:00:17.220> small<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.970> handy

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
which is actually pretty small but handy

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.380 
which is actually pretty small but handy
and<00:00:18.750> most<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.619> all<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.100> really<00:00:20.220> cheap<00:00:20.850> so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and most of all it is really cheap so

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.920 
and most of all it is really cheap so
that<00:00:21.869> makes<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.410> really<00:00:22.619> nice<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.400> beginners

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
that makes it really nice for beginners

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
that makes it really nice for beginners
right<00:00:24.930> now<00:00:25.140> however<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.920> using<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.430> Cintiq

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
right now however I'm using the Cintiq

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
right now however I'm using the Cintiq
12<00:00:27.330> w<00:00:27.720> X<00:00:27.990> which<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.189> pretty<00:00:30.150> big<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.800> actually

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
12 w X which is pretty big and actually

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790 
12 w X which is pretty big and actually
has<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> screen<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.850> draw<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
has a screen you can draw on but it is

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.750 
has a screen you can draw on but it is
really<00:00:35.370> expensive<00:00:35.870> um<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.829> wouldn't<00:00:38.550> really

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
really expensive um I wouldn't really

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.569 
really expensive um I wouldn't really
recommend<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.450> beginners<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
recommend it for beginners because it is

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
recommend it for beginners because it is
really<00:00:41.820> expensive<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.660> said<00:00:42.840> earlier<00:00:43.260> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
really expensive as I said earlier and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
really expensive as I said earlier and
note<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.120> will<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.480> make<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.899> better

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
note that it will not make you better

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.580 
note that it will not make you better
art<00:00:46.620> wise<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.789> actually<00:00:48.270> maybe<00:00:48.510> faster<00:00:48.989> well

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
art wise but actually maybe faster well

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.979 
art wise but actually maybe faster well

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
scene right here I used a lens flare

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.890 
scene right here I used a lens flare
which<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.260> imported<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:14.270> Adobe<00:01:15.270> After

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
which I imported from Adobe After

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.520 
which I imported from Adobe After
Effects<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:18.000> made<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.720> shine<00:01:19.110> effect

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
Effects and I made a little shine effect

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.200 
Effects and I made a little shine effect
to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> eyes<00:01:21.259> however<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> scene<00:01:23.640> does<00:01:24.000> not

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
to the eyes however this scene does not

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
to the eyes however this scene does not
have<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> background<00:01:24.810> well<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.590> least<00:01:25.799> not<00:01:26.009> yeah

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
have a background well at least not yeah

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.060 
have a background well at least not yeah
because<00:01:27.080> backgrounds<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.320> usually<00:01:28.799> done

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
because backgrounds are usually done

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.450 
because backgrounds are usually done
inside<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.090> After<00:01:30.360> Effects<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.290> mean<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
inside of After Effects I mean the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.230 
inside of After Effects I mean the
panning<00:01:32.909> part<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> course<00:01:34.400> okay<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.850> we're

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

back in Adobe After Effects and this is
basically<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.950> place<00:01:41.689> where<00:01:43.100> compositing

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
basically the place where compositing

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
this gene you can see pretty well how

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.920 
this gene you can see pretty well how
After<00:01:54.570> Effects<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.079> used<00:01:55.939> for<00:01:56.939> example<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.719> used

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
After Effects is used for example I used

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.560 
After Effects is used for example I used
to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.500> Blue<00:01:58.770> Train<00:01:58.829> effect<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.090> After

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
to do the Blue Train effect in After

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.679 
to do the Blue Train effect in After
Effects<00:02:01.110> while<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> sort<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.820> drool<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
Effects while I sort of drool the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.990 
Effects while I sort of drool the
template<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.340> Adobe<00:02:06.270> Photoshop<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
template for it in Adobe Photoshop and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
template for it in Adobe Photoshop and
basically<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.479> set<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> particles

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
basically it's just a set of particles

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.890 
basically it's just a set of particles
that<00:02:11.220> are<00:02:11.280> moving

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
that are moving

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.100 
that are moving
like<00:02:13.390> upwards<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:16.720> yeah<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.750> also

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
like upwards like there and yeah I also

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.890 
like upwards like there and yeah I also
added<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.620> optical<00:02:19.220> flare<00:02:19.670> fact<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.569> make<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.870> a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
added a optical flare fact to make it a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.390 
added a optical flare fact to make it a
little<00:02:21.019> more<00:02:21.140> shiny<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.659> yeah<00:02:23.659> I<00:02:23.930> will<00:02:24.110> get

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
little more shiny and yeah I will get

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.190 
little more shiny and yeah I will get
more<00:02:25.400> detailed<00:02:25.939> to<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.420> when<00:02:26.689> I<00:02:26.720> actually<00:02:26.870> do

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
more detailed to that when I actually do

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.440 
more detailed to that when I actually do
the<00:02:27.379> tutorial<00:02:28.010> about<00:02:28.129> compositing<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.150> stuff

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
