all that in this video we're just going

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.110 
all that in this video we're just going
to<00:03:21.689> be<00:03:21.780> talking<00:03:22.109> about<00:03:22.170> initial<00:03:22.950> after<00:03:23.939> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
to be talking about initial after the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.949 
to be talking about initial after the
range<00:03:24.390> review<00:03:25.200> here<00:03:25.439> so<00:03:25.709> shot<00:03:26.430> really<00:03:26.790> well

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
range review here so shot really well

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.059 
range review here so shot really well
his<00:03:27.959> first<00:03:28.200> time<00:03:28.379> I'd<00:03:28.530> shot<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:31.069> really

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
his first time I'd shot it and I really

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.080 
his first time I'd shot it and I really
liked<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:33.450> very<00:03:34.079> few<00:03:34.859> just<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:36.030> of

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
liked it have very few just kind of

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.910 
liked it have very few just kind of
maybe<00:03:36.239> nitpicky<00:03:36.810> complaints<00:03:37.409> about<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.799> but

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
maybe nitpicky complaints about it but

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.339 
maybe nitpicky complaints about it but
they're<00:03:38.040> not<00:03:38.129> really<00:03:38.340> complaints<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.349> think

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
they're not really complaints I think

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.809 
they're not really complaints I think
they're<00:03:40.530> probably<00:03:40.829> things<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.489> could<00:03:41.700> be

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
they're probably things that could be

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.780 
they're probably things that could be
solved<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.269> well<00:03:42.980> one<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.010> them<00:03:44.250> was<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.519> grips

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
solved as well one of them was the grips

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.819 
solved as well one of them was the grips
I'm<00:03:45.269> not<00:03:45.450> real<00:03:45.689> big<00:03:45.810> into<00:03:46.049> wood<00:03:46.230> grips<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.680> I

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
I'm not real big into wood grips so I

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.949 
I'm not real big into wood grips so I
went<00:03:47.099> with<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.450> Ergo<00:03:50.510> here<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.629> is<00:03:51.720> xtr

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
went with the the Ergo here it is xtr

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.539 
went with the the Ergo here it is xtr
1911<00:03:54.959> grip<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:56.129> dark<00:03:56.579> earth<00:03:56.819> color<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.829> I

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
1911 grip in the dark earth color and I

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.629 
1911 grip in the dark earth color and I
think<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.939> really<00:04:00.560> helped<00:04:01.560> with<00:04:01.980> my<00:04:02.160> grip<00:04:02.430> on

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
think that really helped with my grip on

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.140 
think that really helped with my grip on
that<00:04:03.109> performed<00:04:04.109> well<00:04:04.349> after<00:04:04.829> I<00:04:04.889> got<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.579> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
that performed well after I got the the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.619 
that performed well after I got the the
sights<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:08.069> trigger<00:04:08.340> pull<00:04:08.609> down<00:04:08.879> it's

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
sights and the trigger pull down it's

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.199 
sights and the trigger pull down it's
about<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.959> four<00:04:10.230> pound<00:04:10.530> trigger<00:04:10.769> pull<00:04:11.209> so

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
about a four pound trigger pull so

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.279 
about a four pound trigger pull so
nothing<00:04:12.690> surprising<00:04:13.590> there<00:04:13.940> one<00:04:14.940> thing<00:04:15.150> that

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:15.289 
nothing surprising there one thing that

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.890 
nothing surprising there one thing that
I<00:04:16.289> will<00:04:16.590> say<00:04:16.620> about<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.159> trigger<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.900> there's

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
I will say about the trigger is there's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.990 
I will say about the trigger is there's
a<00:04:18.959> lot<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.699> extra<00:04:20.699> play<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:22.770> trigger<00:04:23.130> as<00:04:23.729> it

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
a lot of extra play in the trigger as it

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.839 
a lot of extra play in the trigger as it
comes<00:04:24.270> from<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.199> manufacturer<00:04:25.710> now<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.669> can

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
comes from the manufacturer now that can

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.060 
comes from the manufacturer now that can
probably<00:04:27.090> be<00:04:27.360> tightened<00:04:28.080> up<00:04:28.229> or<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.560> might<00:04:28.949> even

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
probably be tightened up or I might even

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.360 
probably be tightened up or I might even
change<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.669> trigger<00:04:29.970> out<00:04:30.949> but<00:04:31.949> it<00:04:32.099> didn't

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
change that trigger out but it didn't

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.839 
change that trigger out but it didn't
affect<00:04:32.669> my<00:04:32.820> shooting<00:04:33.150> at<00:04:33.630> all<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.699> saw

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
affect my shooting at all and as you saw

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.540 
affect my shooting at all and as you saw
in<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.060> video<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.389> mean<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.840> was<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:36.990> a

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
in the video I mean that was just a

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.240 
in the video I mean that was just a
human<00:04:38.550> user<00:04:39.030> error<00:04:39.530> when<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:40.560> first<00:04:40.830> started

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
human user error when I first started

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.510 
human user error when I first started
but<00:04:41.460> as<00:04:41.789> I<00:04:41.940> got<00:04:42.320> used<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.650> trigger<00:04:44.159> on<00:04:44.280> the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
but as I got used to the trigger on the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.430 
but as I got used to the trigger on the
sights<00:04:44.789> you<00:04:45.300> could<00:04:45.479> see<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.720> was<00:04:45.840> putting<00:04:46.320> them

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
sights you could see I was putting them

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.620 
sights you could see I was putting them
right<00:04:46.680> on<00:04:46.860> target

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
right on target

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.140 
right on target
another<00:04:48.630> thing<00:04:48.930> is<00:04:49.470> there's<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:50.130> seems<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.030> be<00:04:51.120> a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
another thing is there's a seems to be a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.589 
another thing is there's a seems to be a
lot<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.360> extra<00:04:51.599> play<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:53.250> safety<00:04:53.970> grip<00:04:54.330> as

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
lot of extra play in the safety grip as

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.089 
lot of extra play in the safety grip as
well<00:04:56.389> that<00:04:57.389> was<00:04:57.720> another<00:04:58.289> thing<00:04:58.560> don't<00:04:58.919> like

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
well that was another thing don't like

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.839 
well that was another thing don't like
my<00:04:59.310> guns<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.669> be<00:04:59.789> real<00:05:00.510> noisy<00:05:01.400> but<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.520> can<00:05:02.669> see

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
my guns to be real noisy but you can see

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.909 
my guns to be real noisy but you can see
that<00:05:03.030> right<00:05:03.150> there<00:05:03.389> you<00:05:03.479> can<00:05:03.599> hear<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.990> not<00:05:04.889> a

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
that right there you can hear that not a

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.399 
that right there you can hear that not a
big<00:05:05.310> issue<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.880> can<00:05:06.000> be<00:05:06.150> fixed<00:05:06.900> -<00:05:07.139> that's<00:05:07.349> a

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
big issue that can be fixed - that's a

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.040 
big issue that can be fixed - that's a
curable<00:05:08.180> if<00:05:09.180> we're<00:05:09.389> going<00:05:09.510> on<00:05:09.779> a<00:05:10.169> scale

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
curable if we're going on a scale

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.089 
curable if we're going on a scale
of<00:05:11.379> 1<00:05:11.710> to<00:05:11.860> 10<00:05:12.099> just<00:05:13.090> right<00:05:13.360> out<00:05:13.539> of<00:05:13.569> the<00:05:13.720> box<00:05:14.099> you
