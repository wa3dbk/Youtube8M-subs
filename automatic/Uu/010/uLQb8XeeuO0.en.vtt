for the dihybrid cross now for the
Drosophila<00:00:04.880> lab<00:00:05.470> first<00:00:06.470> thing<00:00:06.710> to<00:00:06.770> do<00:00:06.890> is

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
Drosophila lab first thing to do is

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.029 
Drosophila lab first thing to do is
going<00:00:07.310> over<00:00:07.580> your<00:00:07.700> flies<00:00:07.970> actually<00:00:09.039> once

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:10.039 
going over your flies actually once

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.379 
going over your flies actually once
again<00:00:10.309> I'll<00:00:10.400> turn<00:00:10.579> off<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:10.759> sounds<00:00:11.209> of<00:00:11.299> the

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
again I'll turn off the sounds of the

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.140 
again I'll turn off the sounds of the
transitions<00:00:13.570> going<00:00:14.570> in<00:00:14.659> order<00:00:14.839> your<00:00:14.990> flies

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
transitions going in order your flies

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.870 
transitions going in order your flies
your<00:00:17.150> female<00:00:17.630> will<00:00:18.560> once<00:00:18.800> again<00:00:18.949> at<00:00:19.490> first

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
your female will once again at first

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.630 
your female will once again at first
just<00:00:20.420> be<00:00:20.689> a<00:00:20.720> homozygous<00:00:21.380> dominant<00:00:21.640> the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
just be a homozygous dominant the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.179 
just be a homozygous dominant the
wild-type<00:00:22.970> your<00:00:23.839> males<00:00:24.199> you've<00:00:24.800> got<00:00:24.980> two

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
wild-type your males you've got two

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.279 
wild-type your males you've got two
traits<00:00:25.519> you're<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.910> example<00:00:26.449> I'm<00:00:26.839> gonna<00:00:26.990> give

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
traits you're the example I'm gonna give

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:37.270 
traits you're the example I'm gonna give
is<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:28.689> star<00:00:29.689> I<00:00:30.189> shape<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.990> a<00:00:34.330> sepia<00:00:35.330> I<00:00:35.750> color<00:00:36.710> so

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
is a star I shape and a sepia I color so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.940 
is a star I shape and a sepia I color so
it<00:00:37.520> has<00:00:38.080> two<00:00:39.080> genes<00:00:39.410> that<00:00:39.590> I'm<00:00:40.010> testing<00:00:40.910> for

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
it has two genes that I'm testing for

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:52.660 
it has two genes that I'm testing for
I'll<00:00:42.950> then<00:00:43.580> go<00:00:43.970> to<00:00:44.030> my<00:00:44.300> cart<00:00:44.660> checkout<00:00:51.670> I'll

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
I'll then go to my cart checkout I'll

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.900 
I'll then go to my cart checkout I'll
sort<00:00:53.030> them<00:00:53.150> out<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.170> see<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:54.470> have<00:00:54.910> some

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
sort them out and you see I have some

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.260 
sort them out and you see I have some
star<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:57.470> some<00:00:57.890> wild-type<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:58.910> there<00:00:59.180> is

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
star and some wild-type so there is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.670 
star and some wild-type so there is
something<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.660> little<00:00:59.840> bit<00:00:59.960> interesting<00:01:00.530> going

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
something a little bit interesting going

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.329 
something a little bit interesting going
on<00:01:00.950> here<00:01:01.310> that<00:01:02.150> the<00:01:02.780> star<00:01:03.200> doesn't<00:01:03.890> seem<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.220> be

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
on here that the star doesn't seem to be

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.300 
on here that the star doesn't seem to be
completely<00:01:04.759> recessive<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.920> wild-type

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
completely recessive to the wild-type

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.770 
completely recessive to the wild-type
regardless<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:10.490> want<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.910> take<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:13.480> warm<00:01:14.480> take<00:01:14.660> an

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
regardless I want to take a warm take an

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.950 
regardless I want to take a warm take an
individual<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:16.040> is<00:01:16.370> hair<00:01:17.180> azygous<00:01:17.510> I<00:01:17.870> know

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
individual that is hair azygous I know

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.310 
individual that is hair azygous I know
that<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.620> wild<00:01:18.980> type<00:01:19.220> female<00:01:20.090> will<00:01:20.900> certainly

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
that the wild type female will certainly

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.260 
that the wild type female will certainly
be<00:01:21.500> heterozygous<00:01:21.800> because<00:01:22.670> her<00:01:23.570> mom<00:01:23.870> was

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
be heterozygous because her mom was

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.120 
be heterozygous because her mom was
homozygous<00:01:26.270> dominant<00:01:26.840> for<00:01:27.290> both<00:01:27.409> traits<00:01:27.740> and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
homozygous dominant for both traits and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.360 
homozygous dominant for both traits and
her<00:01:28.190> father<00:01:28.430> was<00:01:28.760> homozygous<00:01:30.100> recessive<00:01:31.100> for

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
her father was homozygous recessive for

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.219 
her father was homozygous recessive for
both<00:01:31.520> traits<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.270> mom<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.600> definitely

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
both traits so the mom is definitely

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.219 
both traits so the mom is definitely
going<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.590> be<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:34.150> heterozygous<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:35.720> I'll<00:01:35.930> find

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
going to be a heterozygous so I'll find

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.610 
going to be a heterozygous so I'll find
that<00:01:36.770> wild<00:01:37.729> type<00:01:38.060> female<00:01:38.540> which<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.350> right

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
that wild type female which is right

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.670 
that wild type female which is right
here<00:01:39.650> I<00:01:40.010> will<00:01:40.729> use<00:01:41.240> her<00:01:41.720> in<00:01:41.870> my<00:01:41.990> new<00:01:42.170> meeting<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
here I will use her in my new meeting so

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.430 
here I will use her in my new meeting so
I'm<00:01:42.770> using<00:01:42.979> my<00:01:43.600> heterozygous<00:01:44.600> my

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
I'm using my heterozygous my

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.870 
I'm using my heterozygous my
heterozygote<00:01:46.220> female<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:49.130> I'm<00:01:49.190> using<00:01:49.460> her<00:01:49.760> in

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
heterozygote female so I'm using her in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.969 
heterozygote female so I'm using her in
a<00:01:49.970> new<00:01:50.090> meeting<00:01:50.390> jar<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.840> then<00:01:51.590> I'm<00:01:51.680> gonna<00:01:51.799> go

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
a new meeting jar and then I'm gonna go

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.289 
a new meeting jar and then I'm gonna go
back<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.060> lab<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.540> I'm<00:01:54.200> going<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:55.299> order

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
back to the lab and I'm going to order

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.940 
back to the lab and I'm going to order
another<00:01:57.460> male<00:01:59.290> that<00:02:00.290> was<00:02:00.500> homozygous

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
another male that was homozygous

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.510 
another male that was homozygous
recessive<00:02:01.909> for<00:02:02.119> both<00:02:02.869> eye<00:02:03.140> color<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.950> eye

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
recessive for both eye color and eye

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.270 
recessive for both eye color and eye
shape<00:02:04.960> which<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.260> star<00:02:06.530> I've<00:02:06.740> shape<00:02:06.979> just

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
shape which is the star I've shape just

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.750 
shape which is the star I've shape just
as<00:02:07.400> before

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.380 

and<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:22.580> female<00:02:23.580> homo<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and then I now have the female homo the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.620 
and then I now have the female homo the
female<00:02:24.750> heterozygous<00:02:26.630> heterozygote

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
female heterozygous heterozygote

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.910 
female heterozygous heterozygote
dominant<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.320> here<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.980> male<00:02:29.840> homozygous

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
dominant in here and the male homozygous

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.250 
dominant in here and the male homozygous
recessive<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.130> here<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
recessive in here and so this is the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.280 
recessive in here and so this is the
cross<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.770> you're<00:02:35.370> doing<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.510> number<00:02:36.990> two

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
cross that you're doing for number two

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.590 
cross that you're doing for number two
for<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.310> worksheet<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.850> you're<00:02:39.240> filling

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
for the worksheet that you're filling

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.790 
for the worksheet that you're filling
out<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.540> expect<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:43.230> happen<00:02:43.380> well

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
out so what do I expect to happen well

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.100 
out so what do I expect to happen well
this<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.520> called<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> die<00:02:45.060> bird<00:02:45.420> test<00:02:45.750> cross

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
this is called the die bird test cross

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.670 
this is called the die bird test cross

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
genotypic ratio and my phenotypic ratio

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.370 
genotypic ratio and my phenotypic ratio
is<00:02:58.800> going<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.580> 1<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.270> 1<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.780> 1<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.260> 1<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.180> 25%

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
is going to be a 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 so 25%

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.060 
is going to be a 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 so 25%
for<00:03:04.380> 4<00:03:04.830> different<00:03:05.190> phenotypes<00:03:06.980> let<00:03:07.980> you

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
for 4 different phenotypes let you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.830 
for 4 different phenotypes let you
figure<00:03:08.280> out<00:03:08.400> what<00:03:08.670> those<00:03:08.850> phenotypes<00:03:09.239> are<00:03:09.690> but

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
figure out what those phenotypes are but

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.150 
figure out what those phenotypes are but
what<00:03:09.989> I'm<00:03:10.080> expecting<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:11.540> 25%<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:13.380> each<00:03:13.709> one

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
what I'm expecting is 25% for each one

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.699 
what I'm expecting is 25% for each one
so<00:03:14.910> we'll<00:03:15.090> test<00:03:15.390> this<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.410> this

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
so we'll test this and see if this

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.280 
so we'll test this and see if this
matches<00:03:17.489> what<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.239> thought<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.930> would

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
matches what I thought it would

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.560 
matches what I thought it would
let's<00:03:20.070> sort<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> Flies<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:23.120> yeah<00:03:24.120> as<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
let's sort the Flies out and yeah as it

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.740 
let's sort the Flies out and yeah as it
turns<00:03:24.810> out<00:03:25.019> if<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.650> take<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.820> data<00:03:27.090> send<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.660> to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
turns out if I take this data send it to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.660 
turns out if I take this data send it to
my<00:03:27.870> computer<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.560> will<00:03:29.489> once<00:03:30.000> again<00:03:30.150> ignore<00:03:30.720> sex

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
my computer I will once again ignore sex

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.039 
my computer I will once again ignore sex
because<00:03:32.670> I'm<00:03:32.790> not<00:03:33.000> worried<00:03:33.420> about<00:03:33.510> whether

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
because I'm not worried about whether

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.840 
because I'm not worried about whether
males<00:03:34.410> or<00:03:34.680> females<00:03:34.709> have<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.430> neither<00:03:35.640> them

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
males or females have it neither them

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.570 
males or females have it neither them
appeared<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:37.160> sex-linked<00:03:38.160> trait<00:03:38.400> they

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
appeared to be sex-linked trait they

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.030 
appeared to be sex-linked trait they
both<00:03:38.790> appear<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.239> autosomal<00:03:39.840> traits<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.920> if

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
both appear to be autosomal traits so if

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.610 
both appear to be autosomal traits so if
I<00:03:41.130> look<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.400> my<00:03:41.549> data<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.150> looks<00:03:42.959> pretty<00:03:43.320> close

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
I look at my data it looks pretty close

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.120 
I look at my data it looks pretty close
to<00:03:43.730> 25%<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:45.420> all<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.720> these<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.170> I'd<00:03:46.590> go<00:03:46.890> in<00:03:47.010> and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
to 25% for all of these so I'd go in and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.550 
to 25% for all of these so I'd go in and
fill<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.640> information<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.660> step<00:03:49.140> 3

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
fill in this information and to step 3

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.750 
fill in this information and to step 3
of<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.340> lab<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.110> then<00:03:52.110> for<00:03:52.739> step<00:03:53.250> 4<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
of the lab and then for step 4 of the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.289 
of the lab and then for step 4 of the
lab<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.180> would<00:03:54.269> have<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.570> actually<00:03:54.720> perform

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
lab I would have to actually perform

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:04.009 
lab I would have to actually perform
chi-square<00:03:57.299> test<00:03:58.640> so<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:02.209> find<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:03.510> once

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
chi-square test so if I find out once

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.590 
chi-square test so if I find out once
again<00:04:04.230> if<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.950> have<00:04:06.470> 1214<00:04:07.470> individuals

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
again if I have 1214 individuals

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.000 
again if I have 1214 individuals
expected<00:04:11.420> approximately<00:04:12.420> 303<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.560> each<00:04:13.709> type

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
expected approximately 303 of each type

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.390 
expected approximately 303 of each type
so<00:04:14.720> if<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.810> go<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.200> enter<00:04:16.470> my<00:04:16.500> hypothesis

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
so if I go in and enter my hypothesis

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.040 
so if I go in and enter my hypothesis
for<00:04:17.640> each<00:04:17.820> one<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.299> be<00:04:18.440> 303

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.909 

I<00:04:24.270> can<00:04:25.270> then<00:04:25.419> come<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.960> perform<00:04:26.139> a<00:04:26.470> chi-square

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
I can then come and perform a chi-square

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.640 
I can then come and perform a chi-square
analysis<00:04:26.949> on<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.180> as<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.139> see<00:04:29.199> that

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
analysis on this so as you can see that

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.610 
analysis on this so as you can see that
25%<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:31.180> these<00:04:31.659> species<00:04:32.229> of<00:04:32.409> these

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
25% of these species of these

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.040 
25% of these species of these
individuals<00:04:33.310> are<00:04:33.580> wild-type<00:04:34.360> meaning<00:04:34.960> they

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
individuals are wild-type meaning they

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.200 
individuals are wild-type meaning they
have<00:04:35.229> their<00:04:35.500> regular<00:04:35.710> eye<00:04:36.099> shape<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.729> their

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
have their regular eye shape and their

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.770 
have their regular eye shape and their
regular<00:04:37.780> eye<00:04:38.020> color<00:04:38.819> you<00:04:39.819> could<00:04:39.940> see<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.240> 25

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
regular eye color you could see that 25

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.649 
regular eye color you could see that 25
percent<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.500> them<00:04:41.620> had<00:04:41.860> sappy<00:04:42.310> eyes<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.909> starr

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
percent of them had sappy eyes and starr

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.879 
percent of them had sappy eyes and starr
eyes<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:44.110> this<00:04:44.229> case<00:04:44.470> they're<00:04:44.770> homozygous

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
eyes in this case they're homozygous

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.360 
eyes in this case they're homozygous
homozygous<00:04:47.889> recessive<00:04:48.849> for<00:04:49.139> both<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.500> the

trait that we're measuring so I've got

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.950

my<00:05:05.710> hypotheses<00:05:06.699> in<00:05:06.909> here<00:05:07.150> I'm<00:05:07.300> now<00:05:07.539> gonna<00:05:07.750> run

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
my hypotheses in here I'm now gonna run

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.809 
my hypotheses in here I'm now gonna run
them<00:05:08.080> through<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.289> Machine<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:09.460> can<00:05:09.610> see

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
them through the Machine and you can see

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.279 
them through the Machine and you can see
I<00:05:09.849> get<00:05:10.389> a<00:05:10.419> pretty<00:05:10.719> good<00:05:10.930> level<00:05:11.139> of

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
I get a pretty good level of

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.200 
I get a pretty good level of
significance<00:05:11.819> definitely<00:05:12.819> a<00:05:12.849> lot<00:05:13.000> larger

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
significance definitely a lot larger

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.619 
significance definitely a lot larger
than<00:05:13.620> 0.05<00:05:14.699> okay<00:05:15.699> suggesting<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.509> my

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
than 0.05 okay suggesting that my

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:22.950 
than 0.05 okay suggesting that my
hypothesis<00:05:17.319> is<00:05:17.349> likely<00:05:17.740> true<00:05:20.310> so<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.960> can

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
hypothesis is likely true so you can

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.999 
hypothesis is likely true so you can
then<00:05:23.080> go<00:05:23.139> on<00:05:23.530> from<00:05:23.789> number<00:05:24.789> 4<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.830> accept<00:05:26.830> or

then go on from number 4 to accept or

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.890 
then go on from number 4 to accept or

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
reject your null hypothesis so number 5

are the genes linked on the same
chromosome<00:05:31.060> well<00:05:31.419> they<00:05:31.779> don't<00:05:31.900> seem<00:05:32.259> to<00:05:32.440> be

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
chromosome well they don't seem to be

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.959

dependent on each other it seems to be a

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:39.149

fairly even number of observed versus
expected<00:05:40.139> here<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:41.440> I<00:05:41.860> don't<00:05:42.400> think<00:05:42.610> they<00:05:42.819> are

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
expected here so I don't think they are

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.820

use that handout that I gave you in

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.939 
use that handout that I gave you in

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
will you likely have is a set of genes

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.089 
will you likely have is a set of genes
that<00:06:09.699> are<00:06:09.879> on<00:06:10.029> the<00:06:10.210> same<00:06:10.449> chromosome<00:06:10.990> or<00:06:11.379> you

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
that are on the same chromosome or you

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.730 
that are on the same chromosome or you
have<00:06:12.819> one<00:06:13.300> set<00:06:13.539> of<00:06:13.659> genes<00:06:13.960> that<00:06:14.169> might<00:06:14.680> be

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
have one set of genes that might be

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.339 
have one set of genes that might be
lethal<00:06:15.430> in<00:06:15.699> certain<00:06:16.509> combinations<00:06:17.110> with

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
lethal in certain combinations with

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.350 
lethal in certain combinations with
other<00:06:17.500> genes<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:18.190> so<00:06:18.729> you'll<00:06:18.909> have<00:06:19.029> to<00:06:19.180> take<00:06:19.300> a

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
other genes and so you'll have to take a

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.969 
other genes and so you'll have to take a
look<00:06:19.539> at<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.779> data<00:06:19.960> for<00:06:20.199> yourself<00:06:20.560> and<00:06:20.830> try

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
look at the data for yourself and try

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.059 
look at the data for yourself and try
and<00:06:21.099> figure<00:06:21.279> out<00:06:21.430> what<00:06:21.669> that's<00:06:21.879> all<00:06:22.060> about<00:06:23.069> if

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
and figure out what that's all about if

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:26.459 
and figure out what that's all about if
you're<00:06:24.279> wondering<00:06:24.639> which<00:06:24.879> traits<00:06:25.569> to<00:06:25.870> use<00:06:26.169> for

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
you're wondering which traits to use for

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.980 
you're wondering which traits to use for
your<00:06:26.560> dihybrid<00:06:26.889> cross<00:06:27.310> try<00:06:28.180> and<00:06:28.300> use<00:06:28.479> traits

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
your dihybrid cross try and use traits

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.159 
your dihybrid cross try and use traits
that<00:06:29.440> are<00:06:29.590> given<00:06:29.949> to<00:06:30.190> you<00:06:30.279> on<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.870> front<00:06:31.870> page

of the virtual lab that I gave you so if

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.810 
of the virtual lab that I gave you so if
you<00:06:35.919> look<00:06:36.099> there

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820

five I signed you each in a row try and

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.720 
five I signed you each in a row try and
cross<00:06:41.470> only<00:06:41.830> traits<00:06:42.370> in<00:06:42.670> that<00:06:43.000> row<00:06:43.390> if<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:44.380> can

cross only traits in that row if you can

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.670 
cross only traits in that row if you can
you<00:06:45.730> can<00:06:45.850> see<00:06:46.000> that<00:06:46.030> there's<00:06:46.300> four<00:06:46.540> traits<00:06:46.960> so

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
you can see that there's four traits so

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.100 
you can see that there's four traits so
there's<00:06:47.890> quite<00:06:48.280> a<00:06:48.310> few<00:06:48.610> different<00:06:49.000> options

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
there's quite a few different options

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.870 
there's quite a few different options
that<00:06:50.110> you're<00:06:50.320> able<00:06:50.500> to<00:06:50.710> do<00:06:50.920> there<00:06:51.160> as<00:06:51.490> you're

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
that you're able to do there as you're

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.420 
that you're able to do there as you're
crossing<00:06:52.150> so<00:06:52.960> just<00:06:53.350> try<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:53.590> do<00:06:53.710> any<00:06:53.890> four<00:06:54.400> of

crossing so just try and do any four of

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.810 
crossing so just try and do any four of
them<00:06:54.730> some<00:06:55.360> traits<00:06:55.870> might<00:06:56.290> not<00:06:56.580> be<00:06:59.820> some
