economy but triple digit quadruple digit
last<00:00:52.559> year<00:00:52.830> we<00:00:52.949> had<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> different<00:00:53.549> car<00:00:53.729> with

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
last year we had a different car with

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.420 
last year we had a different car with
this<00:00:54.479> engine<00:00:54.720> using<00:00:55.589> a<00:00:55.680> carburetor<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.280> got

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this engine using a carburetor we got

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.630 
this engine using a carburetor we got
842<00:00:57.269> miles<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.869> gallon<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.400> put<00:00:59.580> us

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
842 miles to the gallon so that put us

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.929 
842 miles to the gallon so that put us
in<00:00:59.760> sixth<00:01:00.000> place<00:01:00.119> we<00:01:00.869> got<00:01:01.799> a<00:01:01.860> run<00:01:02.100> every<00:01:02.670> time

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:02.939 
in sixth place we got a run every time

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.690 
in sixth place we got a run every time
over<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:03.930> thousand<00:01:04.530> miles<00:01:04.710> per<00:01:04.949> gallon<00:01:05.250> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
over a thousand miles per gallon this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
over a thousand miles per gallon this
year<00:01:05.939> we're<00:01:06.150> expecting<00:01:06.600> over<00:01:06.720> 2000<00:01:07.350> miles<00:01:07.500> per

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
year we're expecting over 2000 miles per

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
year we're expecting over 2000 miles per
gallon<00:01:08.100> last<00:01:08.820> year<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.299> won<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.570> competition

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
gallon last year we won the competition

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.249 
gallon last year we won the competition
with<00:01:10.700> 1485<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:12.450> thinking<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
with 1485 we're thinking because the

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.310 
with 1485 we're thinking because the
body<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.580> twice<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.000> good<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.049> last

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
body is is twice as good as it was last

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.440 
body is is twice as good as it was last
year<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:17.189> we're<00:01:17.340> hoping<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:18.180> twice

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
year that we're hoping for about twice

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.190 
year that we're hoping for about twice
as<00:01:18.659> much<00:01:18.810> fuel<00:01:19.470> economy<00:01:19.740> round<00:01:20.869> 3000<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.990> what

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
as much fuel economy round 3000 is what

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.140 
as much fuel economy round 3000 is what
we're<00:01:22.380> aiming<00:01:23.159> for

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
we're aiming for

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.570 
we're aiming for
we're<00:01:24.570> first<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.960> were<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.620> early

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
number of changes the first vehicles we

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.050 
number of changes the first vehicles we
used<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.300> out<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.619> had<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:05.009> pole<00:02:05.580> start

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
used to see out here had a pole start

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
used to see out here had a pole start
engine<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.350> my<00:02:07.530> rototiller

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
engine like is on my rototiller

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.490 
engine like is on my rototiller
there<00:02:08.729> were<00:02:08.910> people<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.450> literally<00:02:10.050> had<00:02:10.259> a

lawn chair and an engine on the back we

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.940 
lawn chair and an engine on the back we
did<00:02:18.239> some<00:02:18.390> electronic<00:02:18.870> changes<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.739> an

enrichment around that easy we said she

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
made changes to the aerodynamics when we

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.510 
made changes to the aerodynamics when we
recast<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.290> body<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.830> started<00:02:26.160> with<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> car

good friction in the wheels and we have

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.710 
good friction in the wheels and we have
improved<00:03:10.769> window<00:03:11.280> visibility<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.540> been

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
improved window visibility so it's been

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.110

safety is our priority here we have a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.220 
safety is our priority here we have a
checklist<00:05:05.140> that<00:05:05.410> we<00:05:05.680> go<00:05:05.830> through<00:05:06.130> there<00:05:06.669> is

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
checklist that we go through there is

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.290

basically<00:05:08.230> about<00:05:08.620> seven<00:05:09.070> seven<00:05:09.430> steps<00:05:09.669> we

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
basically about seven seven steps we

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.860 
basically about seven seven steps we
check<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:10.720> roll<00:05:10.930> roll<00:05:11.500> cage<00:05:11.770> strength<00:05:12.870> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
maneuverability of the vehicle we also

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.700 
maneuverability of the vehicle we also
check<00:05:17.100> driver<00:05:18.419> extraction<00:05:19.419> for<00:05:19.840> safety<00:05:20.169> we

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
check driver extraction for safety we

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.940 
check driver extraction for safety we
are<00:05:20.830> looking<00:05:21.280> for<00:05:21.700> anything<00:05:22.330> that<00:05:22.780> poses<00:05:23.680> a

extinguishers braking systems work
properly<00:05:32.740> we<00:05:33.550> try<00:05:33.760> to<00:05:33.820> nudge<00:05:34.060> them<00:05:34.210> into<00:05:34.419> the

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
properly we try to nudge them into the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.170 
properly we try to nudge them into the
right<00:05:34.630> direction<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.410> we<00:05:35.590> also<00:05:36.400> encourage

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
right direction but we also encourage

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.670 
right direction but we also encourage
them<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.450> come<00:05:37.570> up<00:05:37.600> with<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.169> correct

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
them to come up with the correct

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.320 
them to come up with the correct
solution<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.310> their<00:05:39.460> own<00:05:39.580> problems

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
solution to their own problems

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.930 
solution to their own problems
I<00:05:40.680> think<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.770> winners<00:05:42.010> of<00:05:42.039> supermileage<00:05:42.610> are

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
I think the winners of supermileage are

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.700 
I think the winners of supermileage are
teams<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.270> are<00:05:43.450> well<00:05:43.600> organized<00:05:44.169> in

every assumption they know about engines

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.590 
every assumption they know about engines
and<00:06:02.470> try<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.400> again<00:06:03.700> with<00:06:04.180> something

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
and try it again with something

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.710 
and try it again with something
different<00:06:04.930> they're<00:06:05.860> gonna<00:06:06.100> learn<00:06:06.310> a<00:06:06.370> ton<00:06:06.820> they
