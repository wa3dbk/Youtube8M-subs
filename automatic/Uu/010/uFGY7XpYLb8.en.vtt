00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.060
 good friends of the channel of decia sti today 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.720
 we are going to perform the antutu test 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.630
 benchmark on sony z3 compact and up 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.029
 samsung galaxy alpha 2 phones 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.820
 pocketed by the processor from 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.980
 advanced features so let's go 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.910
 to open the antutu application 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.600
 benchmark we wait for it to come 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.600
 initialized on both 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.940
 see on sony has been initialized 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:57.140
 first perhaps because it had already been on alpha 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.590
 performed then we start with the test 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.590
 let's begin 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.260
 here the sony has already finished wait 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:13.280
 that also ends galaxy alfa to see 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:17.150
 the benchmark antutu scores has finished 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:23.120
 also galaxy alfa these are the scores 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:27.980
 reporting the two 44.250 phones 3 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.590
 for the sony 50.000 431 for samsung 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.530
 galaxy alfa 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.540
 I leave to you the interpretation of these 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.870
 benchmark I remind you that the two phones 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.850
 the same version of the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.330
 android operating system then 4.4.4 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:54.220
 see identical they have the same ram 2 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:00.549
 gigabytes of ram and the same resolution 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:04.280
 of the display therefore 1200 80 x 720 pixels 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.900
 with this test it's all I give you 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.730
 appointment to the next video 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.730
