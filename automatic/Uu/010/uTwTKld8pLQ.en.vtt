00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.500
 hello everyone with you sonar now i will 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.430
 compare two planes is planes 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:24.330
 andromada and from 400 and so is from 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 400 here here here here here 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.670
 This garage Las Venturas and Well 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.340
 he enter at last and with what you can 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.129
 look so come on and now i'm 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.270
 tell you about from 400 where he is and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.860
 the fact is that he is nowhere and 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.539
 it is only possible with the help of this 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.059
 fashion, that is, to get the type of spawner machines 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.789
 remember the cars there map 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:59.000
 I estimate the spawn of the certificate cards in general 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.710
 him sit down and if you want let's say 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.369
 you will have to ride it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.479
 download mod fashion because without you nothing 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:13.110
 so here this plane is found in two 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 times semi in the game in missions and on it you 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.990
 never fly and so here you can 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.299
 fly on it so and let 's spawn 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.680
 one more airplane is not 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.689
 this plane which is in that garage 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.689
 from 400 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.570
 So 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.310
 so well here 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.310
 I got on a plane and now we will try 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.659
 let's go 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.920
 put so close to compare what 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.580
 of which more than that my 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.039
 the task is to figure out which one is more 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.149
 and tell you all tut.by where 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.409
 proper along the length of the side so they 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.409
 equally st and yes Ñ‘-my 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:12.209
 damn thats here thanks we all leave 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.209
 aircraft 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.250
 and look what seems to me from 400 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.490
 more beautiful 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:30.380
 drama yes this white no look here 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:35.450
 This is more beautiful from 400 and it is more and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.840
 For a long time, then somehow, they are not a little bit. 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.820
 similar to something like this 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:48.320
 gloomy what is he cargo 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:50.290
 and that one is already a passenger, so only 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.840
 of these are such 22 aircraft 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.450
 well let's let it be that i declare 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.280
 a winner from 400 and let's ka 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.130
 try 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.310
 wreck these two planes 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.910

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.270
