00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.830

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 here on youtube in the video day has 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.240
 Made me really 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.140
 It was super mega cool but that way 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 many experiences and impressions i 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.760
 had to process first and therefore 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 I have some time off 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.720

 So interested in writing the like 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.940
 first of all handle that me 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.410

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.120
 Upload that and I will get you 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.710
 Of course, if you still know me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.660
 not if not then I do like that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 now here you can click on it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
 then you get that over with otherwise 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.869
 I inform you as I said also 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 like to use facebook instagram and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.260
 twitter and you will also find these links on the left 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.930
 in the infobox 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.490
 so what's new on those 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.650
 the video was unfortunately one 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.689
 bit disappointed because we had 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 hoped that they would put the meow pillow there 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 Unfortunately, it did not work out 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 was unfortunately one day late so the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.920
 Pillows arrived on saturday and that was 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.180
 unfortunately too late for that then on the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 video for sale 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.140
 but now here I finally hold it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 managed the bsg sank on ebay 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.850
 that's the pillow that i put in the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.509
 last months together with courage quickly 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.890
 designed to have it really was not that 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.600
 simply because we have different 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.060
 First of all, we create different patterns 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.680
 had different graphics and then 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.360
 I did not like that but I found 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.100
 already that it must look after me and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.510
 not after any hobbs because of that 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.250
 here too the eyes are so outward 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.990
 with me also has these camellias 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.229
 Look, you know that 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.000
 and yes, I really wanted it that way 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.590
 I can say that's ok was me 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.209
 it and so I would like to sell and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.660
 Now it is finally available in the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.970
 onlineshop freimuth fast than direct 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.590
 Of course you will find link to that right away 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.050
 below and what I still tell you 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.140
 I wanted to be pillowed by everyone 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.320
 one euro each from the proceeds to the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.670
 shelter mannheim donate for those 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.120
 who have been following me for some time now 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.410
 that for the new i have beside her 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.720
 pug we have another pug and mops 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.940
 Although the martini martin ochs is called because of 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.070
 mannheim animals we have last 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.590
 year in september take place in november 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.600
 We got there from the shelter 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.080
 via the facebook page of the animal shelter 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.200
 seen that he is an old pug 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.250
 was suspended in mannheim and that is 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.720
 not so fit anymore 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.400
 he does not hear so well anymore he does not see 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.079
 more so good and he is not anymore 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.079
 so how should I say 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.190
 So from the movement 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.870
 but we are really very good at it 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.260
 managed him in the last months 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.700
 to train and I work since then 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.959
 very much like the shelter in 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.079
 I'll be together on the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.700

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.760
 be there and just get started 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.430
 So the dog shit away in the dog house 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.200
 and just look what you can 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.870

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.910

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.140

 if needed there is nothing
