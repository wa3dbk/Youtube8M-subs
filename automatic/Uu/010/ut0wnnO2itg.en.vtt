00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.410
 the big canyon as you do in the first 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.060
 instance at least 8 pancakes and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.380
 how many millions of times did we do 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.360
 packages here or if you do not know it you're going to 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.480
 put for 8 parts that you are going to put 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.419
 have whole chicken eggs in a 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.819
 bowl with 3 tablespoons of flour and you're going 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.159
 to send milk or water and you will shake 

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:25.839
 so with passion and crazy fury so that 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.880
 there is no group left and you go 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.619
 making the pancakes as the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.829
 you're doing the putting in a 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.420
 countertop covers them with a spacer 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.309
 money so they do not dry out and then 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.949
 have them in this way look 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.010
 four online that is online four 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:45.190
 just passed over each other and 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.030
 four others and between them they stick a 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.839
 brushstroke like mayonnaise this mega cannon 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.030
 of tuna and other things is eaten cold if the 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.249
 risk is negotiating the pancakes with a 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.050
 little mayonnaise with respect to the filling 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.290
 minutes 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.700
 eleven 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.979
 so it's a big run to go 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.740
 cutting into slices 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.479
 cold and unemployed because nothing of saucer 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.620
 you can also napkin and it goes 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.880
 eating we already have 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:21.510
 red pepper was opened and onions 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.490
 green all raw and all raw tuna 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.770
 that you take it out of the can that can be 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.650
 blue obviously to turin retains 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.410
 natural in oil the elusive a little 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.050
 water or oil and the basics that 'no 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.680
 and you mix it with the onion of 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.770
 verdeo el morrón and celery this alone 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 to start because the truth has of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.700
 all for example surname of Marians and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.570
 mariana males 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.340
 black olives of these yes sir yes 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:02.130
 that more almonds for very good 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.130
 almond I was wondering about music 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.140
 let's go with some cream cheese 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.030
 cream cheese because all this has 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 solids and if you have to amalgamate 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.410
 then a little mayonnaise a little 16 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.410
 cream we put the tuna 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.150
 remember a lot of ingredients 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.490
 obviously you will not put what you 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.220
 you want and can or want and those who 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.480
 no no it's not going to change the taste you're going to 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.750
 define you 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.180
 this is an idea just for the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.160
 people go and open the refrigerator so 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.760
 find everything and in this 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.989
 big 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.300
 do not put everything you find in 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.940
 it's not just that it exists 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.860
 with one with a trigger that are a pair 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.570
 of cans of tuna the rest what you 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.150
 go see us we went finding 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.120
 a little celery green onion 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.790
 morrón we are going to put you agitated until 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.780
 is fine well well well chopped would follow 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.720
 more than chopped 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.110
 recontra ground some ginger too 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.980
 remember that ginger is picantito is 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.830
 very very aromatic and it's like citrus is 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.120
 fragrant feeling of freshness so 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.790
 in this type of winding are 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.730
 cool combinations is very very good and 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.510
 more power and zest with the 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.510
 Skin of a lemon 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.200
 more freshness 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.090
 green apple cubes 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.360
 therefore the whole family 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.330
 bombs scoring surely you missed 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.970
 it does not matter then you go and get in www 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.800
 considered from Argentine puntocom and there 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.140
 they will upload the video they will upload the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.849
 recipe or if you do not get on the facebook and 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.299
 there you will also have the possibility 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.340
 on facebook at www.shell.com point to 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.440
 bar so that you cook to find 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.049
 the amount of ingredients that you 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.989
 we are putting here and they are me 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.989
 warning there are already photos of chopped 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.610
 but what a barbarian that does not go 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.540
 good a little dry tomato let's go 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.560
 with dry tomato some May 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.250
 we needed with older people remember that 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.700
 it is that it was filled in on the one hand the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.550
 cream cheese or white cheese and on the other 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.610
 side the mayonnaise that is missing me 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.060
 over here some green I have civil 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.380
 I have parsley and surely now you know 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.230
 that I'm going to put a key product 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:39.160
 because I want something very rich inside and 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.160
 you know that a very good mozzarella
