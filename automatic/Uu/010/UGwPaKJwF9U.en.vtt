00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.930 
in soups and stews they don't last long
I'm<00:04:22.229> surprised<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:22.770> jar<00:04:23.070> still<00:04:23.430> here<00:04:23.789> and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
I'm surprised that jar still here and

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.409 
I'm surprised that jar still here and
then<00:04:24.660> back<00:04:25.110> here<00:04:25.860> I've<00:04:26.039> got<00:04:26.340> celery<00:04:26.880> and

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
then back here I've got celery and

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.540 
then back here I've got celery and
that's<00:04:28.020> probably<00:04:29.930> 20<00:04:30.930> bundles<00:04:31.560> or<00:04:31.889> bunches<00:04:32.340> of

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
that's probably 20 bundles or bunches of

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.900 
that's probably 20 bundles or bunches of
celery<00:04:33.199> dehydrated<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:35.070> was<00:04:35.340> gonna<00:04:35.520> put<00:04:35.820> it

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
celery dehydrated and I was gonna put it

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.620 
celery dehydrated and I was gonna put it
in<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.330> soup<00:04:37.020> today<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.940> can<00:04:39.210> be<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.419> little

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
in the soup today it can be a little

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.960 
in the soup today it can be a little
strong<00:04:40.020> once<00:04:40.260> it's<00:04:40.470> dehydrated<00:04:41.160> stuff<00:04:41.460> gets<00:04:41.729> a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
strong once it's dehydrated stuff gets a

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.110 
strong once it's dehydrated stuff gets a
little<00:04:42.270> more<00:04:43.190> flavorful<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.460> wanted<00:04:44.789> to

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
little more flavorful and I wanted to

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.170 
little more flavorful and I wanted to
really<00:04:45.449> be<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.690> smooth<00:04:46.080> soft<00:04:46.440> soup<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.520> didn't

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
really be a smooth soft soup so I didn't

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.010 
really be a smooth soft soup so I didn't
put<00:04:48.330> them<00:04:48.389> in<00:04:48.539> there<00:04:48.660> because<00:04:48.750> some

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
put them in there because some

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.080 
put them in there because some
dehydrated<00:04:49.710> things<00:04:49.949> will<00:04:50.250> stay<00:04:50.490> chewy<00:04:50.789> like
