the dimension box

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.229 
the dimension box
we'll<00:00:46.320> make<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.559> 1000<00:00:47.399> by<00:00:47.670> 1000<00:00:48.390> millimeters

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
we'll make it 1000 by 1000 millimeters

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
we'll make it 1000 by 1000 millimeters
next<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.539> draw<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> toilet<00:00:52.340> we<00:00:53.340> will<00:00:53.489> draw

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
next we can draw a toilet we will draw

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.130 
next we can draw a toilet we will draw
it<00:00:53.820> from<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> middle<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.870> will<00:00:54.989> be

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it from the middle so that it will be

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
it from the middle so that it will be
drawn<00:00:55.379> exactly<00:00:55.879> 450<00:00:56.879> millimeters<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.690> the

drawn exactly 450 millimeters from the
side<00:00:58.109> wall<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> midline<00:00:59.600> let's<00:01:00.600> make<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
side wall to the midline let's make the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.969 
side wall to the midline let's make the
toilet<00:01:01.320> dimensions<00:01:02.120> 400<00:01:03.120> millimeters<00:01:03.629> by<00:01:04.140> 720

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.080 
toilet dimensions 400 millimeters by 720
millimeters<00:01:07.010> next<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.310> draw<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> vanity<00:01:08.970> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
millimeters next we can draw a vanity in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990 
millimeters next we can draw a vanity in
this<00:01:09.270> corner<00:01:10.189> pressing<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.490> key<00:01:11.760> will

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this corner pressing the up key will

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.670 
this corner pressing the up key will
change<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> vanity<00:01:12.840> direction<00:01:13.320> while<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
change the vanity direction while you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.910 
change the vanity direction while you
are<00:01:13.830> drawing<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.869> vanity<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.680> set<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
are drawing this vanity will be set to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.560 
are drawing this vanity will be set to
dimensions<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.670> 1200<00:01:18.420> by<00:01:18.689> 450<00:01:19.530> millimeters

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
dimensions of 1200 by 450 millimeters

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
dimensions of 1200 by 450 millimeters
finally<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:21.960> draw<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> door<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.189> wall

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
finally we will draw a door on this wall

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.760 
finally we will draw a door on this wall
starting<00:01:24.210> 100<00:01:24.750> millimeters<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.409> from<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
starting 100 millimeters out from the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.060 
starting 100 millimeters out from the
right<00:01:25.950> wall<00:01:27.020> pressing<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> shift<00:01:28.200> key<00:01:28.680> will

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
right wall pressing the shift key will

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
right wall pressing the shift key will
fix<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> width<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.909> height<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> correct

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
fix the width and height to the correct

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.649 
fix the width and height to the correct
proportions<00:01:31.710> however<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.909> also<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
proportions however we also want the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.050 
proportions however we also want the
door<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.020> swing<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.439> other<00:01:34.470> way<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.549> press<00:01:35.759> tab

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
door to swing the other way so press tab

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
door to swing the other way so press tab
to<00:01:36.329> change<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> direction<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> door

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
to change the direction of the door

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.789 
to change the direction of the door
swing<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.689> this<00:01:39.689> case<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> door<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
swing in this case we want the door to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.819 
swing in this case we want the door to
be<00:01:41.119> 820<00:01:42.119> millimeters<00:01:42.600> wide<00:01:42.810> which<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.680> can

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
be 820 millimeters wide which we can

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.710 
be 820 millimeters wide which we can
determine<00:01:44.159> by<00:01:44.520> reading<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> dimension<00:01:45.479> box

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
determine by reading the dimension box

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.399 
determine by reading the dimension box
values<00:01:46.850> all<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> bathroom<00:01:48.600> objects<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.259> now

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
values all the bathroom objects have now

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
values all the bathroom objects have now
been<00:01:49.619> added<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.040> our<00:01:50.310> floor<00:01:50.549> plan<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.200> next

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
been added to our floor plan the next

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.230 
been added to our floor plan the next
step<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> draw<00:01:53.009> dimensions<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> floor

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
step is to draw dimensions for the floor

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.200 
step is to draw dimensions for the floor
plan<00:01:54.860> ot<00:01:55.860> draw<00:01:56.070> makes<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.579> easy<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
plan ot draw makes it very easy to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.300 
plan ot draw makes it very easy to
insert<00:01:57.509> dimensions<00:01:58.140> by<00:01:58.469> snapping<00:01:58.950> between

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
insert dimensions by snapping between

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.969 
insert dimensions by snapping between
points<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.329> pressing<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> D<00:02:01.079> K<00:02:01.350> again<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
points and pressing the D K again to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.410 
points and pressing the D K again to
slide<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> dimension<00:02:02.880> away<00:02:03.000> from<00:02:03.329> the
