for me it's about the movement it's
about<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> constant<00:00:06.540> discovery<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.350> my<00:00:07.589> body

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
about the constant discovery of my body

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.540 
about the constant discovery of my body
and<00:00:08.189> how<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:09.559> functions<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.800> works<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.280> love

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
and how it functions and works I love

recurrent research that is going on

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.140 
recurrent research that is going on
doing<00:01:24.450> writings<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.140> findings<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.650> their<00:01:25.770> own

doing writings and findings of their own

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
doing writings and findings of their own
and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.720> last<00:01:28.020> aspect<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and then the last aspect is the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.910 
and then the last aspect is the
technical<00:01:29.490> production<00:01:35.930> my<00:01:36.930> typical<00:01:37.409> day<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
technical production my typical day is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.420 
technical production my typical day is
being<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.610> from<00:01:39.090> eight<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.380> nine<00:01:40.590> a.m.<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
being here from eight to nine a.m. so

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.929 
being here from eight to nine a.m. so
seven<00:01:44.570> depending<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.750> rehearsals<00:01:46.560> i<00:01:46.939> would

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
seven depending on rehearsals i would

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
seven depending on rehearsals i would
say<00:01:48.180> i<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.600> about<00:01:50.329> 15<00:01:51.329> hours<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:52.170> rehearsal<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
say i have about 15 hours of rehearsal a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
say i have about 15 hours of rehearsal a
week<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.520> almost<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:54.090> having<00:01:54.240> another

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
week so it's almost like having another

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.440 
week so it's almost like having another
major<00:01:55.340> dance<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> not<00:01:56.729> something<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
major dance is not something that you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.620 
major dance is not something that you
can<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.399> driven<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.450> do

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
can just do you have to be driven to do

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
can just do you have to be driven to do
it<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.250> there's<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> connection<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.329> we

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it and there's this connection that we

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.380 
it and there's this connection that we
need<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:05.610> don't<00:02:05.670> look<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
need to have and we don't look for it it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.710 
need to have and we don't look for it it
just<00:02:06.420> happens

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
just happens

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.350 
just happens
brings<00:02:08.649> us<00:02:08.890> together<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.880> answers<00:02:10.180> because

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
brings us together the answers because

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.330 
brings us together the answers because
they<00:02:10.600> have<00:02:10.840> they<00:02:10.990> are<00:02:11.020> sort<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.500> disciplines

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
they have they are sort of disciplines

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.210 
they have they are sort of disciplines
that<00:02:12.550> there<00:02:12.880> are<00:02:12.940> actually<00:02:13.240> better<00:02:14.220> educators

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that there are actually better educators
