00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
light so what the reflector is going to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
light so what the reflector is going to
do<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.720> allow<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.080> natural<00:01:22.560> bounce<00:01:22.770> off

a smaller box we can actually just have
one<00:01:49.200> diffusion<00:01:49.710> layer<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.970> bigger<00:01:51.150> box<00:01:51.390> has

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
one diffusion layer the bigger box has

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
one diffusion layer the bigger box has
the<00:01:51.750> two<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.650> we're<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.100> actually
