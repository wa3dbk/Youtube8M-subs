00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
9 in a side-by-side size comparison now

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.579 
9 in a side-by-side size comparison now
to<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.429> more<00:00:29.789> specific<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.960> Tab<00:00:31.320> s

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
to be more specific this is the Tab s

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.420 
to be more specific this is the Tab s
series<00:00:32.580> so<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> tab<00:00:34.290> pro<00:00:34.740> source<00:00:35.070> it's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
series so there is a tab pro source it's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.580 
series so there is a tab pro source it's
the<00:00:35.550> same<00:00:35.760> size<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.539> the<00:00:36.600> Tabitha's<00:00:37.230> latest

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the same size but the Tabitha's latest

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.770 
the same size but the Tabitha's latest
and<00:00:37.710> greatest<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.160> Samsung<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.480> size

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and greatest from Samsung at this size

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049 
and greatest from Samsung at this size
so<00:00:40.469> we're<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.129> these<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.789> stack

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
so we're going to see how these to stack

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.689 
so we're going to see how these to stack
up<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.539> in<00:00:42.690> pure<00:00:43.140> size<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.949> then<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.670> course

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
up just in pure size and then of course

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.340 
up just in pure size and then of course
we're<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.360> more<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.780> depth<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.140> other

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
we're going to go more in depth in other

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290 
we're going to go more in depth in other
videos<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.489> stack<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.120> together

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
videos on how they stack up all together

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
videos on how they stack up all together
now<00:00:49.190> first<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.399> foremost<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:51.800> terms<00:00:52.800> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
now first and foremost in terms of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
now first and foremost in terms of
height<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.149> width<00:00:54.899> T<00:00:55.859> Tab<00:00:56.160> s<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.760> staggering

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
height and width T Tab s is staggering

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.380 
height and width T Tab s is staggering
over<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.320> tablet<00:00:58.920> now<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.550> knew<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> would<00:01:00.180> be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
over this tablet now we knew it would be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.049 
over this tablet now we knew it would be
obviously<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.079> bigger<00:01:01.469> tablet<00:01:02.190> because<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
obviously a bigger tablet because of the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.230 
obviously a bigger tablet because of the
size<00:01:03.510> difference<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.260> screen<00:01:04.620> 8.4<00:01:05.519> verse<00:01:05.700> 8.9

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
size difference of screen 8.4 verse 8.9

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.130 
size difference of screen 8.4 verse 8.9
but<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.800> huge<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.659> width<00:01:09.900> is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
but this really is huge and the width is

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.310 
but this really is huge and the width is
dramatically<00:01:10.860> more<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:12.450> height<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.960> little

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
dramatically more the height is a little

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.390 
dramatically more the height is a little
bit<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.009> that's<00:01:14.400> understandable<00:01:16.400> also

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
bit more but that's understandable also

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.240 
bit more but that's understandable also
the<00:01:17.700> thickness<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.509> definitely<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the thickness is definitely more on the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
the thickness is definitely more on the
tab<00:01:20.850> s<00:01:22.460> being<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.670> thinner<00:01:24.000> device<00:01:24.420> between

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
tab s being the thinner device between

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.580 
tab s being the thinner device between
these<00:01:25.710> two<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.700> tablets<00:01:27.299> Nexus<00:01:28.049> 9<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
these two the tablets Nexus 9 is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.399 
these two the tablets Nexus 9 is
definitely<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.610> thin<00:01:29.970> tablet<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
definitely not a thin tablet and not a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.710 
definitely not a thin tablet and not a
light<00:01:32.070> tablet<00:01:32.579> either<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.119> definitely<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
light tablet either it's definitely the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.020 
light tablet either it's definitely the
heavier<00:01:34.170> between<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.729> notice

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
heavier between the two and you notice

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.880 
heavier between the two and you notice
that<00:01:36.090> immediately<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:36.780> holding<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.799> in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that immediately when holding it but in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.490 
that immediately when holding it but in
terms<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.250> thinness<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.850> Tab<00:01:39.119> s<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.689> easily

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
terms of thinness the Tab s is easily

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
terms of thinness the Tab s is easily
going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.159> thinner<00:01:41.430> between<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> two

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
going to be the thinner between the two

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.010 
going to be the thinner between the two
tablets<00:01:43.220> now<00:01:44.220> another<00:01:44.670> really<00:01:45.210> important

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
tablets now another really important

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.889 
tablets now another really important
feature<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.250> note<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:48.719> to<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:50.180> is<00:01:51.180> going

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
feature to note is going to be is going

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
feature to note is going to be is going

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
landscape this really isn't ideal simply

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.240 
landscape this really isn't ideal simply
for<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> fact<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.900> everything<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.950> looks

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
for the fact that everything just looks

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.839 
for the fact that everything just looks
a<00:02:23.459> bit<00:02:23.609> off<00:02:24.650> simply<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:25.890> fact<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.250> you

they were meant to be watched and it
makes<00:03:18.569> sense<00:03:18.810> 16<00:03:19.769> by<00:03:19.889> 9<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.519> ratio<00:03:20.669> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
makes sense 16 by 9 is the ratio that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.839 
makes sense 16 by 9 is the ratio that
all<00:03:21.260> tvs<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.650> laptops<00:03:23.129> are<00:03:23.280> done<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.669> why
