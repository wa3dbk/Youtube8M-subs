00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
of the mini Shinkansen system a little

of the mini Shinkansen system a little
different<00:00:56.850> from<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> regular<00:00:57.239> Shinkansen

system but it's going to be replaced by

naming a nice curtains but I have to say

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.630 
naming a nice curtains but I have to say
that<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.720> separated<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.289> c3<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.280> e5

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that as we separated the c3 from the e5

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
that as we separated the c3 from the e5
back<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.270> mean<00:01:18.630> can't<00:01:19.080> help<00:01:19.289> but<00:01:19.470> feel

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
back there I mean can't help but feel

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.279 
back there I mean can't help but feel
like<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.039> saucer<00:01:20.429> section<00:01:20.899> being<00:01:21.899> sent<00:01:22.170> off

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
like the saucer section being sent off

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.669 
like the saucer section being sent off
to<00:01:22.500> safety<00:01:22.740> over<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> northwest<00:01:24.320> well<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
to safety over in the northwest well the

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.550 
to safety over in the northwest well the
5<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.460> bad<00:01:26.490> already

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.010 

now<00:01:31.009> we've<00:01:31.189> just<00:01:31.220> come<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.820> dead<00:01:32.240> stop<00:01:32.270> here

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
now we've just come to a dead stop here

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.330 
now we've just come to a dead stop here
next<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.250> another<00:01:34.520> III<00:01:35.390> kolache

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
next to another III kolache

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.520 
next to another III kolache
this<00:01:37.880> has<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.329> do<00:01:38.479> with<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.780> mini<00:01:39.049> shin<00:01:39.409> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
this has to do with the mini shin and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.459 
this has to do with the mini shin and
sin<00:01:40.100> aspect<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:41.539> I<00:01:41.600> had<00:01:41.750> mentioned<00:01:41.960> earlier

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
sin aspect that I had mentioned earlier

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.020 
sin aspect that I had mentioned earlier
so<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.100> should<00:01:43.250> probably<00:01:43.280> start<00:01:43.729> with<00:01:43.909> just

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
so I should probably start with just

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.899 
so I should probably start with just
what<00:01:44.299> Shinkansen<00:01:44.990> means<00:01:45.490> Japan<00:01:46.490> used<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.789> used

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
what Shinkansen means Japan used to used

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.940 
what Shinkansen means Japan used to used
what's<00:01:47.210> called<00:01:47.299> long<00:01:47.689> narrow<00:01:47.929> gauge<00:01:48.259> railway

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
what's called long narrow gauge railway

the distance between the two rails it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.370 
the distance between the two rails it
was<00:01:52.490> pretty<00:01:52.640> narrow<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.179> when<00:01:53.630> Japan<00:01:53.869> decided

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
was pretty narrow and when Japan decided

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.319 
was pretty narrow and when Japan decided

back<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.750> 60s<00:01:57.170> as<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.009> can<00:01:58.130> see<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.459> the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
back in the 60s as you can see that the

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.039 
back in the 60s as you can see that the
two<00:01:58.700> tracks<00:01:58.969> there<00:01:59.209> just<00:01:59.539> merged<00:01:59.750> into<00:01:59.959> one

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
two tracks there just merged into one

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.779 
two tracks there just merged into one
which<00:02:00.770> means<00:02:00.799> only<00:02:01.159> one<00:02:01.340> train<00:02:01.549> you'll<00:02:01.670> be

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
which means only one train you'll be

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.039 
which means only one train you'll be
running<00:02:01.909> at<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.149> time<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:02.479> they<00:02:02.569> have<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.810> time

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
running at a time and they have to time

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.169 
running at a time and they have to time
their<00:02:03.289> passing<00:02:03.859> so<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.880> they<00:02:05.000> can<00:02:05.149> actually

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
their passing so that they can actually

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.090 
their passing so that they can actually
meet<00:02:05.689> each<00:02:05.869> other<00:02:06.079> or<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:06.920> they<00:02:07.009> don't

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
meet each other or so that they don't

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.449 
meet each other or so that they don't
make<00:02:07.280> each<00:02:07.429> other<00:02:07.579> head<00:02:07.789> on<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.979> for<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:10.310> we

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
make each other head on so for what we

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.039 
make each other head on so for what we

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the old narrow gauge so what they did

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.440 
the old narrow gauge so what they did
with<00:02:24.799> these<00:02:24.980> mini<00:02:25.220> shaitaan<00:02:25.700> sentences<00:02:26.239> in<00:02:26.360> a

with these mini shaitaan sentences in a
few<00:02:26.660> places<00:02:26.829> well<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:27.920> would<00:02:28.040> sort<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.250> make

few places well it would sort of make

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.009 
few places well it would sort of make
sense<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.760> think<00:02:28.790> first<00:02:29.450> because<00:02:29.780> all<00:02:29.930> they

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
sense you think first because all they

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.500 
sense you think first because all they
did<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.200> they<00:02:30.290> ripped<00:02:30.650> up<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:31.010> old<00:02:31.310> track<00:02:31.760> that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
did is they ripped up the old track that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.479 
did is they ripped up the old track that
was<00:02:32.629> only<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.810> meter<00:02:33.079> across<00:02:33.230> or<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:33.950> then

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
was only a meter across or so and then

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.130 
was only a meter across or so and then
they<00:02:34.640> put<00:02:34.849> in<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.060> one<00:02:35.269> point<00:02:35.540> four<00:02:35.810> wide

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
they put in this one point four wide

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.979 
they put in this one point four wide
meter<00:02:36.470> track<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.519> has<00:02:37.940> become<00:02:38.299> venetian

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
meter track and that has become venetian

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.900 
meter track and that has become venetian
nonsense<00:02:39.470> however<00:02:40.220> when<00:02:40.430> you're<00:02:40.579> doing<00:02:40.790> that

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
nonsense however when you're doing that

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.220 
nonsense however when you're doing that
there's<00:02:41.120> things<00:02:41.329> like<00:02:41.420> loading<00:02:41.720> gauge<00:02:42.019> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
there's things like loading gauge and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.569 
there's things like loading gauge and
stuff<00:02:42.440> like<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.739> basically<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.519> just

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
stuff like that and basically it's just

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.699 
stuff like that and basically it's just
talking<00:02:43.970> about<00:02:44.180> how<00:02:44.660> tall<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.079> drink<00:02:45.290> me<00:02:45.530> how

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
talking about how tall the drink me how

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.080 
talking about how tall the drink me how
wide<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.100> can<00:02:46.220> be<00:02:46.310> how<00:02:46.459> close<00:02:46.730> they<00:02:46.910> pass

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
wide it can be how close they pass

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.000 
wide it can be how close they pass
together<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.690> basically<00:02:48.530> there<00:02:48.769> were<00:02:48.859> too

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
together and basically there were too

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.920 
together and basically there were too
many<00:02:49.130> problems<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.540> because<00:02:50.900> of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
many problems with that so because of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.289 
many problems with that so because of
that<00:02:51.109> these<00:02:51.799> trains<00:02:52.130> here<00:02:52.609> they're<00:02:52.970> not<00:02:53.180> going

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
that these trains here they're not going

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.580 
that these trains here they're not going
to<00:02:53.389> be<00:02:53.480> running<00:02:53.660> very<00:02:53.900> fast<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.349> think<00:02:54.500> they've

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
to be running very fast I think they've

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.589 
to be running very fast I think they've
only<00:02:54.739> got<00:02:54.889> a<00:02:54.920> max<00:02:55.160> be<00:02:55.489> just<00:02:55.880> above<00:02:56.090> 100<00:02:56.450> maybe

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
only got a max be just above 100 maybe

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.650 
only got a max be just above 100 maybe
