Velde<00:05:58.630> is<00:05:58.780> excellent<00:05:59.380> in<00:05:59.470> the<00:05:59.530> main<00:05:59.710> deck<00:05:59.890> to

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
Velde is excellent in the main deck to

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.150 
Velde is excellent in the main deck to
dig<00:06:00.250> for<00:06:00.550> answers<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.300> two<00:06:01.450> more<00:06:01.630> tributes

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.520 
dig for answers and two more tributes
yes<00:06:03.160> it<00:06:03.430> conflicts<00:06:03.910> with<00:06:03.910> reborn<00:06:04.630> but<00:06:04.930> you<00:06:05.350> can

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
yes it conflicts with reborn but you can

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.460 
yes it conflicts with reborn but you can
just<00:06:05.560> play<00:06:05.890> around<00:06:06.040> it<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:07.330> in<00:06:07.900> most<00:06:08.140> of<00:06:08.380> the

a check Trust is yet to good I'm really
happy<00:06:34.139> that<00:06:34.260> I<00:06:34.410> mean<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:35.419> failure<00:06:36.419> in<00:06:36.570> the<00:06:36.630> main

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
happy that I mean to failure in the main

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.719 
happy that I mean to failure in the main
that<00:06:36.990> was<00:06:37.169> a<00:06:37.440> decent<00:06:38.100> pic<00:06:38.280> it's<00:06:38.490> dead

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
that was a decent pic it's dead

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.490 
that was a decent pic it's dead
essentially<00:06:39.449> it's<00:06:39.570> a<00:06:39.660> minus<00:06:40.020> one<00:06:40.260> but

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
essentially it's a minus one but

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.650 
essentially it's a minus one but
stopping<00:06:40.830> a<00:06:40.979> Lumina<00:06:41.340> or<00:06:41.610> a<00:06:41.910> gear<00:06:42.210> get<00:06:42.389> armor

stopping a Lumina or a gear get armor
was<00:06:42.840> more<00:06:43.080> important<00:06:43.680> for<00:06:43.740> me<00:06:43.889> more<00:06:44.880> important

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
was more important for me more important

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.270 
was more important for me more important

like seeing a saitek and then yeah that
was<00:06:49.410> also<00:06:49.560> an<00:06:50.190> excellent<00:06:50.760> choice<00:06:51.530> as<00:06:52.530> for<00:06:52.710> the

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
was also an excellent choice as for the

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.610 
was also an excellent choice as for the
rest<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:53.610> sole<00:06:53.910> charge<00:06:53.940> I<00:06:54.510> never<00:06:55.080> activated

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620

rest the sole charge I never activated
it<00:06:55.860> but<00:06:56.039> it<00:06:56.280> stays<00:06:56.520> in<00:06:56.550> the<00:06:56.729> main<00:06:56.850> deck<00:06:57.000> because

it but it stays in the main deck because
of<00:06:57.419> all<00:06:57.630> the<00:06:57.870> tricks<00:06:58.320> you<00:06:58.440> can<00:06:58.470> do<00:06:58.710> because<00:06:59.100> you

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
of all the tricks you can do because you

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.090 
of all the tricks you can do because you
have<00:06:59.460> for<00:06:59.669> example<00:06:59.870> reborn<00:07:00.870> swap<00:07:01.350> and<00:07:01.620> mega

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
have for example reborn swap and mega

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.890 
have for example reborn swap and mega
movies<00:07:02.430> so<00:07:02.699> bounce<00:07:03.030> back<00:07:03.270> your<00:07:03.419> mega<00:07:03.600> movies

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
movies so bounce back your mega movies

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.340 
movies so bounce back your mega movies
to<00:07:03.990> the<00:07:04.080> hands<00:07:04.320> activate<00:07:05.190> your<00:07:05.310> swap<00:07:05.610> frog<00:07:05.910> and

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
to the hands activate your swap frog and

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.500 
to the hands activate your swap frog and
then<00:07:07.350> put<00:07:08.000> Mobile's<00:07:09.000> back<00:07:09.120> to<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.300> field<00:07:09.449> for

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
then put Mobile's back to the field for

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.260 
then put Mobile's back to the field for
example<00:07:09.990> or<00:07:10.110> reborn<00:07:10.470> two<00:07:11.310> monarchs<00:07:11.550> exceed

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.710 
example or reborn two monarchs exceed
and<00:07:12.510> so<00:07:12.660> on<00:07:12.810> so<00:07:13.470> it's<00:07:13.620> perfect<00:07:14.010> at<00:07:14.100> one<00:07:14.570> the<00:07:15.570> one

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720
