prior<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.219> normally<00:00:32.219> just

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
prior to you like but I normally just

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
use no no flash just because it's the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.360 
use no no flash just because it's the
easiest<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> simplest<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.719> that

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
easiest and simplest to do in that

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
kind of I'm zoomed in about 75% right
here<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:53.220> gonna<00:01:53.430> focus<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> cow<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> look

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
here I'm gonna focus on the cow and look

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
here I'm gonna focus on the cow and look
at<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> background<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> background<00:01:55.430> just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
at the background the background just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.600 
at the background the background just
looks<00:01:56.640> great<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.270> photo<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:58.579> take<00:01:59.579> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610

photo for you real cat take a photo for
you<00:02:01.950> guys

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.670 

and<00:02:08.220> yeah<00:02:08.460> now<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:10.080> should<00:02:10.260> be<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.470> photo

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
and yeah now this should be the photo

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.470 
and yeah now this should be the photo
right<00:02:10.860> there<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.090> were<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.240> leave

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
right there and if we were to leave

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.420 
right there and if we were to leave
completely<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.710> were<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.190> move

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
completely out and we were to just move

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.700 
completely out and we were to just move
in<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> cow<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:16.020> bokeh<00:02:16.380> wouldn't<00:02:16.650> be

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
in on the cow but the bokeh wouldn't be

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.790 
in on the cow but the bokeh wouldn't be
as<00:02:16.860> good<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.460> it's<00:02:17.580> hard<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.820> focus<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.330> it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
as good and it's hard to focus on it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.110 
as good and it's hard to focus on it
it's<00:02:19.800> really<00:02:20.100> hard<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.430> focus<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
it's really hard to focus on you have to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.370 
it's really hard to focus on you have to
probably<00:02:21.330> move<00:02:21.420> back<00:02:21.630> here<00:02:21.870> that's<00:02:21.990> as<00:02:22.170> close

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
probably move back here that's as close

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.170 
probably move back here that's as close
to<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.800> focus<00:02:23.160> that's<00:02:23.760> why<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.030> better

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
to the can focus that's why it's better

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270 
to the can focus that's why it's better
to<00:02:24.360> zoom<00:02:24.570> in<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.960> do<00:02:25.050> bokeh<00:02:25.290> because<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
to zoom in and do bokeh because the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.560 
to zoom in and do bokeh because the
background<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.730> more<00:02:26.850> blurrier<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
background is more blurrier and the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.500 
background is more blurrier and the
aperture<00:02:27.900> causes<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:29.700> gives<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.180> certain

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
aperture causes it gives you a certain

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.380 
aperture causes it gives you a certain
amount<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.750> focal<00:02:31.170> face<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.970> also<00:02:33.120> want

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
amount of focal face and you also want

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.260 
amount of focal face and you also want
to<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.510> really<00:02:33.810> careful<00:02:34.020> with<00:02:34.320> your<00:02:34.440> focusing

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
to be really careful with your focusing

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.850 
to be really careful with your focusing
to<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.480> right<00:02:36.810> now<00:02:36.960> its<00:02:37.110> focus<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.500> his<00:02:37.650> head

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
to see right now its focus on his head

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.800 
to see right now its focus on his head
but<00:02:38.040> its<00:02:38.160> body<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.550> really<00:02:38.850> out<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:38.970> focus<00:02:39.240> but

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
but its body is really out of focus but

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.240 
but its body is really out of focus but
that's<00:02:39.990> basically<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.620> main<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:42.030> main

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
that's basically the main the main

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.530 
that's basically the main the main

I'm going to show you how this is going

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.470 
I'm going to show you how this is going
to<00:03:07.350> fit<00:03:07.500> into<00:03:07.620> component<00:03:08.780> zoom<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.050> that

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
to fit into component zoom in on that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.420 
to fit into component zoom in on that
and<00:03:12.480> I'm<00:03:13.470> going<00:03:13.650> what<00:03:13.800> I'm<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.160> do<00:03:14.280> with

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and I'm going what I'm going to do with

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.790 
and I'm going what I'm going to do with
this<00:03:14.580> light<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.780> I'm<00:03:15.870> gonna<00:03:16.020> point<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.560> off

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
this light is and I'm gonna point it off

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.210 
this light is and I'm gonna point it off
I'm<00:03:17.790> gonna<00:03:17.910> point<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.330> off<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.780> table<00:03:19.230> it

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I'm gonna point it off the table it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.100 
I'm gonna point it off the table it
gives<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.640> kind<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> little<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:22.019> don't

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
gives it kind of like a little you don't

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.810 
gives it kind of like a little you don't
want<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.350> like<00:03:22.470> point<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.890> exactly<00:03:23.310> at<00:03:23.519> that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
want to like point it exactly at that

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.370 
want to like point it exactly at that
then<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.209> just<00:03:24.360> makes<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.660> look<00:03:24.810> bad<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.200> wanna

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
then it just makes it look bad you wanna

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.140 
then it just makes it look bad you wanna
you<00:03:25.980> want<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> kind<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.400> give<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.700> soft

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
you want to kind of give it that soft

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.440 
you want to kind of give it that soft
look<00:03:28.070> let's<00:03:29.070> see<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.519> I'm<00:03:29.730> lucky<00:03:30.390> because

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
look let's see like I'm lucky because

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.759 
look let's see like I'm lucky because
I'm<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.840> table<00:03:31.110> right<00:03:31.290> now<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.709> could

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
I'm on the table right now and I could

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.830 
I'm on the table right now and I could
just<00:03:32.070> kind<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.730> balance<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.239> off<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.630> table

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
just kind of balance it off the table

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.380 
just kind of balance it off the table
and<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:35.250> gives<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.519> kind<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.820> soft<00:03:36.180> look

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and it gives you kind of that soft look

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.160

could<00:03:44.550> go<00:03:44.670> high-low<00:03:46.100> see<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.310> big<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
could go high-low see that big and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.420 
could go high-low see that big and
making<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.420> makes<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.750> big<00:03:48.959> difference<00:03:49.430> what

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430
