00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 when alcohol enters the blood and 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.599
 red blood cells clump together 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.519
 blood clots 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.980
 which tightly clog the micro 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.640
 capillaries capillaries swell and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 burst 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.529
 at the use of 100 grams of vodka 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.220
 forever and irrevocably perish a few 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 thousands of brain cells at every feast 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.240
 tens of thousands of dead brain cells 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.240
 excreted in the urine the next day 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:58.359
 take care when alcohol with blood 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 enters the heart it destroys the cells 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.719
 your heart muscles appear 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.539
 microtubules 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.649
 muscle loses elasticity working on 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.810
 limit of possibilities 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.860
 and choke with blood not having time and and 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.020
 pushing the heart is covered with fatty 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.679
 with a cloth, therefore, in a drinking person, she 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.509
 is always 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.970
 enlarged in arteries and capillaries 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.280
 blood clots are formed that overlap 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.490
 access of oxygen and nutrients to 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.840
 cardiac muscle tissue 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.920
 takes away it's called heart attack 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 Take care of yourself 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.120
 alcohol aggressively destroys the defensive 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.960
 layer 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.510
 shell of the gastrointestinal tract 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.420
 microflora is destroyed 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.800
 blood circulation is disturbed throughout 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.130
 intestinal mucosa are formed 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.090
 numerous erosion 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.150
 they are reborn into ulcers and afterwards 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.150
 malignant tumors 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:30.750
 take care of yourself under the influence of alcohol 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.830
 red blood cell cells quickly stick together 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.070
 the splices formed are spread along 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.900
 clogging capillaries all over the body 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.970
 the body is dehydrated decomposition products 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.620
 alcohol poisoning without exception 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.600
 organs and infect all systems of your 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.730
 organism in the home such a state 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.500
 called hangover voluntarily and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.180
 disabling the mechanism of degradation and 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.450
 take care of the rapid aging of man 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.450
 myself 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.020
 when alcohol with blood gets into your 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.950
 pancreas 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.230
 it causes a spasm of its ducts Well 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.740
 gland enzymes accumulate 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.740
 digest the gland from the inside 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.300
 pancreas swells 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.040
 inflammation begins then rotting in 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.840
 the end result is painful 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:35.360
 deadly disease 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.360
 pancreatitis at pancreatonecrosis take care of yourself 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.310
 alcohol inevitably causes varicose 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.340
 veins esophageal veins gradually 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.280
 deform and weaken at any moment 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.080
 they may burst in this case 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.629
 unexpected occurs intense 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.090
 internal bleeding blood fast 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.370
 accumulates in the stomach develops 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.560
 hemorrhagic shock that requires 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.560
 immediate resuscitation 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.269
 Take care of yourself 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.919
 getting into the stomach 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.490
 alcohol actively stimulates the production 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.590
 enzymes enzymes along with alcohol 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.220
 aggressively destroy the mucosa and walls 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.840
 stomach 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.080
 as a result, the stomach digests itself 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.770
 yourself on the digestive process turns 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.770
 in the process of rotting 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.430
 effects of gastritis and ulcer 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.430
 stomach cancer 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.200
 Take care of yourself 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.090
 any doses of alcohol the most devastating 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.740
 acts on the liver which 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.590
 takes first strike 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.360
 alcohol poison liver cells die 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.090
 and are replaced by fat and connective 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.300
 tissues 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.340
 begins fatty liver 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:38.830
 hepatosis comes after him 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:38.830
 cirrhosis followed by cancer take care of yourself
