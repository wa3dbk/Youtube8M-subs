00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
background you can click into it you can
leave<00:00:59.940> it<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.079> minimize<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.739> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
leave it there or you can minimize it I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.590 
leave it there or you can minimize it I
like<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> minimize<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.059> clicking<00:01:03.300> the

like to minimize it by clicking the
little<00:01:03.750> yellow<00:01:04.100> minus<00:01:05.100> sign<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.909> careful<00:01:06.270> not

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
little yellow minus sign be careful not

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.109 
little yellow minus sign be careful not
to<00:01:06.720> close<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.979> minimize<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> puts

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.969 
it down here in the dock so now I can
see<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:13.049> bit<00:01:13.229> better<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.799> working

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
see a little bit better what I'm working

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.429 
see a little bit better what I'm working
with<00:01:14.270> now<00:01:15.270> interface<00:01:15.720> builder<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.229> these

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
with now interface builder has these

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
with now interface builder has these
four<00:01:16.740> windows<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> be

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
four windows we're not going to be

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.990 
four windows we're not going to be
working<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.229> first<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.860> only<00:01:20.790> with
