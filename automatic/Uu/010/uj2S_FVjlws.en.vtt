00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 what happens teachers and 16 have returned their 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.379
 videos I will tell you why there were not any 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.820
 videos and I come with a one boxing one 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.560
 little thing that now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.920
 workers a forest 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.190
 and well let's see what this 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.190
 small box 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.520
 and open the channel 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.119
 And come back 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.440
 congratulations to us 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:47.469
 son of a bitch the Chinese have dust 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.650
 good kids, I've got a 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.310
 mouse and a keyboard 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.660
 with blue lights that is pretty good 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.310
 apparently not likely is 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.310
 pretty good the keyboard has 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 wrong 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.920
 let's get this out 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.830
 it's outside 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.830
 in the cable up here 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.270
 Well here is the keyboard already 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.270
 you will see plugged in and the mouse 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 and the mouse is here is quite comfortable 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.659
 has some very rare keys here 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.000
 but he's pretty good at kids 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.830
 you have already plugged it in and to open how 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 remains 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.510
 Well guys, I would have noticed a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.080
 change of this sound that is sounding 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.120
 as a background sound there is a cpu that 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.360
 it's quite old enough already 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.750
 and nothing I have already plugged in the mouse and the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.140
 keyboard and the mouse would stay like this 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.760
 more or less it's pretty good 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.069
 gameplay has two lights here 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.900
 forward it 's pretty good 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.850
 and the keyboard would look like this in a way 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.270
 and the other would be by applying this button 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.730
 and it lights up is pretty cool for 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.220
 to play 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.459
 at night and I saw it is pretty cool 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.459
 all 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.690
 As you can see it's another desk I've 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.069
 changed also from home I do not want no 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.209
 I want to focus more because I do not want 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.380
 advance things and so it would be for 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.100
 light 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.340
 ok and so at night I would be alone 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.220
 with the screen it would light up like this 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.040
 pretty good to escape taltal would be 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.640
 pretty good as you can see it has 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.310
 lights on edge to all the all the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.920
 keys does not have lights individually the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.080
 edge is addressing all the keys 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.990
 and nothing will we turn off the screen to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.300
 see how everything would look off 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.240
 the screen we paid if it would be 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.740
 that way everything wanted it that way would be there 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.290
 with blue light and there 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.110
 has all the normal controls has 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.570
 to additional tecos like that to stop 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.270
 to advance the video or if it focuses 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.550
 this shit to overtake the video and 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.550
 all those little things and then have other 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.250
 two here typical to go up and down the 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.680
 volume I hope you liked the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.240
 keyboard and mouse devastator of cms 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.130
 storm and nothing to explain in another video 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.990
 because he has not uploaded videos in two months 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.360
 it's something complex and it's that I change 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.980
 house and I have a room for me to 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.570
 make life on the computer and do my 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.340
 little corner of games and another to sleep 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.070
 and here the little corner of the game, I'm going to 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.320
 Great ribs and do good , and 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.270
 you will see it little by little and nothing 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.420
 I hope you liked it until others 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.420
 Boys
