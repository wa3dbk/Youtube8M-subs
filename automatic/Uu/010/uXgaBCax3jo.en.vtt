kind of hard to do it we had to stop
doing<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:27.199> three<00:00:28.199> days<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.189> did<00:00:29.369> lose

a<00:00:29.640> lot<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> weight<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:30.720> soon<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
a lot of weight but then soon as I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
a lot of weight but then soon as I
started<00:00:31.470> putting<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.930> meat<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.920> think

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
started putting in like meat and I think

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.830 
started putting in like meat and I think
pretty<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.550> bread<00:00:36.000> bread<00:00:36.239> does<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.750> you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
pretty much bread bread does it for you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.799 
pretty much bread bread does it for you
I<00:00:37.879> went<00:00:38.879> back<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:40.969> 145<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.480> pretty

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I went back up to 145 and that's pretty

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
I went back up to 145 and that's pretty
much<00:00:42.930> where<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> stand<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.789> still

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
much where I stand right now I'm still

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.220 
much where I stand right now I'm still
there<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.980> haven't<00:00:46.980> gained<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.640> haven't<00:00:48.360> lost<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
there I haven't gained I haven't lost so

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.830 
there I haven't gained I haven't lost so
i'm<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.530> sure<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> hit<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.449> like<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> peak

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
i'm pretty sure I hit like a like a peak

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.420 
i'm pretty sure I hit like a like a peak
thing<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.090> I'm<00:00:54.090> cranking<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.170> more

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
thing here so I'm cranking in more

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.840 
thing here so I'm cranking in more
exercising<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.640> watching<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
exercising and watching what I do so I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.420 
exercising and watching what I do so I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
can lose that weight again because my

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.509 
can lose that weight again because my

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.500 
what's for dinner but I know we have
shrimp<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.650> my<00:03:34.890> SmartWater<00:03:35.700> I'm

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
shrimp and this is my SmartWater I'm

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.479 
shrimp and this is my SmartWater I'm
wondering<00:03:36.900> why<00:03:37.050> it's<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.500> color<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.010> because

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
wondering why it's that color is because

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.259 
wondering why it's that color is because
up<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.510> half<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.110> half<00:03:40.260> feisty<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.269> this

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
up this half and half feisty in this

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.170 
up this half and half feisty in this
packet<00:03:42.750> there's<00:03:42.959> only<00:03:43.200> five<00:03:43.769> calories<00:03:44.459> per

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
packet there's only five calories per

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.090 
packet there's only five calories per
serving<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.750> there's<00:03:46.050> two<00:03:46.200> servings<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.860> here

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
serving and there's two servings in here

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.680 
serving and there's two servings in here
so<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:48.330> makes<00:03:48.769> ten<00:03:49.769> calories<00:03:50.570> simple<00:03:51.570> math

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
so that makes ten calories simple math

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.770 
so that makes ten calories simple math
yes<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.380> know

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
yes I know

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.000 
yes I know
but<00:03:53.380> that's<00:03:53.560> 10<00:03:53.830> calories<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:55.020> this<00:03:56.020> big<00:03:56.319> model

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
but that's 10 calories in this big model

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.650 
but that's 10 calories in this big model
