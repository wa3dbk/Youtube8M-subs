00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.900 
so now I'm just going to do some
diagonal<00:01:01.780> lines<00:01:02.230> across<00:01:02.770> this<00:01:03.040> direction<00:01:03.579> and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
diagonal lines across this direction and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.880 
diagonal lines across this direction and
then<00:01:04.089> reduce<00:01:04.269> him<00:01:04.390> across<00:01:04.690> here<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.170> in<00:01:05.740> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
then reduce him across here and in the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.050 
then reduce him across here and in the
the<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:08.100> cross<00:01:09.100> section<00:01:09.580> that's<00:01:09.970> where

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
the like the cross section that's where

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.859 
the like the cross section that's where
I'll<00:01:10.180> stick<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.479> clove

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.139 

now<00:01:17.590> I'll<00:01:17.710> put<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:17.950> whole<00:01:18.219> cloves<00:01:18.579> in<00:01:18.909> and

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
now I'll put the whole cloves in and

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.209 
now I'll put the whole cloves in and
this<00:01:19.899> will<00:01:20.079> just<00:01:20.320> give<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:20.500> ham<00:01:20.829> a<00:01:20.859> nice

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
this will just give the ham a nice

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.060 
this will just give the ham a nice
flavor<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.359> also<00:01:22.539> good<00:01:22.840> for<00:01:23.070> decoration

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
flavor and it's also good for decoration

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.690 
flavor and it's also good for decoration

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
a glace in the glaze there is about 500

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.359 
a glace in the glaze there is about 500
to<00:01:41.429> 750<00:01:42.429> grams<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.630> my<00:01:44.409> just<00:01:44.890> breakfast

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369

to 750 grams of my just breakfast
marmalade<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.119> then<00:01:46.689> once<00:01:46.959> that's<00:01:47.170> boiled

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
marmalade and then once that's boiled

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.100 
marmalade and then once that's boiled
for<00:01:47.859> about<00:01:48.069> four<00:01:48.429> minutes<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.090> it's<00:01:49.509> melted

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
for about four minutes and it's melted

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.169 
for about four minutes and it's melted
and<00:01:50.349> it's<00:01:50.500> just<00:01:50.739> starting<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.280> bubble<00:01:51.489> then<00:01:52.149> I

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
and it's just starting to bubble then I

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.800 
and it's just starting to bubble then I
add<00:01:52.709> 1/2<00:01:53.709> a<00:01:53.829> cup<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.250> 3/4<00:01:54.819> of<00:01:54.849> a<00:01:55.000> cup<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.239> Muscat

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
add 1/2 a cup to 3/4 of a cup of Muscat

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:09.960 
add 1/2 a cup to 3/4 of a cup of Muscat
depending<00:01:56.439> on<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> size<00:01:56.829> of<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.039> ham

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.270 

so<00:02:10.750> now<00:02:10.869> we've<00:02:10.990> just<00:02:11.020> got<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.440> marmalade<00:02:11.890> and

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so now we've just got the marmalade and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.370 
so now we've just got the marmalade and
you<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.580> get<00:02:12.730> what<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.990> don't<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.260> to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
you just get what you don't have to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.470 
you just get what you don't have to
continually<00:02:15.010> stir<00:02:15.400> but<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.790> find<00:02:16.030> if<00:02:16.390> you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
continually stir but I find if you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.210 
continually stir but I find if you
continuously<00:02:17.080> stir<00:02:17.530> then<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.830> get<00:02:18.010> rid<00:02:18.160> of

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
continuously stir then you get rid of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.740 
continuously stir then you get rid of
all<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.460> lumps<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.600> over

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
all the lumps and this is just over

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.280 
all the lumps and this is just over
medium<00:02:20.200> heat<00:02:21.120> okay<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.180> now<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.510> marmalade

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
medium heat okay so now the marmalade

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.190 
medium heat okay so now the marmalade
has<00:02:23.530> melted<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.870> lumps<00:02:26.080> are

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
has melted and it's all the lumps are

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.990 
has melted and it's all the lumps are
gone<00:02:26.260> out<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.250> was<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:27.670> about<00:02:27.790> to

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
gone out of it and it was just about to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.120 
gone out of it and it was just about to
boil<00:02:28.240> as<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.080> see<00:02:29.230> around<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.560> rimless<00:02:29.800> a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
boil as you can see around the rimless a

few<00:02:30.370> bubbles<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.210> now<00:02:31.330> I'll<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.480> turn<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.020> off

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
few bubbles so now I'll just turn it off

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.450 
few bubbles so now I'll just turn it off
the<00:02:32.350> heat<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.890> I'll<00:02:33.310> add<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.610> Muscat<00:02:35.010> as<00:02:36.010> I

said<00:02:36.640> before<00:02:36.790> half<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.750> three<00:02:37.960> curves<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.350> a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
said before half to three curves of a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.200 
said before half to three curves of a
cup<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.220> stir<00:02:45.460> this<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> nice

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
cup and you stir this to a nice

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.360 
cup and you stir this to a nice
consistency<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.590> don't<00:02:47.770> want<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:47.980> too<00:02:48.130> runny

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
consistency you don't want it too runny

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.680 
consistency you don't want it too runny
because<00:02:48.640> then<00:02:48.760> it'll<00:02:48.910> just<00:02:49.090> run<00:02:49.240> straight<00:02:49.390> off

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
because then it'll just run straight off

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.010 
because then it'll just run straight off
the<00:02:49.810> head<00:02:51.150> okay<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.210> now<00:02:52.450> I'm<00:02:52.540> just<00:02:52.630> gonna<00:02:52.750> put
