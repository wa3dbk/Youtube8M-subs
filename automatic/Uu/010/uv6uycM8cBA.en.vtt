00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
security advisors to give me a plan that

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.520

reason that I have to ask for a plan

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
reason that I have to ask for a plan
it's<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.750> don't<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it's because I don't think the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.460 
it's because I don't think the
administration<00:01:22.439> has<00:01:23.189> planned<00:01:24.350> planning<00:01:25.350> has

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
administration has planned planning has

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
administration has planned planning has
not<00:01:25.650> turned<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.280> their<00:01:26.430> strong<00:01:26.729> suit

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
not turned out to be their strong suit

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
not turned out to be their strong suit
as<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.689> seen<00:01:27.930> over<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> last<00:01:28.380> seven

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
as we have seen over the last seven

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.850 
as we have seen over the last seven
years<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.540> in<00:01:30.540> fact<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.079> got<00:01:31.229> worried<00:01:31.650> about

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
years and in fact I got worried about

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.859 
years and in fact I got worried about
this<00:01:32.130> last<00:01:32.369> spring<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.119> wrote<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> letter<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
of planning to withdraw because

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
of planning to withdraw because
eventually<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> come<00:01:40.079> home<00:01:40.290> and

eventually we are going to come home and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.260 
eventually we are going to come home and
they<00:01:41.220> said<00:01:41.369> oh<00:01:41.460> we're<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> tell<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
they said oh we're not going to tell you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.760 
they said oh we're not going to tell you
and<00:01:42.329> eventually<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.990> gave<00:01:43.170> us<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> hearing

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and eventually they gave us a hearing

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.080 
and eventually they gave us a hearing
I'm<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> Senate<00:01:44.430> Armed<00:01:44.549> Services

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090

I'm on the Senate Armed Services
Committee<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.500> some<00:01:46.530> information

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
Committee and so we got some information

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
Committee and so we got some information
but<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.610> was<00:01:47.729> totally<00:01:47.970> inadequate<00:01:48.509> because

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
but it was totally inadequate because
