that<00:01:29.350> paradiddle

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.680 

and<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.760> line<00:01:36.910> up<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.090> bass<00:01:37.330> drum<00:01:37.570> I'll

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
and then just line up the bass drum I'll

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:54.900 
and then just line up the bass drum I'll
start<00:01:37.960> on<00:01:38.080> b3<00:01:43.710> whole<00:01:44.710> thing<00:01:45.010> slowly<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:53.910> picked

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
start on b3 whole thing slowly I picked

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.460 
start on b3 whole thing slowly I picked
this<00:01:55.090> pattern<00:01:55.510> because<00:01:55.750> there's<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.990> lot<00:01:56.170> going

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
this pattern because there's a lot going

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.110 
this pattern because there's a lot going
on<00:01:56.560> with<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:57.250> have<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.490> lot<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.670> options<00:01:58.060> to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
on with it you have a lot of options to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.880 
on with it you have a lot of options to
move<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.510> sticks<00:01:58.750> around<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.080> drums<00:01:59.350> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
move the sticks around the drums the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.530 
move the sticks around the drums the
easiest<00:02:00.250> thing<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.520> do<00:02:00.730> is<00:02:00.910> just<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.240> move<00:02:01.480> the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
easiest thing to do is just to move the

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.810 
easiest thing to do is just to move the
left<00:02:01.840> stick<00:02:01.930> maybe<00:02:02.290> onto<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.710> hi-hat<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.310> I'm

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
left stick maybe onto the hi-hat and I'm

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.790 
left stick maybe onto the hi-hat and I'm
gonna<00:02:03.910> do<00:02:04.120> that<00:02:04.300> every<00:02:04.720> on<00:02:05.290> every<00:02:05.440> hi-hat

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
gonna do that every on every hi-hat

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:17.790 
gonna do that every on every hi-hat
stroke<00:02:06.070> that<00:02:06.220> isn't<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.580> two<00:02:06.790> or<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.120> four<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
stroke that isn't a two or a four and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
stroke that isn't a two or a four and
again<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.190> just<00:02:18.250> playing<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.640> left

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
again that's just playing the left

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.880 
again that's just playing the left
stroke<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.300> every<00:02:19.690> snare<00:02:20.290> stroke<00:02:20.500> that's<00:02:20.680> not

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
stroke on every snare stroke that's not

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.190 
stroke on every snare stroke that's not
on<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> two<00:02:21.400> or<00:02:21.610> four<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.300> hi-hat<00:02:22.840> really

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
on the two or four the hi-hat really

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.630 
on the two or four the hi-hat really
doesn't<00:02:23.440> stand<00:02:23.650> out<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.830> lot<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.280> it's<00:02:24.430> more

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
doesn't stand out a lot and it's more

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520 
doesn't stand out a lot and it's more
rhythmic<00:02:25.060> than<00:02:25.270> anything<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.350> throw

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
in the Tom's and a combination it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.580 
in the Tom's and a combination it
creates<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.510> melody<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.320> for<00:02:29.530> this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
creates a little melody so for this

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.350 
creates a little melody so for this
example<00:02:29.800> instead<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.370> using<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.700> hi-hat<00:02:31.150> I'm

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
example instead of using the hi-hat I'm

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.200 
example instead of using the hi-hat I'm
gonna<00:02:31.540> use<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.960> hi<00:02:32.470> Tom<00:02:32.740> with<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.670> exception

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
gonna use the hi Tom with the exception

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.870 
gonna use the hi Tom with the exception
of<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.450> last<00:02:34.750> note<00:02:35.310> instead<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.520> high<00:02:36.640> Tom

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
of the last note instead of the high Tom

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:46.520 
of the last note instead of the high Tom
and<00:02:36.910> play<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.330> middle<00:02:37.510> Tom

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.510 

now<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.650> creates<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.980> little<00:02:48.160> bit<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.400> a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
now that creates a little bit of a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.580

I like to throw in a third on the and of
two<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.860> instead<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.160> hitting<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.550> ride<00:02:54.730> Bell

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
two so instead of hitting the ride Bell

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.460 
two so instead of hitting the ride Bell
with<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.180> right<00:02:55.390> stick<00:02:55.660> I'm<00:02:56.050> just<00:02:56.230> gonna<00:02:56.320> hit

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
with the right stick I'm just gonna hit

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:06.240 
with the right stick I'm just gonna hit
the<00:02:56.560> low<00:02:56.710> Tom<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.440> one<00:03:05.650> more<00:03:05.830> thing<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.040> can

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
the low Tom and one more thing you can

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.980 
the low Tom and one more thing you can
do<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.430> can<00:03:06.700> throw<00:03:06.880> in<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.120> splash<00:03:07.420> cymbal<00:03:07.810> and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
do you can throw in a splash cymbal and

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.650 
do you can throw in a splash cymbal and
that<00:03:08.530> would<00:03:08.650> replace<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.340> second<00:03:10.180> high<00:03:10.330> time

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
that would replace the second high time

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:23.400 
that would replace the second high time
so<00:03:11.260> that's<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.590> e<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:12.040> count<00:03:12.310> three<00:03:22.170> op8<00:03:23.170> bump

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
so that's the e of count three op8 bump

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.960 
so that's the e of count three op8 bump
with<00:03:23.530> his<00:03:23.650> beat<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.100> exploring<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.760> around

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
with his beat and exploring it around

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.580 
with his beat and exploring it around
the<00:03:25.120> drum<00:03:25.360> kit<00:03:25.570> remember<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.080> could<00:03:26.230> take<00:03:26.380> the
