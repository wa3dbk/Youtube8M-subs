00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
adapter which is here you get to with

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.480 
adapter which is here you get to with
that<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.320> used<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.920> stick<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.250> down

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.880 
that so I used one to stick that down
and<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.170> stick<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.650> there
