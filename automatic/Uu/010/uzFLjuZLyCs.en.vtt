00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
forward smash down in there should be an

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:08.039 
forward smash down in there should be an
edge<00:02:57.790> guard<00:02:58.030> yeah<00:02:58.330> it's<00:02:58.599> easy<00:02:58.780> oh<00:03:04.440> oh<00:03:05.440> no<00:03:07.049> yeah

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
edge guard yeah it's easy oh oh no yeah
