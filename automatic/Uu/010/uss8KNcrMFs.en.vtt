well<00:04:57.570> what<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:57.900> do<00:04:58.050> is<00:04:58.320> actually<00:04:58.470> figure<00:04:58.890> it's

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
well what I do is actually figure it's

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.219 
well what I do is actually figure it's
not<00:04:59.430> bodybuilding<00:05:00.120> as<00:05:00.360> such<00:05:00.600> although<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.110> do

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
not bodybuilding as such although I do

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.960 
not bodybuilding as such although I do
go<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.740> gym<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.070> I<00:05:02.130> lift<00:05:02.340> weight<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.910> I

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
go to the gym and I lift weight so I

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.969 
go to the gym and I lift weight so I
guess<00:05:03.150> that's<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.510> form<00:05:03.720> of<00:05:03.810> bodybuilding<00:05:04.440> but

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
guess that's a form of bodybuilding but

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.630 
guess that's a form of bodybuilding but
um<00:05:05.190> women<00:05:05.790> can't<00:05:06.090> look<00:05:06.240> like<00:05:06.300> men<00:05:07.020> so

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
um women can't look like men so

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.920 
um women can't look like men so
naturally<00:05:08.640> if<00:05:08.729> you<00:05:08.850> train<00:05:09.120> as<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.330> woman<00:05:09.750> you

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
naturally if you train as a woman you

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.980 
naturally if you train as a woman you
can<00:05:10.080> only<00:05:10.229> get<00:05:10.410> so<00:05:10.680> big<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.510> result<00:05:12.840> I
