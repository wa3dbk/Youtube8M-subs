bit of this pinky color so it actually

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.839 
bit of this pinky color so it actually
feels<00:03:44.129> really<00:03:44.430> good<00:03:44.909> it<00:03:45.090> turns<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:46.049> eyeshadow

feels really good it turns the eyeshadow
right<00:03:47.849> into<00:03:48.659> like<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.019> bomb<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.889> color<00:03:50.129> is

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
right into like a bomb and the color is

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
let's do this so mine's a very like

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.750 
let's do this so mine's a very like
dramatic<00:04:08.579> purple<00:04:08.909> color<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.200> that

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
dramatic purple color but I like that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.270 
dramatic purple color but I like that
okay<00:04:11.760> not<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.090> dramatic<00:04:12.389> apparently<00:04:13.280> your

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
okay not that dramatic apparently your

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.189 
okay not that dramatic apparently your
application<00:04:15.090> process<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.629> lot<00:04:15.840> neater<00:04:16.079> than

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
application process is a lot neater than

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.659 
application process is a lot neater than
mine<00:04:16.500> because<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.889> don't<00:04:17.039> end<00:04:17.220> up<00:04:17.280> with<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.489> red

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
mine because you don't end up with a red

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.629 
mine because you don't end up with a red
finger<00:04:18.030> that's<00:04:18.449> true<00:04:20.419> okay<00:04:21.419> cool<00:04:22.400> yeah<00:04:23.400> it's

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
finger that's true okay cool yeah it's

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.600 
finger that's true okay cool yeah it's
going<00:04:23.849> on<00:04:24.120> like<00:04:24.389> cheap<00:04:25.169> lip<00:04:25.440> gloss<00:04:25.710> like<00:04:26.130> kind

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
going on like cheap lip gloss like kind

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.930 
going on like cheap lip gloss like kind
of<00:04:26.669> like<00:04:26.820> doesn't<00:04:27.210> have<00:04:27.330> much<00:04:27.539> pigment<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.530> it

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
of like doesn't have much pigment to it

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.980 
of like doesn't have much pigment to it
but<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:29.970> guess<00:04:30.150> that's<00:04:30.300> better<00:04:30.449> because<00:04:30.840> like

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
but I guess that's better because like

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.260 
but I guess that's better because like
then<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.710> can't<00:04:32.010> mess<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.310> up<00:04:32.400> okay<00:04:32.639> seems<00:04:33.150> like

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
then I can't mess it up okay seems like

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.610 
then I can't mess it up okay seems like
when<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.510> mix<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.780> with<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.960> Vaseline<00:04:34.349> in<00:04:34.530> the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
when you mix it with the Vaseline in the

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.680 
when you mix it with the Vaseline in the
container<00:04:34.979> it's<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.490> bit<00:04:35.760> more<00:04:35.970> sheer<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
container it's a bit more sheer the

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.659 
container it's a bit more sheer the
beginning<00:04:37.110> directly<00:04:37.620> on<00:04:37.770> let's<00:04:38.370> make<00:04:38.520> you

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
beginning directly on let's make you

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.150 
beginning directly on let's make you
head<00:04:38.820> for<00:04:39.030> popsicle<00:04:39.690> yeah<00:04:40.139> look<00:04:40.889> at<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.039> guy

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
head for popsicle yeah look at the guy

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.189

who's<00:04:41.310> eating<00:04:41.550> several<00:04:41.760> candy<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.020> takes

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
who's eating several candy it just takes

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.230 
who's eating several candy it just takes
a<00:04:43.289> little<00:04:43.410> more<00:04:43.560> work<00:04:43.620> it's<00:04:44.370> like<00:04:44.460> if<00:04:45.030> you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
a little more work it's like if you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.029 
a little more work it's like if you
really<00:04:45.599> have<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> color<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.560> can't<00:04:46.800> find

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
really have a color that you can't find

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.310 
really have a color that you can't find
as<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.250> lipstick<00:04:47.820> then<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.419> would<00:04:48.720> try<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.050> it

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
as a lipstick then I would try it it

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.230 
as a lipstick then I would try it it
just<00:04:49.470> takes<00:04:49.530> more<00:04:49.830> time<00:04:50.070> because<00:04:50.310> if<00:04:50.669> you're

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
just takes more time because if you're

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.399 
just takes more time because if you're
you're<00:04:51.479> gonna<00:04:51.570> have<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.840> like<00:04:51.990> apply<00:04:52.349> it

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
you're gonna have to like apply it

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.040 
you're gonna have to like apply it
slower<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:53.940> like<00:04:54.090> really<00:04:54.360> mix<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.900> in

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
slower and just like really mix it in

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.080 
slower and just like really mix it in
well<00:04:55.229> so<00:04:55.949> yeah<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.220> think<00:04:56.430> hers<00:04:56.729> turned<00:04:56.909> out

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
well so yeah I think hers turned out

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.710 
well so yeah I think hers turned out
really<00:04:57.419> well

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
really well

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.300 
really well
especially<00:04:58.500> because<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.889> feel<00:04:59.070> like<00:04:59.190> that

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
especially because I feel like that

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.180 
especially because I feel like that
color<00:04:59.550> is<00:04:59.729> such<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.120> good<00:05:00.659> lip<00:05:00.990> color<00:05:01.289> and<00:05:01.440> this

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
color is such a good lip color and this

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.360 
color is such a good lip color and this
is<00:05:02.370> like<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:03.180> is<00:05:03.470> it's<00:05:04.470> okay<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:05.130> think<00:05:05.190> it's

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
is like this is it's okay I think it's

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.980 
is like this is it's okay I think it's
