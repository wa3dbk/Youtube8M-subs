know<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> long-ass<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.210> but<00:00:21.210> yeah<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.570> all

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689

know a long-ass time but yeah in all
honesty<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> actually<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
honesty I actually think this is the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.910 
honesty I actually think this is the
hardest<00:00:23.760> loot<00:00:24.000> video<00:00:24.210> I've<00:00:24.359> ever<00:00:24.449> done<00:00:24.920> in

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
hardest loot video I've ever done in

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.470 
hardest loot video I've ever done in
terms<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.310> difficulty<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> had<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.359> use

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
terms of difficulty I had to use

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.230 
terms of difficulty I had to use
overloads<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.890> were<00:00:28.949> damaging<00:00:29.519> me<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.029> much

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
overloads they were damaging me so much

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.720 
overloads they were damaging me so much
like<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.840> only<00:00:31.590> could<00:00:31.800> stay<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.430> two

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
like I only could stay for like two

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.610 
like I only could stay for like two
kills<00:00:32.969> per<00:00:33.149> trip<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.630> pretty<00:00:33.870> bad<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
kills per trip it was pretty bad you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.470 
kills per trip it was pretty bad you
know<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.399> happens<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.450> are

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
know that's what happens when you are

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.720 
know that's what happens when you are
using<00:00:36.870> ninety<00:00:37.559> level<00:00:37.829> weapons<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
using ninety level weapons but you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.080 
using ninety level weapons but you
aren't<00:00:38.910> using<00:00:39.120> per<00:00:39.420> Nick's<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:40.250> level<00:00:41.250> 90<00:00:41.610> gear

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
aren't using per Nick's or level 90 gear

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930 
aren't using per Nick's or level 90 gear
so<00:00:42.360> oh<00:00:42.600> well<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> could<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.590> done<00:00:43.710> faster<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so oh well I could have done faster if I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
so oh well I could have done faster if I
brought<00:00:45.239> tectonic<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.079> seismics<00:00:46.500> or

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
brought tectonic and seismics or

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.920 
brought tectonic and seismics or
whatever<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> made<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> through<00:00:48.239> but

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
whatever but I made it through but

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
whatever but I made it through but
either<00:00:49.079> way<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:50.100> actually<00:00:50.550> only<00:00:50.730> took

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
either way this actually only took

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.709 
either way this actually only took
around<00:00:51.030> an<00:00:51.360> hour

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
around an hour

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.389 
around an hour
I'd<00:00:51.960> say<00:00:52.230> only<00:00:52.530> about<00:00:52.680> an<00:00:52.800> hour<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.190> really

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
I'd say only about an hour it's really

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.939 
I'd say only about an hour it's really
fast<00:00:53.610> kills<00:00:53.879> especially<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.440> longest

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
fast kills especially really the longest

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.680 
fast kills especially really the longest
time<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.520> spend<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> picking<00:00:57.600> up

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
time that you spend here is picking up

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
time that you spend here is picking up
the<00:00:57.809> drops<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.469> kill<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.100> hit

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the drops like you kill them in one hit

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
the drops like you kill them in one hit
obviously<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:00.930> why<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> use

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
obviously I really don't know why I use

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
obviously I really don't know why I use
dissensions<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.250> could<00:01:02.430> easily<00:01:02.609> kill<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.059> one

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
dissensions I could easily kill them one

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.240 
dissensions I could easily kill them one
hit<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.930> any<00:01:04.110> other<00:01:04.379> weapon<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
hit with like any other weapon but I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
hit with like any other weapon but I
really<00:01:05.939> didn't<00:01:06.150> want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.600> another

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
really didn't want to go by another

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.050 
really didn't want to go by another
weapon<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> guess<00:01:07.920> good<00:01:08.280> fight<00:01:08.490> charge<00:01:08.790> on

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
weapon so I guess good fight charge on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.420 
weapon so I guess good fight charge on
intentions<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.080> oh<00:01:10.260> well<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.950> yeah<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.369> said

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
intentions but oh well so yeah as I said

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.280 
intentions but oh well so yeah as I said

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.280 
seconds but yeah so really considering
its<00:01:36.000> goblins<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:36.840> nothing<00:01:37.170> else

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
its goblins there's really nothing else

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.160 
its goblins there's really nothing else
you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:37.979> talk<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.299> about<00:01:39.299> them<00:01:39.540> but

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you can really talk about about them but

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.530 
you can really talk about about them but
I<00:01:40.650> did<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.159> them<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.490> lumbridge<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> house

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I did do them in lumbridge at the house

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.139 
I did do them in lumbridge at the house
like<00:01:42.930> north<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.740> river<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.430> guess<00:01:44.640> are

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
like north of the river I guess are

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.510 
like north of the river I guess are
actually<00:01:45.479> east<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> river<00:01:46.530> sorry<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually east of the river sorry the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
actually east of the river sorry the
banking<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.329> easy<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.990> used<00:01:49.259> my

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
banking was pretty easy I just used my

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.569 
banking was pretty easy I just used my
yak<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.250> storing<00:01:50.729> some<00:01:50.909> stuff<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.570> i

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
yak for storing some stuff and then i

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.609 
yak for storing some stuff and then i
teleported<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.270> fight<00:01:54.780> kiln<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.320> banked

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
teleported to the fight kiln and banked

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.050 
teleported to the fight kiln and banked
there<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.130> came<00:01:56.310> back<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> was

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
there and then came back so it was

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.490 
there and then came back so it was
really<00:01:57.210> easy<00:01:57.390> took<00:01:57.719> about<00:01:57.899> an<00:01:57.990> hour<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
really easy took about an hour for a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
really easy took about an hour for a
thousand<00:01:58.799> kills<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.610> yeah<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.030> guess<00:02:00.689> there's

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
thousand kills so yeah I guess there's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.209 
thousand kills so yeah I guess there's
really<00:02:01.049> nothing<00:02:01.380> else<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.710> say<00:02:01.860> about<00:02:01.979> them

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
really nothing else I can say about them

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.340

of the kills I got 50 golds which is a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.830 
of the kills I got 50 golds which is a
lot<00:02:13.500> more<00:02:13.650> than

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
lot more than

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.570 
lot more than
I<00:02:13.870> thought<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.110> would<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.560> thought<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.220> charms

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
I thought I would I thought the charms

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.220 
I thought I would I thought the charms
here<00:02:15.760> we're<00:02:15.910> like<00:02:16.120> absolutely<00:02:16.629> nothing<00:02:16.870> but

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
here we're like absolutely nothing but

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.410 
here we're like absolutely nothing but
uh<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.620> guess<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.129> do<00:02:18.250> get<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.489> few<00:02:18.879> golds<00:02:19.239> but

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
uh I guess you do get a few golds but

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.350 
uh I guess you do get a few golds but
even<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:19.989> that's<00:02:20.110> only<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.500> 5%<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:22.090> it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
even then that's only like 5% so it's it

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.300 
even then that's only like 5% so it's it
is<00:02:22.480> pretty<00:02:22.750> terrible<00:02:23.080> for<00:02:23.200> charms<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.800> guess

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
is pretty terrible for charms I guess

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.710 
is pretty terrible for charms I guess

the<00:02:42.310> bones<00:02:42.549> yeah<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.660> really<00:02:43.900> really

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
the bones yeah it's just really really

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.410 
the bones yeah it's just really really
bad<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:44.799> I'm<00:02:45.310> gonna<00:02:45.400> price<00:02:45.670> check<00:02:45.910> quick<00:02:46.180> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
bad so I'm gonna price check quick and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.059 
bad so I'm gonna price check quick and
we'll<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.810> how<00:02:46.900> much<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.140> actually<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.560> I'm

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
we'll see how much it actually is I'm

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.069 
we'll see how much it actually is I'm
not<00:02:48.250> expecting<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.760> much<00:02:48.940> alright<00:02:49.900> that

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
not expecting that much alright that

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.479 
not expecting that much alright that
actually<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.530> more<00:02:50.709> than<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:50.980> thought<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.400> would

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
actually is more than I thought it would

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.080 
actually is more than I thought it would
be<00:02:51.610> 434<00:02:52.510> K<00:02:53.130> most<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.280> its<00:02:54.400> obviously<00:02:54.790> from<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
be 434 K most of its obviously from the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.059 
be 434 K most of its obviously from the
bones<00:02:55.329> but<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.140> know<00:02:56.290> get<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> 100<00:02:56.920> K<00:02:57.010> from

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
bones but you you know get a 100 K from

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.819 
bones but you you know get a 100 K from
just<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.489> grapes<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.930> guess<00:02:59.620> for

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
just the grapes so I guess for

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.500 
just the grapes so I guess for
free-to-play<00:03:00.040> people<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.910> mean<00:03:01.180> they<00:03:01.329> they

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
free-to-play people I mean they they

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.860 
free-to-play people I mean they they
kill<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.110> lot<00:03:02.290> slower<00:03:02.590> than<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:02.920> do<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.940> I

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
kill it a lot slower than I do but I

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.020 
kill it a lot slower than I do but I
mean<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.440> guess<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.890> could<00:03:06.069> be<00:03:06.160> good<00:03:06.430> training

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
mean I guess it could be good training

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.280 
mean I guess it could be good training
in<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.209> beginning<00:03:07.540> get<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.840> little<00:03:08.110> bit<00:03:08.200> of

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
money but the lumbridge catacombs are

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.569 
money but the lumbridge catacombs are
probably<00:03:10.599> better<00:03:10.780> XP<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.560> money<00:03:11.799> anyways<00:03:12.250> so

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
have been suggesting it so the next loop

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.229 
have been suggesting it so the next loop
video<00:03:47.230> will<00:03:47.889> be<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> real<00:03:48.579> loot<00:03:48.760> video<00:03:49.000> I

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
video will be like a real loot video I

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.670 
video will be like a real loot video I
don't<00:03:49.419> even<00:03:49.540> consider<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:50.079> one<00:03:50.260> like<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.470> real

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
don't even consider this one like a real

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.860 
don't even consider this one like a real
one<00:03:50.919> because<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.940> only<00:03:52.090> took<00:03:52.329> me<00:03:52.450> around<00:03:52.750> an

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
one because that only took me around an

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.720 
one because that only took me around an
hour<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.380> there's<00:03:53.859> really<00:03:54.010> no<00:03:54.220> loot<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.609> be

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
hour and there's really no loot to be

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.059 
hour and there's really no loot to be
had<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.349> hopefully<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.440> next<00:03:56.500> one<00:03:56.829> will<00:03:56.950> be<00:03:56.980> a

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
had so hopefully the next one will be a

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.190 
had so hopefully the next one will be a
lot<00:03:57.220> better<00:03:57.370> than<00:03:57.489> this<00:03:57.669> but<00:03:58.000> either<00:03:58.900> way<00:03:59.169> I

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
lot better than this but either way I

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.940 
lot better than this but either way I
will<00:03:59.530> see<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.799> guys<00:03:59.919> in<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.489> next<00:04:00.609> video
