the the wooden logs are actually

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.449 
the the wooden logs are actually
branches<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.709> tree<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.660> they<00:02:15.660> look<00:02:15.870> quite

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
branches of the tree so they look quite

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:24.320 
branches of the tree so they look quite

but to remove the separate links you

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.460 
but to remove the separate links you
have<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.730> make<00:03:17.909> incisions<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.989> same<00:03:19.200> time

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
have to make incisions at the same time

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.220 
have to make incisions at the same time
to<00:03:19.739> remove<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.220> link<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:22.470> plastic<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.159> is

to remove the link the plastic is is

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.330 
to remove the link the plastic is is
it's<00:03:25.230> fragile

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
it's fragile

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.280 
it's fragile
it's<00:03:26.760> brittle<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.599> know<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:27.840> breaks

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
it's brittle you know it just breaks

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.880 
it's brittle you know it just breaks
breaks<00:03:28.709> apart<00:03:29.099> those<00:03:29.849> pins<00:03:30.209> they<00:03:31.019> just<00:03:31.260> rips

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
breaks apart those pins they just rips

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.819 
breaks apart those pins they just rips
they<00:03:32.549> just<00:03:32.790> dictate<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.480> they<00:03:33.599> just<00:03:33.829> break

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
they just dictate just they just break

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.369 
they just dictate just they just break
away<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.939> easily

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379

think about this particular one there

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.390 
think about this particular one there
was<00:04:12.569> some<00:04:12.780> questions<00:04:13.260> regarding<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:14.040> colours

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
was some questions regarding the colours

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.879 
was some questions regarding the colours
and<00:04:14.669> stuff<00:04:14.819> like<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.540> I've<00:04:16.410> used<00:04:16.650> the

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
and stuff like that and I've used the

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.930 
and stuff like that and I've used the
olive<00:04:17.579> green<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.870> was<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.049> dark<00:04:19.320> base<00:04:19.590> or<00:04:19.949> shadow

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
olive green it was a dark base or shadow

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.750 
olive green it was a dark base or shadow
