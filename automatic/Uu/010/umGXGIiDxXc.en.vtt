all<00:02:38.910> started<00:02:39.360> for<00:02:39.480> us<00:02:39.540> with<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> fun<00:02:40.560> thought

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
all started for us with a fun thought

all started for us with a fun thought
experiment<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.880> got<00:02:42.030> into<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.420> 2009<00:02:43.080> to

experiment that I got into in 2009 to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.710 
experiment that I got into in 2009 to

farming<00:02:57.090> operation<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.750> then<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> did<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.260> at

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
farming operation and then I did that at

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.900 
farming operation and then I did that at
every<00:02:58.500> stage<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> supply<00:02:59.310> chain<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.730> come

every stage of the supply chain to come

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.490 
every stage of the supply chain to come
up<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.420> approximation<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> footprint

up with the approximation of a footprint

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.310 
up with the approximation of a footprint
and<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.010> came<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.370> with<00:03:02.400> about<00:03:03.210> 11<00:03:03.780> pounds<00:03:04.140> of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
and I came up with about 11 pounds of

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.250 
and I came up with about 11 pounds of
co2<00:03:05.160> per<00:03:05.310> pound<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.790> coffee<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.480> floored<00:03:07.140> me

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
co2 per pound of coffee it floored me

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.710 
co2 per pound of coffee it floored me
that<00:03:07.560> actually<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.160> last<00:03:08.490> step<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.300> brewing

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that actually that last step of brewing

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.320 
that actually that last step of brewing
coffee<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.230> more<00:03:10.890> energy<00:03:11.370> intensive<00:03:11.880> than<00:03:12.090> any

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
coffee is more energy intensive than any

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.500 
coffee is more energy intensive than any
other<00:03:12.630> step<00:03:12.960> in<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.170> chain<00:03:14.150> when<00:03:15.150> brewing

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
other step in the chain when brewing

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.920 
other step in the chain when brewing
coffee

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
coffee

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.449 
coffee
you're<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.290> you're<00:03:16.440> heating<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.010> much<00:03:17.190> water

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
you're just you're heating so much water

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.880 
you're just you're heating so much water
for<00:03:18.120> such<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> small<00:03:19.200> amount<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.680> coffee

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
for such a small amount of coffee

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.850 
for such a small amount of coffee
comparatively<00:03:20.640> versus<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:22.020> oversea

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
comparatively versus the oversea

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.740 
comparatively versus the oversea
transportation<00:03:23.520> where<00:03:23.700> you're<00:03:24.209> burning<00:03:24.690> a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
transportation where you're burning a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.770 
transportation where you're burning a
lot<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.900> fuel<00:03:24.990> in<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> container<00:03:25.740> ship<00:03:25.830> but<00:03:26.520> that

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
lot of fuel in a container ship but that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.600 
lot of fuel in a container ship but that
footprint<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:27.900> spread<00:03:28.140> over<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.680> tons<00:03:29.280> and

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
footprint is spread over the tons and

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.880 
footprint is spread over the tons and
tons<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:30.150> cargo<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.620> ship<00:03:31.860> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
tons of cargo that is on that ship and

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.100 
tons of cargo that is on that ship and
so<00:03:32.220> for<00:03:32.520> coffee<00:03:33.000> brewing<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.600> know<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.870> thing

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
so for coffee brewing you know one thing

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.610 
so for coffee brewing you know one thing
that<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:35.070> can<00:03:35.250> do<00:03:35.400> that's<00:03:35.760> pretty<00:03:36.440> simple<00:03:37.440> but

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
that you can do that's pretty simple but

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.100 
that you can do that's pretty simple but
will<00:03:38.100> make<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.400> significant<00:03:39.300> impact<00:03:39.540> if<00:03:39.990> you

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
will make a significant impact if you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.080 
will make a significant impact if you
look<00:03:40.290> at<00:03:40.410> each<00:03:40.560> pound<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.340> coffee<00:03:41.550> separately

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
look at each pound of coffee separately

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.640 
look at each pound of coffee separately
it's<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.840> heat<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.110> correct<00:03:43.380> amount<00:03:43.620> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
it's just to heat the correct amount of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.680 
it's just to heat the correct amount of
water<00:03:43.860> now<00:03:44.310> we<00:03:44.370> know<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:44.940> not<00:03:45.120> actually<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
water now we know it's not actually the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.479 
water now we know it's not actually the
transportation<00:03:46.320> from<00:03:46.440> El<00:03:46.650> Salvador<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.100> here

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
transportation from El Salvador to here

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.030 
transportation from El Salvador to here
it's<00:03:47.730> like<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:48.180> we're<00:03:48.330> doing<00:03:48.630> here<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.380> that

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
it's like what we're doing here and that

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.300 
it's like what we're doing here and that
then<00:03:50.940> motivated<00:03:51.600> me<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.780> push<00:03:52.320> us<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.190> little

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
then motivated me to push us a little

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.340 
then motivated me to push us a little
harder<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.820> start<00:03:54.060> accounting<00:03:54.840> for<00:03:55.080> our

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
harder to start accounting for our

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.009 
harder to start accounting for our
company's<00:03:56.220> carbon<00:03:56.430> footprint<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.000> we<00:03:57.600> do<00:03:57.989> a

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
company's carbon footprint so we do a

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.810 
company's carbon footprint so we do a
greenhouse<00:03:58.440> gas<00:03:58.650> inventory<00:03:59.190> every<00:03:59.459> year<00:03:59.670> and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
greenhouse gas inventory every year and

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.660 
greenhouse gas inventory every year and
then<00:04:00.090> have<00:04:00.360> offset<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.340> we've<00:04:02.340> done<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
then have offset that we've done the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.060 
then have offset that we've done the
same<00:04:02.820> thing<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.300> our<00:04:03.540> training<00:04:04.290> centers<00:04:04.620> small

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
same thing in our training centers small

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.070 
same thing in our training centers small
things<00:04:05.340> like<00:04:05.459> worm<00:04:05.790> composting<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.720> low-flow

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
things like worm composting and low-flow

things like worm composting and low-flow
