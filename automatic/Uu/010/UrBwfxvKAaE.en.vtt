00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.570
 I am Héctor Magallón coordinator of the greenpeace forest campaign and the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.480
 tree day today we are in mourning for our forests which are the 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.230
 victims of the prárbol 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.670
 the pro-tree reforestation program in 2007 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.540
 ask for resides 60% of the resources of this program and we see with concern 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.240
 that you remember training the conafor the national forestry commission 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.520
 more than half of the plants used in their campaigns 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.750
 reforestation are the pallets are magueyes one each time and are plants 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 exotic like him the stick and the lollipop 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.110
 this clearly does not serve to solve the serious crisis of our forests 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.190
 if we also consider that the own pse that also recognized sale 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.910
 that only 10% of the plants used for these cases survive 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.320
 repression we see that the proverb is failing flatly 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.280
 to protect your forests, that's why today we are calling 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.939
 President Felipe Calderón 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.299
 to correct its forest policy to correct the proverb and stop supporting 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.049
 both to reforestation to support 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.760
 the programs that provide sustainable forest management of the communities 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.199
 and ejidos that together have 80 percent more 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.859
 only then will we be able to resolve the crisis in their forests and we will stop 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.959
 then lose visits thousand hectares of forests and forests that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.969
 we lose annually 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.399
 there is more that there are those who treat the capitalinos to demand from the government 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:36.499
 federal 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.069
 that will redesign the structure of the national forest policy and so it will be 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.319
 in more than 50% of the reforestation and commercial forest plantations 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.329
 reforestation is not the solution to deforestation in our country and 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.559
 we want to demand that the federal government support and prioritize forest management 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:59.399
 sustainable in the communities and ejidos freire and of the forests in our country
