00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
my downfall last year was I

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.430

front<00:01:14.649> of<00:01:14.710> me<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.479> wasn't<00:01:16.750> really<00:01:17.190> training

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
front of me and I wasn't really training

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.820 
front of me and I wasn't really training
as<00:01:18.460> far<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.789> I<00:01:18.880> could<00:01:19.149> as<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:20.170> came<00:01:20.409> up<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
as far as I could as I came up to the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.410 
as far as I could as I came up to the
starting<00:01:21.190> line<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.550> I<00:01:21.640> saw<00:01:21.819> high<00:01:22.090> fliers

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
starting line and I saw high fliers

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.570 
starting line and I saw high fliers
face-to-face<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.350> really<00:01:24.069> didn't<00:01:24.340> think<00:01:24.369> much

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
face-to-face I really didn't think much

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.180 
face-to-face I really didn't think much
of<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.649> thought<00:01:26.649> was<00:01:26.770> gonna<00:01:26.920> be<00:01:26.979> simple

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
of it I thought was gonna be simple

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.050 
of it I thought was gonna be simple
something<00:01:27.789> easier<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.360> go<00:01:28.509> across<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.259> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
something easier to go across and I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.969 
something easier to go across and I
completely<00:01:31.060> ignored<00:01:31.569> how<00:01:32.200> difficult<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
completely ignored how difficult the

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.240 
completely ignored how difficult the
pipe<00:01:33.159> ladder<00:01:33.429> really<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:35.259> went<00:01:36.009> way<00:01:36.220> too

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
pipe ladder really is I went way too

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.279 
pipe ladder really is I went way too
fast<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:36.880> couldn't<00:01:37.119> control<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.780> as<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.140> was

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
fast I couldn't control it and as I was

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.050
