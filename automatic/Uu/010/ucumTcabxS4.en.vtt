00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.350
 goodbye of place I hate this era 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.350
 ah 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.810
 We encourage you to keep traveling this site 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.260
 you think it will come do not look back 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.950
 He will come immediately when he sees that he does not 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.950
 we make my case 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.879
 [Music] 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.879
 look at them there comes already 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.760
 yes 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 one 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.250
 I'm sorry the dinosaurs can no longer 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.710
 get enough food because the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.450
 trees and grass have dried but 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.930
 they must continue eating to feed their 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.930
 huge body 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.310
 they have not changed their way of life after 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.739
 of this evolution of nature 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.739
 [Applause] 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.579
 you know the latest theory about 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.439
 extinction of the dinosaurs not a 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.119
 cosmic explosion located near the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.450
 solar system killed all the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.810
 dinosaurs this theory does not relate its 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.979
 extinction with nature and it is true 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.560
 nobody knows it is still a mystery 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.049
 impenetrable until today you mean the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.569
 it was primitive not to the time when 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.789
 we live because what I say we live in 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.489
 a primitive time we are not living 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.430
 at the end of the Cretaceous period about 65 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.940
 millions of years before our time 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.940
 alva that float 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.690
 they soon died but the reasons for 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.040
 their disappearance are not yet clear and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.110
 we may never know what happened 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.879
 some say that the alkaloid that 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.799
 contains the ferns has increased and 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.230
 causes death by poisoning 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.629
 dinosaurs others say they have 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.250
 overgrown some say that the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.840
 mammals that appear on earth 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.840
 behind them they eat their eggs 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.310
 look at those animals are like molecules 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.840
 the delta rigiÃ³ is not an insect although 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.530
 it seems it is believed to be the ancestor 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.530
 of the mammal 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.950
 there are many theories about the extinction of 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.389
 the dinosaurs I think that 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.340
 they disappeared because they grew 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.060
 too much and they could not keep the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.060
 hormonal balance 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.810
 already 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.740

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.709
 look at an authentic mammoth

 [Applause] 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.830
 and good 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.720
 As the 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.519
 [Music] 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.000
 yes 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.990
 [Music] 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.090
 through that type you mean the 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.100
 Tyrannosaurus can not be 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.510
 [Music] 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.120
 he is dead

 [Music] 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.470
 [Applause] 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.620
 why 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:35.570
 [Music] 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:55.260
 and 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:55.260
 [Music] 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.789
 [Music] 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.129
 They can not be no bird tracks 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:40.860
 too big 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.729
 sure they are tyrannosaurs s the 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.339
 one-eyed 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:47.559
 can not be can not live millions of 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:49.210
 years anyway or is it possible that 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:53.009
 the dinosaurs have managed to survive 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.009
 until recently there are problems of it 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.849
 drawings made by primitive men 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:07:00.219
 discovered in the USA represent men 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.560
 fighting against dinosaurs can be 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:04.930
 but I'm afraid to think that you can 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.379
 be around here how long you can live 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.379
 so 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.250
 follow them to eat 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.770
 when I think about the existence of 

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:21.899
 dinosaur in this time I only see one 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.619
 explanation he also travels through 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.619
 weather 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.920
 the UFO carries the dinosaur along with 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.510
 us that proposes with that something 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.850
 they will have planned but it does not make me any 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.620
 grace is an injustice could have 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.620
 let us accompany the triceratops 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.260
 they fell on my hands they were going to 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.260
 find out 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.640
 still do not be sorry the flowers look 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.640
 a butterfly 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.979
 the butterflies I care a cucumber 

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:57.550
 still obvious come tyrannosaur then the 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:08:01.889
 welcome you the next time 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.889
 come I'll give him for the hair I saw
