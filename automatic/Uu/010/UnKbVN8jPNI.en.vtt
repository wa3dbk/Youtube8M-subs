the time it's no good for him and it's
not<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> club<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.540> sort

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
not good for the club to have this sort

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.149

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
of ghostly figure hanging around doesn't
make<00:01:29.250> sense<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.600> what's<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.960> on

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
make sense and so that's what's going on

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
make sense and so that's what's going on
with<00:01:31.140> cleverly<00:01:31.590> elsewhere<00:01:32.460> unless<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.299> right
