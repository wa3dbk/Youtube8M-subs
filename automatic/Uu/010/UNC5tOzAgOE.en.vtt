and it's down the middle so you can just
you<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.189> draw<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> line<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.850> side<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you know draw a line on that side and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.179 
you know draw a line on that side and
you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> draw<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.439> same<00:01:31.740> line<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you know the draw the same line in the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.660 
you know the draw the same line in the
same<00:01:32.369> spot<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> go<00:01:35.520> all<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
are just to help you get the board close

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.500 
are just to help you get the board close
to<00:01:41.790> what

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.510 

Oh<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:46.080> design<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.010> to<00:01:47.160> do<00:01:47.280> okay<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
Oh a design you want to do okay so you

and you can round the nose really nice
too<00:04:44.640> i<00:04:44.670> didn't<00:04:44.970> know<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.480> i<00:04:45.540> might<00:04:46.170> even

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
too i didn't know that so i might even

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.260 
too i didn't know that so i might even
start<00:04:46.530> using<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.250> regular<00:04:47.880> decks<00:04:48.120> and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
start using this on regular decks and

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.550 
start using this on regular decks and
I'm<00:04:48.330> thinking<00:04:48.540> about<00:04:48.600> doing<00:04:48.750> regular<00:04:49.170> dicks

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
I'm thinking about doing regular dicks

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.920 
I'm thinking about doing regular dicks
again<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.220> then<00:04:50.700> start<00:04:51.390> selling<00:04:51.660> them<00:04:51.690> again

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
again and then start selling them again

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.530 
again and then start selling them again
and<00:04:52.170> then<00:04:52.920> oh<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.490> tail<00:04:53.700> is<00:04:53.910> rounded<00:04:54.450> so

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
and then oh and the tail is rounded so

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.150 
and then oh and the tail is rounded so
it<00:04:54.630> was<00:04:54.720> kind<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:54.960> hard<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.410> decided<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:56.040> you

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
it was kind of hard so I decided it you

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.600 
it was kind of hard so I decided it you
know<00:04:56.250> what<00:04:56.400> I'm<00:04:56.730> gonna<00:04:56.880> make<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.890> doubt<00:04:58.890> so<00:04:59.490> the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
know what I'm gonna make a doubt so the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.790 
know what I'm gonna make a doubt so the
Dow<00:04:59.900> actually<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.080> don't<00:05:01.230> know<00:05:01.350> if<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.530> can<00:05:01.650> see

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
Dow actually I don't know if you can see

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.159 
Dow actually I don't know if you can see
that<00:05:01.980> could<00:05:02.850> go<00:05:03.000> in<00:05:03.210> there<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.540> sand<00:05:04.080> it

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
that could go in there and sand it

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.020 
that could go in there and sand it
pretty<00:05:04.410> nice<00:05:04.620> so<00:05:04.860> I<00:05:04.890> got<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.220> down<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.400> looking

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
pretty nice so I got it down to looking

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.690 
pretty nice so I got it down to looking
