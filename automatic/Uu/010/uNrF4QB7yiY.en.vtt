the guys carrying nothing

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.120 
the guys carrying nothing
so<00:03:36.730> inventory<00:03:37.359> is<00:03:37.510> empty<00:03:37.870> there<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.620> there<00:03:39.040> are

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
so inventory is empty there is there are

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.819 
so inventory is empty there is there are
no<00:03:39.280> objects<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.880> look<00:03:40.000> at<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:41.139> none<00:03:41.709> of

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
no objects to look at and then none of

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.370

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
the directions on the compass section

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.590 
the directions on the compass section
are<00:03:44.530> lit<00:03:44.829> up<00:03:45.010> because<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:45.790> haven't<00:03:46.060> added<00:03:46.269> any

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
are lit up because we haven't added any

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.740 
are lit up because we haven't added any
exits<00:03:47.280> but<00:03:48.280> we<00:03:48.400> know<00:03:48.519> at<00:03:48.670> least<00:03:48.730> our<00:03:49.000> game<00:03:49.239> runs

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
exits but we know at least our game runs

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.780 
exits but we know at least our game runs
so<00:03:50.440> if<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.620> want<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:50.859> carry<00:03:51.099> on<00:03:51.160> creating<00:03:51.639> in

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
so if you want to carry on creating in

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.839 
so if you want to carry on creating in
which<00:03:51.880> we<00:03:52.000> do<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.389> will<00:03:52.480> go<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.690> file

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
which we do we will go to file

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.089 
which we do we will go to file
stop<00:03:54.849> game<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.389> then<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:55.930> can<00:03:56.109> continue<00:03:56.440> to

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
stop game and then we can continue to

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.180 
stop game and then we can continue to
edit<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:58.269> our<00:03:58.389> next<00:03:58.690> tutorial<00:03:59.069> we'll<00:04:00.069> look

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
edit and in our next tutorial we'll look

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.860 
edit and in our next tutorial we'll look
at<00:04:00.340> adding<00:04:00.609> some<00:04:00.819> more<00:04:01.000> rooms<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.599> some<00:04:02.560> exits

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
at adding some more rooms and some exits

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.560 
at adding some more rooms and some exits
for<00:04:05.410> now
