00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.690 
to like let the fear may be transformed
into<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.840> being<00:00:49.140> involved<00:00:49.560> I<00:00:49.920> long<00:00:50.370> ago

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
into just being involved I long ago

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
into just being involved I long ago
learned<00:00:50.970> if<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.900> think<00:00:52.230> specific<00:00:52.800> ideas<00:00:53.220> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
learned if I think specific ideas of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
learned if I think specific ideas of
light<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:54.000> never<00:00:54.180> work<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.720> this<00:00:54.750> method<00:00:55.500> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
light they never work in this method of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.370 
light they never work in this method of
working<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.700> practice<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.840> never<00:00:58.080> work

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
working in this practice they never work

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.530 
working in this practice they never work
right<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> because<00:00:59.040> light<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.790> elemental

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
right and because light is so elemental

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.520 
right and because light is so elemental
and<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.960> much<00:01:01.620> purer<00:01:02.040> than<00:01:02.370> thinking<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.530> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and so much purer than thinking and so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
and so much purer than thinking and so
much<00:01:04.680> faster<00:01:05.250> than<00:01:05.400> thinking<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.120> like<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.930> let

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
much faster than thinking I like to let

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.700 
much faster than thinking I like to let
light<00:01:07.650> kind<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> lead<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.610> lead<00:01:09.480> the<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:09.840> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
light kind of lead me lead the way have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.950 
light kind of lead me lead the way have
you<00:01:10.830> ever<00:01:10.950> done<00:01:11.190> an<00:01:11.340> athlete<00:01:11.700> before<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you ever done an athlete before like you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.110 
you ever done an athlete before like you
know<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:14.310> that's<00:01:14.460> what's<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.910> to<00:01:14.970> be

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
know I think that's what's going to be

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.000 
know I think that's what's going to be
really<00:01:15.390> interesting<00:01:15.870> is<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.050> I've<00:01:16.560> seen<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
they establish the initial just so we

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.620 
they establish the initial just so we
can<00:01:48.620> get<00:01:48.800> a<00:01:48.830> still<00:01:49.220> shot<00:01:49.250> not<00:01:50.060> hitting<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.450> bag
