00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.310
 Personal speech there drink beque + 1 ed 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.199
 black 2 the channel was this time it was 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.609
 time not to do a post comment is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.160
 I 'm really doing more for you. 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 videos live here for you but this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.820
 instead stopping a little the series here I 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.359
 I wanted to talk a bit of the subject means 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.430
 I'm boring with you and you could 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.800
 see a video title there is that the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.320
 sensitive subject and comment on 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.420
 if I talk but I always open with you 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.430
 I have always expressed my opinion clearly 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.980
 For all of you then I decided to hit a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.379
 chat and talk about hackers in block 2 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.270
 cops as well so fast canopy 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.070
 It's already connected, I can not imagine. 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.440
 as someone already finds out 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.690
 hackers of the cup the two soon did not pass 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 nor six months nor five months of the game 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.719
 launch already has expensive hacker and lots of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.520
 people complained 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.780
 You have very fast here in the modern 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.439
 do not you 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.250
 active activision of better or refer 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.920
 I forgot the name of the producer of the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.040
 Bad faith, and I'll remember it in a bit more 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 Finally everyone spoke our team is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.909
 much better 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.430
 the bad faith producer is bad for 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.110
 raffia sent two of rake number three 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.479
 but if you reach a conclusion here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 It's no use, it's no use. 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.900
 producer who is doing better with the other 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.150
 will solve the problem of hackers 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.950
 I do not know what happens to me is I 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.930
 I always go to finish the problem 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 of the hackers I thought was in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.900
 Always put update of the game does not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 to have fast I always thought 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 temperatures and does not update 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.439
 place the two have update the other 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 bodies also had updates only 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.340
 really have a serious problem with 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 hackers and because it was that day I wanted 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 chat with you because I 'm 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.430
 playing much more men noticed is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.560
 I even made one last video there that I 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.329
 I told you that you wanted six men. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.829
 I'm half divided then the people asked for a 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.479
 galera asked yes another galera spoke 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.130
 that we are not wanted in the channel 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.200
 but I'll bring it, I've already prepared myself 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640
 bring you there on some 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.020
 Sound issues that the personnel more 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.970
 is of interest to men but will not 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 series, but I'm going to release videos 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.720
 slowly go out on the men to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.270
 you but the focus is not this then how 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.430
 Speaking 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.350
 looking men and a bpc galera and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.390
 My friends start talking about what they have 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.720
 a lot of people there I do not need any more 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.160
 knows and even a guy who was my pcn amy 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 to speak otherwise I will not name names 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.050
 Of course not, but they told me 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.970
 where he was trapped three or four 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.300
 nothing needed master 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.240
 so man is not cool is extremely 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.640
 bad and this for you travel to the game 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.220
 for us game users then face is 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.230
 This just ruins the guy and I know that guy. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.210
 Brazil has is that it creates has a 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.860
 Brazilian who creates hacker but is very 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.660
 more American and this is spreading 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.370
 American talking to the players 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.250
 Brazilians who can speak English is 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.260
 hit the chat and then it will only attack then 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.250
 This happens straight guys then 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.750
 each one 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.490
 we have to stop it and if not 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.350
 a lot of people watching me there 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.390
 What do you see, do not do it or do you hate it? 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.610
 that neither I but because you see a guy 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.850
 that denounces reports know I know 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.800
 in the codes never helped anything this ever 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.510
 happened nothing reporting the player does 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.330
 This happens to nothing, the guy. 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.670
 reported nothing happens and it never 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.590
 it was never any good for sure 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.700
 already the guys from the active have arrived 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.110
 diogo deivid and vander e rar 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.660
 likely to drop an update 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.300
 then to try to end the drugs but 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.280
 in the end I'm in the code and mothers unavoidable 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.170
 at the end of the code there are 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.510
 here hackers they can never banish 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.130
 once and a half the hacker in block 2 already 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.170
 This I was really scared of. 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.060
 because face it early in the game already 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.230
 Has fast but again in the end understood 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.270
 intensively 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.650
 even scared so I decided to go 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.750
 this message to you who does not 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.790
 You know that, so if you do not know 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.830
 find out now by passing information to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.620
 people are leaving a fan on the video to 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.140
 pass comments and if you have a friend for 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.240
 talk go there see video beckham knows that 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.190
 if you want of course also but it spreads 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.840
 This is a good message to be there. 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.360
 try to combat as little as possible and 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.620
 Let's try is I'm too big for 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.910
 try to do this but I have to do 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.920
 my maximum here I also have one 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.989
 Good job for you, you always have to 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.459
 do that so you can leave it there 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.709
 and I told the truth, you do not like my channel 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.540
 of my work and of course the video show in 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.609
 video because hackers are really 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.980
 really horrible in the game front one 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.890
 shooting game where you can is with hackers 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.960
 and may it may contradict controlling 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.960
 he can control his focus is that the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.030
 change weapon 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.160
 can pass from the fast level and many 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.840
 Sometimes guys this has happened to me and 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.620
 with a friend my name of the year 3 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 I think I came in with a lot of 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.240
 story for you guys but I was on a 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.580
 departure is to have a game of pool 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.680
 Tactical Tim momentum in third and I joined the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.789
 sharing and out of nowhere when the game is over 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.380
 came type is hacker for me to listen to 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.849
 central councils aim and I know that 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.880
 right word but entered 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.440
 the ranking is the bush that was there entered 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.660
 for me then my focus was totally 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.430
 changed with the river I was afraid 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.349
 because I was not going to make any more pressure 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.090
 mw3 fight for you guys I was having 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.830
 a canal start is that put sugar is 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.990
 speak less and honor such and such 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.539
 so I turned off the playstation when 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.610
 returned thanks to God had alternative 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.410
 back to normal but there are situations that 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.150
 people pass is maybe so beautiful in the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.729
 backoffice 80 people do not even know you are 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.009
 with hackers in the middle of the match and 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.229
 passing on to you and you 're going through a 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.820
 hacker and is not even understanding what's going on 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.099
 for sensitive situations 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.080
 so man do not have to end this 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.520
 or do not try to pass that word on because 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.229
 people will try to do this because 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.270
 Dude, I was really scared to 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.349
 This is true but it is no longer the 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.699
 series will return the channel 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.430
 I know I have horses series of 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.229
 shocks and bbc will also continue in 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.759
 new series on the channel too 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.949
 thank you from all submissions to 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.330
 write on the channel so if you are new and 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.830
 it happened that this video gives a 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.690
 look at the channel content if you like 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.070
 inscribe has the pilot of one day yes day 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.780
 not remembering that one day yes one day no 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.639
 has channel video has not seen of the day 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.560
 But one day, one day, it does not have any good people. 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.300
 do not watch the day this morning 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.190
 that's why it leaves a space every 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.719
 video beauty was between them james and 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.669
 It was too much to comment on. 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.099
 little about the rapids then never snakes 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.930
 25 then the story does not know the replica of 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.280
 I'll still choose the fund because I 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.570
 I'd rather have a chat sooner than 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.639
 put the video but I hope they have 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.860
 I really liked it, I just went to stay. 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:18.159
 fund now so that's it with a 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.159
 Hugs to you, it's okay, bye. 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.030
 ooo
