00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello everyone with you smartphone yuri 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.150
 and today we 'll talk relatively 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.780
 inexpensive tablet from the South Korean g 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.900
 jeep models from 70 for only $ 196 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.190
 the user will get a compact solution 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 quad processor under the hood 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.990
 fresh version of gps operating system 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.810
 display and various software 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
 lotions but is it worth the whole bunch 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.910
 your money and accordingly your 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 attention, see further design plan 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.140
 the manufacturer came up with a practical 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.829
 the sides are polycarbonate on the back panel and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.800
 collar 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.410
 plus the gloss on the front is nothing like 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.230
 of such unusual things only 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 have long been proven quality 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 I have no claims to the assembly with 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 three sides of the body is monolithic however 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
 there is also a joint on the front panel 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.260
 Well, here even find fault it turned out 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.020
 no jeep on the market from 70 is available in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.780
 two colors completely black 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.460
 and white no matter what 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.840
 orientation you will keep your tablet 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 you will have a front panel 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.220
 divided between the display of the eye 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.260
 frontal 1 and pixel training 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.420
 cameras as well as three classic 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.640
 touch buttons rendered by the way 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.189
 speaking on the display by the way 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.780
 last as in the case of so than gg2 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.119
 can be combined 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.549
 increasing their number on the panel to 5 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.710
 pieces and what is interesting in comparison with 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.409
 above mentioned smartphone here 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 wider possibilities there is also a button 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.060
 responsible for calling the so-called 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.100
 double window allows you to run 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 work two applications simultaneously on 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.380
 one desktop but more on that below 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.640
 on the opposite side of the lg g pad 70 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.189
 the output of the main eye is equipped 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.320
 3 megapixel camera in addition 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.750
 there are two grids here but only for one of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.720
 them hiding the built-in speaker 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.799
 the other is just a decor yet user 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.630
 may notice the logo 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.270
 manufacturing company plus a few 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.979
 technical notes even if deployed 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.770
 raise vertically on top 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.740
 can be seen miniature 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.469
 grafon noise reduction peephole and to port a 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.360
 also the output of the classic audio jack + 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.670
 micro sd card slot 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.640
 the last one is covered with thick plastic 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.879
 tablet got a stub 7 inch 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.069

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.780
 good viewing angles both vertically 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.010
 and horizontal pixel density on 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.810
 inch 216 in practice is not very much 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.450
 insignificant grain can be seen by 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.709
 at least it does not create discomfort in 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.989
 bright working hours 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.400

 backlight adjustment implemented only 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.000
 manually among other interesting 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.069
 features in the same submenu 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.470
 implemented activation so

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.079
 there is also an opportunity 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.370
 combinations of touch buttons 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.900
 sensitivity does not cause claims 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.440
 touch control implemented 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.610
 by 10 fingers at the same time 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.230
 quite good in terms of resistance to 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.480

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.889
 clarifies what material in question 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.109
 however in practice they are friction on the panel 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.280
 edge coin transporting week 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.440
 in a backpack with other devices 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 it was not enough to 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.670
 leave at least a small one 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.889

 slightly less user access 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.299
 half expansion is possible due to 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.780

 milliampere hours in practice device 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.180
 shows quite good results 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.590
 with approximate loads not less 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.620

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.659
 The tablet has one speaker with 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.519
 lunge on the rear panel on the basis of 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.019
 familiarity with its features can 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.510
 make a conclusion about quite good 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.850
 sound volume is good clean and even 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.430
 the amount of distortion that's nice i don't 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.930
 noticed in setting all classic

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.979
 I also did not slow down 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.350
 as for the pre-installed 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.270
 applications interesting was a jeep from 70 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.880
 It turned out to be Kyupi RF for pairing 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.410
 tablet with a smartphone and Krymov for 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.990

 by the way the front camera is also capable 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.639
 for a similar feat with test content 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.479
 You can find in our text
