00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 so i am back again a week as 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.410
 flex italia lives a week, so five 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.710
 days one working week on animal 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.299
 products dispensed except media yes that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.800
 was not a big problem now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.210
 I had the first three days 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.850
 bit of problems right for fruit 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.170
 I ate and I can 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.689
 actually be very grateful because of me 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.539
 have reduced the fruit in favor of one 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.119
 other evil glad and that is what I have for 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.679
 I discovered the beans and so on 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 the shopping street had gone a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.430
 little break did not want that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 at first one was not packed 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.350
 at the bio company in and have me this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.850
 tomato or white bean tomatoes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.469
 aware as usual drive that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050
 really cool because they only have 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:54.390
 2 70 calories per 100 grams 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 Carbohydrates 11 and 15 and that 's real 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 ne giant glass of which a maximum of half 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.090
 and so far only pack says and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.210
 This problem was with the fruit 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.479
 that he cheered my appetite yes 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.990
 in the train after a bit 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.950
 sensitive to react 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.939
 we live but very very 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.970
 helped a lot 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.460
 yes, because I have found when living 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.280
 there are for each goal setting the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.799
 matching munich 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.409
 So he wanted a low-calorie bean 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.860
 where you can eat a lot then 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.320
 just take to green beans and that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.759
 like to take all that out of it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 break well, what do I know they have a lot 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.189
 few calories and yet it is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.549
 relatively good nutrition or he tells her 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.259
 really want to make a lot of protein 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.369
 white, of course, then a bit 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.049
 more calories bit more 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.970
 carbohydrates you can know in the home 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.409
 to take 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 These are always sharp 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.630
 if in between if have something in between 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.119
 you want to take the soybean and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.369
 so you can use that for you yes 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.560
 So I found quite interesting and each one 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.560
 Bean has thus also in their own 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.000
 taste and me personally 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.280
 the neatly off right and neat 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.780
 it is cooked so no 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.670
 problem i do not get bloated 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.970
 thus if you somehow 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.530
 interested in the soybean has me 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.290
 Of course, the advantage that you 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.970
 has a relatively high value in the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.610
 opposite to the white house 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.320
 in that amino acids profile there 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.750
 the quality is a bit one-sided 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.640
 the biological value is absorbed 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.050
 could not be that high thats good though 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.480
 you combined the whole a bit 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.030
 with other proteins sources in the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.160
 soybean has less protein, however 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.260
 for a higher biological value 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:47.190
 that means you can just do that again 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:50.250
 record better so live in the absence 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.600
 look for recipes with white beans 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.890
 yes a lot of protein then much power behind it 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.140
 once I have white beans in 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:05.900
 tomato sauce then the kidney beans and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.900
 Just press here today 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.959
 Simply sweet potatoes with kidney beans 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.880
 I 'm still a little bit fat 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.489
 Niederrhein made and vegetables more 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.450
 not that is my lunch now and that 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.730
 I let myself taste 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.730
 in this sense, a high on the bun
