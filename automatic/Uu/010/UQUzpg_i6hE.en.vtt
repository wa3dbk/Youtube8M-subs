00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.040
 see more or less like that I know how to teach 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.410
 in some past video I do not remember which 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.850
 but what a nice color do you have if 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.380
 you have hyperpigmentation like me if 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.410
 you have to spend a little more 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.170
 this is to really see the gib 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.520
 round makes me super nice despite 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.170
 that this one has nothing and I do not like them 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.480
 many satin labile is a color 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:22.480
 super cute I recommend them 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.120
 totally this is show number 272 2 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.220
 tito is this precise tone that is here 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.290
 here they see it on my lips 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.370
 this is the lipstick I brought in my video 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.810
 past shopping I love it is a 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:41.170
 coffee in the orange trees or I do not know is a 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:47.860
 top post and it is very very nice I like it 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:51.100
 a lot and cts the 028 great kids of the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.460
 silver look what a beautiful thing 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.500
 like a lot of wake and the belt that does not 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.260
 I know from my skin tone I like it a lot 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.310
 How is it left if you can see it? 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.920
 color also do not know as pretty as that 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.810
 you can use it for a lot of things 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.750
 It is very neutral 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.060
 it's very very nice since we have all 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.760
 the bears cafes let's go with the tones 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.040
 darker from the reds to the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.180
 totally super van peace this tone 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.760
 beautiful that I really liked is the road 33 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.980
 from jordan so you're looking for a lip 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.470
 red that closely resembles the ruby ​​fuck 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.820
 more resemble because it's not exactly 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.190
 the dup but it resembles a lot and that 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.490
 be half moisturizer even though it says 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.979
 that is mate I feel that it is enough 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.720
 moisturizer can see it there if it shines 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:50.150
 a little bit the termination 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.450
 but it's super nice the pigmentation is 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:58.650
 beautiful and from super economic 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:01.700
 that is 011 cabaret is one of the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.590
 creamy jordan a is this is not mate 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.550
 but I think you like it like 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.530
 bring the vampi wave but not so dark 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.390
 this is a perfect lipstick for you 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.580
 apart from that it is super moisturizing and not 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.010
 it has smell is like super dry 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.120
 simply packed in super super shades 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:24.240
 nice look is beautiful this tone the 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.080
 true and then 32 thousand years that is 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.210
 This very beautiful coffee is a coffee that 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.580
 it's not like the brawn that I have to 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.310
 they know I like it a lot this is 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.030
 a coffee that throws more earth tones 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.640
 so it's a coffee very different from the 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.350
 that I'm used to, I bought it 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.260
 thinking that I could stay maybe as 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.880
 the one of kylie jenner but still it is thus 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.620
 I really like the nude was not so as 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.480
 I wanted because it seems that I presented 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.570
 less but pigments super good and it's 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.510
 good mate so it's a very nice tone 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.660
 see, I like lipstick a lot 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:04.680
 almost almost the love of my life is this 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.860
 red wine lovely coffee that is the lord 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.310
 ex planning they were presented is the number 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.720
 20 explant I searched for it and if you guys 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.640
 you know my videos from before you know that 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.010
 I looked for it like a crazy psychopath in a 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.790
 lots of places and what they can tell 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:24.009
 very little is for me 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.289
 exactly the brand diva 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.999
 look what prettier thing or whatever 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:34.020

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:38.710
 perfect is lovely pigment great 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.419
 it is hard mate a lot I do not have in 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.029
 nothing more than 7 this lipstick if you see it 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:45.529
 buy it as psychopaths because what 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:48.030
 really beautiful thing 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:51.570

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.540

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.970
 last labials of jordan to which he has 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.280

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.750
 tone of those in case they do not fit or something 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.800
