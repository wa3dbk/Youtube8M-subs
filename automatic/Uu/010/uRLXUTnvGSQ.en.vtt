00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.969
 the harmony comes to a new video 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.910
 today it's about battlefield 4 beta 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.379
 tweets yes , so the most determined 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.960
 already home of you dragonfly 4 beta 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.550
 played for all who are not yet closed 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.869
 beta have these qualities premium 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.669
 have no means of eurofighter and such 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.220
 further we can of course on Friday 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.230
 play yes and we have already noticed 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.880
 should the performance be rather 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.340
 modest of these games that is to say 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.899
 it does not look much better 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.430
 as Battlefield 3 and still is the 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.649
 canon performance so bad that you 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.870
 quite a few frame backpack little fps 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.520
 and so on that's not bad 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.380
 only the few fps one just the 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.720
 very bad drops where then the game 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.850
 of 30 fps on for example seven or 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.110
 eight under pressure and then the mouse 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.120
 gets really spongy and that for a 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.100
 for a few seconds so that's right 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.180
 annoying is this video which you 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.829
 Now reveal a few small tricks 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.020
 how could you fix that? 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.220
 a whole beta conclusion is still from us 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.510
 four come that means we take then 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.489
 also play much longer and still 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.260
 to be able to say a little bit more about it 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.089
 then after that, there are a few now 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.030
 tricks on how to enjoy the beta better 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.979
 can almost start I have yes 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.899
 at that time over the 43 a user cfg 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.060
 create a user conflict that you 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.829
 brings a bit more fps and I have 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.240
 this old user conficker me easy 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.619
 times bayfield 4 1 coup her because it is yes 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.329
 almost the same engineer a bit 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.259
 advanced 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.030
 I do not have any orders yet 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.829
 Tried out if that works 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.840
 in any case, this console gives me up 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.909
 this control remains this command 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.329
 already more fps that means for example 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.759
 spotlight slammed resolution is 156 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.359
 already a command of me about 5 fps 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.659
 more brings from 47 to 52 so I have it 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.249
 just tried it and all orders 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.359
 together in my config give me 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:49.670
 from 47 to 57 fps at this point 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.490
 I tried it out so it was 10 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.869
 fps more is quite cheap but there 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.779
 these stupid drops remain like 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.549
 you get the way yes and there is 

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.779
 a small possibility that does not have to 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.279
 in your case, but the core areas 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:02.689
 are specifically can you after the 

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.639
 Battlefield 4 beta started 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.289
 Just in the touchscreen and there 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.270
 go in and right click on yours 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.520
 make battlefield 4 process and then 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.650
 could yes select priority 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.599
 could be normal lower than normal 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.890
 or set low or so 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.540
 and there just imagine times on low 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.850
 that can be your frame jobs 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.130
 that is, if your processor reduces 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.319
 and 100% CPU usage then comes on 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.090
 These strangers come about and through 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.040
 this about portioning of the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.950
 Prioritization of the process itself can 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.180
 you just fix these frameworks 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.459
 as I said so with me, for example 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.480
 I do not need because there is one more 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.880
 further possibility he does not do 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.800
 theoretically overclock your processor 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.130
 I did that to myself too 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.959
 and I have a grain 5 375 kw 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.970
 you seem to be running at 3.4 gigahertz 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.640
 and I have me from 34 to 40 4 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.350
 gigahertz timed values ​​for all 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.510
 interested are now in the video 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.950
 for all who have no idea now 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.910
 what was overclocking again which should 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.200
 let that also be better 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.550
 the solution is really just for 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.110
 people know what they are doing with theirs 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.330
 Professor please do not hire any 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.950
 the instructions follow the correct ones 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.450
 So not his team is not her 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.320
 do not know what that does then fit 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.630
 you can do something pretty fast 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.310
 of course you can destroy yours 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.470
 graphics card is minimal overclock that is 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.730
 Of course, no problem would be to do it 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.430
 probably already wants 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.110
 I'll show you a screenshot 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.880
 from a benchmark of different 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.440
 graphics cards are both with new ones 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.030
 drivers open that means both one 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.610
 He has identified the new drivers 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.060
 as well as a video that bring more fps 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.500
 should 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.750
 and here you can see my benchmark 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.049
 that even a gtx titan so the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.060
 currently best nvidia graphics card quasi 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.400
 he does not have as many fps as she does 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.750
 actually could have had 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 it's really funny that programs 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.829
 play it is a real step to 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.350
 Battlefield 3 seen 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.120
 I mean heffner performance right now 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.220
 and just the zone again 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.260
 addressed drivers of nvidia 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.760
 Drivers can also do this 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.500
 frame drops that is supposed to produce 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.239
 the frame rubsamen and the new nvidia 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.680
 already installed driver tried 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.510
 Do not worry about things failing 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.040
 bring her for example 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.599
 yes the driver times then the official 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.610
 Frame drops do not have that anymore 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.200
 a pretty much abandon everything 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.760
 one in forums always easy 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.829
 the operators the drobs is right away 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.879
 the other way around 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.590
 yes, I always know for one 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.750
 But shit pretty much 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.400
 one is funny by want 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.169
 to summarize process priority 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.760
 never enforce user cfg purely copy 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.190
 if you want to overclock both cpu 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.070
 as well as gpu and maybe your new one 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.300
 nvidia drivers install 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.440
 if you can do that 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.330
 also writes in the comments 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.120
 what brought you that or if I did 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.669
 that brought nothing, etc. driveway video 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.930
 as mentioned already comes from us 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.310
 probably also comes a bug 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.419
 video in the sense of maybe already 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.949
 in a video that means we have like that 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.510
 Many beautiful bugs picked up the door 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:53.070
 are really cool not brought the 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.070
 and as always until the next video
