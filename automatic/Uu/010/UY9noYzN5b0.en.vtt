00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay so today we're going to make this

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay so today we're going to make this
tomahawk<00:00:03.060> from<00:00:03.480> old<00:00:04.380> piece<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.710> saw<00:00:05.069> blade<00:00:05.400> and

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
tomahawk from old piece of saw blade and

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.330 
tomahawk from old piece of saw blade and
I<00:00:06.600> used<00:00:06.960> three<00:00:07.379> types<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.830> wood<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
I used three types of wood for the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.490 
I used three types of wood for the
handle<00:00:08.790> two<00:00:09.090> very<00:00:09.300> sharp<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.929> works<00:00:10.230> very

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
handle two very sharp and works very

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.350 
handle two very sharp and works very
well<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:11.460> first<00:00:11.730> we're<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.120> draw<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
well so first we're going to draw the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.079 
well so first we're going to draw the
design<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> piece<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.320> paper<00:00:13.670> then<00:00:14.670> cut<00:00:14.700> it

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
design on a piece of paper then cut it

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.890 
design on a piece of paper then cut it
out<00:00:15.210> using<00:00:15.509> scissors<00:00:17.060> use<00:00:18.060> spray<00:00:18.390> paint<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
out using scissors use spray paint to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.759 
out using scissors use spray paint to
transfer<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> design<00:00:19.800> onto<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.609> steel<00:00:21.769> okay

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
transfer the design onto the steel okay

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.230 
transfer the design onto the steel okay
so<00:00:22.830> now<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> grind<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:23.939> use

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
so now we're going to grind it out use

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.700 
so now we're going to grind it out use
an<00:00:24.420> angle<00:00:24.720> grinder<00:00:26.720> to<00:00:27.720> make<00:00:27.750> sure<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.680> a

like after its growing out now we're
going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> thick<00:00:48.989> wheel<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> handle

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
going to use a thick wheel on the handle

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.040 
going to use a thick wheel on the handle
grinder<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.489> grind<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> its<00:00:51.629> final<00:00:51.840> profile

yeah<00:00:57.650> I'm<00:00:57.830> using<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.340> round<00:00:58.580> file<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.630> file<00:01:00.020> the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
yeah I'm using a round file to file the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.200 
yeah I'm using a round file to file the
inside<00:01:00.740> where<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:01.100> can't<00:01:01.400> reach<00:01:01.700> with<00:01:02.000> my<00:01:02.030> own

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
inside where I can't reach with my own

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.090 
inside where I can't reach with my own
in<00:01:02.390> front<00:01:07.570> but<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.690> can<00:01:08.870> also<00:01:09.020> use<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> disc

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
in front but you can also use a disc

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.270 
in front but you can also use a disc
grinder<00:01:10.280> like<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:10.730> one<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:12.280> homemade

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
grinder like this one this is a homemade

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.289 
grinder like this one this is a homemade
one

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.230 

remove<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.570> rust<00:01:23.780> with<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.229> sounder

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.090 

punch<00:01:30.240> their<00:01:30.630> holes<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> handle<00:01:34.100> drill

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
punch their holes for the handle drill

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
punch their holes for the handle drill
the<00:01:35.310> holes<00:01:35.580> through<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> town<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> metal

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the holes through the town with a metal

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
the holes through the town with a metal
drill<00:01:40.790> okay<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:42.240> we're<00:01:42.330> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> grind

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
drill okay so now we're going to grind

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.730 
drill okay so now we're going to grind
the<00:01:42.899> bevels<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.990> make<00:01:45.990> sure<00:01:46.229> everything's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the bevels and make sure everything's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.210 
the bevels and make sure everything's
even<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.720> grind<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> hand<00:01:49.470> grinder

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
even and grind it with a hand grinder

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
even and grind it with a hand grinder
odd<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.789> have<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.720> belt<00:01:52.110> sander<00:01:52.380> like

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
odd if you have one a belt sander like

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.050 
odd if you have one a belt sander like
this<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:54.710> make<00:01:55.710> sure<00:01:55.950> both<00:01:56.280> sides<00:01:56.640> are<00:01:56.880> even

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
this one make sure both sides are even

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.929 
this one make sure both sides are even
and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> same<00:01:59.159> angle<00:01:59.670> every

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and then you use the same angle every

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.029 
and then you use the same angle every
time<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:00.630> how<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.929> can<00:02:01.289> get<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> very<00:02:01.890> good

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
time that's how you can get a very good

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.080 
time that's how you can get a very good
sharp<00:02:02.909> edge<00:02:03.500> also<00:02:04.500> cool<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.369> blade<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.850> water

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
sharp edge also cool the blade in water

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.940 
sharp edge also cool the blade in water
so<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.720> doesn't<00:02:06.780> open<00:02:07.319> now<00:02:07.619> we're<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so it doesn't open now we're going to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.609 
so it doesn't open now we're going to
harden<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.519> blade<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.000> use<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> charcoal<00:02:10.229> forge

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
harden the blade I use a charcoal forge

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.640 
harden the blade I use a charcoal forge
and<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.610> when<00:02:11.910> they're<00:02:12.299> steel<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.900> red-hot

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and then when they're steel is red-hot

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.460 
and then when they're steel is red-hot
then<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.610> quench<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.209> into<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> oil<00:02:18.290> do<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
then you quench it into the oil do the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.830 
then you quench it into the oil do the
same<00:02:19.709> with<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.580> Spica<00:02:21.330> at<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.660> end<00:02:23.840> after

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
same with the Spica at the end after

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.370 
same with the Spica at the end after
hardening<00:02:25.670> we<00:02:26.670> remove<00:02:27.180> all<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.510> scale<00:02:28.019> and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
hardening we remove all the scale and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.670 
hardening we remove all the scale and
rust<00:02:28.680> that's<00:02:29.280> left<00:02:29.670> by<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.030> oil<00:02:30.450> sand<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
rust that's left by the oil sand the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.460 
rust that's left by the oil sand the
whole<00:02:31.890> thing<00:02:32.160> clean<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.299> polish<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.350> up

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
whole thing clean and then polish it up

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.180 
whole thing clean and then polish it up
to<00:02:35.280> 600<00:02:36.239> grit<00:02:38.870> I'm<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.440> leave<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
to 600 grit I'm going to leave the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.190 
to 600 grit I'm going to leave the
temper<00:02:41.609> colors<00:02:42.000> onto<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.420> steel<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:42.959> that's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.110 
temper colors onto the steel so that's
why<00:02:43.350> I'm<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.829> sound<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.459> polish<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.820> now

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
why I'm going to sound and polish it now

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.670 
why I'm going to sound and polish it now
and<00:02:46.079> instead<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.440> after<00:02:47.070> tempering<00:02:48.470> now<00:02:49.470> it's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and instead of after tempering now it's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.250 
and instead of after tempering now it's
time<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:49.980> tempering<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.910> temper<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.870> normal

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
time for tempering I temper in a normal

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.099 
time for tempering I temper in a normal
oven<00:02:52.500> at<00:02:53.000> 200<00:02:54.000> degrees<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> one-and-a-half

oven at 200 degrees for a one-and-a-half

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.740 
oven at 200 degrees for a one-and-a-half
hour<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.579> reduces<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.299> brittleness

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
hour and it reduces the brittleness

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.080 
hour and it reduces the brittleness
after<00:02:58.260> hardening<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:02.670> going<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.940> give

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
after hardening so now I'm going to give

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.120 
after hardening so now I'm going to give
it<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.329> final<00:03:03.570> edge<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.950> make<00:03:05.100> a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
it a final edge and to make a

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.729 
it a final edge and to make a
razor-sharp<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> contrast

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
razor-sharp and I like the contrast

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.130 
razor-sharp and I like the contrast
between<00:03:08.160> shiny<00:03:08.850> metal<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.720> orange

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
between shiny metal and the orange

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.880 
between shiny metal and the orange
temper<00:03:10.590> colors

now<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.100> time<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.820> handle<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.450> use<00:03:15.990> three

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
now it's time for the handle I use three

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.030 
now it's time for the handle I use three
different<00:03:16.440> types<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.220> wood<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> top

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
different types of wood this is a top

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.400 
different types of wood this is a top
part<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:20.730> handle<00:03:21.210> it's<00:03:21.690> purple<00:03:22.230> hardwood

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
make sure everything fits before you use

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:19.800 
make sure everything fits before you use
the<00:04:07.170> glue

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.530

out with some lacquer cleaner when the
glue<00:04:27.980> has<00:04:28.010> dried<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.850> can<00:04:29.090> start<00:04:29.810> shaping<00:04:30.410> the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
glue has dried you can start shaping the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.580 
glue has dried you can start shaping the
handle<00:04:30.980> by<00:04:31.190> rasping<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.030> violent<00:04:32.570> of<00:04:32.870> excess

wood to the profile of the metal rasping

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.700 
wood to the profile of the metal rasping
and<00:04:37.700> filing<00:04:38.180> takes<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.690> lot<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:38.870> time<00:04:39.260> but<00:04:39.530> it

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
and filing takes a lot of time but it

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.770 
and filing takes a lot of time but it
gives<00:04:39.920> you<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.070> lot<00:04:40.250> of<00:04:40.280> control<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:41.120> if<00:04:41.690> you

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
gives you a lot of control and if you

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.020 
gives you a lot of control and if you
don't<00:04:41.990> have<00:04:42.260> better<00:04:42.950> machines<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.790> is<00:04:44.000> a

don't have better machines this is a

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.360 
don't have better machines this is a
very<00:04:44.300> good<00:04:44.480> option<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:45.500> can<00:04:45.650> also<00:04:45.830> use<00:04:46.160> an

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
very good option you can also use an

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.730 
very good option you can also use an
angle<00:04:46.670> grinder<00:04:46.880> with<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.270> flap<00:04:47.600> disc<00:04:47.900> gives<00:04:48.650> a

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
angle grinder with a flap disc gives a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.850 
angle grinder with a flap disc gives a
really<00:04:49.100> nice<00:04:49.400> finish<00:04:49.460> but<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.540> don't<00:04:51.500> like

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
really nice finish but I don't like

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.590 
really nice finish but I don't like
using<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.400> very<00:04:52.460> much<00:04:52.790> because<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.300> isn't<00:04:53.570> very

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
using it very much because it isn't very

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.070 
using it very much because it isn't very
precise<00:04:54.260> here<00:04:55.130> I'm<00:04:55.370> cutting<00:04:56.000> off<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.570> ends<00:04:56.900> of

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
precise here I'm cutting off the ends of

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.040 
precise here I'm cutting off the ends of
the<00:04:57.230> pins<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.950> I'm<00:04:58.400> rounding<00:04:59.180> off<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.600> handle

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
the pins and I'm rounding off the handle

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.210 
the pins and I'm rounding off the handle
with<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.470> file<00:05:02.290> make<00:05:03.290> sure<00:05:03.320> everything<00:05:04.010> is<00:05:04.100> the

with a file make sure everything is the

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.330 
with a file make sure everything is the
same<00:05:04.250> thickness<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:05.590> all<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.860> edges<00:05:07.220> are

same thickness and all the edges are
rounded<00:05:07.550> off<00:05:07.970> so<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.270> gives<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.660> very

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
rounded off so it gives a very
