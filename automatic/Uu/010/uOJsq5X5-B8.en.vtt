a<00:00:29.029> focus<00:00:29.359> on<00:00:29.509> this<00:00:29.720> was<00:00:30.019> weight<00:00:30.679> reduction<00:00:31.309> I

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
a focus on this was weight reduction I

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.270 
a focus on this was weight reduction I
kind<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.419> improved<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.989> fit<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:33.410> feel<00:00:33.650> and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
kind of improved the fit and feel and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.090 
kind of improved the fit and feel and
then<00:00:34.760> really<00:00:34.970> maximize<00:00:35.480> our<00:00:35.900> my<00:00:36.589> own<00:00:36.739> story

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100

then really maximize our my own story
which<00:00:37.309> for<00:00:37.610> us<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:37.730> bio<00:00:39.010> optimization<00:00:40.010> where

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
which for us is bio optimization where

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.970 
which for us is bio optimization where

injected liquid polyurethane which is
also<00:00:52.159> very<00:00:52.549> unique<00:00:52.699> for<00:00:53.000> running<00:00:53.269> shoe<00:00:53.449> but

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:54.439 
also very unique for running shoe but

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.369 
also very unique for running shoe but
the<00:00:54.589> kind<00:00:55.159> of<00:00:55.189> way<00:00:55.309> it<00:00:55.369> looks<00:00:55.549> like<00:00:56.229> so<00:00:57.229> you're

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
the kind of way it looks like so you're

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.590 
the kind of way it looks like so you're
able<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.619> get<00:00:57.769> a<00:00:57.830> real<00:00:58.009> natural<00:00:58.250> shape<00:00:58.759> in<00:00:59.420> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
with in the upper here we have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.340 
with in the upper here we have
a<00:01:18.579> symmetrical<00:01:19.579> tongue<00:01:19.850> construction<00:01:20.600> we

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
a symmetrical tongue construction we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.499 
a symmetrical tongue construction we
also<00:01:21.500> have<00:01:21.740> an<00:01:21.829> anatomical<00:01:22.490> construction<00:01:23.299> so

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
also have an anatomical construction so

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.419 
also have an anatomical construction so
little<00:01:23.960> bit<00:01:24.049> lower<00:01:24.289> on<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.770> outside<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.250> he'll

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
retail that'll be a 130 on the textile

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
retail that'll be a 130 on the textile
we<00:01:44.569> also<00:01:44.719> do

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.120 

the<00:01:48.250> industry<00:01:48.610> we're<00:01:48.760> doing<00:01:48.970> our<00:01:49.450> yak<00:01:49.720> leather

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the industry we're doing our yak leather

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240 
the industry we're doing our yak leather
still<00:01:51.870> yak<00:01:52.870> has<00:01:53.050> very<00:01:53.320> high<00:01:53.500> tensile<00:01:53.800> strength

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
still yak has very high tensile strength

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.310 
still yak has very high tensile strength
were<00:01:54.430> able<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.700> Skype<00:01:55.150> it<00:01:55.330> really<00:01:55.570> thin<00:01:55.840> so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
were able to Skype it really thin so

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.620 
were able to Skype it really thin so
it's<00:01:56.500> like<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:57.340> golf<00:01:57.580> club<00:01:57.910> like<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.150> second

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
it's like the golf club like a second

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.460 
it's like the golf club like a second
skin<00:01:58.720> feel<00:01:59.200> able<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.680> get<00:01:59.800> really<00:01:59.950> thin<00:02:00.250> really

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
percent less than the textile so it's

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.749 
percent less than the textile so it's
really<00:02:07.060> really<00:02:07.510> unique<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:08.470> great<00:02:08.759> results

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759

selling<00:02:26.950> point<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.489> -<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:28.439> think<00:02:29.439> it's<00:02:29.860> gonna<00:02:29.980> be

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
selling point is - I think it's gonna be

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.949 
selling point is - I think it's gonna be
our<00:02:30.250> natural<00:02:30.459> motion<00:02:30.970> technology<00:02:31.569> no<00:02:31.930> one

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
our natural motion technology no one

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.170 
our natural motion technology no one
else's<00:02:32.379> is<00:02:32.680> doing<00:02:33.010> direct<00:02:33.730> inject

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
else's is doing direct inject

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.479 
else's is doing direct inject
polyurethane<00:02:34.900> running<00:02:35.379> shoes<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.220> get

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
polyurethane running shoes so you get

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.940 
polyurethane running shoes so you get
that<00:02:36.640> natural<00:02:36.970> fit<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.840> feel<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.739> last

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
that natural fit and feel the last

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.100 
that natural fit and feel the last
mimics<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.579> foot<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:40.989> is

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
mimics the foot and then this is

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.140 
mimics the foot and then this is
lightweight<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.620> flexible<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.790> why<00:02:42.970> should

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
lightweight and flexible and why should

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.360 
lightweight and flexible and why should
a<00:02:43.180> retailer<00:02:43.659> carry<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.650> think<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.220> offer

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
a retailer carry on I think we offer

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.960 
a retailer carry on I think we offer
something<00:02:45.700> unique<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:47.260> our<00:02:47.860> natural<00:02:48.670> motion

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
something unique in our natural motion

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.640 
something unique in our natural motion
biotechnology<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.109> think<00:02:50.349> there's<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:51.280> lot<00:02:52.030> of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
biotechnology I think there's a lot of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.569 
biotechnology I think there's a lot of
products<00:02:53.650> out<00:02:53.739> there<00:02:53.769> that's<00:02:54.099> pretty<00:02:54.250> similar

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
products out there that's pretty similar

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.550 
products out there that's pretty similar
and<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.909> think<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.390> what<00:02:55.840> we're<00:02:55.989> doing<00:02:56.079> with<00:02:56.379> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and I think of what we're doing with the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.699 
and I think of what we're doing with the
Bioman<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.489> I<00:03:04.049> guess<00:03:05.049> they're<00:03:05.349> far<00:03:05.680> more

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
Bioman and I guess they're far more

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.540 
Bioman and I guess they're far more
focused<00:03:06.609> on<00:03:06.879> success
