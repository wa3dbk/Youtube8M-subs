I<00:00:15.590> got<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.740> add<00:00:17.240> four<00:00:18.240> ohm<00:00:18.420> resistance<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.260> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
I got it add four ohm resistance and it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.910 
I got it add four ohm resistance and it
wouldn't<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.039> too<00:00:20.250> much<00:00:20.279> work<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.789> put<00:00:20.970> them<00:00:21.090> at

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920
