00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.600
 yes good morning for the class of 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.580
 nutrition 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.030
 with the teachers moral lanes 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.699
 are presenting this video and it's for 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.960
 is about the difference between the 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:19.000
 parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.470
 many years ago a lot a lot 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.810
 time ago when people 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.669
 they had certain conditions that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.150
 prevented receiving their nutrients via 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.759
 orally there were no such advances 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 technological as there are today where 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.449
 we can administer nutrition came back 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 by veins or returned directly to 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.660
 intestine 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.180
 also parenteral nutrition when 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.860
 says to integrate refers to the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.040
 nutrition that directly by vein 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.140
 it also has some variables by 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.570
 example those that is for integral by 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.100
 pain in the upper extremities and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.200
 be the basilica or another type of vein are 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.330
 many times doctor ordered in 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.850
 nutrition for integral but because of 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.580
 which is a smaller blood vessel what 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.640
 can combine with nutrition or by 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.460
 nasogastric or enteral and can also 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.380
 be a partial nutrition because because 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.740
 many times this type of nutrients 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.940
 creates irritation directly to the glass by 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.940
 where is it going 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.670
 the nutrition to integrate via 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.560
 central in which many are administered 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.300
 times by a subclaw or by a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.760
 jugular 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.460
 this type of nutrition many times 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.940
 administered by when the patient is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.090
 burned that has hyper metabolism and in 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.190
 a nutrition that is more synthesized 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 it is more absorbable by the torrent 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.560
 blood does not harm some allergies 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.720
 some people can present a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.409
 kind of skill but it's designed 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.119
 is ready to be absorbed 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:01.369
 and received by the bloodstream 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.069
 also people who have conditions 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.009
 where your gastrointestinal system is 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.119
 there may be some malfunction as 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.920
 You can receive the return to integrate 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.000
 one of the things that we have to have 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 well outstanding is that when 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.409
 we administer this type of nutrition in 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.080
 the hospital that the bag is at 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.060
 room temperature because the change of 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.040
 temperature as it can as it goes 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.079
 directly to a central blood vessel 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.280
 can create changes in the heart with 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.349
 functioning in the body of the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.760
 We are always looking for a person 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.310
 truly acceptable temperature by 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.650
 the human body 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.330
 as I said before the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.489
 indications are often hyper 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.940
 metabolism or inability to 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.270
 person receiving the nutrient came back to the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.220
 final source 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.650
 to our years is in a coma 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.370
 then you can receive parenteral nutrition 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.960
 by a central vein or by a vein 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.840
 peripheral either partial nutrition 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.270
 partial or total nutrition what is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.090
 known as tipi in total to integrate 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.800
 no gene 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.319
 nursing care should be 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.720
 focused on the orientation to 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.770
 family preventive care to the area 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.740
 where it is inserted 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.610
 of the cannula or cannula so it's 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.470
 receiving nutrition and also the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.560
 monitoring in the progress of the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.990
 assimilation the weight react the ica 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.940
 everything that is related to this 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.760
 kind of nutrition this is nutrition 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.530
 parenteral the difference as I said is 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.170
 that the body can receive it 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.260
 directly into the bloodstream without 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.270
 be degraded letter in the stomach 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.230
 catalyzed by gastric acid while 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.510
 that nutrition is gastric or integral 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.210
 is very different from parenteral, not in 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.290
 regarding nutrients but in terms of 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.780
 the physical form in which it is prepared 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.549
 enteral nutrition we could mention 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.650
 also the nasogastric tubes by ions 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.209
 nutrition is directly deposited in 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.480
 the stomach this type of nutrition 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.630
 it's also a little different from the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.539
 integral since when in these new 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.570
 judges to gastric acids 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:25.990
 break catalyze those large particles 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.930
 and can do then assimilated into the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.570
 small intestine we also have the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.759
 gastrectomy that is another way for a 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.090
 administered a trial and was also 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:40.190
 directly to the stomach just that 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.580
 is sitting by an area 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.090
 the abdominal quadrants and the tube 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.790
 directly to the stomach 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.389
 now let's mention nutrition 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.740
 Enteral that goes directly to the intestine 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.990
 this type of nutrition obviously 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.960
 as basel deposits directly to 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.000
 intestine is also simple 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.880
 simplified synthesized that is 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.440
 absorbable directly in the 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.260
 intestine 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.770
 there are doctors who order tubes that are 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.310
 glasses boden to one's arms depends 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.720
 of the condition that the person has 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.090
 this kind of nutrition as I told you 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.229
 it's different because you do not need to 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.450
 has been to us in Rome but the 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.240
 the body can absorb it directly 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.760
 through the intestine here I have a 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.650
 little bottle I have a patient in my house 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.380
 of three years old which is 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.760
 receiving enteral nutrition through a tube 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.789
 in hard tie and this type of nutrition is 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.800
 a nutrition is called perfectly and 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.340
 It has all the necessary nutrients 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.789
 all kinds of vitamins proteins everything 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:52.030
 needed with a calorie by the cc already 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:56.670
 has 250 cc of received 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.440
 100 cc per hour and receive no calories 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.320
 practically because this child can not 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.630
 ingest anything since you swallowed orally 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.780
 acid to unclog toilets what is 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:12.190
 you know like a grain and this kind of 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:15.190
 acid and created a terrible ulcer in 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.080
 the esophagus and in the stomach and 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.030
 is currently ingesting this 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.240
 nutrition for a fast that what 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.690
 present you this tube and I will not record 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.810
 the child's face so that respecting 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:32.520
 the privacy but I want you to see then 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.520
 keeps it from the type of nutrition see 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.430
 well as we can see this child is 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.350
 connected to a tube was born one what there is 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.500
 have the disease of care 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.949
 when you connect this tube that does not go 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.860
 infested and here we also have the 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:54.720
 nutrition in the collecting bag where 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.480
 they deposit the nutrients and also this 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.430
 machine is connected to a continuous king 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.470
 Now he is currently down the 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.290
 science is for now receives no calories 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.540
 for now since it is titled 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.030
 increasing the king 's speed according to 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.860
 the assimilation of and this is a diet 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.510
 which is different from parenteral though 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:19.350
 it seems the liquids seem the same but 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:25.600
 not really not , this is a diet 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:28.300
 assimilable via enteral route, I am 1 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.740
 well then without more this my presentation 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:35.790
 thank you very much for the opportunity and this 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.790
 is the difference between
