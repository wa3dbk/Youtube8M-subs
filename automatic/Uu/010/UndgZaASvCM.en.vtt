on the other side in order to rotate a

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.420 
on the other side in order to rotate a
shape<00:03:07.850> or<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.600> tile<00:03:08.810> sorry<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.320> hold<00:03:09.830> ctrl<00:03:10.220> and

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
shape or a tile sorry I hold ctrl and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.949

then<00:03:10.519> scroll<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:14.140> there<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.230> go<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:16.840> don't<00:03:17.840> know

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
then scroll and there we go I don't know

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.289 
then scroll and there we go I don't know
what<00:03:18.079> I'm<00:03:18.140> doing<00:03:18.380> at<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.739> minute<00:03:19.150> there<00:03:20.150> we<00:03:20.209> go

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
what I'm doing at the minute there we go

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.890 
what I'm doing at the minute there we go
that<00:03:20.450> will<00:03:20.510> do<00:03:22.180> isn't<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.269> amazing

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
that will do isn't that amazing

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.640 
that will do isn't that amazing
yes<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.829> is<00:03:25.090> now<00:03:26.090> such<00:03:26.810> as<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.019> physics<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.380> me

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
yes it is now such as the physics of me

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.960 
yes it is now such as the physics of me
boy<00:03:27.799> he<00:03:27.920> will<00:03:28.010> not<00:03:28.160> slide<00:03:28.370> off<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.549> edge<00:03:28.760> which

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
boy he will not slide off the edge which

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.400 
boy he will not slide off the edge which
is<00:03:29.030> amazing<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:30.640> again<00:03:32.110> there's<00:03:33.110> plenty<00:03:33.380> of

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
is amazing but again there's plenty of

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.569 
is amazing but again there's plenty of
other<00:03:33.590> shapes<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.040> do<00:03:34.160> something<00:03:34.459> cuz

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
other shapes you can do something cuz

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.190 
other shapes you can do something cuz
actually<00:03:34.820> there's<00:03:35.000> four<00:03:35.030> shapes<00:03:35.450> there's<00:03:35.989> the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
actually there's four shapes there's the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.840 
actually there's four shapes there's the
basic<00:03:36.590> square<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:37.040> I'll<00:03:37.100> go<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> around<00:03:37.610> bats

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
basic square and I'll go to around bats

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.780 
basic square and I'll go to around bats
normal<00:03:38.209> rotation<00:03:38.390> there's<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.900> basic<00:03:39.260> square

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
normal rotation there's the basic square

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.819 
normal rotation there's the basic square
there's<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.940> rectangle<00:03:41.420> big<00:03:42.079> triangle<00:03:42.500> small

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
there's the rectangle big triangle small

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.610 
there's the rectangle big triangle small
triangle<00:03:43.239> now<00:03:44.239> what<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.480> will<00:03:44.600> notice<00:03:44.780> I'm

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
triangle now what you will notice I'm

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.050 
triangle now what you will notice I'm
gonna<00:03:45.769> put<00:03:45.980> some<00:03:46.190> rectangles<00:03:46.670> down<00:03:46.820> there

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
gonna put some rectangles down there

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.880 
gonna put some rectangles down there
then<00:03:47.900> I'm<00:03:47.989> gonna<00:03:48.110> turn<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.380> one<00:03:48.590> up<00:03:48.739> and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
then I'm gonna turn that one up and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.069 
then I'm gonna turn that one up and
place<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.190> there<00:03:49.630> now<00:03:50.630> I'm<00:03:50.750> gonna<00:03:50.870> do<00:03:51.019> I'm

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
place it there now I'm gonna do I'm

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.150 
place it there now I'm gonna do I'm
gonna<00:03:51.140> set<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.500> triangles<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:51.950> put<00:03:52.010> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
gonna set the triangles and put the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.240 
gonna set the triangles and put the
triangles<00:03:52.519> along<00:03:52.579> there<00:03:52.820> as<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.690> walk<00:03:53.840> across

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
triangles along there as I walk across

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.160 
triangles along there as I walk across
this<00:03:55.250> yokai<00:03:55.640> cannot<00:03:56.329> fall<00:03:56.510> down<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.810> gaps<00:03:56.989> in

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
this yokai cannot fall down the gaps in

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.410 
this yokai cannot fall down the gaps in
between<00:03:57.200> these<00:03:57.530> however<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.250> can<00:03:59.000> fall<00:03:59.269> down

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
between these however I can fall down

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.000 
between these however I can fall down
and<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.630> image<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.260> gaps<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:00.620> between<00:04:00.680> the

and the image on the gaps in between the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.220 
and the image on the gaps in between the
small<00:04:01.220> triangles<00:04:01.670> that's<00:04:02.329> just<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.720> random

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
small triangles that's just a random

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.500 
small triangles that's just a random
thing<00:04:03.739> but<00:04:04.010> other<00:04:04.130> what<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:05.209> triangle

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
thing but other what is the triangle

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.060 
thing but other what is the triangle
don't<00:04:05.780> really<00:04:05.989> effective<00:04:06.500> make<00:04:06.650> one<00:04:06.799> anywhere

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
don't really effective make one anywhere

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.710 
don't really effective make one anywhere
you<00:04:07.250> cannot<00:04:07.489> touch<00:04:07.730> them<00:04:07.910> nothing<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.570> do

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
you cannot touch them nothing you do

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.110 
you cannot touch them nothing you do
really<00:04:09.019> affects<00:04:09.290> them<00:04:09.970> okay

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
really affects them okay

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.060 
really affects them okay
so<00:04:11.329> there<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.750> have<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.170> there's<00:04:12.920> everything

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
so there you have it there's everything

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.380 
so there you have it there's everything
you<00:04:13.190> need<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.459> know<00:04:13.549> about<00:04:13.670> placing<00:04:14.150> tiles

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
you need to know about placing tiles

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.180 
you need to know about placing tiles
down<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.989> layer<00:04:15.170> four<00:04:15.470> which<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.799> active

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
down in layer four which is the active

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.279 
down in layer four which is the active
layer<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.549> will<00:04:17.209> be<00:04:17.299> covering<00:04:17.600> down<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:18.049> will<00:04:18.200> be

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
layer I will be covering down I will be

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.690 
layer I will be covering down I will be
covering<00:04:18.530> placing<00:04:18.950> down<00:04:19.070> tiles<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:19.579> other

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
covering placing down tiles in other

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.800 
covering placing down tiles in other
layers<00:04:19.970> such<00:04:20.090> as<00:04:20.209> layers<00:04:20.359> three<00:04:20.599> five<00:04:20.780> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
layers such as layers three five and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.420 
layers such as layers three five and
eight<00:04:21.049> but<00:04:21.620> I'll<00:04:21.739> be<00:04:21.859> getting<00:04:21.979> on<00:04:22.160> staying
