00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.459
 hey people today we do the song walk 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.380
 by quarks newcomer from london the 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.590
 soulful voice baritone so vote 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.900
 middle pitch and this year 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.300
 2015 will also be his debut album 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.949
 and I think the song already gives us 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.900
 very good taste makes it easy 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.970
 total much fun to hear him and 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.380
 of course , to play him and like him 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.150
 I can show that I can do the best 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.739
 Have fun with the song 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.300
 Fortunately, it only exists 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.190
 a chord order which is now constantly 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.190
 is repeated and that will do 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.810
 So start with the course 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.020
 we promised exactly the same 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.030
 how would I indeed beat once in a while 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.880
 Come here now 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.969
 came 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.320
 Now we come to the time course we 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.320
 have made 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.360
 and so on, it should be enough more 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.800
 I think the highschool impression 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.690
 Now I'll show you a few 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.220
 stop pattern already said im 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.580
 Just burst each chord once 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.580
 strike 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.570
 the x 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.710
 and in the choir is the whole thing 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.190
 of course, a little more and boost 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.150
 do the following 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.150
 down down town 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.009
 change tomorrow so 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.890
 it's best to do it slowly 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.590
 there is also one 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.480
 possibilities to increase a bit 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.800
 more demanding but who can stand 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.450
 to do that and indeed 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.450
 the pattern works like this 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:54.450
 play that too slowly in front of you 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.450
 and I have and have 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.450
 down down down 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.630
 daun 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.630
 fast 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.800
 Unfortunately 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.569

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.500

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.689
