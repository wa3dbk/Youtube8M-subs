00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.410
Look at me,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.910
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.770
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.870
I can't understand,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.550
I get misty, holding your hand.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.930
Walk my way,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.120
And a thousand violins begin to play

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.740
Or it might be the sound of your hello

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.900
That music I hear,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.570
I get misty the moment you're near

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.280
You can say that you're leading me on

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.850
But it's just what I want you to do

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.640
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.680
That's why I'm following you.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.270
On my own,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.950
Would I wander through this wonderland alone

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.380
Never knowing my right foot from my left,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.970
My hat from my glove,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:56.970
I get misty, and too much in love.
