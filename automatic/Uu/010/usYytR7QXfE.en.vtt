00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.200
 the fourth row of our circle I see again 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.500
 new color is not the same red 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.660
 don't you think it has a different shade 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.940
 and he even more like it than usual 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.250
 red of my favorite yarn 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.539
 put craft in a hurry of children so 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.539
 continuing the conversation about yarn 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:34.100
 we cut off continuing the conversation and yarn can 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.780
 recommend it to everyone 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.250
 suitable for hook number four three with 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 half four and a half in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.899
 whichever you knit and so 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:52.710
 scheme for the fourth row again the 4th had time 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:57.239
 3 columns of air loops on the rise in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.280
 same hole we do 2 and now in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.320
 last row we had two one two 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.619
 now 222 meaning two we do 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.000
 one loop in one hole 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:14.580
 next hole we make one bar 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 still in the next do one column then 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.080
 there are two singles 2 combined 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.080
 the following we do 2 combined 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.289
 the next two we do are loners 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.039
 the following we do combined 32 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.700
 combined I do not know seen from you on 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.000
 the camera 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 it seems that the color is different 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 red 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.140
 again one by one 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.649
 Well, actually, according to this scheme, we 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.110
 continue to the end of the series, I guess you 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.479
 Now I will not show the whole process 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.270
 I will show in the finished form how everything 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.030
 it will just say that for such 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.569
 the pattern we continue to knit on then 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.620
 there is in each new row we add 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.340
 the number of these here 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.400
 columns that go between doubled 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.769
 that is, in the first we just scored 12 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.910
 second and done in every climb in 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:39.959
 we made the third 2 1 2 1 in the fourth 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:44.840
 222 means the following will be three single 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.840
 then four five six and so on
