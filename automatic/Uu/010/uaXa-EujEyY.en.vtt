step<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.090> probably<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> most<00:01:27.930> important

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
step and probably the most important

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
step and probably the most important
step<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> turn<00:01:29.130> off<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.549> power<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.180> your

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
step is to turn off the power to your

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.179 
step is to turn off the power to your
thermostat<00:01:30.780> before<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> start<00:01:31.409> working<00:01:31.740> if

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
thermostat before you start working if

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.830 
thermostat before you start working if
you<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.970> run<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> risk<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> electrical

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you don't you run the risk of electrical

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.440 
you don't you run the risk of electrical
shock<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.229> nobody<00:01:34.439> likes<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.299> just<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
shock and nobody likes that and just to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.109 
shock and nobody likes that and just to
show<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.439> know<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> hot

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
show you you know that this is a hot

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
show you you know that this is a hot
item<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.560> could<00:01:40.829> cause<00:01:41.369> some<00:01:41.400> damage

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
item here that could cause some damage

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
item here that could cause some damage
if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.299> turn<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> power<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.280> you'll

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
if you don't turn the power off you'll

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
if you don't turn the power off you'll
see<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:45.990> screwdriver<00:01:46.350> before<00:01:46.890> turn

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
see if I use my screwdriver before turn

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
see if I use my screwdriver before turn
the<00:01:47.250> power<00:01:47.430> off<00:01:47.810> get<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> spark<00:01:49.439> coming

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the power off get a bit of spark coming

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.960 
the power off get a bit of spark coming
at<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.070> end<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.700> through<00:01:50.820> your

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
at you that end up going through your

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.280 
at you that end up going through your
arm<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> wouldn't<00:01:51.450> feel<00:01:51.570> too<00:01:51.750> good<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.170> when

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
arm it wouldn't feel too good and when

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.260 
arm it wouldn't feel too good and when
you<00:01:52.320> turn<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> electricity<00:01:53.280> off<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:54.149> your

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you turn the electricity off to your

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
you turn the electricity off to your
thermostat<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.810> may<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.500> your

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
thermostat you may have to go to your

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.340 
thermostat you may have to go to your
fuse<00:01:55.860> box<00:01:55.890> or<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.460> circuit<00:01:56.820> breaker<00:01:57.090> box<00:01:57.350> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
fuse box or your circuit breaker box to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.630 
fuse box or your circuit breaker box to
turn<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> off<00:01:58.770> along<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.310> some<00:01:59.520> other

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
turn it off along with some other

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.950 
turn it off along with some other
outlets<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.119> light<00:02:00.299> fixtures<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.810> house

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
outlets or light fixtures in your house

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.499 
outlets or light fixtures in your house
I<00:02:01.290> happen<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.920> live<00:02:02.100> an<00:02:02.280> apartment<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> has<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
I happen to live an apartment that has a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
I happen to live an apartment that has a
separate<00:02:03.930> circuit<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.799> heater<00:02:05.040> itself

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
separate circuit for the heater itself

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.910 
separate circuit for the heater itself
so<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.329> flip<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.899> light<00:02:07.530> switch<00:02:07.649> right

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
so I just flip this light switch right

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.940 
so I just flip this light switch right
here<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.340> takes<00:02:08.489> care

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
here and that takes care

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.190 
here and that takes care
and<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.520> I'm<00:02:09.789> just<00:02:09.880> gonna<00:02:09.970> go<00:02:10.179> right<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.750> go

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
and so I'm just gonna go right in and go

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.240 
and so I'm just gonna go right in and go
for<00:02:11.230> these<00:02:11.470> screws<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:11.830> attach<00:02:11.890> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
for these screws that attach the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.980 
for these screws that attach the
thermostat<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.819> wall<00:02:15.630> jutsu<00:02:16.630> there's<00:02:16.810> one

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
thermostat to the wall jutsu there's one

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.050 
thermostat to the wall jutsu there's one
at<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.170> top<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.620> one<00:02:18.400> at<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.550> bottom<00:02:18.730> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
at the top and one at the bottom and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.470 
at the top and one at the bottom and
just<00:02:19.480> those<00:02:19.900> two<00:02:20.140> usually<00:02:20.650> hold<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
just those two usually hold the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.309 
just those two usually hold the
thermostat<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> wall<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.080> got<00:02:23.230> to

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
thermostat to the wall so you got to

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.800 
thermostat to the wall so you got to
take<00:02:23.410> those<00:02:23.590> out<00:02:23.770> first<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:25.240> now<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.510> have<00:02:25.690> this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
take those out first so now we have this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.210 
take those out first so now we have this
away<00:02:25.930> from<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> wall<00:02:26.290> I'm<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:26.980> getting<00:02:27.190> a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
away from the wall I'm just getting a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.740 
away from the wall I'm just getting a
little<00:02:27.280> bit<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.580> slack<00:02:27.820> here<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.330> then<00:02:28.600> I'm

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
little bit of slack here and then I'm

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.930 
little bit of slack here and then I'm
gonna<00:02:28.840> use<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.260> small<00:02:29.500> small<00:02:30.459> screwdriver

to unscrew these ports and disconnect
these<00:02:33.550> wires

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
these wires

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.180 
these wires
okay<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:34.900> I've<00:02:35.140> removed<00:02:35.230> my<00:02:35.650> old<00:02:35.860> thermostat

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
okay so I've removed my old thermostat

safety here environmental safety as well

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.930 
safety here environmental safety as well
as<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:41.980> see<00:02:42.220> there's<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.550> little<00:02:42.730> bit<00:02:42.850> of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
as you can see there's a little bit of

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.120 
as you can see there's a little bit of
mercury<00:02:43.420> right<00:02:43.660> here<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.170> that's<00:02:44.290> how<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
mercury right here and that's how the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.979 
mercury right here and that's how the
analog<00:02:45.640> thermostat<00:02:46.180> tells<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.570> temperature

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
analog thermostat tells the temperature

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.810 
analog thermostat tells the temperature
a<00:02:47.170> mercury<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:47.950> technically<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.430> hazardous

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
a mercury is technically a hazardous

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.640 
a mercury is technically a hazardous
material<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.870> can't<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.290> toss<00:02:50.500> this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
material so you can't just toss this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.130 
material so you can't just toss this
thing<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.010> garbage<00:02:51.160> your<00:02:52.150> need<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.570> take<00:02:53.080> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
thing in the garbage your need to take a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.570 
thing in the garbage your need to take a
look<00:02:53.320> on<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.410> internet<00:02:53.769> or<00:02:53.920> call<00:02:54.100> around<00:02:54.310> and

look on the internet or call around and
find<00:02:55.239> out<00:02:55.750> where<00:02:56.050> on<00:02:56.380> your<00:02:56.590> community<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.100> can

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
find out where on your community you can

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.150 
find out where on your community you can
dispose<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.030> mercury<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.050> other<00:02:59.160> hazardous

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.300 
materials properly and safely all right
so<00:03:02.110> now<00:03:02.230> we're<00:03:02.350> ready<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.709> begin<00:03:03.190> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
so now we're ready to begin the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.790 
so now we're ready to begin the
installation<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.900> new<00:03:05.019> thermostat<00:03:05.350> so

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
installation of the new thermostat so

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.920 
installation of the new thermostat so
here<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.360> complete<00:03:07.660> form

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
here you have it in this complete form

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.020 
here you have it in this complete form
and<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.739> what<00:03:08.830> I<00:03:08.890> need<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.040> do<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.400> take<00:03:09.880> off

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
and so what I need to do is take off

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.430 
and so what I need to do is take off
that<00:03:10.209> face<00:03:10.420> plate<00:03:10.690> again<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.200> we<00:03:11.320> did

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
that face plate again just like we did

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.410 
that face plate again just like we did
with<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.590> old<00:03:11.680> one<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:12.910> case<00:03:13.150> it's

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
with the old one and in this case it's

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.420 
with the old one and in this case it's
just<00:03:13.480> done<00:03:14.380> by<00:03:14.560> unscrewing<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.220> little

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
just done by unscrewing this little

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.289 
just done by unscrewing this little
screw<00:03:15.579> at<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> bottom<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:18.209> separating<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
screw at the bottom and separating the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.740 
screw at the bottom and separating the
two<00:03:19.480> pieces<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.910> this<00:03:22.180> part<00:03:22.450> is<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.630> part

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
two pieces and so this part is the part

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.600 
two pieces and so this part is the part
is<00:03:22.900> going<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.079> go<00:03:23.200> against<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.560> wall<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.980> then

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
is going to go against the wall and then

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.160 
is going to go against the wall and then
this<00:03:24.940> front<00:03:25.209> part<00:03:25.420> with<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.750> screen<00:03:25.989> and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
this front part with the screen and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.080 
this front part with the screen and
everything<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.769> will<00:03:26.950> go<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.430> on<00:03:27.670> top<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:28.000> it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
everything that will go on on top of it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.490 
everything that will go on on top of it
now<00:03:28.390> that<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.570> have<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> backplate<00:03:29.200> here<00:03:29.440> I'm

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
now that I have the backplate here I'm

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.440 
now that I have the backplate here I'm
going<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.680> put<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.980> wires<00:03:30.190> through<00:03:30.610> this

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
going to put the wires through this

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.080 
going to put the wires through this
space<00:03:31.720> for<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.959> wires<00:03:32.140> here<00:03:32.880> push<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.000> up

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
space for the wires here push it up

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.960 
space for the wires here push it up
against<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> wall<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.549> now<00:03:36.640> we<00:03:36.700> have<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
against the wall so now we have the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.330 
against the wall so now we have the
backplate<00:03:37.329> installed<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:38.290> nice<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.220> snug

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
backplate installed it's nice and snug

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.340 
backplate installed it's nice and snug
on<00:03:39.700> there<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.630> see<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.900> two<00:03:41.049> screws

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
on there and I you see the two screws

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.710 
on there and I you see the two screws
holding<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.739> in<00:03:41.829> place<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.120> our<00:03:43.269> next<00:03:43.450> step

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
holding it in place and so our next step

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.270 
holding it in place and so our next step
is<00:03:43.870> now<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.110> attach<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.860> wire<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.220> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
is now to attach the wire to the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.430 
is now to attach the wire to the
appropriate<00:03:45.700> ports<00:03:45.970> here<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.480> again<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.290> is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
appropriate ports here so again this is

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.690 
appropriate ports here so again this is
the<00:03:47.620> important<00:03:48.040> part<00:03:48.160> where<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.430> really<00:03:48.519> got

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
the important part where you really got

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.539 
the important part where you really got
to<00:03:48.760> pay<00:03:48.940> attention<00:03:49.290> right<00:03:50.290> here<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.160> shows<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
to pay attention right here it shows the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.030 
to pay attention right here it shows the
mat<00:03:51.760> for<00:03:52.090> where<00:03:52.299> each<00:03:52.480> wire<00:03:52.720> should<00:03:53.049> go<00:03:53.230> and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
mat for where each wire should go and

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.039 
mat for where each wire should go and
because<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.430> only<00:03:54.579> had<00:03:54.790> two<00:03:55.000> wires<00:03:55.239> like<00:03:55.930> we

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
because I only had two wires like we

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.250 
because I only had two wires like we
said<00:03:56.230> before<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.860> white<00:03:57.250> wire<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.519> W<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.420> the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
said before the white wire is W and the

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.289 
said before the white wire is W and the
red<00:03:59.680> wire<00:03:59.829> is<00:04:00.040> R<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.760> looked<00:04:01.000> at<00:04:01.150> the

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
red wire is R and I looked at the

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.270 
red wire is R and I looked at the
installation<00:04:01.810> instructions<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.320> they<00:04:02.500> told

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
installation instructions and they told

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.000 
installation instructions and they told
me<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.670> put<00:04:04.360> just<00:04:04.570> a<00:04:04.720> regular<00:04:05.049> R<00:04:05.200> into<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.620> RH

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
me to put just a regular R into the RH

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.090 
me to put just a regular R into the RH
port<00:04:06.340> which<00:04:06.609> is<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.390> then<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.200> W<00:04:08.620> will

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
port which is this and then the W will

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.539 
port which is this and then the W will
go<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:10.000> W<00:04:10.359> port<00:04:10.630> down<00:04:11.170> here<00:04:11.530> already<00:04:12.130> the

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
go to the W port down here already the

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.039 
go to the W port down here already the
hardest<00:04:12.820> part<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.060> done<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.510> final<00:04:13.840> step

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
hardest part is done and the final step

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.229 
hardest part is done and the final step
is<00:04:14.260> just<00:04:14.290> attaching<00:04:15.070> your<00:04:15.190> digital<00:04:15.730> faceplate

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
is just attaching your digital faceplate

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.180 
is just attaching your digital faceplate
to<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.870> digital<00:04:17.169> backplate<00:04:17.769> that<00:04:17.950> we<00:04:18.010> just

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
to the digital backplate that we just

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.330 
to the digital backplate that we just
installed<00:04:18.750> I've<00:04:19.750> already<00:04:20.019> put<00:04:20.200> in<00:04:20.229> two<00:04:20.950> triple

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
installed I've already put in two triple

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.200 
installed I've already put in two triple
A<00:04:21.430> batteries

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
A batteries

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.270 
A batteries
to<00:04:22.479> power<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.750> thermostat<00:04:23.259> again<00:04:23.979> depending

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
to power the thermostat again depending

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.070 
to power the thermostat again depending
on<00:04:24.340> what<00:04:24.460> model<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:24.819> get<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.240> may<00:04:25.389> need<00:04:25.630> one

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
on what model you get you may need one

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.469 
on what model you get you may need one
delay<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.830> triple-a<00:04:27.280> whatever<00:04:27.970> but<00:04:28.210> you'll

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
delay to triple-a whatever but you'll

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.610 
delay to triple-a whatever but you'll
probably<00:04:28.600> need<00:04:28.900> at<00:04:29.020> least<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.470> couple

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
probably need at least a couple

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.980 
probably need at least a couple
batteries<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.280> run<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.330> digital<00:04:31.630> brains<00:04:31.840> of

batteries to run the digital brains of
the<00:04:32.050> operation<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.430> what<00:04:33.550> I'm<00:04:33.610> gonna<00:04:33.699> do<00:04:33.849> is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
the operation so what I'm gonna do is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.920 
the operation so what I'm gonna do is
just<00:04:34.240> start<00:04:34.840> at<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.930> top<00:04:35.099> hang<00:04:36.099> this<00:04:36.340> down

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
just start at the top hang this down

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.450 
just start at the top hang this down
click<00:04:37.930> it<00:04:38.080> on<00:04:38.199> and<00:04:38.530> then<00:04:38.889> tighten<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.370> screw

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
click it on and then tighten the screw
