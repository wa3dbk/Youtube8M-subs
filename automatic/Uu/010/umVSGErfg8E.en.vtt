00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.290 

my<00:00:17.330> vision<00:00:17.840> is<00:00:17.930> definitely<00:00:18.710> not<00:00:19.340> fully<00:00:20.000> formed

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
my vision is definitely not fully formed

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.700 
my vision is definitely not fully formed
I<00:00:20.750> think<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.349> whole<00:00:21.560> notion<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:23.210> being<00:00:24.199> you

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
I think the whole notion of being you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.460 
I think the whole notion of being you
know<00:00:24.770> being<00:00:25.130> an<00:00:25.520> artist<00:00:25.849> today<00:00:26.180> is<00:00:26.689> that<00:00:27.199> it<00:00:27.320> is

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
know being an artist today is that it is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.240 
know being an artist today is that it is
a<00:00:27.500> kind<00:00:27.949> of<00:00:28.070> discovery<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.180> that<00:00:29.410> one<00:00:30.410> takes

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
a kind of discovery and that one takes

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.610 
a kind of discovery and that one takes
on<00:00:31.809> different<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:32.960> related<00:00:33.370> sets<00:00:34.370> of<00:00:34.489> ideas

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
on different but related sets of ideas

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.880 
on different but related sets of ideas
one<00:00:36.620> of<00:00:36.739> them<00:00:36.860> here<00:00:37.160> of<00:00:37.280> course<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:37.809> color<00:00:38.890> you

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
one of them here of course is color you

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.200 
one of them here of course is color you
know<00:00:39.980> there's<00:00:40.190> much<00:00:40.430> color<00:00:40.730> in<00:00:40.910> there<00:00:41.059> showing

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
know there's much color in there showing

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.060 
know there's much color in there showing
that<00:00:41.330> oh<00:00:41.480> yeah<00:00:41.600> I've<00:00:41.750> always<00:00:41.960> worked<00:00:42.860> with

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
that oh yeah I've always worked with

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.850 
that oh yeah I've always worked with
with<00:00:43.370> color<00:00:43.699> in<00:00:43.879> different<00:00:43.910> ways<00:00:44.860> I'm

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
with color in different ways I'm

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.930 
with color in different ways I'm
interested<00:00:46.460> in<00:00:46.610> it

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
interested in it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.619 
interested in it
because<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.800> way<00:00:48.949> I've<00:00:49.160> come<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.239> to

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
because the way I've come to it is to

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.040 
because the way I've come to it is to
think<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.020> color<00:00:51.320> as<00:00:51.620> being<00:00:52.250> stuff<00:00:53.120> it's<00:00:53.840> not

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
think of color as being stuff it's not

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.790 
think of color as being stuff it's not
it's<00:00:54.980> not<00:00:55.129> just<00:00:55.190> surface<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.210> other<00:00:56.329> words

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
it's not just surface in other words

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.910 
it's not just surface in other words
it's<00:00:57.800> stuff<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.579> it's<00:00:58.730> it's<00:00:59.359> that<00:00:59.629> that<00:01:00.020> sort

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
it's stuff and it's it's that that sort

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.970 
it's stuff and it's it's that that sort
of<00:01:01.329> interplay<00:01:02.329> between<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.140> physicalness<00:01:03.859> of

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
of interplay between the physicalness of

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.450 
of interplay between the physicalness of
it<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:05.089> sense<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:05.630> actually<00:01:06.320> it's<00:01:07.250> rather

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
it and a sense that actually it's rather

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.340 
it and a sense that actually it's rather
losery<00:01:08.149> it's<00:01:08.450> rather<00:01:08.660> loose<00:01:09.080> if<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:12.110> know<00:01:12.200> we

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
losery it's rather loose if you know we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.620 
losery it's rather loose if you know we
think<00:01:12.530> we're<00:01:12.770> watching<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.190> this<00:01:13.729> big<00:01:14.000> block

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630

this<00:01:28.729> work<00:01:28.970> here<00:01:29.330> I've<00:01:29.750> given<00:01:29.959> it<00:01:30.050> a<00:01:30.140> Sanskrit

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
this work here I've given it a Sanskrit

this work here I've given it a Sanskrit

passage through these galleries of this
big<00:01:44.330> block<00:01:44.810> that's<00:01:45.110> bigger<00:01:45.380> than<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.679> doors

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
as it moves through it's sort of sculpts

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.210 
as it moves through it's sort of sculpts
itself<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.700> pushes<00:01:53.149> itself<00:01:53.739> through<00:01:54.739> the

galleries giving it the form that's that

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
implications of that are that it's

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.490 
implications of that are that it's
making<00:02:05.300> itself<00:02:05.629> it's<00:02:05.869> doing<00:02:06.140> its<00:02:06.259> own<00:02:06.410> thing

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
of course I am involved but I chose the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.699 
of course I am involved but I chose the

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
red I made I made the process but then

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.460 
red I made I made the process but then
I'll<00:02:15.830> try<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.190> leave<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.430> alone<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.879> process

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
I'll try and leave it alone the process

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.619 
I'll try and leave it alone the process
reveals<00:02:18.470> all<00:02:19.400> that's<00:02:19.879> needed<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.330> be<00:02:20.450> rebuilt

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
reveals all that's needed to be rebuilt

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.020 
reveals all that's needed to be rebuilt
in<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.200> way<00:02:21.379> I<00:02:21.620> feel<00:02:22.069> I'm<00:02:22.250> not<00:02:22.400> trying<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.790> say

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
in a way I feel I'm not trying to say

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.530 
in a way I feel I'm not trying to say
something<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.290> let<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.739> occur

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
something but to let it occur

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.660 
something but to let it occur
and<00:02:26.290> that's<00:02:26.500> true<00:02:26.769> of<00:02:26.799> most<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.340> works<00:02:27.489> on

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and that's true of most of the works on

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.610 
and that's true of most of the works on
the<00:02:27.700> show<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.970> know<00:02:31.000> there's<00:02:31.269> no<00:02:31.480> there's<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
the show you know there's no there's you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.589 
the show you know there's no there's you
know<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.799> mean<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.310> make<00:02:33.519> work<00:02:33.730> for<00:02:33.849> myself<00:02:34.269> and

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
know I mean I make work for myself and

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.679 
know I mean I make work for myself and
to<00:02:35.110> try<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.379> pursue<00:02:35.769> an<00:02:35.920> idea<00:02:38.939> perhaps<00:02:39.939> when

to try and pursue an idea perhaps when

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.350 
to try and pursue an idea perhaps when
one's<00:02:40.989> got<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> lot<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.739> say<00:02:42.010> there's<00:02:42.700> less<00:02:43.030> room

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
one's got a lot to say there's less room

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.539 
one's got a lot to say there's less room
for<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.750> viewer<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.349> what<00:02:44.650> I'm<00:02:44.799> concerned<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
for the viewer and what I'm concerned to

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.580 
for the viewer and what I'm concerned to
do<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.329> find<00:02:46.750> saying<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.110> I've<00:02:47.200> got

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
do is to find saying that I've got

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.500 
do is to find saying that I've got
nothing<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.980> say<00:02:48.159> nothing<00:02:48.819> much<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.150> say

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
nothing to say nothing much to say

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.569 
nothing to say nothing much to say
anyway<00:02:49.900> or<00:02:50.319> as<00:02:50.409> little<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.829> say<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.129> possible

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
anyway or as little to say as possible

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.020 
anyway or as little to say as possible
and<00:02:51.790> let<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.299> viewer<00:02:53.040> find<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.340> space<00:02:54.730> in

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
and let the viewer find that space in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.830 
and let the viewer find that space in
themselves<00:02:56.909> maybe<00:02:57.909> that's<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.299> process<00:02:58.569> that's

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
themselves maybe that's a process that's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.500 
themselves maybe that's a process that's
that's<00:02:59.440> that's<00:02:59.909> has<00:03:00.909> something<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.239> do<00:03:01.480> with

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
that's that's has something to do with

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.869 
that's that's has something to do with
with<00:03:01.989> with<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.500> with<00:03:02.859> engagement<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:05.879> don't

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
with with with with engagement I don't

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.539 
with with with with engagement I don't
believe<00:03:07.299> in<00:03:07.680> trying<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:11.349> idea<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.280> one

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
believe in trying in the idea that one

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.789 
believe in trying in the idea that one
as<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.239> say<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.510> know<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.780> don't<00:03:14.230> feel<00:03:14.409> I<00:03:14.650> have

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
as I say you know I don't feel I have

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.089 
as I say you know I don't feel I have
have<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:16.209> message<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.019> give<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.519> thing<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.730> say<00:03:19.019> so

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
have a message to give a thing to say so

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.470 
have a message to give a thing to say so
therefore<00:03:21.099> I'm<00:03:21.459> not<00:03:21.489> trying<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.000> illustrate<00:03:22.150> a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
therefore I'm not trying to illustrate a

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.830 
therefore I'm not trying to illustrate a
point<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:23.730> mean<00:03:24.730> one<00:03:24.879> makes<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.359> work<00:03:25.569> one

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
point I mean one makes the work one

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.390 
point I mean one makes the work one
makes<00:03:26.139> and<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.549> it's<00:03:27.760> very<00:03:29.400> what

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
makes and it's and it's very what

makes and it's and it's very what
happens<00:03:30.699> to<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.180> know<00:03:31.299> has<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.599> if<00:03:31.840> it's

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
happens to it you know has to if it's

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.490 
happens to it you know has to if it's
any<00:03:32.109> good<00:03:32.169> it'll<00:03:32.470> find<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.919> life<00:03:33.609> for<00:03:33.849> itself<00:03:34.500> it

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
any good it'll find a life for itself it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.140 
any good it'll find a life for itself it
has<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.739> stand<00:03:36.010> up<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.340> itself<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.879> can't
