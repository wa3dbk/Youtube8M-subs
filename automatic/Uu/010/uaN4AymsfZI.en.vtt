00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
have we've been very vocal about this I

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.949 
have we've been very vocal about this I
think<00:02:55.340> people<00:02:55.609> get<00:02:55.730> into<00:02:55.970> Tegan<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.420> Sara<00:02:56.599> for

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
think people get into Tegan and Sara for

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.960 
think people get into Tegan and Sara for
a<00:02:57.170> lot<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.799> different<00:02:58.099> reasons<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.670> think

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
a lot of different reasons but I think

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.699 
a lot of different reasons but I think
that<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.390> majority<00:02:59.780> of<00:03:00.049> people<00:03:00.290> get<00:03:00.440> into

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
that the majority of people get into

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.500 
that the majority of people get into
teens<00:03:01.069> are<00:03:01.340> kind<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.640> get<00:03:01.760> into<00:03:01.879> the<00:03:02.060> culture

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
teens are kind of get into the culture

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.690 
teens are kind of get into the culture
around<00:03:02.900> Tegan<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.829> Sara<00:03:03.980> -<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.250> think<00:03:04.579> we're

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
around Tegan and Sara - I think we're

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.220 
around Tegan and Sara - I think we're
more<00:03:04.849> than<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.359> music<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:05.930> put<00:03:06.109> out

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
more than just the music that we put out

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.110 
more than just the music that we put out
and<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.890> think<00:03:07.129> that<00:03:07.280> people<00:03:07.519> want<00:03:07.940> to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
and I think that people want to

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.650 
and I think that people want to
permanently<00:03:08.620> put<00:03:09.620> lyrics<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.700> pieces<00:03:11.569> of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
permanently put lyrics and and pieces of

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.330 
permanently put lyrics and and pieces of
our<00:03:11.720> artwork<00:03:11.989> on<00:03:12.230> their<00:03:12.380> bodies<00:03:12.650> for<00:03:12.889> probably

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
our artwork on their bodies for probably

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.830 
our artwork on their bodies for probably
a<00:03:13.459> really<00:03:13.609> good<00:03:13.880> reason<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.329> think<00:03:14.389> a<00:03:14.569> lot<00:03:14.720> of

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
a really good reason I think a lot of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.000 
a really good reason I think a lot of
people<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.170> gets<00:03:15.290> them<00:03:15.560> through<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.799> lot<00:03:15.950> of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
people it gets them through a lot of

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.379 
people it gets them through a lot of
things<00:03:16.250> I'm<00:03:16.370> projecting<00:03:16.549> on<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.359> don't

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
things I'm projecting on you and I don't

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.940 
things I'm projecting on you and I don't
mean<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.750> but<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.260> think<00:03:18.530> there's<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.769> lot<00:03:18.920> of

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
mean to but I think there's a lot of

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.190 
mean to but I think there's a lot of
remaining<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:19.609> people<00:03:19.910> in<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.720> music<00:03:21.049> and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
remaining for people in the music and

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.539 
remaining for people in the music and
they<00:03:21.290> feel<00:03:21.560> like<00:03:21.590> they<00:03:21.829> need<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.130> do<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.400> and

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
they feel like they need to do that and

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.250 
they feel like they need to do that and
I<00:03:22.639> understand<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.239> because<00:03:23.329> I've<00:03:23.510> multiple

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
I understand that because I've multiple

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.289 
I understand that because I've multiple
times<00:03:24.440> gotten<00:03:24.769> tattoos<00:03:24.919> with<00:03:25.489> musical<00:03:25.940> notes

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
times gotten tattoos with musical notes

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.970
