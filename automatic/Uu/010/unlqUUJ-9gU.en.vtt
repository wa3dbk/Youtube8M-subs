refill<00:00:17.760> syringes<00:00:18.150> are<00:00:18.300> good<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.859> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
refill syringes are good for this the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.950 
refill syringes are good for this the
big<00:00:20.039> ones<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.430> not<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.939> great<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.600> if

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
big ones are not so great because if

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.250 
big ones are not so great because if
there's<00:00:22.170> any<00:00:22.289> pressure<00:00:22.529> left<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:24.140> can<00:00:25.140> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
there's any pressure left in the can of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.099 
there's any pressure left in the can of
aerosol<00:00:25.680> then<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.910> will<00:00:27.029> blow<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.480> plunger

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
aerosol then it will blow this plunger

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
aerosol then it will blow this plunger
out<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.470> great<00:00:28.710> force<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> pneumatic

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
out with great force like a pneumatic

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.830

to actually refill it what we're going
to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.630> is<00:00:36.630> we're<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> press<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
to do is we're going to press down this

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.549 
to do is we're going to press down this
plunger<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.340> open<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> valve<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.379> then<00:00:40.379> we're

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
plunger to open the valve and then we're

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.930 
plunger to open the valve and then we're
going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> basically<00:00:40.920> squirting<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
going to basically squirting the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
going to basically squirting the
essential<00:00:42.360> oils<00:00:42.629> now<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.440> is

and<00:00:45.480> bindus<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.410> otherwise<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.890> will

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and bindus because otherwise it will

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.709 
and bindus because otherwise it will
blow<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> plunger<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.390> will<00:00:48.539> cover

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
blow the plunger out and it will cover

better<00:01:57.530> ear<00:01:57.830> at<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.010> top<00:01:58.280> because<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.090> wanted

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
better ear at the top because I wanted

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.540 
better ear at the top because I wanted
to<00:01:59.600> push<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.900> oil<00:02:00.080> down<00:02:00.320> completely<00:02:00.800> down<00:02:01.310> the

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
to push the oil down completely down the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.020 
to push the oil down completely down the
dip<00:02:01.850> tube<00:02:02.120> in<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.660> can<00:02:03.729> now<00:02:04.729> I'm<00:02:04.790> going<00:02:04.970> to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
dip tube in the can now I'm going to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.919 
dip tube in the can now I'm going to
very<00:02:05.180> carefully<00:02:05.540> put<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.840> plunger<00:02:06.260> in<00:02:06.380> and

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
very carefully put this plunger in and

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.510 
very carefully put this plunger in and
sometimes<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.440> cans<00:02:09.679> can<00:02:09.950> slightly<00:02:10.310> be

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
sometimes the cans can slightly be

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.520 
sometimes the cans can slightly be
pressurizer<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.540> trace<00:02:11.780> butane<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.410> be

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
pressurizer that in a trace butane so be

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.080 
pressurizer that in a trace butane so be
very<00:02:12.680> careful<00:02:12.890> make<00:02:13.280> sure<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.610> keep<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:13.910> in

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
very careful make sure you keep this in

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.180 
very careful make sure you keep this in
tightly<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:15.290> push<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.740> whole<00:02:15.920> thing

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
tightly and then push the whole thing

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.230 
tightly and then push the whole thing
down<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:17.470> squirt<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.650> oil<00:02:18.940> into<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:19.970> can

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
down and squirt the oil into the can

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.970 
down and squirt the oil into the can
plus<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.630> tiny<00:02:21.110> little<00:02:21.290> bit<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.530> air<00:02:21.709> just<00:02:21.920> to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
plus a tiny little bit of air just to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.620 
plus a tiny little bit of air just to
make<00:02:22.100> sure<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.430> gone<00:02:22.550> down<00:02:22.850> completely<00:02:23.390> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
make sure it's gone down completely and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.800 
make sure it's gone down completely and
then<00:02:24.400> holding<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.520> syringe<00:02:25.820> down<00:02:26.060> release

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
then holding the syringe down release

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.520 
then holding the syringe down release
the<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:27.530> no<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.890> can<00:02:28.100> has<00:02:28.370> got<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.670> oil<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.060> it

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
the can no the can has got the oil in it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.610 
the can no the can has got the oil in it
to<00:02:30.530> repressurize<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:32.260> we're<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.470> use

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
to repressurize it we're going to use

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.540 
to repressurize it we're going to use
butane<00:02:34.070> now<00:02:34.459> buting<00:02:35.000> later<00:02:35.300> refill<00:02:35.870> liquid<00:02:36.230> is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
butane now buting later refill liquid is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.610 
butane now buting later refill liquid is
quite<00:02:37.550> useful<00:02:38.060> because<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:39.200> very<00:02:39.410> good

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
quite useful because it's a very good

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.690 
quite useful because it's a very good
solvent<00:02:40.040> for<00:02:40.130> oils<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.440> it's<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:43.459> what's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
solvent for oils and it's it's what's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.009 
solvent for oils and it's it's what's
commonly<00:02:44.090> used<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.420> new<00:02:44.540> resolves<00:02:44.930> to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
commonly used the new resolves to

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.500 
commonly used the new resolves to
pressurize<00:02:45.440> them<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:46.130> basically<00:02:47.000> forms<00:02:47.360> an

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
pressurize them it basically forms an

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.440 
pressurize them it basically forms an
emulsion<00:02:47.780> with<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:49.100> oils<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.730> then<00:02:49.940> when<00:02:50.269> you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
emulsion with the oils and then when you

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.880 
emulsion with the oils and then when you
spray<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.900> can<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.290> comes<00:02:51.470> out<00:02:51.620> as<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.800> vapour

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
spray the can it comes out as a vapour

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.930 
spray the can it comes out as a vapour
of<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:53.530> quickly<00:02:54.530> evaporating<00:02:55.280> gas<00:02:55.459> carrying

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
of the quickly evaporating gas carrying

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.729 
of the quickly evaporating gas carrying
a<00:02:56.000> fine<00:02:56.269> dispersion<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> oil<00:02:57.350> particles

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
a fine dispersion of the oil particles

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.560 
a fine dispersion of the oil particles
so<00:02:58.190> let's<00:02:58.970> put<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.239> one<00:02:59.360> very<00:02:59.690> carefully<00:02:59.900> and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
so let's put that one very carefully and

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.600 
so let's put that one very carefully and
give<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.780> shake<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.200> warm<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.470> up<00:03:03.610> press

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
give this a shake to warm it up press

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.600 
give this a shake to warm it up press
down<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.440> hold<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.590> down<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.489> can

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
down and hold it down and you can

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.780 
down and hold it down and you can
actually<00:03:08.440> hear<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.830> pressurizing<00:03:10.670> with

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
actually hear the can pressurizing with

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.970 
actually hear the can pressurizing with
the<00:03:10.910> butane

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.030 

order<00:03:16.980> down<00:03:17.160> pretty<00:03:17.400> well

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.250 

some<00:03:21.640> butane<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.150> escaping<00:03:22.659> this<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.049> best

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
some butane is escaping this is best

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.280 
some butane is escaping this is best
done<00:03:23.379> outdoors

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.640 

okay<00:03:31.659> and<00:03:32.659> I'll<00:03:32.780> give<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:32.989> shake<00:03:33.409> when<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
okay and I'll give that shake when you

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.069 
okay and I'll give that shake when you
shake<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.159> distributes<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.879> oil<00:03:35.720> into<00:03:36.049> the

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
shake it it distributes the oil into the

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.940 
shake it it distributes the oil into the
butane<00:03:37.239> should<00:03:38.239> mention<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.659> M<00:03:38.959> goodness

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
butane should mention that M goodness

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.500 
butane should mention that M goodness
Lewis<00:03:40.159> what<00:03:40.310> chemicals<00:03:40.819> that<00:03:41.030> they<00:03:41.090> use<00:03:41.299> in

Lewis what chemicals that they use in

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.449 
Lewis what chemicals that they use in
their<00:03:41.689> room<00:03:42.170> fragrances<00:03:42.769> then<00:03:42.980> normal<00:03:43.310> ones

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
their room fragrances then normal ones

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.399 
their room fragrances then normal ones
are<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.510> powerful<00:03:44.840> because<00:03:45.230> they're

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
are really powerful because they're

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.740 
are really powerful because they're
completely<00:03:45.739> synthetic<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:46.879> can<00:03:47.030> be<00:03:47.180> quite

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
completely synthetic and it can be quite

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.660 
completely synthetic and it can be quite
caustic<00:03:48.500> in<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> with<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.129> think<00:03:49.189> the<00:03:49.430> court

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
caustic in a with so I think the court

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.099 
caustic in a with so I think the court
then<00:03:49.819> said<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.090> these<00:03:50.299> cans<00:03:50.569> but<00:03:50.840> there's<00:03:50.989> no

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
then said to these cans but there's no

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.020 
then said to these cans but there's no
guarantee<00:03:51.650> there's<00:03:52.489> not<00:03:52.609> going<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.760> be<00:03:52.819> some

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
guarantee there's not going to be some

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.399 
guarantee there's not going to be some
sort<00:03:53.269> of<00:03:53.299> reaction<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:53.930> oil<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:54.319> the

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
sort of reaction with the oil and the

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.460 
sort of reaction with the oil and the
can<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:54.859> this<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.159> strictly<00:03:55.579> ass<00:03:55.849> of

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
can so this is strictly ass of

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.380 
can so this is strictly ass of
experimental<00:03:57.470> thing<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.799> do

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
experimental thing to do

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.379 
experimental thing to do
so<00:04:00.459> sometimes<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.609> helps<00:04:01.639> to<00:04:01.909> shake<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.329> and

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
so sometimes it helps to shake it and

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.729 
so sometimes it helps to shake it and
then<00:04:02.450> we<00:04:02.659> pressurize<00:04:03.079> it<00:04:03.290> again<00:04:03.470> but<00:04:03.620> I'm<00:04:03.680> not

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
then we pressurize it again but I'm not

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.199
