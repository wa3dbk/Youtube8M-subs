don't<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.439> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
don't want to but then it's kind of just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.370 
don't want to but then it's kind of just
a<00:01:22.920> box<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.180> headphones<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.020> anyways

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
a box that you put headphones in anyways

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
a box that you put headphones in anyways
so<00:01:25.830> um<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.310> am<00:01:26.670> using<00:01:26.909> Michael's<00:01:27.840> spray<00:01:28.049> paint

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
so um I am using Michael's spray paint

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.160 
so um I am using Michael's spray paint
right<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.759> red<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.540> spray<00:01:30.930> paint

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
I would definitely recommend because it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.819 
I would definitely recommend because it
is<00:01:32.729> easier<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.689> than<00:01:33.869> paint<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.740> are

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
