this is a standard room you've got two
single<00:01:40.229> beds<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> double

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
single beds I think if it was a double

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.340 
single beds I think if it was a double
room<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.240> couple<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.720> push<00:01:42.930> those<00:01:43.140> two<00:01:43.259> your

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
room a couple they push those two your

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.130 
room a couple they push those two your
best<00:01:43.500> together<00:01:43.799> possibly<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.750> sleep

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
best together possibly so you can sleep

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.300 
best together possibly so you can sleep
together<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> couple

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
together as a couple

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
together as a couple
