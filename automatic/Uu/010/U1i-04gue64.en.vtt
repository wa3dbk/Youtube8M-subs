00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
into into the sinus wall and then we get

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.350 
into into the sinus wall and then we get
the<00:04:41.130> first<00:04:41.310> chance<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.730> was<00:04:41.850> some<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.150> so

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
the first chance it was some of that so

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.240 
the first chance it was some of that so
I<00:04:42.390> wanted<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.990> again<00:04:43.260> try<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.560> similar<00:04:43.860> shut<00:04:44.130> to

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
I wanted to again try a similar shut to

the<00:04:44.280> one<00:04:44.490> with<00:04:44.610> Muriel<00:04:44.820> but<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.600> believe<00:04:46.170> was

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
the one with Muriel but I believe was

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.110 
the one with Muriel but I believe was
knowing<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:46.770> he<00:04:47.010> would<00:04:47.190> has<00:04:47.400> saved<00:04:47.670> that<00:04:47.910> one

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
knowing that he would has saved that one

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.270 
knowing that he would has saved that one
but<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.170> was<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> game<00:04:49.650> with<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:49.890> bunch<00:04:50.160> of

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
but it was a game with a bunch of

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.670 
but it was a game with a bunch of
chances<00:04:50.730> here<00:04:50.880> it's<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.120> hook<00:04:51.390> a<00:04:51.570> finding<00:04:52.440> part

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
chances here it's a hook a finding part

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.470 
chances here it's a hook a finding part
two<00:04:52.830> will<00:04:53.010> go<00:04:53.220> past<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.640> defender<00:04:54.090> with<00:04:54.390> her

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
shot and that was pretty much all at

halftime I had most of the chances as
you<00:05:02.850> can<00:05:02.970> see<00:05:03.120> there<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.600> I<00:05:03.720> was<00:05:03.840> leading<00:05:04.050> one

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
you can see there and I was leading one

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.720 
you can see there and I was leading one
nil<00:05:04.500> but<00:05:04.650> into<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.010> second<00:05:05.280> half<00:05:05.370> he<00:05:05.490> plays<00:05:05.700> a

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
nil but into the second half he plays a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.120 
nil but into the second half he plays a
pass<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.930> was<00:05:07.080> kind<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.350> running<00:05:07.950> with

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
pass and I was kind of running with

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.740 
pass and I was kind of running with
another<00:05:08.400> defender<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.330> switched<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.720> that

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
another defender so it switched to that

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.480 
another defender so it switched to that
offend<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.200> turned<00:05:10.500> around<00:05:10.680> right<00:05:11.100> into<00:05:11.370> his

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
offend I turned around right into his

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.670 
offend I turned around right into his
path<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.030> he<00:05:12.180> would<00:05:12.390> make<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.930> 1-1<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:13.590> that

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
path and he would make it 1-1 so that

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.780 
path and he would make it 1-1 so that
was<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.890> course<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.160> bit<00:05:14.280> of<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.400> frustrating

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790
