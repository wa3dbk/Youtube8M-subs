00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the easiest way to do this I think is to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.270 
the easiest way to do this I think is to
make<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.819> white<00:02:33.330> wool<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.950> I'm<00:02:35.160> just

make this all white wool so I'm just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.160 
make this all white wool so I'm just
gonna<00:02:35.370> roll<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.790> at<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.060> end<00:02:36.239> not<00:02:36.989> really

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
gonna roll that at that end not really
