00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
shot so and then you see ground shock

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
shot so and then you see ground shock
here<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> blue<00:00:56.550> car<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.660> one

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
spherical area of damage so if you have

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
spherical area of damage so if you have
bridges<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.090> forth<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.780> above<00:01:07.170> each

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you're on a different level then ground

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.440 
you're on a different level then ground
shock<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> very<00:01:16.259> good<00:01:16.530> car<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.979> use<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.270> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
shock is a very good car to use so this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
shock is a very good car to use so this
is<00:01:18.540> thermo<00:01:18.900> his<00:01:19.259> basic<00:01:19.860> weapon<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210 
is thermo his basic weapon is a
flamethrower<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.930> he<00:01:22.200> had<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.619> flamethrower<00:01:22.890> as

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
flamethrower so he had a flamethrower as

a weapon which has sort of medium range
and<00:01:25.350> medium<00:01:25.890> spread<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> pretty<00:01:27.180> good

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
weapon to start out with so it's a it's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550

a<00:01:29.369> good<00:01:29.520> car<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.030> start<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
a good car to start out with so this is

a good car to start out with so this is
skull<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.610> actually<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> cars

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
skull this is actually one of the cars

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.530 
skull this is actually one of the cars
in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.079> base<00:01:34.259> set<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.579> has<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> very<00:01:36.180> narrow

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
in the base set and it has a very narrow

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
in the base set and it has a very narrow
really<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.799> long<00:01:38.100> range<00:01:38.460> weapon<00:01:39.030> called

really really long range weapon called
the<00:01:39.509> plasma<00:01:39.750> cannon<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.979> means<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the plasma cannon so what that means is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670 
the plasma cannon so what that means is
you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.549> shoot<00:01:42.000> across<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.840> large<00:01:43.229> tracks

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you can shoot across really large tracks

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
you can shoot across really large tracks
really<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.939> little<00:01:45.180> bit<00:01:45.299> more

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
really well it's a little bit more

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.060 
really well it's a little bit more
difficult<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.560> you've<00:01:46.829> got<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
difficult to use because you've got to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.399 
difficult to use because you've got to
be<00:01:47.100> rough<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.299> line<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.689> another<00:01:49.140> car

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
be rough right in line with another car
but<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> lot<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.000> damage<00:01:51.240> over

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
but you can do a lot of damage over

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.990 
but you can do a lot of damage over
really<00:01:52.020> long<00:01:52.170> distances<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.759> nuke

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
really long distances so this is nuke

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
really long distances so this is nuke
this<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> expansion<00:01:55.350> cars<00:01:55.740> he<00:01:56.040> has

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
this is one of the expansion cars he has

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.850 
this is one of the expansion cars he has
a<00:01:56.280> weapon<00:01:57.000> called<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.420> decimator<00:01:57.990> which<00:01:58.590> has

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
a weapon called a decimator which has

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
a weapon called a decimator which has
sort<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> wide<00:01:59.549> spread<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.240> free<00:02:00.719> early

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
sort of a wide spread but free early

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.289 
sort of a wide spread but free early
short<00:02:01.680> range<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.460> somebody's<00:02:02.850> far<00:02:03.090> away

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
short range so if somebody's far away

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.179 
short range so if somebody's far away
you<00:02:03.780> can't<00:02:04.020> shoot<00:02:04.290> them<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:04.770> somebody's

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
you can't shoot them but if somebody's

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.280 
you can't shoot them but if somebody's
really<00:02:05.399> close<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.329> much<00:02:06.570> much<00:02:06.810> easier<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
really close it's much much easier to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.960 
really close it's much much easier to
get<00:02:07.590> them<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.039> sort<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.399> shotgun

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
get them so it's sort of like a shotgun

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.839 
get them so it's sort of like a shotgun
it's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.270> pretty<00:02:09.450> good<00:02:09.629> car<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> start<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:10.410> with

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
it's a pretty good car to start out with

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.229 
it's a pretty good car to start out with
so<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.930> ground<00:02:12.170> chalk<00:02:12.549> also<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.579> car<00:02:13.999> in

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
so this is ground chalk also a car in

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.750 
so this is ground chalk also a car in
the<00:02:14.719> base<00:02:14.900> set<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.469> ground<00:02:16.249> chalk<00:02:16.489> has<00:02:16.700> a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the base set and ground chalk has a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.209 
the base set and ground chalk has a
special<00:02:17.359> item<00:02:17.719> a<00:02:17.900> special<00:02:18.560> weapon<00:02:18.680> called<00:02:19.069> an

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
special item a special weapon called an

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.039 
special item a special weapon called an
electro<00:02:19.700> pulse<00:02:19.969> and<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.659> doesn't<00:02:20.930> really

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
electro pulse and it doesn't really

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.069 
electro pulse and it doesn't really
shoot<00:02:21.439> but<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:22.010> creates<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.519> sort<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:22.999> a<00:02:23.120> an<00:02:23.329> area

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
shoot but it creates a sort of a an area

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.679 
shoot but it creates a sort of a an area
of<00:02:24.319> damage<00:02:24.709> which<00:02:25.159> looks<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.670> sphere<00:02:26.209> so

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
of damage which looks like a sphere so

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.289 
of damage which looks like a sphere so
if<00:02:26.870> anybody<00:02:27.409> is<00:02:27.500> inside<00:02:28.189> that<00:02:28.430> radius<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:29.150> that

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
if anybody is inside that radius of that

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.360 
if anybody is inside that radius of that
sphere<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.379> do<00:02:30.469> damage<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:31.010> them<00:02:31.159> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
sphere you can do damage to them and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.339 
sphere you can do damage to them and
that<00:02:31.519> even<00:02:31.909> works<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.329> they're<00:02:32.540> above<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.170> or

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
that even works if they're above you or

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.140 
that even works if they're above you or
below<00:02:33.379> you<00:02:33.739> on<00:02:34.099> a<00:02:34.129> different<00:02:34.549> level<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
below you on a different level of the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.059 
below you on a different level of the
track<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.079> is<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> really<00:02:36.680> really<00:02:36.799> good

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
track so this is a really really good

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.890 
track so this is a really really good
car<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.519> use<00:02:37.700> if<00:02:37.879> you<00:02:38.000> build<00:02:38.299> tracks<00:02:38.629> with

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
car to use if you build tracks with

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.839 
car to use if you build tracks with
multiple<00:02:39.439> levels<00:02:39.799> where<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.400> want<00:02:40.669> to

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
multiple levels where you want to

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.149 
multiple levels where you want to
disable<00:02:41.780> them<00:02:42.109> when<00:02:42.319> they<00:02:42.469> are<00:02:42.499> even<00:02:42.919> on<00:02:43.099> a

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
disable them when they are even on a

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.679 
disable them when they are even on a
different<00:02:43.489> level<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.030> track<00:02:44.239> as<00:02:44.389> you<00:02:44.540> are

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
different level of the track as you are

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.869 
different level of the track as you are
right<00:02:44.900> now<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.889> Big<00:02:46.129> Bang<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.579> is<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
right now this is Big Bang this is the

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.939 
right now this is Big Bang this is the
biggest<00:02:47.329> car<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:47.719> have<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.439> pack<00:02:48.650> it's

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:48.949 
biggest car we have in the pack it's

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.709 
biggest car we have in the pack it's
much<00:02:49.250> heavier<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.819> also<00:02:50.060> much<00:02:50.269> bigger<00:02:50.510> than

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
much heavier and also much bigger than

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.649 
much heavier and also much bigger than
the<00:02:50.840> other<00:02:50.989> cars<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.560> not<00:02:52.099> as<00:02:52.280> fast<00:02:52.609> but<00:02:53.389> it

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
the other cars it's not as fast but it

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.619 
the other cars it's not as fast but it
is<00:02:54.189> very<00:02:55.189> hard<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.549> shoot<00:02:55.819> off<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.180> tracks<00:02:56.449> it

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
is very hard to shoot off the tracks it

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.360 
is very hard to shoot off the tracks it
has<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.810> lot<00:02:57.139> of<00:02:57.260> armor<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.680> its<00:02:57.859> weapons<00:02:58.250> are

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
has a lot of armor and its weapons are

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.670 
has a lot of armor and its weapons are
very<00:02:58.549> powerful<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.719> it's<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.169> weapon<00:03:00.530> which

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
very powerful it's a it's a weapon which

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.030 
very powerful it's a it's a weapon which
can<00:03:00.889> do<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.280> lot<00:03:01.939> of<00:03:02.120> damage<00:03:02.599> on<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.409> medium

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
can do a lot of damage on a on a medium

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.439 
can do a lot of damage on a on a medium
distance<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.819> doesn't<00:03:05.090> really<00:03:05.180> matter

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:05.449 
distance and it doesn't really matter

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.240 
distance and it doesn't really matter
where<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.019> cars<00:03:06.260> are<00:03:06.409> located<00:03:06.859> around<00:03:06.949> you

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
where the cars are located around you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.610 
where the cars are located around you
it's<00:03:07.489> just<00:03:07.790> doing<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.299> huge<00:03:08.870> amount<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.290> damage

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
it's just doing a huge amount of damage

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.289 
it's just doing a huge amount of damage
the<00:03:09.859> disadvantage<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.699> car<00:03:10.939> is<00:03:11.120> that

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
the disadvantage of this car is that

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.420 
the disadvantage of this car is that
it's<00:03:11.840> gonna<00:03:12.079> take<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.739> lot<00:03:13.010> longer<00:03:13.250> to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
it's gonna take it a lot longer to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.969 
it's gonna take it a lot longer to
accelerate<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.329> decelerate<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.620> it's

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:15.979 
accelerate and to decelerate but it's

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.159 
accelerate and to decelerate but it's
actually<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.370> pretty<00:03:16.549> good<00:03:16.759> car<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.180> use<00:03:17.389> in<00:03:17.599> a

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
actually a pretty good car to use in a

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.349 
actually a pretty good car to use in a
race<00:03:18.439> as<00:03:18.680> well<00:03:18.829> because<00:03:19.459> once<00:03:19.759> you<00:03:19.879> get<00:03:20.030> up<00:03:20.180> to

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
race as well because once you get up to

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.119 
race as well because once you get up to
that<00:03:20.479> top<00:03:20.750> speed<00:03:21.079> then<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.439> really<00:03:21.620> hard<00:03:21.949> to

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
that top speed then it's really hard to

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.300 
that top speed then it's really hard to
