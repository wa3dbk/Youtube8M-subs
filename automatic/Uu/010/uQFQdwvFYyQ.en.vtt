00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
modes there is a little bit kind of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.670 
modes there is a little bit kind of
quick<00:01:10.460> but<00:01:10.909> that<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:11.240> can<00:01:11.390> choose<00:01:11.539> from<00:01:11.780> at

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
quick but that you can choose from at

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.260 
quick but that you can choose from at
the<00:01:12.770> beginning<00:01:12.890> here<00:01:13.310> you'll<00:01:13.789> see<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.090> it's

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the beginning here you'll see that it's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.570 
the beginning here you'll see that it's
basically<00:01:14.690> it's<00:01:15.170> like<00:01:15.289> a<00:01:15.350> Tetris<00:01:15.619> ish<00:01:16.009> puzzle

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
basically it's like a Tetris ish puzzle

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.550 
basically it's like a Tetris ish puzzle
game<00:01:16.759> but<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.539> has<00:01:17.570> some<00:01:17.810> interesting<00:01:17.960> parts

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
game but it has some interesting parts

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.680 
game but it has some interesting parts
to<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.159> those<00:01:19.819> being<00:01:20.179> that<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.509> can

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
to it and those being that you can

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.779 
to it and those being that you can
actually<00:01:20.840> rotate<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.500> box<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.190> every<00:01:22.640> time

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
actually rotate the box and every time

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.430 
actually rotate the box and every time
you<00:01:22.909> rotate<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.600> characters<00:01:24.080> change

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
you rotate it the characters change

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.710 
you rotate it the characters change
position<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.360> it's<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.450> really<00:01:26.600> interesting

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
position so it's a really interesting

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.190 
position so it's a really interesting
concept<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:28.850> can<00:01:29.030> get<00:01:29.149> quite<00:01:29.390> challenging

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
concept and it can get quite challenging

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.330 
concept and it can get quite challenging
quite<00:01:30.800> quickly<00:01:35.289> so<00:01:36.289> let's<00:01:36.770> give<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.130> shot

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
quite quickly so let's give it a shot

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.469 
quite quickly so let's give it a shot
here<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.549> can't<00:01:40.789> really<00:01:41.060> choose<00:01:41.299> the

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
here and you can't really choose the

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.410 
here and you can't really choose the
position<00:01:41.899> where<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.080> want<00:01:42.380> these<00:01:42.560> guys<00:01:42.619> to

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
position where you want these guys to

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.930 
position where you want these guys to
you<00:01:44.420> know<00:01:44.679> fall<00:01:45.679> once<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.159> start<00:01:46.459> doing<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
you know fall once you start doing the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:55.660 
you know fall once you start doing the
turning<00:01:51.520> there<00:01:52.520> we<00:01:52.670> go<00:01:54.250> you'll<00:01:55.250> notice<00:01:55.490> one

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
turning there we go you'll notice one

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.370 
turning there we go you'll notice one
thing<00:01:55.700> about<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.600> that<00:01:56.719> is<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.200> you

interesting<00:03:34.660> little<00:03:35.170> puzzle<00:03:35.470> game<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:36.000> mean

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
interesting little puzzle game I mean

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.790 
interesting little puzzle game I mean
how<00:03:37.120> many<00:03:37.180> games<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.570> got<00:03:37.840> where<00:03:38.200> it's<00:03:38.350> like<00:03:38.560> a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
how many games you got where it's like a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.580 
how many games you got where it's like a
bunch<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.190> wizards<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.970> like<00:03:43.110> like<00:03:44.110> strange

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
bunch of wizards and like like strange

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.620 
bunch of wizards and like like strange
characters<00:03:45.100> all<00:03:45.370> mixed<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.060> box<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.540> you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
characters all mixed in a box and you

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.020 
characters all mixed in a box and you
just<00:03:46.810> toss<00:03:47.020> them<00:03:47.140> around<00:03:50.700> I'm<00:03:51.700> starting<00:03:52.000> to

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
just toss them around I'm starting to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:09.150 
just toss them around I'm starting to
get<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.180> little<00:03:52.330> bit<00:03:52.480> quicker<00:04:07.770> so<00:04:08.770> if<00:04:08.830> we<00:04:08.950> can

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
get a little bit quicker so if we can

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.590 
get a little bit quicker so if we can
get<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:09.640> different<00:04:09.970> item<00:04:10.060> here<00:04:10.590> there<00:04:11.590> we<00:04:11.709> go

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
get a different item here there we go

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.790 
get a different item here there we go
like<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.690> said<00:04:13.870> all<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.080> little<00:04:14.290> items<00:04:14.530> they<00:04:14.680> do

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
like I said all the little items they do

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:24.830 
like I said all the little items they do
something<00:04:15.100> different<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:15.670> it's<00:04:15.820> kind<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.000> cool

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.850 

but<00:04:25.840> it's<00:04:25.990> ramped<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.350> up<00:04:26.440> there<00:04:26.680> in

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
but it's ramped it up there in

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.710 
but it's ramped it up there in
difficulty<00:04:27.550> right<00:04:27.730> now<00:04:27.880> it's<00:04:28.300> getting<00:04:28.450> much

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
difficulty right now it's getting much

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.909 
difficulty right now it's getting much
much<00:04:28.990> quicker

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.920 

and<00:04:34.919> like<00:04:35.849> I<00:04:35.940> said<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.210> difficult<00:04:36.599> part<00:04:36.810> is

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
and like I said the difficult part is

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.510 
and like I said the difficult part is
that<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.259> can't<00:04:37.500> change<00:04:37.740> around<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.310> order

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
that you can't change around the order

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.309 
that you can't change around the order
of<00:04:38.819> the<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:41.220> characters<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.819> are<00:04:41.879> falling

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
of the the characters that are falling

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.379 
of the the characters that are falling
you<00:04:43.319> can<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:43.650> change<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:43.979> box<00:04:44.340> that's<00:04:44.940> it

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
you can just change the box that's it

00:04:45.389 --> 00:05:22.080 
you can just change the box that's it
so<00:05:04.819> Stephanie<00:05:05.819> pretty<00:05:06.690> rough

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.730 

well<00:05:23.090> it's<00:05:23.270> nice<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.509> have<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:26.680> kind<00:05:27.680> of

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
well it's nice to have the kind of

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.499 
well it's nice to have the kind of
arrows<00:05:28.099> set<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.520> help<00:05:28.759> you<00:05:28.849> out<00:05:29.000> or<00:05:29.240> try<00:05:29.389> and

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509
