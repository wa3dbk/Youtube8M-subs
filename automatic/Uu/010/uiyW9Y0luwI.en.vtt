00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.670
 the axis of the easy excavation is 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.510
 but dance who is not happy he 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.460
 is convinced that it is necessary to reach 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.200
 at the bottom of the waterfall to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 I find quite what I know 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.770
 People need 15 kilos more with this 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.990
 dirt shit will not give 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.140
 it looks like surface earth 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.790
 This is not going to be in 15 grams I 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.270
 never processed a land similar to 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 the one who has gold is not just a loss of 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.600
 time 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.320
 this will be my last word is spoken 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.030
 and I will close I know you want 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.050
 look in the face is conservative and green already 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.980
 You have something there is a crap 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.600
 Earth 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.930
 I think it will not even give 15 grams 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.930
 per day 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.170
 after processing for six hours danst 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.070
 is ready for the first cleaning of the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.370
 season 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.140
 this land is worthless they are 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.370
 spending a thousand dollars a day and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.440
 fuel 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.170
 they will need 20 grams of gold 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.960
 just to match 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.780
 It's the first clean up because the father 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.200
 Look at this boot, whatever. 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.610
 to acquire nothing is not I see some 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.430
 little bits there 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.260
 Fred is sure that the land is good. 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.869
 justin is convinced that his 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.790
 land they need at least 20 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.950
 grams worth about one thousand dollars 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.580
 to cover the fuel cost of the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.010
 day 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.729
 Look at that, but I 've already found it. 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.070
 bigger or maybe we can 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.070
 pay the fuel after all have more gold 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.009
 what i thought fred was right 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.600
 I'm a contractor and he's a miner. 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.900
 I do not see the earth in the same way as 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 he sees 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 seems more than 20 grams of which is the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.209
 your hunch meld about 30 grams more or 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:21.750
 less then we will weigh 30 grams 40 43 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.940
 47 47 grams beauty 47 grams are worth 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.280
 almost two thousand and five hundred dollars 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.140
 a day's fred profit is 1,500 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 dollars your season has finally begun 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.280
 we have 47 grams 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.400
 it's four pounds nine hundred and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.260
 fifty-three grams 47 grams is 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.410
 impressive for that land if 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.440
 There's all this up. 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.440
 I imagine you have in the background gold fever
