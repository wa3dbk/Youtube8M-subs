00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.850
 morning transmission 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.520
 well this television performance is not 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.680
 only from the wiring exactly good 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.500
 today let's talk 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 today I read your column today in record my 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:47.610
 chronic your narrative chronicle although this 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 is a newspaper the newspaper this me 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.470
 it looks like an 11 although it ties and it takes a 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 punto is a mental triumph for mexico 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.850
 is a game that you have given to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.170
 mexico because yesterday chile must have 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.020
 won that game the referee is a 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.030
 true papanatas has a body 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.280
 arbitration of very poor quality can not 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.410
 allow yourself especially with also with the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.450
 pique that exists between Chileans and 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.620
 Peruvians in football can not exist 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.660
 a scope but what is in one of two 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.340
 legitimate world if they stole chile the 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.820
 party is the auxiliary but they are 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 equivocal 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.820
 Mr. wrong because it is very bad 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.439
 surely the group but it must be in 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 the america cup a man so bad what 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.299
 have in fact in bad faith I have had 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.500
 lamentations but not at the moment 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.810
 he pointed the flag for me really two 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 played two plays doing in the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.090
 extreme of which we have criticized Miguel 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 herrera 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.289
 the arbitration are you are falling it comes out to 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.020
 say an end comes out to tell lies 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.969
 after the game with Bolivia saying 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.649
 that did not mark him and that the arbitration in 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.450
 Four criminals who want to lie 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.310
 lie 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.229
 Mr. sampaoli yesterday says the rondos 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.880
 goals and they are absolutely right things 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.920
 with his name and his surname by God 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.840
 you already have to say things as they are and the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.939
 name and last name yesterday was a robbery in 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.219
 depopulated for the Chilean team and 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.220
 if you do not like it because you are a janitor 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.410
 and it surrounds you get up 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.360
 weight to the shield is a problem not mine 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.910
 to see what the purpose is then you 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.890
 that you are so perverse that perverse throw 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.860
 I have manipulated I have already told the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.700
 Peruvian referees please harm 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.380
 to the local saying that it's always 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.770
 like a helping hand that tries to help 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.770
 to local a normal natural mistake 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.950
 and of incapable of twice in order two 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.890
 Sometimes I'm arrived, times Mexico improved 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.480
 yes mexico did not give the big game 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.490
 that established all the cheerleaders of the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.980
 national team for me left many 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.500
 more questions a team than when it comes to 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.209
 attack is protected very much in area 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.250
 defensive a team that when you want 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.750
 defend does not know how to make a team that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.750
 leaves many but many doubts
