hi guys I got my I got some tables for
the<00:00:20.060> USA<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:22.310> basically<00:00:23.310> doing<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.700> test-fit

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the USA one basically doing a test-fit

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.710 
the USA one basically doing a test-fit
before<00:00:24.690> we<00:00:24.840> finalize<00:00:25.380> them<00:00:25.710> and/or<00:00:26.720> change

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
before we finalize them and/or change

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.130 
before we finalize them and/or change
them<00:00:27.990> depending<00:00:28.020> what<00:00:28.560> happens<00:00:28.950> so<00:00:29.990> I'm<00:00:30.990> gonna

them depending what happens so I'm gonna

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
them depending what happens so I'm gonna
try<00:00:31.350> them<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.620> right<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.120> I

try them on right here with you so I

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
try them on right here with you so I
have<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> look<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.749> set<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.289> makeshift

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
have a look so I set up a makeshift

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.200 
have a look so I set up a makeshift
driveshaft<00:00:38.339> it's<00:00:38.519> gonna<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.789> about<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> same

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
driveshaft it's gonna be about the same

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.329 
driveshaft it's gonna be about the same
but<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.510> one's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.749> bit<00:00:39.899> crooked<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.159> have

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
but this one's a bit crooked so you have

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.819 
but this one's a bit crooked so you have
to<00:00:41.429> replace<00:00:41.760> it

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
to replace it

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.069 
to replace it
these<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:44.010> sent<00:00:44.370> Genesis<00:00:44.969> ball<00:00:45.690> links

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
these are sent Genesis ball links

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.500 
these are sent Genesis ball links
they're<00:00:46.579> very<00:00:47.579> huge<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.690> heavy-duty

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
they're very huge and very heavy-duty

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.439 
they're very huge and very heavy-duty
and<00:00:51.510> put<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and put this one in here this is the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:12.219 
and put this one in here this is the
bottom<00:00:55.999> bottom<00:00:56.999> arm

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:38.990 

okay

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.190 

I'm<00:01:39.930> always<00:01:40.110> pretty<00:01:40.380> good

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.940 

talking

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.000 

we<00:01:53.950> are<00:01:54.159> put<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.880> bunch<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:57.540> shock<00:01:58.540> mounts<00:01:59.020> so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
we are put in a bunch of shock mounts so

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:39.970 
we are put in a bunch of shock mounts so
you<00:02:00.130> can<00:02:00.280> play<00:02:00.490> with<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.820> adjustments<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.510> bit

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:50.280 

come<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.909> get<00:02:41.300> in<00:02:41.450> there

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:03:12.130 

cool

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.559 

different<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.180> test

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
different just a test

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:41.160 
different just a test
anyways<00:03:20.209> bearing<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.330> here

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:53.770 

actually<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.160> wrong<00:03:42.459> side

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.500 

who's<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.959> one<00:03:55.110> anyways

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.089 

because<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.080> steering<00:03:59.319> link<00:03:59.620> has<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.890> be<00:03:59.980> up

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
because the steering link has to be up

00:04:00.099 --> 00:05:34.130 
because the steering link has to be up
top<00:04:01.920> there's<00:04:02.920> this<00:04:03.910> one<00:04:04.830> for<00:04:05.830> now

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:50.770 

for<00:05:35.140> all<00:05:35.200> my<00:05:35.230> tools<00:05:35.680> today

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.540 

what<00:05:51.470> we<00:05:51.620> got<00:05:51.800> for<00:05:52.070> now<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.490> this<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:55.190> can<00:05:55.250> see

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
what we got for now is this you can see

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.530 
what we got for now is this you can see
we<00:05:55.700> need<00:05:55.850> to<00:05:55.970> adjust<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.420> camera<00:05:56.870> here<00:05:58.540> bring

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
we need to adjust the camera here bring

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.250 
we need to adjust the camera here bring
this<00:05:59.690> one<00:05:59.900> out<00:06:00.110> a<00:06:00.139> little<00:06:00.230> bit<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:02.960> driveshaft

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
this one out a little bit the driveshaft

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.650 
this one out a little bit the driveshaft
seems<00:06:03.770> to<00:06:03.919> work<00:06:04.070> properly<00:06:04.430> I'll<00:06:05.120> be<00:06:05.360> at<00:06:05.450> this

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
seems to work properly I'll be at this

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.790 
seems to work properly I'll be at this
shaft<00:06:05.930> here<00:06:06.080> is<00:06:06.290> crooked<00:06:06.710> but<00:06:08.410> that<00:06:09.410> seems<00:06:09.680> to

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
shaft here is crooked but that seems to

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.480 
shaft here is crooked but that seems to
work<00:06:09.830> nicely<00:06:14.860> shocks<00:06:15.860> while<00:06:16.130> the<00:06:16.220> shocks

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
work nicely shocks while the shocks

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.260 
work nicely shocks while the shocks
aren't<00:06:16.790> really<00:06:17.060> connected<00:06:17.600> yet<00:06:17.780> but

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
aren't really connected yet but

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.430 
aren't really connected yet but
generally<00:06:20.270> speaking<00:06:20.690> it<00:06:20.810> should<00:06:20.840> work<00:06:21.110> quite

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
generally speaking it should work quite

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.600 
generally speaking it should work quite
well<00:06:22.750> see<00:06:23.750> this<00:06:23.930> thing<00:06:24.169> stays<00:06:24.470> exactly<00:06:24.740> the

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
well see this thing stays exactly the

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.480 
well see this thing stays exactly the
same<00:06:26.030> angle<00:06:28.000> actually<00:06:29.000> no<00:06:29.300> it<00:06:29.390> goes<00:06:29.510> in<00:06:29.720> a<00:06:29.810> bit

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.390 

see<00:06:33.360> this<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:34.230> angle<00:06:34.590> changes<00:06:34.620> ever<00:06:35.280> so

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
see this the angle changes ever so

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.550 
see this the angle changes ever so
slightly<00:06:37.070> it<00:06:38.070> actually<00:06:38.400> goes<00:06:38.550> straight<00:06:38.940> so<00:06:39.560> if

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
slightly it actually goes straight so if

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.590 
slightly it actually goes straight so if
I<00:06:40.770> bring<00:06:41.010> this<00:06:41.190> one<00:06:41.430> out<00:06:41.610> put<00:06:41.910> it<00:06:42.300> straight

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
I bring this one out put it straight

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.510 
I bring this one out put it straight
when<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.170> bring<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.590> up<00:06:43.680> it's<00:06:43.860> going<00:06:44.010> to<00:06:44.070> camera

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
when I bring it up it's going to camera

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
when I bring it up it's going to camera
a<00:06:44.550> little<00:06:44.700> bit<00:06:45.000> which<00:06:45.240> is<00:06:45.420> pretty<00:06:45.630> cool<00:06:47.240> so<00:06:48.240> we

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
a little bit which is pretty cool so we

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.630 
a little bit which is pretty cool so we
need<00:06:48.690> to<00:06:48.810> find<00:06:49.020> a<00:06:49.140> way<00:06:49.290> to<00:06:49.560> mount<00:06:50.130> these<00:06:50.370> two

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
need to find a way to mount these two

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.730 
need to find a way to mount these two
here<00:06:53.720> shouldn't<00:06:54.720> be<00:06:54.840> too<00:06:55.020> difficult

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
here shouldn't be too difficult

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.210 
here shouldn't be too difficult
either<00:06:57.370> that<00:06:57.669> or<00:06:57.729> remove<00:06:58.300> this<00:06:58.599> completely

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
either that or remove this completely

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.790 
either that or remove this completely
and<00:07:00.599> make<00:07:01.599> a<00:07:01.630> bracket<00:07:02.050> where<00:07:02.410> the<00:07:02.530> shocks

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
and make a bracket where the shocks

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.850 
and make a bracket where the shocks
mount<00:07:03.160> like<00:07:03.819> over<00:07:04.150> here<00:07:04.449> inside<00:07:05.349> but<00:07:05.620> then<00:07:05.740> I'm

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
mount like over here inside but then I'm

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.480 
mount like over here inside but then I'm
gonna<00:07:05.979> have<00:07:06.220> problem<00:07:06.789> with<00:07:06.910> the<00:07:07.030> body<00:07:07.210> mounts

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
gonna have problem with the body mounts

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.189 
gonna have problem with the body mounts
so<00:07:09.490> a<00:07:09.910> little<00:07:10.180> bit<00:07:10.330> of<00:07:10.389> thinking<00:07:10.780> to<00:07:10.900> do<00:07:11.020> on

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
so a little bit of thinking to do on

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.689 
so a little bit of thinking to do on
this<00:07:11.490> but<00:07:13.259> looks<00:07:14.259> pretty<00:07:14.500> good<00:07:14.740> seems<00:07:15.460> pretty

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
this but looks pretty good seems pretty
