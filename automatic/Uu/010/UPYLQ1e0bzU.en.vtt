thing<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.260> important<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> Odyssey

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
thing that's important about the Odyssey

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
thing that's important about the Odyssey
is<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.329> pretty<00:00:45.719> much<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> same<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
is that it's pretty much the same to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
is that it's pretty much the same to
drive<00:00:46.680> regardless<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> trim<00:00:47.850> level<00:00:48.090> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
drive regardless of the trim level you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
drive regardless of the trim level you
get<00:00:48.420> well<00:00:49.020> most<00:00:49.530> Sienna<00:00:49.800> trim<00:00:50.010> levels<00:00:50.340> lean

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
get well most Sienna trim levels lean

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279 
get well most Sienna trim levels lean
literally<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.420> toward<00:00:51.750> comfort<00:00:52.140> than

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
literally more toward comfort than

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.290 
literally more toward comfort than
driving<00:00:52.530> dynamics<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> SE<00:00:53.760> model<00:00:53.789> has

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
driving dynamics but the SE model has

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
driving dynamics but the SE model has
more<00:00:54.629> responsive<00:00:55.110> steering<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.980> argue

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
more responsive steering and that argue

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.680 
more responsive steering and that argue
is<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.820> better<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> drive<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
is actually better to drive than the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170 
is actually better to drive than the
Odyssey<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> acceleration<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.969> dead

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
Odyssey now the acceleration is dead

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.729 
Odyssey now the acceleration is dead
equal<00:01:00.480> between<00:01:00.809> these<00:01:00.960> two<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.289> keep<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.559> mind

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
equal between these two but keep in mind

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.470 
equal between these two but keep in mind
the<00:01:01.920> Dodge<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.129> Chrysler<00:01:02.399> minivans<00:01:03.030> actually

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the Dodge and Chrysler minivans actually

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
the Dodge and Chrysler minivans actually
have<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:03.780> powerful<00:01:04.199> engines<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
have more powerful engines one of the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.560 
have more powerful engines one of the
things<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> sienna<00:01:06.240> though<00:01:06.420> is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
things I like about the sienna though is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
things I like about the sienna though is
it<00:01:06.689> has<00:01:06.810> true<00:01:07.110> manual<00:01:07.680> shift<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> ability

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it has true manual shift in the ability

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
it has true manual shift in the ability
with<00:01:08.580> its<00:01:08.700> automatic<00:01:09.090> transmission<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
with its automatic transmission and the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.170 
with its automatic transmission and the
Odyssey<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.159> an<00:01:11.250> old-school<00:01:11.549> console

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
first time way-cool has ever been used

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.960 
first time way-cool has ever been used
for<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> minivan<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> James<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.399> way<00:01:50.670> cool

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
know I'm actually think I might have to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
know I'm actually think I might have to
concede<00:01:58.500> comfort<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> Sienna<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.060> on

the Odyssey now that's not to say the
Odyssey<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.340> uncomfortable<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.149> really

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
Odyssey is uncomfortable this is really

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.950 
Odyssey is uncomfortable this is really
just<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.780> scenario<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.619> 1a<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.670> 1b<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.659> would

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
just a scenario of 1a and 1b but I would

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.410 
just a scenario of 1a and 1b but I would
point<00:02:07.259> out<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.459> both<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.970> these<00:02:09.090> vans

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
point out that the both of these vans

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.229 
point out that the both of these vans
have<00:02:09.780> eight<00:02:10.649> passenger<00:02:11.280> capacity<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:12.030> have

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
have eight passenger capacity they have

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.370 
have eight passenger capacity they have
three<00:02:12.599> seats

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
three seats

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
three seats
in<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.620> second<00:02:14.040> row<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> Odysseys<00:02:15.300> is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
in the second row but the Odysseys is

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.030 
in the second row but the Odysseys is
more<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.350> bench

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
more like a bench

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.920 
more like a bench
so<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.460> middle<00:02:17.700> seat<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> little<00:02:18.720> more

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so that middle seat is a little more

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.110 
so that middle seat is a little more
like<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> normal<00:02:19.590> seat<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.580> Sienna<00:02:20.880> it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
like a normal seat in the Sienna it's

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000 
like a normal seat in the Sienna it's
more<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.510> an<00:02:21.660> odd<00:02:21.840> jump<00:02:22.260> seat<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.620> between

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
more like an odd jump seat in between

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.310 
more like an odd jump seat in between
two<00:02:23.250> captains<00:02:23.730> chairs<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:24.990> we're<00:02:25.140> saying

are<00:02:27.900> great<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.440> families<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> Sienna

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
are great for families but the Sienna

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.720 
are great for families but the Sienna
just<00:02:30.300> edges<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.260> gets<00:02:31.470> my<00:02:31.830> point<00:02:32.100> so

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
just edges it and it gets my point so

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.330 
just edges it and it gets my point so
James<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.570> Odysseys<00:02:34.140> interior<00:02:34.740> worthy<00:02:35.220> of

the Odyssey is kind of epic you know it
does<00:02:43.770> have<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.310> great<00:02:44.820> amount<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.420> versatility

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
does have a great amount of versatility

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.500 
does have a great amount of versatility
in<00:02:46.350> practicality<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.490> does<00:02:47.730> seat<00:02:48.060> eight<00:02:48.270> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
in practicality it does seat eight and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.960 
in practicality it does seat eight and
there's<00:02:48.690> tons<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.380> storage<00:02:49.740> bins<00:02:50.190> including

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
there's tons of storage bins including

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
there's tons of storage bins including
one<00:02:51.210> that's<00:02:51.480> called<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.960> cool<00:02:52.140> box<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
one that's called the cool box that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.000 
one that's called the cool box that
allows<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.060> store<00:02:54.600> drinks<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.230> well<00:02:55.440> keep

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
allows you to store drinks and well keep

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.760 
allows you to store drinks and well keep
them<00:02:56.220> cool<00:02:56.600> for<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> Sienna<00:02:58.050> access<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
them cool for the Sienna access to the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.530 
them cool for the Sienna access to the
third<00:02:59.010> row<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.400> easier<00:02:59.760> because<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.270> second

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
third row is easier because the second

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.540 
third row is easier because the second
row<00:03:00.630> slides<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.110> far<00:03:01.320> forwards<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.460> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
row slides so far forwards and at the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.010 
row slides so far forwards and at the
same<00:03:02.640> time<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.030> slides<00:03:03.240> really<00:03:03.510> far<00:03:03.660> rearward

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
same time it slides really far rearward

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.740 
same time it slides really far rearward
so<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.200> get<00:03:04.380> really<00:03:04.680> big<00:03:05.090> second<00:03:06.090> row<00:03:06.270> legroom

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
so you get really big second row legroom

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.290 
so you get really big second row legroom
one<00:03:07.710> of<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.860> downsides<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.490> it<00:03:08.880> doesn't<00:03:09.210> have

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
one of the downsides is it doesn't have

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.970 
one of the downsides is it doesn't have
a<00:03:09.330> completely<00:03:09.750> flat<00:03:09.990> load<00:03:10.320> floor<00:03:10.350> because<00:03:10.950> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
a completely flat load floor because of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.560 
a completely flat load floor because of
the<00:03:11.190> bits<00:03:11.400> related<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.030> second<00:03:12.450> row

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
the bits related to that second row

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.440 
the bits related to that second row
whereas<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.960> Odyssey<00:03:13.290> does<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.730> second

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
whereas the Odyssey does and the second

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.740 
whereas the Odyssey does and the second
row<00:03:15.570> seats<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.290> sienna<00:03:16.560> are<00:03:16.830> heavy<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.390> a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
row seats in the sienna are heavy and a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.510 
row seats in the sienna are heavy and a
little<00:03:18.870> bit<00:03:19.050> difficult<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.590> take<00:03:19.830> out<00:03:20.100> on<00:03:20.370> like

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
little bit difficult to take out on like

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.130 
little bit difficult to take out on like
theodicies<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.600> other<00:03:21.720> problem<00:03:22.050> with

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
theodicies and the other problem with

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.750 
theodicies and the other problem with
the<00:03:22.200> Sienna<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.920> some<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.340> controls

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the Sienna is that some of the controls

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.670 
the Sienna is that some of the controls
like<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.120> radio<00:03:24.540> tuning<00:03:24.810> knob<00:03:25.050> are<00:03:25.230> way<00:03:25.440> far

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
like the radio tuning knob are way far

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
don't you know the SE model is actually

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.470 
don't you know the SE model is actually
somewhat<00:05:21.440> engaging<00:05:21.820> but<00:05:22.820> it's<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.060> only<00:05:23.180> trim

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
somewhat engaging but it's the only trim

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.880 
somewhat engaging but it's the only trim
level<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.930> Sienna<00:05:24.170> that's<00:05:24.380> actually<00:05:24.680> even

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
level of the Sienna that's actually even

remotely<00:05:25.190> fun<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.580> drive<00:05:25.790> but<00:05:26.120> overall<00:05:26.360> the

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
remotely fun to drive but overall the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.930 
remotely fun to drive but overall the
Sienna<00:05:27.170> lacks<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.740> Odyssey<00:05:28.280> steering<00:05:28.730> feel

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
Sienna lacks the Odyssey steering feel

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.060 
Sienna lacks the Odyssey steering feel
and<00:05:28.970> sharper<00:05:29.480> handling<00:05:29.630> so<00:05:30.169> in<00:05:30.320> conclusion<00:05:30.530> if

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070
