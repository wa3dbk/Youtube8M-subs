was<00:02:10.050> hindering<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.530> training<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.129> wasn't<00:02:11.430> able

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
was hindering my training I wasn't able

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
was hindering my training I wasn't able
to<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.910> deadlifts<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:12.629> squats

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to do deadlifts or squats

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.980 
to do deadlifts or squats
so<00:02:14.100> my<00:02:14.280> favorite<00:02:14.670> exercises<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.510> guys<00:02:15.690> know

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
but I'm right back to to full force

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.120 
but I'm right back to to full force
training<00:02:19.020> although<00:02:19.260> my<00:02:19.560> strength<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.100> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
training although my strength is a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.740 
training although my strength is a
little<00:02:20.400> bit<00:02:20.490> decreased<00:02:20.940> from<00:02:21.060> last<00:02:21.330> season

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
little bit decreased from last season

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.350 
little bit decreased from last season
but<00:02:22.590> keep<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.950> mind<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.280> am<00:02:23.400> trying<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.880> drop<00:02:24.300> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
but keep in mind I am trying to drop a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.960 
but keep in mind I am trying to drop a
bit<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.690> muscularity<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.520> that's<00:02:26.790> not

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
bit of muscularity so so that's not

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.490 
bit of muscularity so so that's not
necessarily<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.690> bad<00:02:27.750> thing

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
necessarily a bad thing

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.950 
necessarily a bad thing
