rifle concept is a forward mounted scope

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.210 
rifle concept is a forward mounted scope
of<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:15.000> very<00:01:15.180> low<00:01:15.479> magnification<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
of a very low magnification this one is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
of a very low magnification this one is
a<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> half<00:01:17.700> x<00:01:18.240> Burris<00:01:18.840> scope<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
a one and a half x Burris scope with a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.649 
a one and a half x Burris scope with a
very<00:01:19.530> thin<00:01:19.890> reticle<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
very thin reticle I really like it the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
very thin reticle I really like it the
idea<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> forward<00:01:22.650> mounting<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
idea of the forward mounting of the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
idea of the forward mounting of the
scope<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> low<00:01:24.150> magnification<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
scope and the low magnification is that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
scope and the low magnification is that
it<00:01:25.680> gives<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.280> opportunity<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.090> pretty

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it gives me the opportunity to be pretty

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.330 
it gives me the opportunity to be pretty
precise<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> hunting<00:01:28.560> situation<00:01:28.710> or<00:01:29.310> for

allows<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.049> very<00:01:37.229> quickly<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.520> scope

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
allows me to very quickly get the scope

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.920 
allows me to very quickly get the scope
up<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.060> front<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.689> where<00:01:39.840> those

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
up in front of me and know where those

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899 
up in front of me and know where those
crosshairs<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.310> case<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
crosshairs are in a case of kind of a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.609 
crosshairs are in a case of kind of a
body<00:01:42.090> shot<00:01:42.450> or<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> close-in<00:01:43.229> hunting

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
body shot or a close-in hunting

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
body shot or a close-in hunting
situation<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.579> obviously<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.420> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
situation so obviously this is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.179 
situation so obviously this is
completely<00:01:46.020> clear<00:01:46.320> I've<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.590> no<00:01:46.740> ammo<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
completely clear I've got no ammo in the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
completely clear I've got no ammo in the
gun<00:01:47.399> no<00:01:47.610> ammo<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> magazine<00:01:48.390> no<00:01:48.570> ammo<00:01:49.290> in

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.719 
gun no ammo in the magazine no ammo in
the<00:01:49.409> chamber<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> go<00:01:50.670> ahead

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the chamber and I'm going to go ahead

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
the chamber and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:50.909> leave<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> bolt<00:01:51.479> flagged<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.350> the

and leave the bolt flagged up and the

trigger just for like triple redundancy
here<00:01:55.530> we're<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> take<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> look<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
here we're going to take a look at the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.819 
here we're going to take a look at the
idea<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> idea<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.200> I'll<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
idea the idea is that I'll be here in a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
idea the idea is that I'll be here in a
ready<00:01:59.040> position<00:01:59.130> I'll<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.790> looking<00:02:00.090> around<00:02:00.210> if

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
ready position I'll be looking around if

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.109 
ready position I'll be looking around if
I<00:02:00.630> need<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.020> throw<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> gun<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I need to throw the gun up here as the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.030 
I need to throw the gun up here as the
gun<00:02:03.270> comes<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.079> make<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:04.439> cheek<00:02:04.710> weld<00:02:04.890> I

gun comes up and I make my cheek weld I
can<00:02:05.219> pick<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.579> those<00:02:05.759> crosshairs<00:02:06.149> very<00:02:06.689> easily

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
can pick up those crosshairs very easily

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
can pick up those crosshairs very easily
but<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> also<00:02:07.590> still<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.129> both<00:02:08.340> eyes<00:02:08.640> open<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
crosshairs are right there that's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.700 
crosshairs are right there that's
exactly<00:02:17.480> we're<00:02:17.660> looking<00:02:17.840> for<00:02:18.020> now<00:02:18.230> if<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.440> want

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
exactly we're looking for now if I want

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.620 
exactly we're looking for now if I want
to<00:02:18.770> close<00:02:19.100> an<00:02:19.280> eye<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.640> really<00:02:19.910> bear<00:02:20.150> down<00:02:20.180> on

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
to close an eye and really bear down on

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.420 
to close an eye and really bear down on
the<00:02:20.720> crosshairs<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.440> duplex<00:02:21.890> reticle

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
the crosshairs this is a duplex reticle

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.310 
the crosshairs this is a duplex reticle
I<00:02:22.580> want<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.850> look<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.210> lot<00:02:23.570> tighter<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
I want to look a lot tighter at that

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.710 
I want to look a lot tighter at that
duplex<00:02:24.770> reticle<00:02:25.250> really<00:02:25.880> get<00:02:26.030> narrow<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.540> it

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
duplex reticle really get narrow on it

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.450 
duplex reticle really get narrow on it
then<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.470> can<00:02:27.620> go<00:02:27.710> ahead<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.920> take<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.160> more

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
then I can go ahead and take that more

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.920 
then I can go ahead and take that more
precise<00:02:28.820> shot<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.330> might<00:02:29.540> need<00:02:29.690> at<00:02:29.870> a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
precise shot but I might need at a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.450 
precise shot but I might need at a
longer<00:02:30.170> distance<00:02:30.320> or<00:02:30.830> again<00:02:31.070> in<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.280> situation

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
longer distance or again in a situation

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.040 
longer distance or again in a situation
where<00:02:31.880> there's<00:02:32.030> bystanders<00:02:32.660> things<00:02:32.870> like

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
where there's bystanders things like

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.680 
where there's bystanders things like

that another thing about the Scout
concept<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.160> particular

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
concept that I like in this particular

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.700 
concept that I like in this particular
rifle<00:02:37.850> build<00:02:38.240> is<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.690> if<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.410> problem

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
rifle build is that if I have a problem

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.380 
rifle build is that if I have a problem
and<00:02:39.950> actually<00:02:40.100> had<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.550> happen<00:02:40.910> once<00:02:41.090> out<00:02:41.270> on

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
kind of miserable we were down in

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.449 
kind of miserable we were down in
Alabama<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.380> had<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.590> cross<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.830> river<00:02:49.160> to

get to where I was going to hunt down in
the<00:02:51.410> palmettos<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:52.940> went<00:02:53.150> ahead<00:02:53.240> and

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
the palmettos and I just went ahead and

took the scope off and then I have this

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.460 
took the scope off and then I have this
ghost<00:02:56.000> ring<00:02:56.300> sight<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> have<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.959> relatively

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
wasn't moving super fast and it's

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.930
