terrific concept as a food group it does
contain<00:00:21.390> fat<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.080> they're<00:00:22.619> good<00:00:22.920> fats<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
contain fat but they're good fats and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.429 
contain fat but they're good fats and
there's<00:00:23.730> tons<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> protein<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> problem

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
there's tons of protein but the problem

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.589 
there's tons of protein but the problem
