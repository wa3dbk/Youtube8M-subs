00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that bounces it might take off use water

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
that bounces it might take off use water
bowl<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.930> bottle<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.680> does<00:01:01.829> work<00:01:02.780> but<00:01:04.100> yeah<00:01:05.100> but

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
bowl it bottle it does work but yeah but

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.950 
bowl it bottle it does work but yeah but
more<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> bouncy<00:01:06.240> bullets<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> gun

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
more like a bouncy bullets with a gun

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.760 
more like a bouncy bullets with a gun
that's<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.799> better<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.610> cost<00:01:08.820> ammo<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.770> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that's way better but it cost ammo so it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
that's way better but it cost ammo so it
takes<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.549> those<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.780> you're

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
takes time to make those so what you're

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.240 
takes time to make those so what you're
going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> way<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.860> here
