00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.230
 I welcome you the breast 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.580
 a video tutorial 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.850
 in the sectorial we will learn to download that seen the dividive 100 6 points the 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.699
 another year 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.309
 if we learn the procedure to install it 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.289
 and to crack 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.840
 I'm going to leave the interest 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.980
 of the download in the description of the video 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.769
 this one on the server despite 24 points 5th the bull market 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.410
 very light and discharge in 15 minutes maximum 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.099
 well once the state is going to cost that folder 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.550
 yamada 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.000
 in front of it ual 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.870
 it is important that you have the antivirus turned off 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.769
 since it brought the crack micra that many times the anti detect it 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 as a virus or a threat 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750
 I do not have disabled 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.750
 you can realize until that 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.170
 it is a recommendation if 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.340
 in any case when performing the download does not eliminate them 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.640
 with one out performs 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.230
 the installer so good 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.150
 there is no problem they do not have to deactivate the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.420
 antivirus or what 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 well once you have a house folder 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.920
 we are going to give him that I am here 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.800
 and then they have to end 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.440
 earring momo 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.760

 my salary 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.630
 bush the electrical network in this one 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 next to the dike and create version 6 points 0 point 8 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 it is not expected to start the installation assistant 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.890

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.590

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.249
 let's cache him 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.259
 to crack we will continue 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.029
