00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
build rockets really and we've just been

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
build rockets really and we've just been
doing<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> competition<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.640> they've

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
and peace of mind we design it into

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.720

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
decide on why did you build what you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.010 
decide on why did you build what you
built<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.100> way<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.250> built<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.640> well<00:03:18.360> we<00:03:18.750> built

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
built the way you built it well we built

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.770 
built the way you built it well we built
the<00:03:19.680> same<00:03:19.860> rocket<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.550> basically<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.600> same

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
the same rocket that basically the same

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.420 
the same rocket that basically the same
rocket<00:03:22.050> we've<00:03:22.290> been<00:03:22.470> building<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.250> past

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
rocket we've been building for the past

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.800 
rocket we've been building for the past
few<00:03:23.610> years<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:24.180> didn't<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:24.540> change

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
few years that we didn't really change

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.660 
few years that we didn't really change
our<00:03:24.989> design<00:03:25.320> too<00:03:25.500> much<00:03:25.680> we've<00:03:26.190> always<00:03:26.400> done

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
our design too much we've always done

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.580 
our design too much we've always done
decently<00:03:27.030> well<00:03:27.390> with<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.989> we<00:03:28.230> kind<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
decently well with it so we kind of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.800 
decently well with it so we kind of
stuck<00:03:28.890> with<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.130> same<00:03:29.190> same<00:03:29.970> design<00:03:30.300> aspect

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
stuck with the same same design aspect

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.140 
stuck with the same same design aspect
and<00:03:31.520> everything<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.700> we've<00:03:32.820> done<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
and everything that we've done in the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.900 
and everything that we've done in the
past<00:03:33.300> has<00:03:33.570> been<00:03:33.860> doing<00:03:34.860> good<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.489> pretty

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
past has been doing good so we pretty

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.790 
past has been doing good so we pretty
much<00:03:36.030> stuck<00:03:36.360> with<00:03:36.570> same<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:37.620> been

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
much stuck with same and it's been

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.890 
much stuck with same and it's been
working<00:03:37.950> out<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.400> us<00:03:38.430> there<00:03:39.390> any<00:03:39.540> one<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.050 
any particular issues of course they
moved<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> streamer<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:44.100> year<00:03:44.310> had<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.940> be

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
moved to a streamer this year had to be

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.600 
moved to a streamer this year had to be
technically<00:03:45.510> intriguing<00:03:46.260> yeah<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.459> was

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
technically intriguing yeah that was

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.400 
technically intriguing yeah that was
actually<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:48.540> had<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:48.840> about<00:03:48.989> how<00:03:49.350> we

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
actually we had to think about how we

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.750 
actually we had to think about how we
were<00:03:49.620> going<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:50.100> using<00:03:50.730> what

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
were going to you and what using what

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.420 
were going to you and what using what
materials<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:51.300> were<00:03:51.420> going<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.630> use<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.130> we<00:03:53.130> we

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
materials we were going to use and we we

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.490 
materials we were going to use and we we
came<00:03:53.610> up<00:03:53.640> with<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> good<00:03:54.420> design<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.200> mean<00:03:55.380> it

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
came up with a good design and I mean it

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.320 
came up with a good design and I mean it
seemed<00:03:55.739> seem<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:56.610> seem<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.300> very

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
seemed seem to be seem to be very

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.290 
seemed seem to be seem to be very
efficient<00:03:58.400> yeah<00:03:59.400> we<00:03:59.520> started<00:03:59.850> out<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.090> these

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
efficient yeah we started out with these

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.330 
efficient yeah we started out with these
paper<00:04:00.930> streamers<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.560> they<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.160> weren't

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
paper streamers and they just weren't

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.160 
paper streamers and they just weren't
doing<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.670> job<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.030> they're<00:04:03.150> they're<00:04:03.480> way

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
doing the job and they're they're way

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.170 
doing the job and they're they're way
too<00:04:04.200> much<00:04:04.500> mass<00:04:04.770> for<00:04:05.130> how<00:04:05.820> much<00:04:05.940> they<00:04:06.120> were

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
too much mass for how much they were

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.810 
too much mass for how much they were
actually<00:04:06.390> causing<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.020> drag<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.980> we<00:04:08.220> switched

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
actually causing and drag so we switched

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.690 
actually causing and drag so we switched
to<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.300> metallic<00:04:09.780> mylar<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.410> that<00:04:11.370> folds<00:04:11.670> a

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
to the metallic mylar and that folds a

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.430 
to the metallic mylar and that folds a
lot<00:04:11.850> nicer<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.840> get<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> lot<00:04:13.140> more<00:04:13.200> out<00:04:13.410> of

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
lot nicer and we get a lot more out of

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.680 
lot nicer and we get a lot more out of
that<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.459> we<00:04:14.580> really<00:04:14.910> focused<00:04:15.420> on<00:04:15.540> that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
that and so we really focused on that

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.020 
that and so we really focused on that
you<00:04:16.080> only<00:04:16.290> got<00:04:16.530> down<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.769> one<00:04:17.310> streamer<00:04:17.730> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you only got down to one streamer and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.470 
you only got down to one streamer and
that<00:04:18.870> did<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> job<00:04:19.140> looks<00:04:20.070> good

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
that did the job looks good

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.080 
that did the job looks good
and<00:04:21.870> also<00:04:22.620> what<00:04:22.920> really<00:04:23.250> helps<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.760> baby

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
and also what really helps is baby

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.700 
and also what really helps is baby
powder<00:04:24.450> um<00:04:26.090> I'm<00:04:27.090> not<00:04:27.300> kidding<00:04:27.660> because<00:04:28.350> baby

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
powder um I'm not kidding because baby

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.520 
powder um I'm not kidding because baby
powder<00:04:29.010> gives<00:04:29.250> us<00:04:29.460> extra<00:04:29.730> weight<00:04:30.050> for<00:04:31.050> when<00:04:31.440> we

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
powder gives us extra weight for when we

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.410 
powder gives us extra weight for when we
need<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.770> write<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:32.070> so<00:04:32.370> we<00:04:32.490> don't<00:04:32.730> go<00:04:32.880> over<00:04:33.240> the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
need to write to so we don't go over the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.560 
need to write to so we don't go over the
altitude<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.350> then<00:04:34.980> when<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.220> ejects<00:04:35.640> we

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
altitude and then when it ejects we

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.820 
altitude and then when it ejects we
don't<00:04:36.750> have<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:36.930> wait<00:04:37.200> anymore<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.710> that's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
don't have that wait anymore and that's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.010 
don't have that wait anymore and that's
all<00:04:37.980> it's<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:38.250> nice<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:39.390> also<00:04:39.570> keeps<00:04:39.870> the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
all it's so nice it it also keeps the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.840 
all it's so nice it it also keeps the

competition and we've been doing it for

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.480 
competition and we've been doing it for
four<00:05:30.600> years<00:05:30.750> now<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.260> it's<00:05:31.620> really<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.220> lot<00:05:32.400> of

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
not actually going into aerospace ah in

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.450 
not actually going into aerospace ah in
the<00:05:36.900> future<00:05:37.110> at<00:05:37.380> not<00:05:37.830> for<00:05:38.070> seeing<00:05:38.280> myself

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
the future at not for seeing myself

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.210 
the future at not for seeing myself
doing<00:05:38.760> that<00:05:38.970> but<00:05:39.330> i<00:05:39.630> still<00:05:40.440> think<00:05:40.650> oh<00:05:40.890> I've

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
doing that but i still think oh I've

learned<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:41.670> lot<00:05:41.730> about<00:05:42.060> teamwork<00:05:42.390> about

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
learned a lot about teamwork about

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.780 
learned a lot about teamwork about
designing<00:05:43.200> things<00:05:43.470> about<00:05:43.890> trial

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
designing things about trial

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.130 
designing things about trial
perseverance<00:05:45.390> trying<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.690> get<00:05:45.810> things<00:05:46.020> to

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
perseverance trying to get things to

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.900 
perseverance trying to get things to
work<00:05:46.170> so<00:05:46.920> yeah<00:05:47.820> I<00:05:47.850> think<00:05:47.940> I've<00:05:48.180> learned<00:05:48.390> a<00:05:48.450> lot

it is very interesting I will be a like
I<00:06:20.340> like<00:06:20.640> model<00:06:21.210> rocketry<00:06:21.600> i'll<00:06:21.810> probably<00:06:22.050> be

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
I like model rocketry i'll probably be

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.580 
I like model rocketry i'll probably be
making<00:06:22.770> Rockets<00:06:22.950> um<00:06:23.790> probably<00:06:24.540> for<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.530> rest

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590

working with these guys and definitely
honing<00:06:33.839> our<00:06:33.959> rocket<00:06:34.559> skills<00:06:34.799> and<00:06:34.949> getting<00:06:35.129> it

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
honing our rocket skills and getting it

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.069 
honing our rocket skills and getting it
down<00:06:35.399> to<00:06:35.579> the<00:06:35.669> point<00:06:35.909> where<00:06:36.149> we<00:06:36.599> can<00:06:36.749> win

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:37.079 
down to the point where we can win

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.399 
down to the point where we can win
something<00:06:37.319> like<00:06:37.559> this<00:06:37.679> it's<00:06:37.949> really<00:06:38.669> cool<00:06:38.849> I

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:39.409 
something like this it's really cool I

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.769 
something like this it's really cool I
plan<00:06:40.409> to<00:06:40.439> go<00:06:41.039> into<00:06:41.219> computer<00:06:42.029> sciences<00:06:42.509> later

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
plan to go into computer sciences later

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.589 
plan to go into computer sciences later
on<00:06:42.989> but<00:06:43.769> I'm<00:06:44.009> hoping<00:06:44.399> that<00:06:44.609> computer<00:06:45.239> sciences

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
on but I'm hoping that computer sciences

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.649 
on but I'm hoping that computer sciences
lead<00:06:45.839> me<00:06:45.989> into<00:06:46.109> aerospace<00:06:47.419> technologies<00:06:48.419> and

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659 
lead me into aerospace technologies and

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.239 
lead me into aerospace technologies and
hopefully<00:06:49.199> I<00:06:49.259> can<00:06:49.349> apply<00:06:49.649> my<00:06:49.799> skills<00:06:49.829> there

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.249 
hopefully I can apply my skills there

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:56.269 
hopefully I can apply my skills there
it's<00:06:51.059> a<00:06:51.209> meat<00:06:51.629> field<00:06:54.619> well<00:06:55.619> the<00:06:55.979> rocket

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:56.279 
it's a meat field well the rocket

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.499 
it's a meat field well the rocket
competition<00:06:56.789> has<00:06:56.879> definitely<00:06:56.909> taught<00:06:57.329> me<00:06:57.389> a

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
competition has definitely taught me a

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:58.939 
competition has definitely taught me a
lot<00:06:57.659> about<00:06:57.719> teamwork<00:06:58.109> and<00:06:58.439> a<00:06:58.469> lot<00:06:58.619> about<00:06:58.799> how

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:00.319 
lot about teamwork and a lot about how
to<00:06:59.009> basically<00:06:59.369> just<00:06:59.549> build<00:06:59.759> a<00:06:59.819> rocket<00:07:00.179> and

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.329 
to basically just build a rocket and

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:01.759 
to basically just build a rocket and
make<00:07:00.569> things<00:07:00.809> work<00:07:01.109> out<00:07:01.289> of<00:07:01.409> what<00:07:01.529> you<00:07:01.619> have

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:01.769 
make things work out of what you have

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:03.799 
make things work out of what you have
and<00:07:02.009> you<00:07:02.489> have<00:07:02.519> time<00:07:02.909> limits<00:07:03.119> and<00:07:03.419> you<00:07:03.539> have<00:07:03.659> to

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:03.809 
and you have time limits and you have to

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:06.259 
and you have time limits and you have to
you<00:07:04.319> have<00:07:04.349> to<00:07:04.499> produce<00:07:04.829> and<00:07:05.309> and<00:07:05.610> we<00:07:05.789> did<00:07:05.999> and

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:06.269 
you have to produce and and we did and

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:08.539 
you have to produce and and we did and
the<00:07:06.989> future<00:07:07.349> is<00:07:07.379> definitely<00:07:07.919> helping<00:07:08.279> out
