00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
but i think that as much flak on decks

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.569 
but i think that as much flak on decks
are<00:00:41.309> much<00:00:41.430> much<00:00:41.640> more<00:00:41.940> better<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.660> um

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
are much much more better with them um

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.260 
are much much more better with them um
wind<00:00:44.579> erosion<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.149> nice<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.780> extreme<00:00:46.620> attack

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
having your deck this trap Inge is a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.260

must-have<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.790> fly<00:01:45.149> context<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.909> so

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
must-have for all fly context and so

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.780 
must-have for all fly context and so
I've<00:01:49.020> seen<00:01:49.380> many<00:01:49.590> different<00:01:49.950> variations<00:01:50.250> like

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
I've seen many different variations like

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
I've seen many different variations like
Palkia<00:01:51.780> X<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:53.090> I've<00:01:54.090> even<00:01:54.240> seen<00:01:54.689> ducks

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
Palkia X and I've even seen ducks

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.469 
Palkia X and I've even seen ducks
exactly<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.340> except<00:01:56.880> without<00:01:56.969> memory

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
exactly like this except without memory

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
exactly like this except without memory
berries<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.680> memory<00:01:59.219> berries<00:01:59.520> are

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
berries but I think memory berries are

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.819 
berries but I think memory berries are
