00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.719
 Hello 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.030
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.929
 correctly assemble a series of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 snow chains 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.940
 in two minutes for the demonstration 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.900
 we will use a series of snow chains 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.600
 k snow 9 mm per car is good to have with you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 of the hardware gloves since the low ones 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.129
 temperatures will make your hands spin 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.739
 making the assembly annoying and a 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.749
 mat a waterproof sheet for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.719
 avoid kneeling on the asphalt 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:41.879
 wet well 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.460
 once we open the chain we spread it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.589
 ground the yellow lead of the cable 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.920
 rigid must be passed behind the wheel e 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.170
 pulled on the other side while the two 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.350
 ends are held with both 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.010
 hands hook in this way the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.010
 circle 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.690
 and let it slip behind the wheel 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.040
 keeping the rest of the chain to us 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.770
 we hook the yellow chain to the hook 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.280
 red and arrange the gray chain on the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280
 tread 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.440
 the yellow chain will therefore remain in the 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.660
 front part of the wheel 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.030
 we recover the red chain from behind 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.250
 with the rubber tip and let's do it 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.590
 pass in the pulley pulling it by 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.020
 well 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 we continue passing the rubber tip 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.730
 in the red buttonhole and we stick in 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.660
 any point in the yellow chain 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 so as to make the latter retire 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.110
 operation the chain is mounted 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.480
 correctly 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.530
 you can then mount the other chain e 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.530
 continue the journey remember that later 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.110
 having covered 50 100 meters the chains yes 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.050
 they will sound and you will hear some noise 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.280
 it will therefore be necessary to stop 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.070
 checking you will notice that the chain 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.990
 Red is no longer just going 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.240
 then proceed to a subsequent e 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.420
 final retirement of the tip in 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.790
 rubber on the yellow chain did that 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.450
 would drastically reduce the noise and the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.640
 risk of chain breakage 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.350
 important for disassembly remember to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.480
 stop the machine so that the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.920
 red hook remains in the upper part 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.920
 of the wheel as it is now 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.450
 a tip after the purchase do a little 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 of practice, try to fit the chains in 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.300
 no snow so in case of 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.410
 emergency 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.410
 you will have an advantage 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.730
 as a last tip to avoid that 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.250
 chains suffer erosion due to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.650
 salt present on snow-covered roads 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.120
 Well wash them dry before 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.120
 place them in the box
