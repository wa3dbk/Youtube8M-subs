00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
would be the most effective way of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.430 
would be the most effective way of
moving<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.409> thing<00:01:19.470> down<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> stand

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
moving this thing down to the stand

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.190 
moving this thing down to the stand
we'll<00:01:22.440> figure<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:23.720> anyway<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.110> about

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
we'll figure it out anyway it's about

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.060 
we'll figure it out anyway it's about
the<00:01:26.030> size<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> car<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:28.440> as<00:01:28.619> long<00:01:31.070> it's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the size of the car about as long it's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.950 
the size of the car about as long it's
freakin<00:01:32.430> huge

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.020 

alright<00:01:41.920> only<00:01:42.920> two<00:01:43.280> things<00:01:43.549> are<00:01:43.700> wrong<00:01:43.880> with

also kind of a handle when you need to

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.590 
also kind of a handle when you need to
lift<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.210> lid<00:01:59.360> out<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.979> problem<00:02:04.600> nothing

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
lift the lid out the problem nothing

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.620

the tank the back of the tank back of
the<00:02:21.260> tanks<00:02:21.530> got<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.769> little<00:02:22.040> hole<00:02:23.080> tiny<00:02:24.080> little

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the tanks got a little hole tiny little

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.170 
the tanks got a little hole tiny little
hole<00:02:24.800> right<00:02:24.830> there<00:02:27.430> I'm<00:02:28.430> not<00:02:28.610> sure<00:02:28.670> what<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.060> do

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
hole right there I'm not sure what to do

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.690 
hole right there I'm not sure what to do
with<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.330> because<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.840> looks<00:02:30.050> clear<00:02:30.610> on<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
with that because it looks clear on the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.400 
with that because it looks clear on the
other<00:02:31.790> side<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.690> can<00:02:32.720> see<00:02:32.900> it

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
other side you can see it

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.290 
other side you can see it
I<00:02:37.540> wanted<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.660> completely<00:02:39.080> black<00:02:39.440> background

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
I wanted a completely black background

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.160 
I wanted a completely black background
so<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.330> don't<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.540> what<00:02:41.660> I'll<00:02:41.750> do<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.019> that

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
so I don't know what I'll do with that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.660 
so I don't know what I'll do with that
stick<00:02:42.500> some<00:02:42.709> electrical<00:02:43.190> tape<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
stick some electrical tape to the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.840 
stick some electrical tape to the
outside<00:02:44.030> or<00:02:44.060> something<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.579> mean<00:02:46.579> I<00:02:46.670> don't

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
outside or something I mean I don't

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.220 
outside or something I mean I don't
think<00:02:47.030> it's<00:02:47.209> worth<00:02:47.360> complaining<00:02:47.690> over<00:02:50.230> tanks

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
think it's worth complaining over tanks

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.680 
think it's worth complaining over tanks
