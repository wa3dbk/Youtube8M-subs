00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.810
 today we are going to learn how to make a pendant 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.810
 for parties 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.690
 For this we will need the following 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:38.180
 Elements a lightweight stapler 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.890
 in a square of 20 x 20 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.590
 and a belt to hang 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.860
 we started the task 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 first we doubled in triangles of 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.280
 square 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.570
 then we double again 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.110
 we cut then 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.580
 one centimeter strips from the side 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.820
 what is 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.860
 open with closed side 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.050
 free 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.050
 we reach almost to the shore 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.700
 we start on the widest side as 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.700
 they will have seen 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.960
 once we finish cutting it what 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.230
 we open 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.340
 and we have this 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.440
 how will you see 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.850
 squared with all cuts made 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.619
 in the center we have a small square 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.980
 we're not going to see what we're going to leave 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.980
 we are going to take the second square 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.190
 above what we 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.210
 and with the dora brush 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.400
 then we turn the work on the side of 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.240
 back this would be the third square 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 over the vertices 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.280
 and we take advantage 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.580
 it seems that it is not very well worth another 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.580
 requirement 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.150
 we look and from the other side 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.670
 over mos 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.960
 the other the other two vertices 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.830
 we turn again 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.450
 and we join the other square 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.450
 always by the vertices 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.660
 we turn again 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.330
 and we continue in this way 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.730
 forever 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.730
 putting on top two the vertices 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.810
 to finish 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.810
 with the last square 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.349
 just as you are seeing it 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.709
 then we put a tape to hang 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.130
 and finished task 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.130
 nice truth
