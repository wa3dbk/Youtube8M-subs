put<00:00:17.449> Omega<00:00:17.779> threes<00:00:18.289> on<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.920> map<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:20.529> when

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
put Omega threes on the map and when

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.339 
put Omega threes on the map and when
this<00:00:21.650> all<00:00:21.859> began<00:00:22.279> happening<00:00:22.669> some<00:00:23.240> 35<00:00:23.839> 40

was<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:38.809> fish<00:00:39.020> oil<00:00:40.239> because<00:00:41.239> I<00:00:41.359> knew<00:00:41.570> something

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
was it fish oil because I knew something

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.830 
was it fish oil because I knew something
that<00:00:42.079> now<00:00:42.379> you're<00:00:42.649> going<00:00:42.769> to<00:00:42.859> know<00:00:43.039> that<00:00:43.840> fish

cancer-causing substance it actually

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.930 
cancer-causing substance it actually
turns<00:00:53.449> into<00:00:53.690> something<00:00:53.899> called<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.440> lipid

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
turns into something called a lipid

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.299 
turns into something called a lipid
peroxide<00:00:57.730> why<00:00:58.730> then<00:00:59.350> was<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:00.559> what<00:01:00.829> was<00:01:01.039> used

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
peroxide why then was this what was used

peroxide why then was this what was used
I<00:01:01.839> looked<00:01:02.839> back<00:01:03.050> 25<00:01:03.920> years<00:01:03.949> ago<00:01:05.230> fish<00:01:06.880> industry

I looked back 25 years ago fish industry

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.219 
I looked back 25 years ago fish industry
has<00:01:08.689> not<00:01:08.990> made<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:09.530> whole<00:01:10.100> lot<00:01:10.310> of<00:01:10.460> progress<00:01:11.229> as

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
has not made a whole lot of progress as

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.740 
has not made a whole lot of progress as
a<00:01:12.290> matter<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.619> fact<00:01:12.970> they<00:01:13.970> are<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.329> losing
