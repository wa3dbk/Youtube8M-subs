00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
painted in modular sections and it all

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.279 
painted in modular sections and it all
looks<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> grid<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.030> cannot<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
looks like a like a grid so I cannot I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
looks like a like a grid so I cannot I
could<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:01.829> over<00:01:02.010> almost<00:01:02.309> any<00:01:02.640> size<00:01:02.850> space

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
could take over almost any size space

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.870 
could take over almost any size space
you're<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.170> bring<00:01:04.409> large<00:01:04.619> images<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.700> me

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
lot of the work that I've been doing

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.210 
lot of the work that I've been doing
has<00:01:48.470> been<00:01:49.840> opposing<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.140> war<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.409> Iraq<00:01:51.770> so

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
there's still a lot of protists imagery

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.640 
there's still a lot of protists imagery
that<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.490> my<00:01:55.700> quiver<00:01:57.729> fortunately<00:01:58.729> we're

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
that is in my quiver fortunately we're

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.710 
that is in my quiver fortunately we're
starting<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.740> withdraw<00:02:01.750> from<00:02:02.750> Iraq<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.619> i

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
but a lot of my work is about

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.810 
but a lot of my work is about
questioning<00:02:15.710> Authority<00:02:18.520> promoting<00:02:19.520> peace

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
intended to have an ambiguity that just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.660 
intended to have an ambiguity that just
gets<00:02:42.570> people<00:02:42.930> thinking<00:02:43.050> about<00:02:43.650> what<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.460> this

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
gets people thinking about what is this

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.780 
gets people thinking about what is this
about<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.270> then<00:02:45.480> theoretically<00:02:46.610> just<00:02:47.610> based

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
about and then theoretically just based

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.190 
about and then theoretically just based

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
on the contacts eight starts maybe

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.540 
on the contacts eight starts maybe
question<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.830> other<00:02:49.920> things<00:02:50.190> there<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.490> day

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550

going<00:02:51.030> public<00:02:51.180> space<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.720> can<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.140> some

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
going public space you can for some

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.080 
going public space you can for some
specifically<00:02:52.980> topical<00:02:53.460> stuff<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.970> then

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
specifically topical stuff and then

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.210 
specifically topical stuff and then
there's<00:02:54.300> other<00:02:54.720> stuff<00:02:55.020> that's<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.860> designed

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
there's other stuff that's just designed

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.590 
there's other stuff that's just designed
to<00:02:56.630> raise<00:02:57.630> general<00:02:58.530> questions<00:02:59.600> everything

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
to raise general questions everything

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.740 
to raise general questions everything
that's<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.290> global<00:03:01.860> warming<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.750> you

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
that's going on global warming and you

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.870 
that's going on global warming and you
know<00:03:03.870> fossil<00:03:04.410> fuels<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.980> think<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.520> it's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
know fossil fuels I think that it's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.670 
know fossil fuels I think that it's
definitely<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.360> very<00:03:06.390> relevant<00:03:07.170> issue<00:03:07.440> to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
definitely a very relevant issue to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.130 
definitely a very relevant issue to
bring<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.360> think<00:03:09.570> for<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.810> United

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
bring up and I think for the United

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.250 
bring up and I think for the United
States<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:12.090> thing<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.720> maybe<00:03:12.960> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
States it's one thing that maybe the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.620 
States it's one thing that maybe the
left<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:13.710> can<00:03:14.070> agree<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.820> you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
left and the right can agree on the you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.750 
left and the right can agree on the you
know<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.900> save<00:03:16.110> save<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.680> planet<00:03:17.070> hippies

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
know the save save the planet hippies

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.350 
know the save save the planet hippies
can<00:03:18.300> say<00:03:19.490> clean<00:03:20.490> energy<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:20.940> good<00:03:21.150> for<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
can say clean energy is good for the

imperialists<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.120> say<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:25.200> technology

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
imperialists can say this technology

imperialists can say this technology
will<00:03:26.310> will<00:03:26.910> lead<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.330> us<00:03:27.540> having<00:03:27.840> something
