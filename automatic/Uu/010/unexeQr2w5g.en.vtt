00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.110 

then<00:00:13.650> magaz<00:00:13.950> our<00:00:14.100> leader<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.610> wind<00:00:14.910> power

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
then magaz our leader in wind power

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.170 
then magaz our leader in wind power
today<00:00:15.930> we<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.530> about<00:00:16.770> 20%<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.550> our

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
today we have about 20% of our

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.210 
today we have about 20% of our
electricity<00:00:18.270> coming<00:00:18.930> from<00:00:19.050> wind<00:00:19.440> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
electricity coming from wind the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.040 
electricity coming from wind the
characteristic<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.449> home<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.930> this

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
characteristic of one home is that this

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.350 
characteristic of one home is that this
is<00:00:22.200> a<00:00:22.230> small<00:00:22.560> island<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.790> we<00:00:23.940> have<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
is a small island so we have here a

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.420 
is a small island so we have here a
controlled<00:00:24.840> environment<00:00:25.440> and<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.280> a<00:00:26.310> lot

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
controlled environment and we have a lot

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.430 
controlled environment and we have a lot
of<00:00:26.460> wind<00:00:26.730> energy<00:00:26.940> upon<00:00:27.660> home<00:00:27.900> also

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
of wind energy upon home also

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.290 
of wind energy upon home also
so<00:00:28.950> in<00:00:29.070> Denmark<00:00:29.430> on<00:00:29.550> average<00:00:29.850> we<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.120> about

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so in Denmark on average we have about

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.650 
so in Denmark on average we have about
20%<00:00:30.840> wind<00:00:31.770> energy<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.369> our<00:00:32.640> grid<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.510> pond

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
20% wind energy in our grid but on pond

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.049 
20% wind energy in our grid but on pond
home<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> almost<00:00:34.260> 50%<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.700> an<00:00:35.760> ideal

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
home is almost 50% so this is an ideal

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.390 
home is almost 50% so this is an ideal
environment<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:36.870> us<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.620> test<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.130> small

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
environment for us to test in a small

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.819 
environment for us to test in a small
scale<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.030> balancing<00:00:39.930> between<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
scale the balancing between the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.729 
scale the balancing between the
electrical<00:00:41.700> cars<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.240> the<00:00:42.900> create<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.320> lot<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
electrical cars and the create a lot of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.970 
electrical cars and the create a lot of
renewable<00:00:44.280> energy<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:46.440> reason<00:00:46.829> why

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
renewable energy in it the reason why

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.550 
renewable energy in it the reason why
it's<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:48.300> good<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.320> demonstration

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
it's very good to do the demonstration

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.100 
it's very good to do the demonstration
in<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.460> home<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.880> because<00:00:51.540> first<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.960> have

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
in from home is because first we have

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.800 
in from home is because first we have
short<00:00:52.410> distances<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:54.090> home<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.630> we<00:00:54.780> are

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
short distances from home because we are

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.130 
short distances from home because we are
an<00:00:54.960> island<00:00:55.250> quite<00:00:56.250> small<00:00:56.520> island<00:00:56.910> also<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:58.020> are

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
an island quite small island also we are

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.979 
an island quite small island also we are
able<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.620> disconnect<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.730> sea<00:00:59.940> cable<00:01:00.420> just

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
able to disconnect the sea cable just

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.260 
able to disconnect the sea cable just
reading<00:01:01.380> so<00:01:01.860> that<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.790> call<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
reading so that we are in what we call a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.709 
reading so that we are in what we call a
learning<00:01:03.480> mode<00:01:04.100> this<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.369> lot<00:01:06.149> of<00:01:06.329> 2

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
learning mode this is a lot of 2

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.860 
learning mode this is a lot of 2
megawatt<00:01:07.380> wind<00:01:07.740> turbine<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.759> modern<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
megawatt wind turbine and modern in the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.350 
megawatt wind turbine and modern in the
sense<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.440> we<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.740> able<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.310> control<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
sense that we are able to control the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.890 
sense that we are able to control the
effects<00:01:12.840> given<00:01:13.830> from<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> wind<00:01:14.460> turbine<00:01:14.940> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
effects given from the wind turbine so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.230 
effects given from the wind turbine so
that<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.200> could<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.560> say<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.180> we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
that we could actually say right now we

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.480 
that we could actually say right now we
only<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.350> maker<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> wind

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
only want one maker what from the wind

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
only want one maker what from the wind
turbine<00:01:20.940> even<00:01:21.869> though<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.229> able<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:22.590> produce

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
turbine even though it's able to produce

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.539 
turbine even though it's able to produce
two<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.930> one<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> reasons<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.220> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
two and one of the reasons to do this is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
two and one of the reasons to do this is
if<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.390> better<00:01:27.659> Pella<00:01:28.170> Singh<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
if it's better Pella Singh the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.390 
if it's better Pella Singh the
consumption<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> production<00:01:30.860> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.190> do

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
consumption and the production if you do

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
consumption and the production if you do
not<00:01:32.580> have<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> possibility<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.650> have

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
not have the possibility to to have

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
not have the possibility to to have
someone<00:01:35.220> using<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.060> power<00:01:36.299> produced<00:01:36.570> from

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
someone using the power produced from

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960 
someone using the power produced from
the<00:01:37.140> winter<00:01:37.500> months<00:01:37.830> we<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.580> eventually

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the winter months we will eventually

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.190 
the winter months we will eventually
have<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> turn<00:01:40.140> them<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:41.580> simply<00:01:42.420> let<00:01:42.990> them

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
have to turn them off to simply let them

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.859 
have to turn them off to simply let them
stop<00:01:43.530> running<00:01:44.010> if<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.880> wind<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.240> blowing<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
stop running if the wind is blowing and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.109 
stop running if the wind is blowing and
we<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.500> anyone<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.220> take<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
we do not have anyone to take the the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.020 
we do not have anyone to take the the
excess<00:01:48.479> power<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:50.640> doing<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
excess power so what we're doing is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210 
excess power so what we're doing is
actually<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.229> intelligent

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
actually to make this the intelligent

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.539 
actually to make this the intelligent
solutions<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:55.080> enable<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.680> good<00:01:55.950> interaction

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
solutions that enable a good interaction

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.390 
solutions that enable a good interaction
between<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.140> vehicles<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.220> power

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
between the the vehicles and the power

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.219 
between the the vehicles and the power
system

future power system I think that's
that's<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:46.739> exciting<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.489> see<00:02:47.700> the
