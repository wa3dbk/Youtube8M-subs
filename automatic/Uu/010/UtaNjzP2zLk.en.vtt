00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
communication through tennis through

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.500 
communication through tennis through
school<00:02:34.020> through<00:02:34.950> fitness<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.850> those<00:02:36.390> are

school through fitness and those are

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.210 
school through fitness and those are
kind<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.780> main<00:02:36.959> things<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.440> I've<00:02:37.680> grown

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
kind of the main things that I've grown

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:54.890 
kind of the main things that I've grown
from

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.940 

think<00:02:55.900> what<00:02:56.020> I'm<00:02:56.110> going<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.260> miss<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.530> most<00:02:56.680> is

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
think what I'm going to miss the most is

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.120 
think what I'm going to miss the most is
just<00:02:58.050> spending<00:02:59.050> time<00:02:59.080> on<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.739> tennis<00:03:00.069> court

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
just spending time on a tennis court

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.660 
just spending time on a tennis court
with<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.400> team<00:03:00.780> we've<00:03:01.780> become<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.319> close

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
with a team we've become so close

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.520 
with a team we've become so close
through<00:03:03.670> tennis<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.360> then<00:03:04.480> off<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.260> court

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
through tennis and then off the court

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.900 
through tennis and then off the court
it's<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:05.860> all<00:03:06.069> we<00:03:06.190> want<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.640> hang<00:03:06.790> out

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
it's like all we want to do is hang out

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.150 
it's like all we want to do is hang out
with<00:03:06.970> each<00:03:07.090> other<00:03:07.330> now<00:03:07.599> if<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.260> want<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.830> hang

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
with each other now if I want to hang

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.320 
with each other now if I want to hang
out<00:03:09.220> with<00:03:09.280> my<00:03:09.430> friends<00:03:09.790> there<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> first

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
out with my friends there the first

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.479 
out with my friends there the first
person<00:03:10.660> I'm<00:03:10.750> going<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.930> call<00:03:11.080> my<00:03:11.110> teammates<00:03:11.709> so

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
person I'm going to call my teammates so

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.040 
person I'm going to call my teammates so
I<00:03:12.520> think<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:12.940> whole<00:03:13.030> tennis<00:03:13.480> aspect<00:03:13.930> has

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
I think just the whole tennis aspect has

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.670 
I think just the whole tennis aspect has
really<00:03:14.319> brought<00:03:14.560> us<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.040> close

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.350 

learning<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.770> crowds<00:03:24.040> I'd<00:03:24.610> say<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.060> it's

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
learning the crowds I'd say that it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.350 
learning the crowds I'd say that it's
made<00:03:25.660> me<00:03:25.840> care<00:03:26.320> even<00:03:26.530> more<00:03:27.090> whether<00:03:28.090> they're

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
made me care even more whether they're

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.480 
made me care even more whether they're
big<00:03:28.540> or<00:03:28.660> small<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.350> fact<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.710> they<00:03:30.190> loved

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
big or small the fact that they loved

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.910 
big or small the fact that they loved
Mississippi<00:03:31.330> State<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:31.750> much<00:03:31.960> or<00:03:32.260> they<00:03:32.710> loved

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
Mississippi State so much or they loved

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.040 
Mississippi State so much or they loved
the<00:03:33.250> tennis<00:03:33.550> program<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.120> much<00:03:34.330> it's<00:03:34.600> made<00:03:34.780> me

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
the tennis program so much it's made me

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.870 
the tennis program so much it's made me
want<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.740> try<00:03:35.860> harder<00:03:36.310> not<00:03:36.490> just<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:36.760> myself

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
want to try harder not just for myself

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.930 
want to try harder not just for myself
but<00:03:37.210> for<00:03:37.390> them<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.710> it<00:03:38.950> makes<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.250> even<00:03:39.370> less<00:03:39.730> of

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
but for them so it makes it even less of

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.150 
but for them so it makes it even less of
an<00:03:40.000> individual<00:03:40.600> sport<00:03:40.720> with<00:03:41.590> fans<00:03:41.890> there

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
an individual sport with fans there

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.560 
an individual sport with fans there
because<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.490> can<00:03:42.640> hear<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.180> can<00:03:43.360> hear

and I play for them sometimes when it's

00:03:48.310 --> 00:04:00.010 
and I play for them sometimes when it's
hard<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:48.700> find<00:03:48.910> motivation<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.540> myself
