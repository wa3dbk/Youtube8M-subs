 which is also a park that still conserves 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.309
 some of the attractions that their 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.620

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.100
 many pictures I made in hollywood at the 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.750

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.750
 people that I have in front and behind 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.110
 do not wait for the one in the back to carry forward 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.840
 so you can see all these people all the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.159
 world goes to the central park a place to which 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.140

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.470
 book time to enter the area 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.080
 The theme of the garden potter I repeat 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.179
 book an hour to be able to enter a 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.600
 thematic area because this is always going to 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.430
 burst in half of people since 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.500
 my mother what atmosphere the 10 of the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.760

 we go there 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.190
 I'm sweating like chickens still because 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.650
 it is important to run at this time 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.690
 everything to be able to book the ticket for 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.780

 seen a map and well we are yes already what 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.480
 I see already I see it we are very high 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.840
 this park that pretends to be the central 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.030
 New York park was once an area 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.069
 to be able to walk and take pictures and we 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.349
 has become a macro area of 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.780
 wait to book tickets 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.150
 of Harry Potter are the needs of 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.829
 asia right now happens to japan so much 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.530
 with universal as with disney that the 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.970
 number of visitors is spectacular and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.140
 very soon the disney will 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.780
 shanghai in fact already is 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.970
 designing with gigantic spaces for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.070
 to be able to welcome so many people 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.710
 We already have the ticket if you see it here 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.320
 this means that between 12 and 50 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.480
 and the 1350 we go to the door of the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.700
 Harry Potter area and they will let us pass 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.800
 to the person who does not have these tickets 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.330
 that many can not enter the area 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.430
 that is, they can visit the rest of the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.830
 universal park but they will not be able 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.350
 visit the harry potter area are 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.140
 thousands and thousands of people every day 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.490
 entering the harry potter area so 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.620
 we have the ticket I'm going to keep it as 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.900
 if it were gold and now we're going to go if the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.690
 I find that my attraction 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.200
 favorite in the whole world that only 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.730
 is in universal orlando and here so 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.310
 I want to show you why in Orlando 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.790
 take us the video camera 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.099
 yes, no matter how much the mochilita bothers me 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.709
 from behind but good today how nice 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.569
 Look, look what kind of cuca da or quÃ© 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.720
 frikada depending on how you look at what 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.640
 they look like the flowers and you see it 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.260
 there is the very geek made with flowers 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.540
 but then I'll show you around 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.030
 because now while very running with 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.640
 Hurry I saw that the shark was 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.310
 hung from the shark attraction with 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.310
 a kind of flower scarf 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.810
 Christmas that can only happen in Japan 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:28.120
 a mother of mine see you here 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.070
 this good tree now does not say much 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.050
 although it 's huge too but this tree 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.180
 when they light it at night it has the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.479
 Guiness record for the third or fourth year 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.130
 consecutive to be the most tree 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.200
 illuminated the world the one that contains more 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.590
 light bulbs but that we left for more 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.360
 late let's go to a spider-man here 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.950
 we are at the door of spider mind a 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.780
 awesome attraction I'll try 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.190
 enter now there is an advantage to come 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.740
 only to disney theme parks 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.840
 universal day here behind you can see the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.380
 normal queue that are now 110 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.730
 minutes of waiting 110 minutes 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.260
 however just there is no other entry 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.510
 which is called single riders is for the 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.940
 people like me not single but that 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.830
 we come alone to come alone we have a 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.020
 wait at the most 10 minutes because 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.620
 with us they fill the seats like this 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.050
 that we're going, I can not even think about his parents 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:24.180
 I love to come alone the parks I'm not going 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:29.870
 to do nothing of tail over two hours 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.870
 I 'm leaving because with the sun 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.600
 d 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.230
 morning 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.290
 and spider man spider man what piece of 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.300
 attractions that is that is impressive 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.940
 I never thought he was going to try me in Japan 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.680
 when I tried the one from Orlando and I know 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.300
 it became my favorite attraction of the 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.640
 whole world I said I do not think I can 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.860
 come back but not here I'm in japan and what 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.020
 I just tried is exactly the same 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.080
 spectacular is that I love 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.120
 are fritz cars are glimpsed and now 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.220
 true, well, the truth is that 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.570
 carlos four dimensions in 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.160
 the ones you go with 3d glasses and you go 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.900
 moving through a path 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.610
 then they mix so much effects of 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.660
 real fire with water effect with 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.340
 movement turns at full speed 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.080
 giant screens and also here 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.420
 specifically in this park there is the 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.540
 novelty that the big screens of 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.190
 the attraction are in 4k quality 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.830
 which is the highest quality that exists today 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.390
 commercially it 's an attraction 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.860
 I really recommend you 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.390
 Now what we are going to do is go to 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.650
 attractions that do not have the tail without 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.660
 ryder because they are the ones that 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.680
 interesting the first one where I do 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.570
 that I will have to wait with the 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.370
 also and then later in the afternoon I'll go to 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.520
 all those that good by the fact of going 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.840
 they are only less wait is yesterday 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.760
 way had sir ryder but if I 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.080
 I could resist I had to ride me already 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.300
 because it's my favorite I told you 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.890
 Now I'm going to see some of those 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.810
 attractions than in other parks 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.370
 universal have already replaced them with 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.310
 new attractions like back to the 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.960
 future as a shark for example I'm going to 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.520
 look for the way back I do not know why 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.080
 has sold in this alley that in fact 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.790
 This alley is've been in the 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.190
 original in the alley that is in the 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.510
 studies of the warner in hollywood that 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.130
 You also saw it in the good video 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.720
 completely that part did not but I put it 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.970
 in pictures 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.470
 and brings back memories all is that no callus 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.570
 in the parks I do not call it sure that in the 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:33.320
 Tokyo video do not talk so much but here 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:36.050
