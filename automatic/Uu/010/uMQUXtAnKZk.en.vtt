00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 I'm experimenting with it 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.069
 Pretty pretty flowers happen like that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:15.480
 I want to show you that now 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:20.600
 I start with a knot put you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:27.460
 crochet hook in and 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:31.520
 much air mesh 1234 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.700
 I make air round in which I use it 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 the first machines stab in pans 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.790
 Get it and go through it again 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.320
 make chain stitches then I do one 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:49.610
 air mesh and daily in the middle of 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.059
 this circle ten fixed meshes 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.230
 So a stinging drive back and through 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:07.780
 Pull both sleep 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:07.780
 that is 12345 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.040
 this color I no longer need the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.970
 I can take off 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.590
 I suffer the round now in that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.390
 I with the new color the chains 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.550
 Masche does that mean I count back 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.530
 12 34 and pierce the first stitch 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.140
 take care that they do not air mass 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:50.430
 get caught thread through the 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.990
 first solid mass and by the thread 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:02.920
 that could tighten and with 1 5 now 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 I'm mesh 1234 air and then a 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.430
 double chopsticks a double 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 Pulled chopsticks I make two 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.740
 envelopes sting 1 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.300
 I stab here 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.060
 where you still have the purple thread 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:25.810
 looks in the same stitch a sting 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:28.480
 you pull through 2 by two and pull 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.340
 a third time through two aim that 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.080
 I repeat in the same way 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.560
 make another double stick 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.590
 through two and again through two and 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.030
 then a third time twice envelope 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.019
 pick sting thread 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.360
 by two by two and a third 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:54.580
 times by two now I turn the am 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.410
 Best on the side and I do 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.470
 an envelope again and enter 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:06.220
 whole city ​​moment a whole 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:08.410
 This way, between the three 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.739
 double chopsticks under air masses 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.570
 chain I make a whole city so 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:19.959
 I pick thread through coal in the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.830
 a little high so this fan should 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.100
 be a little longer then by two and 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.799
 Two more, I'll do four 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:35.070
 more times so that only in total 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.070
 five whole city has 1 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 23 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:53.110
 a little 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.110
 pull up 4 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.730
 that gave 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.030
 you can only distribute then I leave 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.570
 one out and into the next I do 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:23.330
 a chain stitch and that's it 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:28.480
 first petal much air mesh 1 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.480
 224 then three double sticks 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.460
 hierum I make five whole little town 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.220
 You can grazie one again 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.680
 leave out and in the following one 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.970
 chain stitch finished is the next one 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.919
 petal and the next 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.620
 He could bloom alone 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.440
 carry on and the last we see 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.940
 U.S. again 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.940
 Here I have the last petal 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:27.610
 heard and now I'm not stuck here 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:30.260
 not here but there 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.090
 where I double the first five 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.840
 There I stabbed 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:40.220
 a hole in colors and finished with one 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:43.940
 I pull the chains and the thread 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.400
