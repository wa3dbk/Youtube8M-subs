also<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:52.590> bottom<00:01:53.040> piece<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:57.079> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
also this bottom piece right here is a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.940 
also this bottom piece right here is a
little<00:01:58.500> bit<00:01:58.619> loose<00:01:59.600> see<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.140> easily

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
little bit loose see that it's easily

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.649 
little bit loose see that it's easily
pull<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.520> mean<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.790> guess<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
pull I mean I guess they have to that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.880 
pull I mean I guess they have to that
because<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.079> has<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.409> able<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.649> pulled

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
because it has to be able to be pulled

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340 
because it has to be able to be pulled
off<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:05.579> loops<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.600> not

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
off but it's really loops I think not

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.779 
off but it's really loops I think not
really<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:07.799> loose<00:02:08.099> enough<00:02:08.280> where<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.520> can<00:02:08.550> just

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
really but loose enough where I can just

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.110 
really but loose enough where I can just
barely<00:02:09.509> higher<00:02:10.259> pressure

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
barely higher pressure

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.120 
barely higher pressure
it<00:02:12.120> shows<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.870> don't<00:02:13.020> like<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.790> I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
it shows that so I don't like that I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.980 
it shows that so I don't like that I
think<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.390> symbol<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
think I do not like the symbol on the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.040 
think I do not like the symbol on the
