reading<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.420> textbook<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.379> who's<00:00:52.710> reading

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
of debt when we're about to go and file

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.539 
of debt when we're about to go and file
bankruptcy<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.590> think<00:02:09.950> he'll<00:02:10.069> be<00:02:10.190> ranked

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
bankruptcy you think he'll be ranked

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.369 
bankruptcy you think he'll be ranked
higher<00:02:10.700> than<00:02:10.729> save<00:02:11.299> George<00:02:11.780> Washington

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
higher than save George Washington

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.309 
higher than save George Washington
probably<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:14.000> had<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> slavery<00:02:14.750> yet<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.290> I

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
probably so we had a slavery yet but I

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.740 
probably so we had a slavery yet but I
think<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.890> was<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> turnaround<00:02:16.670> with<00:02:17.180> this

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
think it was a turnaround with this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.600 
think it was a turnaround with this
health<00:02:18.230> care<00:02:18.440> thing<00:02:18.500> everything<00:02:19.250> that
