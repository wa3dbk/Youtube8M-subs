00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
very serious problem it's not that we're

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.940 
very serious problem it's not that we're
heavy-handed<00:01:11.659> with<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.810> salt<00:01:12.140> shaker<00:01:12.439> it's

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
heavy-handed with the salt shaker it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.679 
heavy-handed with the salt shaker it's
been<00:01:13.159> most<00:01:13.430> of<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.700> salt<00:01:13.939> we<00:01:14.060> consume<00:01:14.479> is

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
been most of the salt we consume is

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.450 
been most of the salt we consume is
actually<00:01:15.080> cooked<00:01:15.380> into<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.830> foods<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:16.250> bought

actually cooked into the foods we bought

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.220 
actually cooked into the foods we bought
so<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.479> amount<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.840> salt<00:01:18.110> you're

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
so this is the amount of salt you're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.470

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
very serious problem it's not that we're

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.720 
very serious problem it's not that we're
heavy-handed<00:02:57.410> with<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> salt<00:02:57.920> shaker<00:02:58.190> it's
