vintage<00:00:15.780> lens<00:00:16.289> doe<00:00:16.619> however<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:18.359> could<00:00:18.570> be

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
vintage lens doe however it could be

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660 
vintage lens doe however it could be
both<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.289> maybe<00:00:20.160> I'll<00:00:20.340> be<00:00:20.460> able<00:00:20.550> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
both because maybe I'll be able to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.519 
both because maybe I'll be able to
afford<00:00:21.470> new<00:00:22.470> lenses<00:00:22.890> someday<00:00:23.400> who<00:00:23.880> knows

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
afford new lenses someday who knows

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.450 
afford new lenses someday who knows
anyways<00:00:25.789> this<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.390> Vivitar<00:00:28.260> 24<00:00:29.130> millimeter

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
anyways this is a Vivitar 24 millimeter

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.709 
anyways this is a Vivitar 24 millimeter
f/2<00:00:30.050> multi-code<00:00:31.050> wide-angle<00:00:31.710> lens<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:33.570> is

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
f/2 multi-code wide-angle lens and it is

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:43.430 
f/2 multi-code wide-angle lens and it is
on<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> Sony<00:00:35.059> NEX<00:00:36.469> 6<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:40.050> am<00:00:40.110> using<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:42.440> Chinese

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
on a Sony NEX 6 and I am using a Chinese

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.619 
on a Sony NEX 6 and I am using a Chinese
speed<00:00:44.100> booster<00:00:44.520> they<00:00:44.700> call<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> Lin's<00:00:45.180> turbo

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
speed booster they call it a Lin's turbo

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.340 
speed booster they call it a Lin's turbo
but<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:47.120> meta<00:00:48.120> bones<00:00:48.360> invented<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
but really meta bones invented these and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
but really meta bones invented these and
they<00:00:49.620> basically<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.760> perform<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
they basically make it perform like a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.889 
they basically make it perform like a
full<00:00:52.469> frame<00:00:52.680> lens<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> aps-c<00:00:53.820> sensor<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
full frame lens on a aps-c sensor so I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
full frame lens on a aps-c sensor so I
get<00:00:55.250> pretty<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.520> close<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:58.129> did<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> math

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
get pretty much close to I did the math

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.700 
get pretty much close to I did the math
it<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.789> something<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.300> 27<00:01:00.899> millimeter

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it was something like 27 millimeter

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.310 
it was something like 27 millimeter
compared<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:04.379> was<00:01:04.640> whatever<00:01:05.640> 1.5<00:01:06.330> x<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> 24

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
compared to it was whatever 1.5 x to 24

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.880 
compared to it was whatever 1.5 x to 24
is<00:01:08.090> was<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> original<00:01:09.479> crop<00:01:09.659> factor<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.350> this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
is was the original crop factor if this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.039 
is was the original crop factor if this
is<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> dumb<00:01:11.490> adapter<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.240> anyways<00:01:12.510> go

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is on a dumb adapter but anyways go

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.210 
is on a dumb adapter but anyways go
ahead<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.260> take<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.380> off<00:01:15.020> there's<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.220> lens

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
ahead and take it off there's the lens

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
ahead and take it off there's the lens
inside<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> lens<00:01:18.110> inception<00:01:19.189> it's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:21.110> nice

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
inside the lens inception it's a nice

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.539 
inside the lens inception it's a nice
little<00:01:22.259> multi-coat<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
little multi-coat thing there it's a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
little multi-coat thing there it's a
really<00:01:24.150> good<00:01:24.299> adapter<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.170> recommend

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
really good adapter I really recommend

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.249 
really good adapter I really recommend
these<00:01:25.680> I'll<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.250> using<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.810> quite<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> lot

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
these I'll be using it for quite a lot

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
these I'll be using it for quite a lot
of<00:01:28.290> these<00:01:28.979> videos<00:01:29.310> coming<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:32.090> here's<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
of these videos coming up so here's the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.850 
of these videos coming up so here's the
back<00:01:33.450> rear<00:01:33.840> Elnett<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.070> lens<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
back rear Elnett of this lens that the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.319 
back rear Elnett of this lens that the
EOS<00:01:37.860> m<00:01:38.009> try<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> focus<00:01:39.710> if<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.189> yeah<00:01:42.180> there

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
EOS m try to focus if it can yeah there

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.460 
EOS m try to focus if it can yeah there
goes<00:01:42.409> just<00:01:43.409> takes<00:01:43.590> time<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:46.290> can

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
goes just takes time when and you can

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.630 
goes just takes time when and you can
see<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> f2<00:01:48.619> 2.8<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.399> all<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
see it as it is f2 2.8 and then all the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.789 
see it as it is f2 2.8 and then all the
way<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.170> f-16<00:01:52.200> 1/2<00:01:53.100> clicks<00:01:53.720> nice<00:01:54.799> resistance

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
way to f-16 1/2 clicks nice resistance

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.399 
way to f-16 1/2 clicks nice resistance
pretty<00:01:56.070> much<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.369> any<00:01:56.490> good<00:01:57.360> vivitar<00:01:58.170> lens

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
pretty much like any good vivitar lens

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.149 
pretty much like any good vivitar lens
from<00:01:58.799> 70s<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.610> 80s<00:02:00.290> strongly<00:02:01.290> solid<00:02:01.979> build

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
from 70s and 80s strongly solid build

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.130 
from 70s and 80s strongly solid build
quality<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:03.180> damped<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.570> focus<00:02:03.960> right

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
quality pretty damped and focus right

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.980 
quality pretty damped and focus right
here<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.240> ring<00:02:06.450> does<00:02:06.780> not

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
here as you can see the ring does not

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.780 
here as you can see the ring does not
move<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> front<00:02:09.239> barrel<00:02:09.599> extends<00:02:10.790> now

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
move just the front barrel extends now

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.220 
move just the front barrel extends now
as<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.180> see

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
as you can see

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.559 
as you can see
that<00:02:13.980> front<00:02:14.250> element<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.819> absolutely

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
that front element is absolutely

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.860 
that front element is absolutely
gorgeous<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.849> as<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.000> notice<00:02:18.360> he<00:02:18.510> ate<00:02:18.599> number

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
gorgeous and as you notice he ate number

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.640 
gorgeous and as you notice he ate number
22<00:02:19.430> cereal<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.599> 28<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.409> would<00:02:22.530> be

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
22 cereal so if it was a 28 it would be

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.100 
22 cereal so if it was a 28 it would be
the<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.099> think<00:02:23.459> more<00:02:23.670> preferred<00:02:24.150> coalmine

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
the I think more preferred coalmine

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.809 
the I think more preferred coalmine
version<00:02:25.470> there<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> little<00:02:25.769> bit<00:02:26.190> more<00:02:26.250> famous

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
version there a little bit more famous

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.979 
version there a little bit more famous
of<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:27.030> factory<00:02:28.910> however<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.360> not<00:02:30.599> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
of a factory however it is not the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.589 
of a factory however it is not the
coalmine<00:02:31.319> version<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.400> by<00:02:34.280> I'll<00:02:35.280> put<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.420> in

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
coalmine version it is by I'll put it in

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.869 
coalmine version it is by I'll put it in
the<00:02:36.989> subtitle<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.250> don't<00:02:38.760> remember
