00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello everyone with you plunger and this is my 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.970
 new podcast and first of all i want 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.139
 apologize for not taking so long 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.289
 video well, somewhere around three months should 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 say and why is it so long not me 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.210
 there were but many reasons and the first of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.640
 them that the computer broke 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 that is, as if I broke down like starting 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 computer talk about let's run 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.809
 and he writes me so arrogant but sorry 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.320
 can't run please delete all 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 files to restart the system i 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.180
 I think what kind of garbage, well, in general, together 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.870
 I had to reinstall with my father 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.300
 fully windows and upgrade to version 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.370
 8.1 second reason father installed 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 server storage what is it 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.699
 ask you now show this one 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.890
 unit which is called server 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.840
 the storage is also attached to it 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 keyboard standard some kind of logitek 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:17.759
 and built the mouse guys pripi embed 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:23.090
 the mouse on the keyboard is an achievement that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 this thing does with it you can 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.409
 browse through 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.400
 Kintso is right here even as easy 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.799
 see there is another blu-ray icon that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.630
 Of course, very good because Kintso 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.509
 can be viewed will be in large 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 quality and you can not use at all 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.920
 9 wheels because you can safely 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:54.329
 display desktop image 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.549
 quietly on the tv and download 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.340
 any movie torrent 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.479
 But this unit will be all this 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.520
 show what is happening on the screen 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.480
 computer on tv 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.510
 stupidly you press 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.370
 to play kintsa when she 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.780
 booted and all using this 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.380
 unit watching a movie on the box why 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.560
 we've been doing this for so long of course 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.690
 this is the obvious answer because pop 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.310
 I have a job studying 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.550
 that's the reason for postponing the review 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 of course were well now on the computer 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.690
 everything is there and you can safely do reviews 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.130
 shoot whatever you want and third 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.470
 I had a reason for this 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:53.890
 furry friend 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:58.150
 waved his foot feel free to call it 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.090

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.110

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.810
