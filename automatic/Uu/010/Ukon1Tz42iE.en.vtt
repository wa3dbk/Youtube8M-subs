00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:29.349 
internet is capped so basically what

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.980 
internet is capped so basically what
I've<00:01:29.440> done<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:29.619> is<00:01:30.099> I<00:01:30.190> have<00:01:30.869> created<00:01:31.869> myself

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
I've done here is I have created myself

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.979 
I've done here is I have created myself
a<00:01:32.440> small<00:01:33.069> gateway<00:01:33.819> until<00:01:34.300> it<00:01:34.420> gets<00:01:34.599> reset

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:34.989 
a small gateway until it gets reset

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.199 
a small gateway until it gets reset
which<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.289> in<00:01:35.440> two<00:01:35.649> days<00:01:35.679> time<00:01:36.369> I've<00:01:36.910> given

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
which is in two days time I've given

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.510 
which is in two days time I've given
myself<00:01:37.360> about<00:01:37.959> 32<00:01:38.560> gigabytes<00:01:39.039> I<00:01:39.130> believe<00:01:39.399> of

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
myself about 32 gigabytes I believe of

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.639 
myself about 32 gigabytes I believe of
download<00:01:39.910> limit<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.810> next<00:01:41.050> two<00:01:41.229> days<00:01:41.259> or

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
download limit for the next two days or

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.190 
download limit for the next two days or
so<00:01:41.800> just<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.099> give<00:01:42.190> myself<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.670> small<00:01:43.000> window<00:01:43.209> to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
so just to give myself a small window to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.960 
so just to give myself a small window to
practically<00:01:44.709> put<00:01:44.950> out<00:01:45.130> this<00:01:45.280> channel<00:01:45.700> update

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
practically put out this channel update

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.430 
practically put out this channel update
and<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.209> ensure<00:01:46.509> that<00:01:46.630> i<00:01:46.720> can<00:01:46.869> keep<00:01:47.080> collecting

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
and to ensure that i can keep collecting

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
a harasser race on the test server now

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.050 
a harasser race on the test server now
the<00:02:44.990> reason<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.530> I've<00:02:45.710> chosen<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.250> server<00:02:46.760> is

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
the reason that I've chosen a server is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.199 
the reason that I've chosen a server is
simply<00:02:47.600> because<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.350> should<00:02:49.100> be<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.640> quietest

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
simply because it should be the quietest

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.090 
simply because it should be the quietest
and<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.900> should<00:02:51.170> provide<00:02:51.320> us<00:02:51.650> with<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.920> least

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and it should provide us with the least

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.949 
and it should provide us with the least
amount<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.520> complications<00:02:53.330> at<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.720> given

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
amount of complications at the given

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.270 
amount of complications at the given
point<00:02:54.020> in<00:02:54.230> time<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.650> if<00:02:54.800> we<00:02:54.950> go<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.160> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
point in time you know if we go to a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.910
