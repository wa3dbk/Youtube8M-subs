00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450 
videos and so far I think you have a
really<00:00:19.050> good<00:00:19.230> mix<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.220> still

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
really good mix going but I'm still

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
really good mix going but I'm still
thinking<00:00:20.580> about<00:00:20.820> adding<00:00:21.150> maybe<00:00:21.449> something

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
thinking about adding maybe something

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.810 
thinking about adding maybe something
else<00:00:22.080> as<00:00:22.380> well<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.430> pondering

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
else as well and that was like pondering

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.340 
else as well and that was like pondering
the<00:00:23.939> question<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> couple<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> days<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the question of for a couple of days and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
the question of for a couple of days and
i<00:00:25.439> thought<00:00:25.619> i<00:00:25.859> might<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.220> well<00:00:26.400> ask<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.760> guys

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
i thought i might as well ask you guys

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
i thought i might as well ask you guys
what<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.330> would<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
what you would like to have I think that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.500 
what you would like to have I think that
the<00:00:28.830> mix<00:00:29.010> right<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.699> good<00:00:30.000> but

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the mix right now is really good but

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.959 
the mix right now is really good but
what<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.109> could<00:00:31.380> maybe<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.099> also<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.759> put

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
what we could maybe do is also like put

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
what we could maybe do is also like put
a<00:00:33.000> video<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.300> every<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.960> week<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.500> everly<00:00:34.800> 10

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.469 
I wanted to do an FAQ the problem is
that<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.520> never<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.880> got<00:01:17.970> around<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that I never really got around to that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.600 
that I never really got around to that
because<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.470> afterwards<00:01:19.950> super<00:01:20.310> busy

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
because I was then afterwards super busy

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.249 
because I was then afterwards super busy
with<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> apartment<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> everything<00:01:21.840> else

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
with the apartment and everything else

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.810 
with the apartment and everything else
and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.560> kinda<00:01:22.799> underestimated<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.729> bit

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and I kinda underestimated a little bit

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.210 
and I kinda underestimated a little bit
so<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.210> never<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:24.689> did<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.890> always

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so I never really did that but I always

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.130 
so I never really did that but I always
get<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> couple<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> questions<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.479> stream<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
get a couple of questions on stream and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
get a couple of questions on stream and
when<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.439> my<00:01:28.619> life<00:01:28.770> streaming<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> was

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
when I do my life streaming and I was

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.770 
when I do my life streaming and I was
just<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.820> wondering<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.509> might<00:01:30.659> be

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
just like wondering if that might be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.300 
just like wondering if that might be
something<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> would<00:01:31.380> prefer<00:01:31.650> just

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
something that you would prefer just

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.039 
something that you would prefer just
like<00:01:32.549> having<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> video<00:01:33.180> where<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> address<00:01:33.840> one

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
different idea of what why we could do

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.889 
different idea of what why we could do
on<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> channel<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.299> definitely<00:01:54.659> let<00:01:54.869> me

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
on the channel then definitely let me

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.749 
on the channel then definitely let me
know<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.560> course<00:01:55.680> always<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.009> matter<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.369> how

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
know is of course always a matter of how

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.249 
know is of course always a matter of how
much<00:01:56.820> editing<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.020> involved

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
much editing is going to be involved

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.899 
much editing is going to be involved
with<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> how<00:01:59.040> complicated<00:01:59.369> would<00:01:59.790> be

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
with that and how complicated would be

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.100 
with that and how complicated would be
to<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.899> regular

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to really put that out on a regular

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.590 
to really put that out on a regular
basis<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.799> mean<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.189> I'm<00:02:02.850> still<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.270> man<00:02:03.420> army

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
basis I mean as I'm still a one man army

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.289 
basis I mean as I'm still a one man army
so<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.649> try<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.880> course<00:02:06.090> are

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
so I try what I can but of course are

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.300 
so I try what I can but of course are
the<00:02:06.329> out<00:02:06.509> certain<00:02:06.810> limits<00:02:07.229> besides<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the out certain limits besides that I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
weeks but on the second channel I could

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.840 
weeks but on the second channel I could
still<00:03:07.560> upload<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> rest<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.370> videos<00:03:08.640> and

two<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.190> content<00:03:11.760> won't<00:03:12.030> be<00:03:12.240> as<00:03:12.450> regular<00:03:13.020> but

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
two the content won't be as regular but

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.560 
two the content won't be as regular but
there<00:03:13.590> will<00:03:13.740> still<00:03:13.770> be<00:03:14.040> content<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:15.120> every

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570
