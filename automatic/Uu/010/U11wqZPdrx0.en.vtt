00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.740
 today for a little tutorial that 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.750
 you were very numerous to ask 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 since actually for several 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.980
 days it is possible to cheat on 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.620
 pokemon rubio vega sapphire alpha is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.809
 also on potty man x and y 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.340
 by importing very easily 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.470
 pokemon all the pokemon you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.270
 I want to propose to you in this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.519
 video to take stock of this tutorial 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.119
 is to see step by step how that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.099
 works 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.990
 and before I start I'm just doing a 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.279
 clarification on the fact that I am 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.510
 completely neutral at the level of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.579
 cheat I understand people who 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 cheat as long as it stays in the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.210
 legitimacy and that it is not 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.500
 pokemon completely wacky and I 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.430
 also includes people who do not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.350
 do not support cheating 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 in any case I'm just doing the tutorial 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.809
 because they asked me because he 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 are a lot of people who do not understand 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 how it works 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.789
 for this tutorial we are finally going 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.950
 need very little in 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.840
 more in the computer of your 3ds and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 of your cartridge it goes first 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 have to download a file that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 is called point bean code and that I you 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.190
 have uploaded to the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 details of the video you must then 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.409
 of course have an internet connection 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.600
 on your 3ds is necessarily a file to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.460
 send that you want to recover on 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.869
 your console 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.130
 once you have downloaded the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.750
 file you will immediately see 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.159
 it's a zip file 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.960
 so we will necessarily start with 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.970
 extract it and I advise you rather 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 to put everything on your desk time 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.119
 of manipulation like that everything is at 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.850
 same place and it's easier 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.159
 to find it before starting there 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.470
 another little precaution to take it 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.540
 must clear the internet browser from 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 your 3ds and remove the cookies and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.100
 the browsing history for that is 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 easy you go on the browser you 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.159
 go in the options and very 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.960
 just he was going to offer you 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.939
 erase the history and erase the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.020
 couty it's important because if you 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.610
 do not do it there may be 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 some bugs and it may not 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.290
 operate then you have to remove the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.520
 SD card from your console and read it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.649
 with your pc 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.990
 today a lot of laptops 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.490
 are equipped with sd card reader but 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 if this is not your case know also 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.520
 that a lot of converter for 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.109
 camera 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 pioneer in the same way and go 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.700
 allow to read the map once sd 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 that you opened the SD card with 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.640
 your computer 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.379
 it will have to slide inside the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.959
 folder that we download everything to 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.060
 the time the folder code point be and the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.769
 put at the root of the map sd it's 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.099
 to say put it directly when we 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.110
 open the map sd this well the intention 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.400
 to have inserted the file decompress 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 and not the zip file 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.510
 in which case it would not work and we 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.730
 let's get to the pretty friendly stage of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.500
 this tutorial we will choose the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.239
 pokemon that we want to send on 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.400
 our cartridges and for that I have you 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.260
 put in the details of the video the link 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.360
 a small library that offers 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.489
 already done everything perfectly 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.140
 legitimate going on without any problem 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.060
 in wifi and that you will only have 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.750
 download and include directly 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.430
 in your SD card for the example I 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.380
 chosen to download me up this him 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.849
 that I first recorded on my 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.260
 office 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.090
 the next step is easy enough but 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.950
 she is also very important be 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.440
 so careful once we have 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.739
 your pokemon file it will have to be the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.720
 renamed to pokemon point e kx point 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.220
 a kx normally he's already there by 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.319
 against it must remove all the rest and 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.870
 put pokemon instead without accent 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.730
 so for example here I remove milo 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.049
 bellus shoot all the strata and to the 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.940
 place I put pokemon once the 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.920
 name change made I'm going 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.109
 drag my pokemon file to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.359
 the inside of my SD card exactly at 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.549
 same place as everything on their arrival at 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.200
 this point of the tutorial our map sd 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.000
 is ready and can be removed from 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.340
 the computer and put it back into our 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.319
 3ds first you need to 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 start your game pokemon rubio mega 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.480
 safyral lighthouse pokémon x or pokémon y 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.200
 you go to your pc and you have to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.269
 we in leverage 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.430
 the first pokemon of your first 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.049
 box attention it's very important there 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.440
 must be free space since 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.500
 that's where we go in June 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.880
 the pokemon that is on the map sd 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.010
 then you have to go back to the menu 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.500
 3ds but be careful to do but especially 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.330
 not your game he has to stay active for 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.370
 following the tutorial and we will 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.800
 need to activate the camera 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.270
 and for that without closing the pokemon game he 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 press the keys l and r with 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.510
 the camera of the 3ds 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.830
 there is an option that allows you to read the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.540
 code leathers and that's what I need 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.630
 since for the future we must 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.700
 scan this qrcode the 3ds will detect it 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.770
 and will offer you to go directly 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.710
 to an internet address with the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.940
 3ds browser 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.480
 once on the site and after a 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.610
 loading 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.530
 the browser will display a message 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.970
 of error do not panic it's all about 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.880
 is normal and that means that the 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.470
 manipulation worked well you 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.240
 can then go back to your game 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.250
 who if everything worked well and 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.080
 always open and going to see in 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.580
 your box in first position in the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.520
 first magic box 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.990
 our buddy yvonne appeared but 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.590
 be careful one last thing very 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.360
 important 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.130
 once you've checked the little 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.880
 reindeer generated that you've verified that he 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.950
 there is no bug 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.780
 you can save your game and 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.300
 leave the game in order to recover the 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.160
 SD card by putting your SD card on 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.630
 the pc you will then realize 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.880
 that there is a new file a file 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.650
 which is called bugs injection point 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.660
 be and this one if you want 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.430
 to start again it is absolutely necessary 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.680
 delete otherwise it will not work 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.350
 you can also delete the pokemon 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.300
 point e kx to necessarily give back to 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.870
 level give back to our little world and 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.160
 continue to generate pokemon finally I 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.050
 stop on an extremely point 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.120
 important if instead of the little monk 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.680
 that you chose is a 9 which 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.930
 appears in the box especially do not 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.490
 not save your game it's very 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.620
 very bad sign that means you 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.180
 are missed on the tutorial that your 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.310
 file is not good or you have 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.870
 made a wrong manipulation and in this 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.580
 case there why we really do not 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.169
 keep his game well because 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.370
 this is called a bad boy and 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.440
 it's something that can contaminate 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.460
 all your boxes and that can also 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.620
 to plant your 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.130
 save so be careful it happens to you 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.960
 especially do not save to finish 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.880
 it's a matter of common sense but I 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.849
 the signal anyway did not generate 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.229
 on pokemon yx and y objects or mega 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.509
 developments that are only 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.160
 available on pokémon rosa since 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.539
 this is the best way to 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
 completely plant your 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.419
 cartridge 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.520
 if you want to create yourself 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.680
 your files and your pokemon you can 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.080
 use the software that is associated with 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.090
 this method called peak to aix and 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.740
 which is very convenient but be careful if 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.259
 you never use software 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.210
 cheat as for them to know or 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.009
 like poke embarrassment I advise you 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.530
 very formally since that's when 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.910
 even quite difficult to use and you 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.110
 especially risk making files 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.410
 that they will not be good and that they do not 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.820
 will never go into pattern combat 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.259
 I hope this tutorial will be useful to 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.820
 all those who asked us I you 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.099
 really frankly advises 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.050
 use it sparingly since 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.909
 the game by all its charm if all 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.860
 pokemon are generated directly and then 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.750
 it has more interest but good after 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.069
 you do what you want but a 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.620
 last thing anyway it's that 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.270
 it's relatively recent it's all about 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.889
 makes it possible for nintendo to make a 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.280
 updated to avoid this kind of 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.380
 cheated 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.870
 so that's it for now it works 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.490
 but we can not know if in two 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.020
 weeks it will work in the body but 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.550
 in any case here I hope that this 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.909
 tutorial will help you and I'll tell you 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.909
 very soon
