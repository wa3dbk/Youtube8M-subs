00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.380
 at home we have 3 strawberry trees this 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.660
 another smaller one and one that we've 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:19.360
 planted this year this is already starting 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.470
 to ripen the strawberry trees and with the 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.890
 strawberry trees 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.350
 let's make a madroño liqueur 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.420
 great 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.430
 to make the grumpiest icon come on 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.640
 to pick up the most granites that are most 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.640
 mature 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.620
 from my mother we have here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.510
 makes a splendid day 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.510
 more than three fifths 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 but pretty good 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.590
 already the migraine itself has a lot 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.590
 very much liquor 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.780
 of some in a while 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.640
 is one of the things that I like most about 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.670
 live in the countryside 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.270
 that has resources that you can use 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.640
 to do many things well to catch 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.840
 also more firewood that is madroño than 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.840
 It also has enough 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.600
 have more owners 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.600
 in the garden 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.890
 and another one that we have planted this year 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.890
 but that that moment has not given 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.840
 we have enough to make the liquor 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.940
 of madroño 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.550
 Well, to fill 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.540
 the race 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.540
 of strawberry trees 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.770
 you have to fill it as a third of what 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.560
 what is the carafe 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.560
 it's more or less I think mothers 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.540
 now you have to throw 10 grams of coffee 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.960
 n 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.890
 1 5 6 7 8 9 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.400
 and a cinnamon stick we take it to 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.120
 above 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.120
 of anise 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.940
 and we cover it and now six months 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:00.500
 this is what I have left of last year 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.500
 and this is the result of the liquor 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.450
 Y
