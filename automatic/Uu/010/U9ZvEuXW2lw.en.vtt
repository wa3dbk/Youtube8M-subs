00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
think that the way that the last texans

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500 
think that the way that the last texans
game<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> against<00:00:34.950> Seattle<00:00:35.520> um<00:00:35.700> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
game in it against Seattle um is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
game in it against Seattle um is
basically<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.410> same<00:00:37.620> way<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.370> game

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
basically the same way that this game

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.889 
basically the same way that this game
started<00:00:39.300> even<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.739> Matt<00:00:41.550> Schaub<00:00:41.879> started<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
started even when Matt Schaub started to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.680 
started even when Matt Schaub started to
look<00:00:43.079> good<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.460> niners<00:00:44.760> defense<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.420> came

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
look good the niners defense just came

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.529 
look good the niners defense just came
out<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.020> top<00:00:46.469> he<00:00:47.340> threw<00:00:47.550> three<00:00:47.910> picks<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
out up top he threw three picks on the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
out up top he threw three picks on the
day<00:00:48.809> honestly<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:49.739> opinion<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.309> should

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
day honestly in my opinion it should

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.740 
day honestly in my opinion it should
have<00:00:50.579> been<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.700> fourth<00:00:51.030> pick<00:00:51.270> everybody<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
have been a fourth pick everybody can

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
have been a fourth pick everybody can
remember<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.219> rookie<00:00:53.219> read<00:00:53.489> dropping<00:00:54.030> one

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
remember the rookie read dropping one

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.400 
remember the rookie read dropping one
that<00:00:54.360> i<00:00:54.420> thought<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.050> his<00:00:55.289> hands<00:00:55.829> um<00:00:56.190> but

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
that i thought was in his hands um but

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.900 
that i thought was in his hands um but
overall<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.190> rains<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.640> pours

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
overall I think when it rains it pours

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.840 
overall I think when it rains it pours
and<00:01:00.469> we'll<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.100> goes<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.550> with
