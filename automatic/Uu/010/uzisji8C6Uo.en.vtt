as a weapon against this on our own

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.460 
as a weapon against this on our own
territory<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.720> i<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
territory and i think if you have that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.080 
territory and i think if you have that
conclusion<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> incapable<00:01:38.700> for

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
conclusion to make it incapable for

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.340 
conclusion to make it incapable for

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
united states to defend itself from

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.620 
united states to defend itself from
terrorists<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.640> i<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.270> most

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
terrorists because i think most

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.870 
terrorists because i think most
reasonable<00:01:43.170> people<00:01:43.200> would<00:01:43.649> agree<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
reasonable people would agree that the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
united states could have shot misses up

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
united states could have shot misses up
those<00:01:46.829> planes<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.310> taken<00:01:47.610> despite<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.299> law

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
those planes have taken despite the law
