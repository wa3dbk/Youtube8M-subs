saw a good decision by Mandela this was

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.550 
saw a good decision by Mandela this was
super<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.180> funny<00:03:38.359> thing<00:03:38.569> is<00:03:38.720> he<00:03:38.959> decided<00:03:39.440> to

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
super the funny thing is he decided to

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.289 
super the funny thing is he decided to
go<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.799> mile<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.310> half<00:03:40.489> not<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> mile<00:03:41.060> because

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
go a mile and a half not a mile because

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.270 
go a mile and a half not a mile because
he<00:03:41.569> thought<00:03:41.750> there<00:03:41.959> was<00:03:42.079> too<00:03:42.530> much<00:03:42.680> speed<00:03:43.100> in

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
he thought there was too much speed in

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.740 
he thought there was too much speed in
the<00:03:43.370> mile<00:03:43.549> he<00:03:43.819> thought<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> pace<00:03:44.299> scenario

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
the mile he thought the pace scenario

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.360 
the mile he thought the pace scenario
would<00:03:45.049> be<00:03:45.200> easier<00:03:45.620> going<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.920> mile<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> half

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
would be easier going a mile and a half

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.030 
would be easier going a mile and a half
oh<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:47.030> wasn't<00:03:47.239> because<00:03:47.810> he<00:03:48.019> had<00:03:48.290> two<00:03:48.829> horses

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
oh it wasn't because he had two horses

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.890 
oh it wasn't because he had two horses
barreling<00:03:49.670> out<00:03:49.819> in<00:03:49.940> front<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.180> him<00:03:50.329> here<00:03:50.510> but

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
barreling out in front of him here but

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.089 
barreling out in front of him here but
it<00:03:50.959> doesn't<00:03:51.139> matter<00:03:51.290> little<00:03:51.590> Mike<00:03:51.799> was<00:03:51.980> able

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
it doesn't matter little Mike was able

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.860 
it doesn't matter little Mike was able
to<00:03:52.250> relax<00:03:52.459> early<00:03:52.819> here<00:03:53.209> he<00:03:53.299> hits<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.630> front

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
to relax early here he hits the front

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.050 
to relax early here he hits the front
you<00:03:54.139> can<00:03:54.170> see<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:55.040> point<00:03:55.310> eventually<00:03:55.609> comes

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
you can see that point eventually comes

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.150 
you can see that point eventually comes
to<00:03:56.150> along<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.540> inside<00:03:57.049> looks<00:03:57.560> like<00:03:57.680> he<00:03:57.920> might

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.440 
to along the inside looks like he might
be<00:03:58.190> able<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.489> get<00:03:58.579> see<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:58.760> he<00:03:58.880> has<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.090> angle

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
be able to get see so he has to angle

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.180 
be able to get see so he has to angle
