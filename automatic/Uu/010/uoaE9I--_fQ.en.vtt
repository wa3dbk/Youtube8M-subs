through the door to the jetpack cuber
books<00:01:52.079> where<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> made<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> video<00:01:52.829> about<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.399> don't

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
books where I made a video about I don't

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.030 
books where I made a video about I don't
know<00:01:53.700> who<00:01:53.939> knows<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.689> yeah<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.530> know

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
know who knows but yeah what I do know

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
know who knows but yeah what I do know
is<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> when<00:01:56.700> you're<00:01:56.880> closer<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.450> Moreau

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
is that when you're closer to Moreau

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.319 
is that when you're closer to Moreau
Michael<00:01:58.680> will<00:01:58.920> disappear<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> when<00:02:00.180> you're

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
Michael will disappear and when you're

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.170 
Michael will disappear and when you're
far<00:02:00.659> away<00:02:00.689> or<00:02:01.200> away<00:02:01.979> from<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.399> mural<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.969> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
far away or away from the mural so that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.399 
far away or away from the mural so that
you<00:02:03.299> can't<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.869> anymore

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you can't see it anymore

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.740 
you can't see it anymore
he<00:02:04.649> will<00:02:04.979> spawn<00:02:05.460> back<00:02:05.820> again<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.360> he<00:02:06.509> walks

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
he will spawn back again and he walks

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
he will spawn back again and he walks
with<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.049> big<00:02:07.380> smile<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.890> his<00:02:07.979> face<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.700> you

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
with a big smile on his face to you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.880 
with a big smile on his face to you
again<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.599> can

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
again as you can

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.890 
again as you can
here<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.670> guess<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.120> really<00:02:11.630> strange

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
here so I guess it is really strange

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.050 
here so I guess it is really strange
it's<00:02:12.200> probably<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:13.069> glitch<00:02:13.100> but<00:02:13.670> of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
it's probably just a glitch but of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.970 
it's probably just a glitch but of
course<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.720> could<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.290> something<00:02:15.800> new<00:02:15.950> and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
course it could be something new and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.210 
course it could be something new and
perhaps<00:02:16.400> big<00:02:16.970> because<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.840> Moreau<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:19.069> a

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
perhaps big because it's Moreau it's a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.730 
perhaps big because it's Moreau it's a
degree<00:02:19.459> whether<00:02:19.850> there<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.600> moon<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.260> we

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
degree whether there is a moon and we

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.309 
degree whether there is a moon and we
all<00:02:21.920> know<00:02:22.190> we<00:02:22.910> could<00:02:23.120> trigger<00:02:23.360> Easter<00:02:23.900> eggs<00:02:24.050> on

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
all know we could trigger Easter eggs on

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.710 
all know we could trigger Easter eggs on
a<00:02:24.350> specific<00:02:24.890> time<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.640> ghost<00:02:26.120> lady<00:02:26.420> but

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720
