00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.609 
that key seals so the one way to get it
open<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.060> cutting<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
open is by cutting it so this is the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.899 
open is by cutting it so this is the
perfect<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> place<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
perfect time for you to place the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
perfect time for you to place the
battery<00:01:33.330> alright<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> seem<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.740> having<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
battery alright so I seem to be having a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.140 
battery alright so I seem to be having a
little<00:01:35.130> problem<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.729> corner<00:01:36.090> over

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
little problem with this corner over

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090 
little problem with this corner over
here<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> went<00:01:36.900> ahead<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.350> cut<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:37.920> on

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
here so I went ahead and I cut these on

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.380 
here so I went ahead and I cut these on
a<00:01:38.130> foot<00:01:38.310> by<00:01:38.490> degree<00:01:38.790> angle

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
a foot by degree angle

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
a foot by degree angle
ah<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.710> battery<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.070> hitting<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
ah because the battery was hitting that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.060 
ah because the battery was hitting that
corner<00:01:42.119> right<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.829> we

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
corner right there so now it's just we

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
corner right there so now it's just we
were<00:01:44.250> seems<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.150> fitting<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.540> fine<00:01:45.810> but

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
were seems to be fitting just fine but

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.569 
were seems to be fitting just fine but
one<00:01:46.500> thing<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:46.710> noticed<00:01:47.070> always<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
one thing I noticed always that the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.030 
one thing I noticed always that the
chips<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.630> sideways<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:49.979> know

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
chips it's sideways so I don't know

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
chips it's sideways so I don't know
that's<00:01:50.189> gonna<00:01:50.430> affect<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> button<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.869> let

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and like I said before the chips to the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.730 
and like I said before the chips to the
sideways<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.869> thing<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> noticed

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
