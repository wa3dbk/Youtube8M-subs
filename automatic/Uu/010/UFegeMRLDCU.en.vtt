which<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.820> also<00:02:36.030> bringing<00:02:36.540> great<00:02:36.750> performance

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.630 

that<00:03:03.270> was<00:03:03.420> fun<00:03:03.660> but

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
that was fun but

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.910 
that was fun but
now<00:03:06.300> let's<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> look<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:07.410> on<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
now let's have a look in here on the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.280

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.289 

which<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.280> worst<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.670> for<00:03:13.909> you<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.150> play

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
which is the worst I for you can play

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.210 
which is the worst I for you can play
this<00:03:14.450> game<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.500> can<00:03:15.680> play<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.159> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
this game and you can play it on the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.140 
this game and you can play it on the
iPhone<00:03:16.610> 4<00:03:16.909> because<00:03:17.209> it's<00:03:17.390> not<00:03:17.629> compatible<00:03:18.079> I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
iPhone 4 because it's not compatible I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:43.530 
iPhone 4 because it's not compatible I
can't<00:03:20.150> even<00:03:20.470> start<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.620> game

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.179 

but<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.750> iPhone<00:03:45.349> definitely<00:03:45.890> is<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.010> lot

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
but this iPhone definitely is a lot

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.140 
but this iPhone definitely is a lot
slower<00:03:46.519> here<00:03:46.909> than<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.180> iPhone<00:03:47.480> 5s<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:50.000> can

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
slower here than the iPhone 5s you can

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.360 
slower here than the iPhone 5s you can
up<00:03:50.269> in<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.450> field<00:03:50.659> when<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.079> are<00:03:51.370> flying

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
up in the field when you are flying

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.640 
up in the field when you are flying
around<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.019> little<00:03:54.290> bit<00:03:54.439> more

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
around that it is a little bit more

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.250 
around that it is a little bit more
choppier<00:03:55.370> but<00:03:55.970> still<00:03:56.239> pretty<00:03:56.420> stable<00:03:56.780> you

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
choppier but still pretty stable you

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.979 
choppier but still pretty stable you
don't<00:03:57.439> have<00:03:57.650> any<00:03:57.829> lag<00:03:58.609> like<00:03:58.970> in<00:03:59.359> the<00:03:59.569> game

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
don't have any lag like in the game

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.420 
don't have any lag like in the game
frees<00:04:00.530> up<00:04:00.739> too<00:04:01.459> much<00:04:03.250> definites<00:04:04.250> and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
frees up too much definites and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:14.750 
frees up too much definites and
raindrops

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.729 

and<00:04:15.330> sometimes<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:16.109> don't<00:04:16.290> do<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.500> feel

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
and sometimes you don't do you feel

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:32.260 
and sometimes you don't do you feel
anything<00:04:17.010> which<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.669> very<00:04:17.910> nice

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
