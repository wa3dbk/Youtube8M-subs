simply<00:02:01.710> put<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> why<00:02:02.759> Berger<00:02:03.210> bullets

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
simply put is why Berger bullets

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780 
simply put is why Berger bullets
everyday<00:02:04.020> work<00:02:04.290> whether<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> 50-yard

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
everyday work whether it is a 50-yard

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.960 
everyday work whether it is a 50-yard
shot<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.360> 500-yard<00:02:07.350> shot<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.340> thousand-yard

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
shot and that right there is why we
