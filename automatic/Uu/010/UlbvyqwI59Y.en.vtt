00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.690 
this is stripped down it'll really look
nice<00:03:42.950> with<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.760> original<00:03:45.129> has<00:03:46.129> the<00:03:46.310> original

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
nice with the original has the original

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.440 
nice with the original has the original
blue<00:03:48.099> stenciling<00:03:49.099> I<00:03:49.219> believe<00:03:49.640> or<00:03:50.180> may<00:03:50.420> have

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
blue stenciling I believe or may have

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.530 
blue stenciling I believe or may have
been<00:03:50.719> would<00:03:50.930> put<00:03:51.829> on<00:03:51.950> later<00:03:52.189> but<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.489> think<00:03:52.819> that

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
been would put on later but I think that

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.660 
been would put on later but I think that
could<00:03:53.870> be<00:03:53.900> original<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.620> looks<00:03:54.829> nice<00:03:55.159> and<00:03:55.189> old

one<00:04:59.340> drawer<00:04:59.640> with<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.880> original<00:05:00.390> tin<00:05:00.660> this<00:05:01.140> is

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
one drawer with the original tin this is

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.630 
one drawer with the original tin this is
the<00:05:01.500> second<00:05:02.040> drawer

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
the second drawer

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:13.760 
the second drawer
that's<00:05:03.360> original<00:05:03.630> Chen<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:08.750> little<00:05:09.750> sticky<00:05:12.770> and

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.440 
that's original Chen a little sticky and
this<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.580> bread<00:05:14.790> drawer<00:05:15.150> with<00:05:15.419> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
original 10 on it too I think this is

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.909 
original 10 on it too I think this is
the<00:05:18.210> only<00:05:18.270> cabin<00:05:18.840> I've<00:05:19.020> I've<00:05:19.169> ever<00:05:19.410> seen<00:05:19.710> with

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
the only cabin I've I've ever seen with

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.610 
the only cabin I've I've ever seen with
the<00:05:20.070> original<00:05:20.630> two<00:05:21.630> drawers<00:05:22.020> each<00:05:22.350> drawer

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
the original two drawers each drawer

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:34.480 
the original two drawers each drawer
having<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.040> 10

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.700 

everything<00:05:35.300> looks<00:05:35.450> original<00:05:35.750> here

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.080 

so<00:05:41.710> then<00:05:41.889> it's<00:05:42.039> just<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.280> matter<00:05:42.520> of<00:05:42.639> stripping

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
so then it's just a matter of stripping

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.679 
so then it's just a matter of stripping
it<00:05:43.210> down

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.719 

this<00:05:50.259> would<00:05:50.409> be<00:05:50.529> a<00:05:50.559> real<00:05:50.979> beauty<00:05:51.429> when<00:05:51.580> it's

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729
