00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.780
 i am mobile g2 we are at 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.920
 samsung at the cebit 2013 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.000
 Unfortunately, this year does not exist 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.660
 really much to see but what we do 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.950
 The new cells have been found 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.810
 Ultrabooks from samsung and have here 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.360
 we have the version 7 140 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.460
 So that's the touch version like you 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.020
 among other things, just here it looks 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.310
 Great is the thing has a full full 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:34.039
 hd display so 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:37.159
 of course 13 3 inches diagonal and around 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.179
 illustrate how high-resolution 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.379
 display is just let's do it 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.120
 this menu on and you can see already 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.519
 there is a whole lot more to it than at 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.429
 the typical 366 x 768 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.649
 The box is made entirely of aluminum 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.819
 at least the upper part and that is 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.269
 I think plastic as it is now 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.530
 Feeling athletic costs in Germany 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.239
 1399 euro I think that is 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.079
 entry price or that is 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.489
 not even the official one 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.339
 Price of its official price 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.600
 and even finds 1600 euro because you have to 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.549
 then again, say typical samsung 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.930
 But prizes are also very good 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.329
 equipped namely has a core i5 37 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.289
 35 37 o'clock of the tactics with normally 2 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.850
 ghz goes up to 1,1 3,1 ghz and that 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.380
 is already a lot and one 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.729
 further special feature we have below that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.060
 is the radeon graphics in there 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.950
 that's a radeon hd 85 50 with one 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.509
 gigabyte extra memory 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.270
 in addition there are six gigabytes 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.760
 memory 256 gb ssd 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.500
 that's the maximum though 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.970
 and as I said the fat chip in there 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.100
 we'll take a quick look around and there 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.570
 we have the kensington lock in the back 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.460
 here is a usb port is just there 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.650
 This great lock in from samsung 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.080
 there is also a usb 3 port here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.190
 in the front we have a full-fledged one 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.450
 SD card reader so for normal 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.640
 There are cards with some others 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.350
 Ultrabooks no longer on the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.180
 bottom is all empty 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.790
 Unfortunately you can not open it there 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.140
 There is nothing to exchange and up 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.570
 the right side, we still have 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.680
 this looks like displayport next to it 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.560
 we have the headphones and 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.010
 microphone connection combines a usb 3 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.180
 port hdmi and an ethernet port of 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.190
 full size and power connection to us 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.570
 look on top of it very briefly 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.860
 you can see it's a pretty one 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.930
 decent keyword but not quite 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.160
 The quality of the ces no comes but 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.960
 anyway ran because they are yes then 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.310
 still a whole corner is more expensive 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.450
 actually done quite well what me 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.800
 not quite as much like this one 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.820
 very small ship thiede it for 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.770
 Germany then already relatively 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.959
 Small white gives some notebooks there is 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.190
 he is a bit bigger then 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.110
 otherwise good to use 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.820
 down here we have one more thing 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.739
 is of course owed windows 8 take 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.160
 I this trackpad with integrated 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.200
 mouse buttons so 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.690
 nothing extra settled but can 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.600
 one also with it as one sees here 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.460
 reasonably neat 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.460
 even without touching the touchscreen 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.970
 make the wiping work 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.810
 quite well 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.240
 okay that was the samsung ultratouch 740 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.800
 That's the top version of the new ones 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.270
 samsung ultrabooks until then no more 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.270
 or firmware giggs until then
