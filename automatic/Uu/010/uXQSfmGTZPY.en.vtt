competition like the beats pill so it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a ton of base but this thing broke that

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.069 
a ton of base but this thing broke that
law<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.740> has<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:41.310> clean<00:01:41.729> powerful<00:01:42.479> bass<00:01:42.689> it's

definitely<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:44.520> muddy<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.020> had<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.680> word

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
definitely not muddy but if had one word

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.240 
definitely not muddy but if had one word
to<00:01:46.950> describe<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.240> sound<00:01:48.540> quality<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:49.320> would

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to describe the sound quality i would

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.630 
to describe the sound quality i would
say<00:01:50.490> deep<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.630> sound<00:01:51.990> sinks<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.430> body

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
say deep the sound sinks into your body

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.889 
say deep the sound sinks into your body
and<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.930> lose<00:01:55.770> yourself<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> music

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
and you just lose yourself in the music

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
and you just lose yourself in the music
but<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.110> high<00:01:58.409> volume<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.520> hear<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.909> little

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
but at high volume you can hear a little

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.859 
but at high volume you can hear a little
bit<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.570> distortion<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> sound<00:02:02.630> also<00:02:03.630> i

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
bit of distortion and the sound also i

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.530 
bit of distortion and the sound also i
wish<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.649> had<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> higher<00:02:05.340> max<00:02:05.759> volume<00:02:06.060> because

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
wish it had a higher max volume because

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.969 
wish it had a higher max volume because
this<00:02:06.840> thing<00:02:07.200> won't<00:02:07.500> fill<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.190> party<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
this thing won't fill a party and the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.190 
this thing won't fill a party and the
battery<00:02:10.979> life<00:02:11.129> gave<00:02:11.520> me<00:02:11.550> around<00:02:12.120> seven<00:02:12.660> hours

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
battery life gave me around seven hours

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.559 
battery life gave me around seven hours
which<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.650> decent<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.819> could<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.209> little

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
which is decent but it could be a little

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.369 
which is decent but it could be a little
bit<00:02:15.810> better<00:02:17.209> speaking<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.239> battery<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:19.349> I

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
bit better speaking of battery what I

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.530 
bit better speaking of battery what I
didn't<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> charging<00:02:20.970> cable<00:02:21.150> you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
didn't like is a charging cable you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.770 
didn't like is a charging cable you
can't<00:02:21.840> take<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.500> charging<00:02:23.010> cable<00:02:23.250> off<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
can't take the charging cable off of the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.710 
can't take the charging cable off of the
wall<00:02:24.959> charger<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.129> when<00:02:26.640> you're<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> trip<00:02:27.510> or

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
wall charger so when you're on a trip or

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960 
wall charger so when you're on a trip or
something<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.860> have<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.129> take<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> whole

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
something you have to take the whole

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.710 
something you have to take the whole
charger<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.900> but<00:02:31.739> then<00:02:32.599> there's<00:02:33.599> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
charger with you but then there's a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.250 
charger with you but then there's a
charging<00:02:34.349> cradle<00:02:34.860> what<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:36.030> cradle<00:02:36.599> does<00:02:36.959> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
charging cradle what this cradle does is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.440 
charging cradle what this cradle does is
that<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.400> put<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.640> speaker<00:02:39.090> on

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
that you just have to put the speaker on

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.839 
that you just have to put the speaker on
top<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> crater<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:42.150> charges<00:02:42.590> but<00:02:43.849> the

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
top of the crater and it charges but the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.809 
top of the crater and it charges but the
cradle<00:02:45.330> has<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.080> connected<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
cradle has to be connected to the

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.550 
cradle has to be connected to the
charger<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:50.190> there's<00:02:51.000> actually<00:02:51.299> no<00:02:51.840> points<00:02:52.440> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
charger so there's actually no points of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.699 
charger so there's actually no points of
this<00:02:52.980> crater<00:02:53.430> other<00:02:53.730> than<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.299> looks<00:02:54.690> cool<00:02:55.440> but

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
this crater other than it looks cool but

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.680 
this crater other than it looks cool but
the<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.430> cool<00:02:56.760> feature<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the really cool feature about the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.410 
the really cool feature about the
speaker<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.319> no<00:02:59.040> other<00:02:59.340> speaker<00:02:59.849> has<00:03:00.090> is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
speaker that no other speaker has is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.009 
speaker that no other speaker has is
that<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:03.239> removable<00:03:04.140> battery<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.660> it

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
that you have a removable battery so it

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.199 
that you have a removable battery so it
practically<00:03:07.799> won't<00:03:08.069> be<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> dead<00:03:08.579> brick<00:03:08.940> like

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
practically won't be a dead brick like

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.130 
practically won't be a dead brick like
others<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.560> next<00:03:10.890> couple<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.370> years<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140
