hello today we have a Guinness video

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.920 
hello today we have a Guinness video
which<00:00:03.570> features<00:00:03.890> two<00:00:04.890> very<00:00:05.190> quick<00:00:05.400> checkmates

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
which features two very quick checkmates

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.770 
which features two very quick checkmates
including<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> wire<00:00:07.319> fastest<00:00:07.890> segment<00:00:08.780> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
including the wire fastest segment the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.459 
including the wire fastest segment the
fastest<00:00:10.110> way<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> win<00:00:11.150> 22<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.019> two<00:00:13.259> moves

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
fastest way to win 22 is in two moves

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.300 
fastest way to win 22 is in two moves
and<00:00:13.849> actually<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.710> only<00:00:16.710> possible<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:17.279> you

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and actually it's only possible if you

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.000 
and actually it's only possible if you
playing<00:00:17.640> from<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> black<00:00:18.210> side<00:00:18.650> it<00:00:19.650> goes

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
playing from the black side it goes

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.580 
playing from the black side it goes
something<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.630> but<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.810> see<00:00:21.869> 5<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:24.590> now

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
something like this but I see 5 and now

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
something like this but I see 5 and now
the<00:00:25.650> very<00:00:26.160> first<00:00:26.519> move<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:27.000> board<00:00:27.890> c2<00:00:28.890> c4<00:00:29.490> opens

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the very first move on board c2 c4 opens

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.690 
the very first move on board c2 c4 opens
up<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> diagonal<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.050> king<00:00:31.579> already<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
up the diagonal to the king already the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
up the diagonal to the king already the
second<00:00:33.059> move<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.329> black<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:34.320> checkmate<00:00:36.350> of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
second move for black it's checkmate of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560 
second move for black it's checkmate of
course<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.980> possible<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.610> different

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
course this is possible in different

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
course this is possible in different
move<00:00:39.750> others<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.410> slightly<00:00:41.160> different

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
move others with slightly different

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
move others with slightly different
rules<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.090> example<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.559> first<00:00:45.170> like<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
rules for example a for first like I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.360 
rules for example a for first like I
still<00:00:46.469> play<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.800> 52<00:00:47.340> also<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.760> six<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:49.070> FC<00:00:50.070> for

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
still play a 52 also is six and FC for

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.110 
still play a 52 also is six and FC for
once<00:00:50.670> again<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.210> checkmate<00:00:52.789> this<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
once again it's checkmate this is the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
once again it's checkmate this is the
very<00:00:54.710> fastest<00:00:55.710> way<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> check<00:00:56.309> mine<00:00:57.469> this<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
very fastest way to check mine this is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
very fastest way to check mine this is
how<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.770> looks<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> Whitesides<00:00:59.579> from

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
how it looks from the Whitesides from

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.779 
how it looks from the Whitesides from
lattice<00:01:00.510> point<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.930> view<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
lattice point of view there also is a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.939 
lattice point of view there also is a
checkmate<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.510> three<00:01:03.539> moves<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.739> only

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
checkmate in three moves it's only

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.969 
checkmate in three moves it's only
possible<00:01:05.189> from<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> white<00:01:06.090> side<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.450> course

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
possible from the white side of course

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.700 
possible from the white side of course
of<00:01:07.979> course<00:01:08.450> we<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.630> delay<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> checkmate<00:01:10.530> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
of course we can delay the checkmate in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.090 
of course we can delay the checkmate in
two<00:01:10.890> moves<00:01:11.240> simply<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:13.350> playing<00:01:13.710> sonam

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
two moves simply by well playing sonam

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.880 
two moves simply by well playing sonam
since<00:01:14.400> e3<00:01:17.509> f6<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.259> two<00:01:19.380> ways<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> move

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
since e3 f6 now we have two ways to move

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
since e3 f6 now we have two ways to move
and<00:01:20.720> then<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:22.500> exactly<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> same<00:01:23.400> pattern<00:01:23.880> but

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and then if exactly the same pattern but

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
and then if exactly the same pattern but
now<00:01:24.840> white<00:01:25.229> takes<00:01:25.500> three<00:01:25.799> moves<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.400> like

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
now white takes three moves because like

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.539 
now white takes three moves because like
did<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.090> open<00:01:27.509> his<00:01:27.540> skin<00:01:27.900> yet<00:01:28.080> however<00:01:29.070> there

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
did not open his skin yet however there

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.520 
did not open his skin yet however there
is<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> different<00:01:30.479> cut<00:01:30.630> check<00:01:30.930> made<00:01:31.110> possible

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
is a different cut check made possible

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.580 
is a different cut check made possible
in<00:01:31.710> three<00:01:32.310> moves<00:01:32.579> efore<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.720> white

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
in three moves efore for white

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.499 
in three moves efore for white
b5<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.170> second<00:01:38.619> move<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:38.979> white<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:40.060> h5

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
b5 is the second move for white in h5

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.370 
b5 is the second move for white in h5
and<00:01:40.869> now<00:01:41.859> there's<00:01:42.100> only<00:01:42.219> one<00:01:42.789> move<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.380> will

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
and now there's only one move that will

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.520 
and now there's only one move that will
help<00:01:44.619> like<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.609> checkmate<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.929> might<00:01:47.140> try<00:01:47.469> to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
help like a checkmate you might try to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.740 
help like a checkmate you might try to
find<00:01:47.859> them<00:01:48.039> it's<00:01:48.789> King<00:01:49.420> too<00:01:49.689> easy<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.579> now

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
find them it's King too easy and now

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.660 
find them it's King too easy and now
Quint<00:01:52.750> xe5<00:01:53.469> is<00:01:53.920> segment<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.979> practice<00:01:57.520> you

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
Quint xe5 is segment in practice you

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.459 
Quint xe5 is segment in practice you
won't<00:01:57.969> see<00:01:58.329> that<00:01:58.539> you've<00:01:58.689> made<00:01:58.899> think

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
won't see that you've made think

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.809 
won't see that you've made think
especially<00:02:00.130> not<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.929> last<00:02:01.929> one<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.229> show<00:02:02.590> you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
simply because there's no obligation for

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.649 
simply because there's no obligation for
the<00:02:05.409> other<00:02:05.560> side<00:02:05.859> they<00:02:06.159> like<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.599> I'll<00:02:07.599> check
