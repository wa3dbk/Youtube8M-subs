 and I'm going to see what to do with 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.260
 I send this to a halt first 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.830
 so you can better watch with 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.050
 but how does it work with the reins 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.670
 vote so you want nothing then you go with you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.239
 piece of the if don't go down 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.670
 but also not looking for him 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.899
 they remain soft and in the same lines 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 keep your arm born when you get there 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.309

 my right leg so I share 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 pieces and cares or through her 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 went on and girl couple reacts too much 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.009
 that also corrects something with me and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.610
 if you see the other side rises 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.610
 exactly the other way around 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.150
 and I do not really correct less 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.380
 and now in slow trot and swim a little more 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.540
 the corridor took the step most of you go 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.100
 from the step into the ram it can 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.080
 also from a standstill but that is something again 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.270

 I first see what you 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.260

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.209
 trotting 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.010
 publisher this piece needs your leg 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.280
 if not on a light cross 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.100
