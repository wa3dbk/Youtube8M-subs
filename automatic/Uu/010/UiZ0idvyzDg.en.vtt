00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.379
 hi guys today i make snack 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 with the cookies I made created 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.710
 with the playset the fantasy cookies 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.570
 of the play doh you have seen that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.580
 sciccheria I got really of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 commitments now we will see how to implement 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.390
 with all these tools contained in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.410
 this new playset of the pay from this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.210
 type of cookies 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.189
 let's open the box and see what's there 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.109
 inside then we have a rolling pin 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.789
 as you see with different possibilities of 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.650
 david decoration was very fast in 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 so as to provide a pallet extruder 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.700
 we also have a tray to make 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.500
 different forms of cookies and then we have 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.570
 also other types of supplying a little heart 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.879
 a round a saucer and let's try 5 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.290
 mini jars of classic doh play there 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.480
 allow to go then to realize 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.620
 cookies but let's start with the first one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.450
 you have seen a species we say of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.480
 imitation of the hour or not the biscuit 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.510
 vanilla chocolate amidst only that i 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.550
 two layers around are made of pasta 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.910
 play doh purple we also have the brand 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.340
 play doh etcetera and the decorations and al 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.780
 center I made a layer of vanilla or 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.000
 using the yellow right here I have 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.140
 caught equal even what one does 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.299
 he saw in the package and I searched 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.860
 just to rebuild it as told ha 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.189
 accelerated everything as I always go to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.659
 crush the pasta well, take a 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.750
 high groom I call it pasta for 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.880
 take out the mold and then go and maybe 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.290
 with a scoop with some other equipment 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.119
 maybe I have at home also 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
 teaspoon to remove the paste into 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.189
 excess and to work well in detail 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.650
 after I go to work you see the pasta 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.450
 yellow created a round of the same 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.189
 size I put it close and eye 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.420
 in short then that the sup le later as the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.759
 drawing from what we have to be own 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 Precisely our style is important 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.630
 it is important to do it more or less 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.829
 similar and give the idea that it is 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.270
 handmade just like the desserts that 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.130
 we do not then at home with 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 headstock moved the various elements then one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.920
 over the other she has made herself and then here it is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.020
 my doses purple loreo and with the middle 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.430
 the family I recommend I don't know that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.320
 throat to eat them but many me 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.990
 often ask immediately for play davide ma 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.250
 you can eat pasta to shape 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.549
 obviously you can't eat from 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 then it doesn't hurt it's edible in between 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.430
 quotation marks so if you eat it and not 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.229
 absolutely nothing happens to me 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.580
 it may happen that a small child tells a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.690
 but what a beautiful ball that a 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.250
 eyes of your certain that it is 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.420
 making davide it's up to me to eat it 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.580
 that maybe tastes like vanilla 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.190
 in reality it is not good that he does not eat it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 you because he didn't think for this 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.220
 but obviously it won't hurt you then 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.140
 reality and I have never tested it but not 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.120
 I don't think it's particularly good either 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.739
 however having said this we move on to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.030
 tutorial you see of the little monster I have 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.280
 created with a nice square mold 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.600
 square I made two little eyes by doing 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.569
 balls with the classic technique 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.190
 hand near hand and rubbing 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.840
 I made some smaller balls 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.880
 for the pupils of the eyes then 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.860
 used the extruder we find 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.420
 inside then the one to do i 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.890
 hair right inside the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.300
 package I used green for i 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.580
 hair then made a mouth 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.260
 snake then have style hand 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.120
 rolling pin I 'm sorry how they went 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.890
 in focus my hair you see that from 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.100
 hair guys ok sorry this me 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.380
 I put my head in front of me, I said to myself 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.850
 distract making the mouth then doing 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.620
 a snake with a rolling pin and then I would like 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.420
 that sideways and is here is the result 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.130
 of the monster then obviously you want 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.049
 amused to make the little monsters of 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.150
 different sizes now we make the biscuit 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.650
 stellina and in this case then it 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.030
 layer must be a little thinner 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.769
 compared to the pink and purple one you have 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.269
 seen of the previous cookies are of 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.570
 been thinner and we go with it 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.010
 star mold to cut them out to make them 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.750
 all the dishes where you help with a 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.280
 rolling pin in other place at play doh 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.489
 there were also smooth materials or 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.070
 do like me to sciacca hear noise and 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.420
 go right in but not to see creates 5 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.000
 little stars using the five colors 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.970
 different and then fair with sum 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.650
 calm food one above the other with 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.910
 this prevailing color order 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.100
 you can make the colors order that 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.200
 you want the turn around that the smoothest part 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.540
 then I go to use the many molds 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.040
 decoration that I find in the saucer a 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.660
 disposition to make a star and I know 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.570
 then I do a pilot bed I don't know 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.250
 how to call it a hoax here we leave 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.019
 lose a pound to put on 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.790
 the biscuit is also our biscuit 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.650
 star is done let's move on to the next 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.540
 biscuit then in the next biscuit 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.790
 we make a heart shape 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.170
 here it is after that we use i 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.209
 smaller hearts that are a 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.459
 arrangement in various decorations that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.170
 they are on the plate and I do three 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.120
 little hearts that I put one up high a 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.370
 left one top right and one 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.930
 under a bit like eyes and hole and then for 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.370
 make the decorations we face I took 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.810
 inspiration from the cover then I got myself 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.220
 invented a little to do from 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.560
 game cover to do this 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.490
 biscuit and then with many pyrolis, yes, yes 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.530
 face 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.880
 small type the tails of sugar no 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.130
 those that you put on the cakes on 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.840
 I do penknife techniques and desserts 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.550
 then I put them is not necessary that they are all 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.470
 great equals that colors are an order 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.690
 precise, that is to say between the beautiful and the 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.639
 fact that you imagine to take 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.650
 the correct sugar from a jar 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.389
 I always feel yellow fat then 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.949
 to throw them over your cookie 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.530
 casually result should be 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.960
 this is showing me and then finally 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.610
 let's move on to the biscuit I have 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.190
 invented just to let you see how 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.960
 the rolling pin works you see I pass 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.940
 above fighting the mild heat 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.250
 I can use one of several 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.000
 decorations that we find turned out is 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:07.979
 the big biscuit and so I make it 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.259
 maybe a state in the middle I chose 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.639
 big babol colorists let's say and then I have 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.630
 made the superior state as I do 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.340
 seeing another form is always 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.650
 using the rolling pin in this case 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.080
 used the shape of the stars 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.190
 which is on the rolling pin and in the end I have to 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 say that a good deal happened 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.930
 cookies and the desire to eat is coming 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.970
 all and in any case you can create cakes 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.620
 various cupcake and cupcakes biscuits 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.509
 type cremate a cream if that does not 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.580
 buckets not like this 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.349
 well I go on no I don't go myself 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.639
 i go to enjoy my cookies and we will 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.620
 see you at the next video if you are me 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.000
 liked the cookies you do not like learned 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.000
 the next hello david
