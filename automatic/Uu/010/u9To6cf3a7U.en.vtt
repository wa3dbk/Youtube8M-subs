which<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.740> lot<00:01:15.189> different<00:01:15.700> than<00:01:15.960> than<00:01:16.960> this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
which is a lot different than than this

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.099 
which is a lot different than than this
bike<00:01:17.549> much<00:01:18.549> much<00:01:18.820> different<00:01:19.060> all<00:01:19.840> right<00:01:19.960> so

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109

bike much much different all right so
what<00:01:20.229> do<00:01:20.320> I<00:01:20.350> do<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:20.799> think<00:01:20.920> about<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.310> ninja<00:01:21.610> 250

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
what do I do I think about the ninja 250

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.510 
what do I do I think about the ninja 250
seating<00:01:23.079> position<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:24.850> very<00:01:25.119> comfortable

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
seating position very very comfortable

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.870 
seating position very very comfortable
it's<00:01:27.520> actually<00:01:27.819> quite<00:01:28.030> similar<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:30.369> drz

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
it's actually quite similar to the drz

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.539 
it's actually quite similar to the drz
anyway<00:01:31.770> except<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.890> Bott<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.189> bars<00:01:33.399> are

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
anyway except the Bott the bars are

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.320 
anyway except the Bott the bars are
obviously<00:01:33.850> lower

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.050 

hirato<00:01:37.990> response<00:01:38.560> obviously<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.580> lot<00:01:39.850> lower

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
hirato response obviously a lot lower

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.170 
hirato response obviously a lot lower
than<00:01:40.210> I'm<00:01:40.450> used<00:01:40.480> to<00:01:40.750> but<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:42.010> for<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> for<00:01:43.150> a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
than I'm used to but it for a for a

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.780 
than I'm used to but it for a for a
first<00:01:43.450> bike<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.870> think<00:01:43.900> it'd<00:01:44.140> be<00:01:44.790> obviously

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
first bike I think it'd be obviously

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.630 
first bike I think it'd be obviously
would<00:01:46.330> be<00:01:46.360> excellent<00:01:46.870> because<00:01:47.050> I<00:01:47.830> really

down the road I think Lorenzo kind of
better<00:06:05.180> knows<00:06:05.420> his

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.470
