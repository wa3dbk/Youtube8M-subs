depends on their how long well depends

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.290 
depends on their how long well depends
on<00:00:38.409> the<00:00:38.499> basically<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.129> how<00:00:39.190> much<00:00:39.370> time<00:00:40.179> it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
on the basically and how much time it

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.629 
on the basically and how much time it
takes<00:00:40.449> the<00:00:40.780> vendor<00:00:41.469> interrogated<00:00:42.309> up<00:00:42.429> there

takes the vendor interrogated up there
one<00:00:43.059> pole<00:00:43.269> position<00:00:43.690> unless<00:00:44.530> it's<00:00:44.769> pretty

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
one pole position unless it's pretty

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.709 
one pole position unless it's pretty
much<00:00:45.039> gets<00:00:45.249> no<00:00:45.399> Edwards<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.909> go<00:00:46.030> hopefully<00:00:46.269> I

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
much gets no Edwards to go hopefully I

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.259 
much gets no Edwards to go hopefully I
don't<00:00:47.289> mess<00:00:47.979> up<00:00:48.010> from<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.549> first<00:00:48.729> place<00:00:49.030> back

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
don't mess up from the first place back

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.360 
don't mess up from the first place back
so<00:00:49.600> we're<00:00:49.960> some<00:00:50.289> reason<00:00:50.530> were<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:50.679> place<00:00:51.010> to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
so we're some reason were in place to

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.039 
so we're some reason were in place to
when<00:00:51.549> we<00:00:51.609> should<00:00:51.760> be<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:51.879> placement<00:00:52.269> wrong<00:00:52.539> well

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
when we should be a placement wrong well

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.860 
when we should be a placement wrong well
