as you can see the spinning thing right
here<00:01:49.790> um<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.630> must<00:01:50.840> be<00:01:51.040> touching<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.160> ground

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
here um it must be touching the ground

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.850 
here um it must be touching the ground
with<00:01:52.490> one<00:01:52.880> these<00:01:53.240> two<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.810> these<00:01:54.140> will

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860
