yeah<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> little<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.650> odd<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:05.070> buy

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
yeah it's a little bit odd you can buy

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.179 
yeah it's a little bit odd you can buy
the<00:01:05.250> car<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.970> 20k<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> sell<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.619> 39

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.920 
the car for 20k but you can sell for 39
k<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.430> you're<00:01:08.670> basically<00:01:08.760> making<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.330> 19<00:01:09.689> k

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
k so you're basically making a 19 k

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.840 
k so you're basically making a 19 k
profit<00:01:10.380> every<00:01:10.590> time<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> sell<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> that's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
profit every time you sell it and that's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
profit every time you sell it and that's
like<00:01:12.030> 19<00:01:12.450> k<00:01:12.600> every<00:01:12.780> five<00:01:12.990> minutes<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.680> I'll

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
like 19 k every five minutes as I'll

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.580 
like 19 k every five minutes as I'll
show<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.250> step<00:01:15.030> 2<00:01:15.240> since<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.320> can't

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
show you this step 2 since you can't

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.289

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
mechanically every five minutes and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.370 
mechanically every five minutes and
that's<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> limit<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.509> um<00:01:21.720> here's<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
