wanting to do this for a really long

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
wanting to do this for a really long
time<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.220> been<00:01:47.369> out<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:47.580> forever

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
time because it's been out there forever

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.690 
time because it's been out there forever
I<00:01:49.140> feel<00:01:49.830> like<00:01:49.890> everyone's<00:01:50.280> done<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I feel like everyone's done that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
I feel like everyone's done that
challenge<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.020> never<00:01:52.140> got<00:01:52.259> around<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
challenge and I just never got around to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
challenge and I just never got around to
it<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.399> figure<00:01:53.640> today<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.880> would<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it so I just figure today I would do it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.289 
it so I just figure today I would do it
and<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.470> um<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.880> makeup<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and this is um all the makeup that I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.149 
and this is um all the makeup that I
could<00:01:57.450> put<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.810> five<00:01:57.960> minutes<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.830> think

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
could put out in five minutes so I think

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.940 
could put out in five minutes so I think
I<00:01:59.369> did<00:01:59.490> pretty<00:01:59.520> well<00:02:00.060> um<00:02:00.570> its<00:02:01.080> losses<00:02:01.740> pretty

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
I did pretty well um its losses pretty

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.800 
I did pretty well um its losses pretty
much<00:02:02.100> everything<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.210> wear<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.659> daily

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
much everything that I wear on a daily

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.929 
much everything that I wear on a daily
basis<00:02:04.680> except<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.130> didn't<00:02:05.340> even<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> my

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
basis except I didn't even get to my

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.389 
basis except I didn't even get to my
bottom<00:02:06.659> lashes<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.409> didn't<00:02:07.680> even<00:02:07.770> put<00:02:08.039> mascara

bottom lashes I didn't even put mascara
on<00:02:08.519> there<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.910> feel<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.420> what's<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> most

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
on there I feel like what's the most

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.630 
on there I feel like what's the most
time<00:02:10.110> consuming<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.709> since<00:02:10.950> Kara<00:02:11.250> put<00:02:11.519> on

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
time consuming and since Kara put on

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.750 
time consuming and since Kara put on
foundation<00:02:12.140> translucent<00:02:13.140> powder<00:02:13.760> blush

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760

lipstick and eyeliner and mascara

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.509 
lipstick and eyeliner and mascara
normally<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.290> guess<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.739> put<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:20.310> bit<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
normally I guess I put a little bit of

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.130 
normally I guess I put a little bit of
shadow<00:02:20.670> my<00:02:20.910> crease<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.150> normally<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> would<00:02:22.019> do

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
shadow my crease to normally I would do

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.890 
shadow my crease to normally I would do
a<00:02:22.170> little<00:02:22.470> bit<00:02:22.650> more<00:02:22.799> like<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.100> put<00:02:23.370> highlighter

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
a little bit more like I put highlighter

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.300 
a little bit more like I put highlighter
is<00:02:24.900> what<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> wish<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.530> could<00:02:25.799> have<00:02:25.920> still<00:02:26.069> put<00:02:26.280> on

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
is what I wish I could have still put on

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.670 
is what I wish I could have still put on
and<00:02:26.700> then<00:02:26.819> bottom<00:02:27.540> lashes<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.380> still

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and then bottom lashes and I still

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.410 
and then bottom lashes and I still
didn't<00:02:28.890> even<00:02:29.040> finish<00:02:29.220> my<00:02:29.340> top<00:02:30.180> lashes

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
didn't even finish my top lashes

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.080 
didn't even finish my top lashes
completely<00:02:31.049> with<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> mascara<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.880> not

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
completely with the mascara so it's not

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.210 
completely with the mascara so it's not
ideal<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:33.810> didn't<00:02:34.049> do<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:34.140> brows<00:02:34.410> either<00:02:34.769> so

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
ideal I didn't do my brows either so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.580 
ideal I didn't do my brows either so
there's<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.330> many<00:02:36.390> extra<00:02:36.810> steps<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.290> feel<00:02:37.470> like

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
there's so many extra steps I feel like

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.770 
there's so many extra steps I feel like
that<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.890> normally<00:02:38.040> would<00:02:38.549> do<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.209> what

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
that I normally would do that is what

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.390 
that I normally would do that is what
causes<00:02:40.049> me<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.410> take<00:02:40.620> more<00:02:40.860> than<00:02:41.010> five<00:02:41.190> minutes

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
causes me to take more than five minutes

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.479 
causes me to take more than five minutes
but<00:02:41.819> um<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.709> all<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:43.890> could<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.310> five

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
but um this is all I could do in five

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.460 
but um this is all I could do in five
minutes<00:02:44.700> then<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.120> guess<00:02:45.269> it's<00:02:45.420> not<00:02:45.570> too<00:02:46.019> awful

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
minutes then I guess it's not too awful

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.860 
minutes then I guess it's not too awful
I<00:02:46.739> did<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.579> much<00:02:47.670> my<00:02:47.850> mascara<00:02:48.239> towards<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> end

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
I did so much my mascara towards the end

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.360 
I did so much my mascara towards the end
which<00:02:49.019> kind<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.320> delayed<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.070> whole<00:02:50.190> process

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
which kind of delayed the whole process

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.770 
which kind of delayed the whole process
for<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.760> 30<00:02:50.940> seconds<00:02:51.329> because<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.570> had<00:02:51.690> to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
for like 30 seconds because I had to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.050 
for like 30 seconds because I had to
like<00:02:51.900> try<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.500> off<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.280> overall<00:02:53.640> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
like try and get it off but overall I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.000 
like try and get it off but overall I
guess<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.510> wasn't<00:02:54.630> too<00:02:54.870> bad<00:02:54.900> um<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.859> reason

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
guess it wasn't too bad um the reason

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
guess it wasn't too bad um the reason
why<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.340> wanted<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.850> make<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> little

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
why I wanted to make a little

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.690 
why I wanted to make a little
