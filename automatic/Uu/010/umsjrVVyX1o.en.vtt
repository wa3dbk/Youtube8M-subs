time I thought was the most obvious one
which<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.559> stained<00:00:46.890> glass<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.250> pains<00:00:47.850> which

it<00:02:08.119> has<00:02:08.270> cold<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:09.110> just<00:02:09.470> thought<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.680> has<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.800> lot

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
it has cold I just thought it has a lot

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.300 
it has cold I just thought it has a lot
more<00:02:10.270> stone<00:02:11.270> than<00:02:11.750> normal<00:02:12.290> then<00:02:12.650> obviously<00:02:12.830> of

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
more stone than normal then obviously of

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.340 
more stone than normal then obviously of
that<00:02:13.940> snow<00:02:14.270> want<00:02:14.510> that's<00:02:14.750> no<00:02:14.930> bond<00:02:15.230> they

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
that snow want that's no bond they

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.980 
that snow want that's no bond they
showed<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.370> these<00:02:17.150> are<00:02:17.210> confirmed<00:02:17.840> but

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
showed and then these are confirmed but

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.090 
showed and then these are confirmed but
I'm<00:02:18.080> assuming<00:02:18.200> they're<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.830> be<00:02:18.920> coming

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
I'm assuming they're going to be coming

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.580 
I'm assuming they're going to be coming
his<00:02:19.400> amplified<00:02:20.060> worlds<00:02:20.600> which<00:02:21.080> means<00:02:21.320> just

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
his amplified worlds which means just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.490 
his amplified worlds which means just
the<00:02:21.980> elevation<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.570> like<00:02:24.140> as<00:02:24.320> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the elevation of is you know like as of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.770 
the elevation of is you know like as of
right<00:02:24.620> now<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.800> think<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.280> hundred<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.730> a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
right now I think it's a hundred is a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.480 
right now I think it's a hundred is a
120<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.960> like<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> tallest<00:02:27.920> mountains<00:02:28.340> you're

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
120 is like the tallest mountains you're

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.250 
120 is like the tallest mountains you're
gonna<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:28.880> normally<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.690> then<00:02:30.140> this

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
gonna get normally and then this

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.930 
gonna get normally and then this
actually<00:02:30.650> increases<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.280> all<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.640> like<00:02:31.820> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
actually increases it all up to like the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.030 
actually increases it all up to like the
mac<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.660> random<00:02:33.050> generator<00:02:33.500> makes

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
mac so the random generator makes

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.610 
mac so the random generator makes
everything<00:02:34.580> just<00:02:34.760> super<00:02:35.360> super<00:02:35.540> tall<00:02:35.930> but

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
everything just super super tall but

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.290 
everything just super super tall but
like<00:02:36.740> I<00:02:36.770> said<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.190> not<00:02:37.310> confirmed<00:02:37.910> okay

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
like I said that is not confirmed okay

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.030 
like I said that is not confirmed okay
so<00:02:38.360> back<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.750> confirm<00:02:38.930> things<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.860> we<00:02:39.950> have

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
so back to confirm things so we have

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.610 
so back to confirm things so we have

exactly sure how this is going to work
I'm<00:03:20.510> assuming<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.050> both<00:03:21.200> something<00:03:21.380> creative

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
I'm assuming you both something creative

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.100 
I'm assuming you both something creative
then<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.640> want<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.910> test<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.630> go<00:03:23.810> into

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
then you want to test it so you go into

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.979 
then you want to test it so you go into
survival<00:03:24.860> or<00:03:25.370> maybe<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.300> host<00:03:26.510> options

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
survival or maybe in the host options

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.590 
survival or maybe in the host options
you<00:03:27.170> can<00:03:27.320> give<00:03:27.640> specific<00:03:28.640> people<00:03:29.000> survival

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
you can give specific people survival

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.050 
you can give specific people survival
specific<00:03:30.230> people<00:03:30.530> creative<00:03:31.130> that<00:03:31.760> could<00:03:31.940> be

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
specific people creative that could be

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.360 
specific people creative that could be
cool<00:03:32.239> also<00:03:33.140> next<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:33.800> change<00:03:34.130> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
cool also next you can change the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.699 
cool also next you can change the
weather<00:03:34.550> meaning<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:35.480> can<00:03:35.690> turn<00:03:36.200> off<00:03:36.260> the

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
weather meaning you can turn off the

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.040 
weather meaning you can turn off the
well<00:03:37.280> they<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.670> turn<00:03:38.120> off<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.269> rain<00:03:38.690> but<00:03:38.959> I'm

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
well they just turn off the rain but I'm

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.690 
well they just turn off the rain but I'm
assuming<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.590> also<00:03:39.860> means<00:03:40.100> turn<00:03:40.400> off<00:03:40.489> the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
assuming that also means turn off the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.120 
assuming that also means turn off the
snow<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.450> then<00:03:42.019> maybe<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.320> can<00:03:42.440> oh<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.040> then

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
snow and then maybe you can oh and then

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.400 
snow and then maybe you can oh and then
also<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.400> can<00:03:43.700> change<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.090> daylight<00:03:44.570> so<00:03:45.170> it's

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
also you can change the daylight so it's

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.590 
also you can change the daylight so it's
a<00:03:45.500> quick<00:03:46.040> change<00:03:46.220> rain<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:46.880> change<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.390> day

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
a quick change rain and change the day

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.180 
a quick change rain and change the day
I'm<00:03:47.930> assuming<00:03:48.320> you<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:49.070> know
