postseason<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.840> kinda<00:00:41.200> had<00:00:41.470> faced<00:00:42.400> a<00:00:42.430> couple

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
postseason we kinda had faced a couple

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.840 
postseason we kinda had faced a couple
obstacles<00:00:43.630> with<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.230> losses<00:00:44.820> midway<00:00:45.820> through

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
obstacles with the losses midway through

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.820 
obstacles with the losses midway through
season<00:00:46.240> and<00:00:46.630> since<00:00:47.140> then<00:00:47.350> I<00:00:47.440> think<00:00:47.680> we've

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
season and since then I think we've

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.160 
season and since then I think we've
grown<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.130> lot<00:00:48.280> as<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> team<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.360> now<00:00:49.840> we<00:00:49.900> know

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
grown a lot as a team and now we know

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.330 
grown a lot as a team and now we know
what's<00:00:50.350> at<00:00:50.470> stake<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.950> what<00:00:51.070> we're<00:00:51.220> really

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
what's at stake and what we're really

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.540 
what's at stake and what we're really
working<00:00:51.550> for<00:00:54.480> anything<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.810> date<00:00:56.520> no<00:00:57.520> I

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
working for anything to that date no I

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.369 
working for anything to that date no I
think<00:00:57.790> we<00:00:59.100> started<00:01:00.100> strong<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:02.850> don't<00:01:04.379> really

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
think we started strong I don't really

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.319 
think we started strong I don't really
know<00:01:05.619> what<00:01:05.740> happened<00:01:06.250> we<00:01:06.430> lost<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.939> close

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
know what happened we lost the close

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.779 
know what happened we lost the close
matches<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.950> we<00:01:09.100> regrouped<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:11.219> the<00:01:12.219> team

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
matches but we regrouped and the team

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.099 
matches but we regrouped and the team
was<00:01:12.969> very<00:01:13.179> determined<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.859> to<00:01:14.859> be<00:01:14.979> better

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
was very determined to to be better

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.039 
was very determined to to be better
we've<00:01:17.109> worked<00:01:17.350> hard<00:01:17.439> to<00:01:17.679> practice<00:01:17.829> gym<00:01:18.310> we

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
we've worked hard to practice gym we

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.459 
we've worked hard to practice gym we
tweak<00:01:20.049> some<00:01:20.319> things<00:01:20.350> along<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:21.039> way<00:01:21.069> and

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
tweak some things along the way and

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.749 
tweak some things along the way and
finish<00:01:23.469> the<00:01:23.590> regular<00:01:23.770> season<00:01:24.069> very<00:01:24.460> strong

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
finish the regular season very strong

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.929 
finish the regular season very strong
and<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.369> know<00:01:27.429> I<00:01:27.490> think<00:01:27.700> we're<00:01:27.819> playing

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
and you know I think we're playing

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.999 
and you know I think we're playing
really<00:01:28.270> good<00:01:28.359> volleyball<00:01:28.749> now<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.289> hope<00:01:29.979> to

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
really good volleyball now and hope to

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.910 
really good volleyball now and hope to
continue<00:01:30.460> on<00:01:30.759> in<00:01:30.999> the<00:01:31.090> playoffs<00:01:34.829> Emily<00:01:35.829> as

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
continue on in the playoffs Emily as

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.600 
continue on in the playoffs Emily as
good<00:01:36.100> as<00:01:36.219> it<00:01:36.369> feels<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.759> be<00:01:36.789> at<00:01:36.999> home

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
good as it feels to be at home

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.500 
good as it feels to be at home
they're<00:01:37.790> more<00:01:37.970> pressure<00:01:38.300> I<00:01:40.270> guess<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.390> could

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
they're more pressure I guess you could

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.650 
they're more pressure I guess you could
look<00:01:41.540> at<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.870> that<00:01:41.990> way<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:42.800> I<00:01:43.420> think<00:01:44.420> it's<00:01:44.570> a

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
look at it that way but I think it's a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.230 
look at it that way but I think it's a
huge<00:01:44.840> advantage<00:01:45.380> for<00:01:45.410> us<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:46.040> it's<00:01:46.970> not<00:01:47.120> so

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
huge advantage for us and it's not so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.230 
huge advantage for us and it's not so
much<00:01:47.300> pressure<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.550> I'm<00:01:49.550> just<00:01:49.850> excitement

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
much pressure but I'm just excitement

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.810 
much pressure but I'm just excitement
going<00:01:50.540> into<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:50.990> tournament<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.730> when<00:01:52.730> we

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
going into the tournament and when we

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.130 
going into the tournament and when we
play<00:01:53.030> at<00:01:53.150> home<00:01:53.330> we<00:01:53.480> tend<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.810> have<00:01:53.960> better

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
play at home we tend to have better

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.860 
play at home we tend to have better
matches<00:01:54.680> then<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.330> road<00:01:56.479> we've<00:01:56.690> had<00:01:56.840> a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
matches then on the road we've had a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.440 
matches then on the road we've had a
struggle<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.350> little<00:01:57.470> bit<00:01:57.620> so<00:01:57.979> i<00:01:58.040> think<00:01:58.450> it's

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
struggle a little bit so i think it's

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.350 
struggle a little bit so i think it's
huge<00:02:00.440> for<00:02:00.500> us<00:02:04.570> do<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.660> think<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.020> uh<00:02:07.360> it's

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
huge for us do you think that uh it's

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.520 
huge for us do you think that uh it's
almost<00:02:08.509> like<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> guys<00:02:08.899> are<00:02:09.080> planning<00:02:09.229> and

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
almost like you guys are planning and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.719 
almost like you guys are planning and
see<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.709> blame<00:02:09.920> at<00:02:10.070> every<00:02:10.310> time<00:02:10.490> you're<00:02:10.640> at

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
see the blame at every time you're at

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.630 
see the blame at every time you're at
home<00:02:10.850> or<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.720> these<00:02:11.870> other<00:02:12.050> teams<00:02:12.400> get<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.550> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
home or is these other teams get to the

uh<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:26.360> mean<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.200> think<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.680> said<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.070> is

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
uh I mean I think like you said it is

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.130 
uh I mean I think like you said it is
probably<00:02:28.820> eye-opening<00:02:29.390> when<00:02:29.570> teams<00:02:29.840> come<00:02:30.110> in

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
probably eye-opening when teams come in

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.949 
probably eye-opening when teams come in
and<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.560> play<00:02:30.739> in<00:02:30.890> front<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.130> such<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.400> large

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
and you play in front of such a large

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.570 
and you play in front of such a large
crowd<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.709> know<00:02:33.950> we're<00:02:34.160> gonna<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> lot

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
crowd and I know we're gonna have a lot

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.180 
crowd and I know we're gonna have a lot
of<00:02:34.610> fans<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.120> weekend<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.230> think<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:37.010> a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
of fans this weekend so I think it's a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.970 
of fans this weekend so I think it's a
little<00:02:37.310> bit<00:02:37.430> overwhelming<00:02:38.060> maybe<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:39.380> I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
little bit overwhelming maybe but I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.860 
little bit overwhelming maybe but I
think<00:02:40.310> like<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.700> said<00:02:40.910> we're<00:02:41.060> used<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.660> and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
think like you said we're used to it and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.420 
think like you said we're used to it and
we're<00:02:41.989> excited<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.620> get<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.769> play<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.160> front<00:02:43.280> of

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
in the middle of the season does that

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.289 
in the middle of the season does that
help<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:52.370> situation<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
help you it is in this situation to

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.660 
help you it is in this situation to
remain<00:02:54.140> focused<00:02:54.650> on<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.920> task<00:02:54.950> at<00:02:55.340> hand<00:02:55.400> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
remain focused on the task at hand and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.070 
remain focused on the task at hand and
not<00:02:55.730> look<00:02:56.030> ahead<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.600> next<00:02:56.630> night's

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
not look ahead to the next night's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.979 
not look ahead to the next night's
potential<00:02:57.769> match<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.390> think<00:02:59.390> that<00:02:59.840> always

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
potential match I think that always

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.190 
potential match I think that always
teaches<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.620> something<00:03:00.860> no<00:03:01.640> matter<00:03:01.820> what

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
teaches you something no matter what

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.539 
teaches you something no matter what
when<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.320> hit<00:03:03.530> kind<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.799> rough<00:03:03.950> spots<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.459> the

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
when you hit kind of rough spots in the

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.770 
when you hit kind of rough spots in the
season<00:03:04.940> or<00:03:05.090> something<00:03:05.330> like<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.480> you're

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
season or something like that you're

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.750 
season or something like that you're
always<00:03:05.930> learning<00:03:06.140> something<00:03:06.350> new<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.670> think

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
always learning something new so I think

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820 
always learning something new so I think
that<00:03:07.910> taught<00:03:08.690> us<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.870> take<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.440> game<00:03:09.620> at<00:03:09.799> a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
that taught us to take a one game at a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.890 
that taught us to take a one game at a
time<00:03:09.920> before<00:03:10.340> we<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.820> really<00:03:10.940> get<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.720> end

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
time before we can really get to the end

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.440 
time before we can really get to the end
bowl<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:16.160> like<00:03:16.310> just<00:03:16.459> get<00:03:16.790> back<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.000> other

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
bowl and like just get back that other

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.770 
bowl and like just get back that other
question<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:18.799> wondering<00:03:19.160> if

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
question that and just wondering if

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.940 
question that and just wondering if
those<00:03:20.780> teams<00:03:20.989> get<00:03:21.140> inspiration<00:03:21.650> from<00:03:21.680> being

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
those teams get inspiration from being

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.820 
those teams get inspiration from being
in<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.160> NC<00:03:22.400> double-a<00:03:23.350> for<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.380> lot<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.650> teams

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
in the NC double-a for a lot of teams

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.140 
in the NC double-a for a lot of teams
they<00:03:25.070> thrive<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.549> this<00:03:25.640> kind<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:25.970> atmosphere

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
they thrive in this kind of atmosphere

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.600 
they thrive in this kind of atmosphere
which<00:03:26.750> they<00:03:26.900> haven't<00:03:27.080> seen<00:03:27.320> before<00:03:27.440> or<00:03:28.340> as<00:03:28.489> you

be
tournament<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.840> giving<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.990> everything<00:03:42.200> they

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
tournament and giving it everything they

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.190

have<00:03:42.680> really<00:03:43.220> nothing<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.580> lose<00:03:43.850> with<00:03:44.180> us<00:03:44.930> I

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
have really nothing to lose with us I

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.830 
have really nothing to lose with us I
feel<00:03:45.950> we<00:03:46.310> are<00:03:46.460> expected<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.210> win<00:03:47.330> maybe<00:03:47.600> in

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
feel we are expected to win maybe in

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.460 
feel we are expected to win maybe in
this<00:03:48.160> situation<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.960> so<00:03:50.960> I<00:03:50.990> couldn't<00:03:51.350> see

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
this situation and so I couldn't see

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.200 
this situation and so I couldn't see
that<00:03:51.680> being<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:51.890> disadvantage<00:03:52.400> but<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.880> this

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
that being a disadvantage but in this

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.150 
that being a disadvantage but in this
case<00:03:53.510> knowing<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.170> it's<00:03:54.290> postseason<00:03:54.980> it's

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
case knowing that it's postseason it's

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.540 
case knowing that it's postseason it's
not<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.370> regular<00:03:56.030> season<00:03:56.390> match<00:03:56.540> anymore<00:03:56.870> and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
not a regular season match anymore and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.729 
turned a corner out after that match or
got<00:04:20.209> back<00:04:20.450> on<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.690> track<00:04:21.020> that<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.290> guys<00:04:21.470> had

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
got back on the track that you guys had

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.080 
got back on the track that you guys had
earlier<00:04:23.260> yeah<00:04:24.260> that<00:04:24.500> was<00:04:24.650> our<00:04:24.770> first<00:04:25.190> five

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
earlier yeah that was our first five

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.200 
earlier yeah that was our first five
that<00:04:26.840> game<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:28.400> we<00:04:28.550> had<00:04:28.700> one<00:04:28.910> since

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
that game that we had one since

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.680 
that game that we had one since
Creighton<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:31.670> think<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:32.120> was<00:04:32.480> pretty

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
Creighton and so I think that was pretty

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.860 
Creighton and so I think that was pretty
big<00:04:32.900> for<00:04:33.110> us<00:04:33.170> but<00:04:33.940> even<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.150> match<00:04:35.570> we

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
big for us but even that match we

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.330 
big for us but even that match we
weren't<00:04:36.050> playing<00:04:36.410> really<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:37.040> my<00:04:37.100> full

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
weren't playing really to my full

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.050 
weren't playing really to my full
potential<00:04:37.670> as<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.890> after<00:04:39.890> that<00:04:40.100> we<00:04:40.790> started

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
potential as a and after that we started

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.730 
potential as a and after that we started
thinking<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.360> them<00:04:41.480> practice<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.230> since<00:04:42.530> them

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
thinking of them practice and since them

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.830 
thinking of them practice and since them
have<00:04:42.950> come<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.310> long<00:04:43.400> way<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:44.480> played<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.720> lot

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
have come a long way and played a lot

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.640 
have come a long way and played a lot
better<00:04:44.870> than<00:04:47.140> effective<00:04:48.140> I<00:04:49.930> mean<00:04:50.930> we<00:04:51.050> didn't

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
better than effective I mean we didn't

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.710 
better than effective I mean we didn't
have<00:04:51.800> our<00:04:51.830> best<00:04:52.190> match<00:04:52.400> Santa<00:04:53.030> Barbara<00:04:53.390> but<00:04:53.570> we

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
have our best match Santa Barbara but we

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.970 
have our best match Santa Barbara but we
fought<00:04:54.530> hard<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:55.390> just<00:04:56.530> somehow<00:04:57.530> managed<00:04:57.950> to

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
fought hard and just somehow managed to

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.930 
fought hard and just somehow managed to
win<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.910> take<00:04:59.270> Emily's<00:04:59.660> rightly<00:05:00.730> you<00:05:01.730> got

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
win but I take Emily's rightly you got

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.520 
win but I take Emily's rightly you got
back<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.510> I<00:05:04.300> think<00:05:05.300> that's<00:05:05.540> when<00:05:05.840> we<00:05:06.020> we<00:05:06.380> had<00:05:06.500> a

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
back and I think that's when we we had a

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.040 
back and I think that's when we we had a
little<00:05:06.680> change<00:05:06.980> over<00:05:07.220> lineup<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.820> we<00:05:08.560> just

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.580 

I<00:05:13.139> think<00:05:13.919> we<00:05:14.190> were<00:05:17.840> forced<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:18.990> look<00:05:19.199> at<00:05:19.379> some

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
I think we were forced to look at some

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.680 
I think we were forced to look at some
things<00:05:19.620> on<00:05:20.720> our<00:05:21.720> team<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.229> we<00:05:22.319> still<00:05:22.919> I

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
things on our team and we still I

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.999 
things on our team and we still I
thought<00:05:24.690> could<00:05:24.960> be<00:05:25.139> better<00:05:25.409> and<00:05:27.740> after<00:05:28.740> the

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
thought could be better and after the

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.029 
thought could be better and after the
match<00:05:29.190> we<00:05:29.370> came<00:05:29.580> home<00:05:29.789> and<00:05:29.849> regroup<00:05:31.009> then<00:05:32.009> I

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
match we came home and regroup then I

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.950 
match we came home and regroup then I
think<00:05:32.460> he<00:05:32.580> started<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.150> believe<00:05:33.629> in<00:05:33.870> ourselves

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
think he started to believe in ourselves

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.780 
think he started to believe in ourselves
and<00:05:34.440> play<00:05:34.979> better

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.950 

no<00:05:41.420> businessman<00:05:41.870> Dustin<00:05:43.030> Mendoza<00:05:44.030> has<00:05:44.300> just

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
no businessman Dustin Mendoza has just

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.600 
no businessman Dustin Mendoza has just
surprised<00:05:45.470> me<00:05:45.650> game<00:05:46.490> after<00:05:46.850> game<00:05:47.060> she<00:05:48.610> just

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
surprised me game after game she just

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.430 
surprised me game after game she just
makes<00:05:49.850> plays<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.570> we<00:05:50.660> had<00:05:51.020> her<00:05:51.110> in<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.290> right

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
makes plays and we had her in the right

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.230 
makes plays and we had her in the right
back<00:05:51.710> for<00:05:52.010> a<00:05:52.040> long<00:05:52.250> time<00:05:52.520> and<00:05:52.850> then<00:05:53.030> we

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
back for a long time and then we

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.690 
back for a long time and then we
switched<00:05:53.540> her<00:05:53.720> over<00:05:53.900> to<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.140> middle<00:05:54.380> back<00:05:54.560> and

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
switched her over to the middle back and

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.950 
switched her over to the middle back and
she's<00:05:55.700> not<00:05:55.850> your<00:05:56.090> typical<00:05:56.240> middle<00:05:56.810> back

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
she's not your typical middle back

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.800 
she's not your typical middle back
player<00:05:57.410> with<00:05:57.650> a<00:05:57.710> lot<00:05:57.890> of<00:05:57.920> reining<00:05:58.340> she<00:05:58.550> just

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.850 

you<00:06:02.810> know<00:06:02.840> she<00:06:02.960> has<00:06:03.170> great<00:06:03.410> hand-eye

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
you know she has great hand-eye

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.480 
you know she has great hand-eye
coordination<00:06:04.430> and<00:06:04.880> seems<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.750> come<00:06:05.990> up<00:06:06.110> with

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
coordination and seems to come up with

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.070 
coordination and seems to come up with
some<00:06:07.490> big<00:06:07.700> digs<00:06:08.030> she's<00:06:08.630> not<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.960> most

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
some big digs she's not the most

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.310 
some big digs she's not the most
athletic<00:06:12.340> player<00:06:13.340> on<00:06:13.550> her<00:06:13.670> team<00:06:13.940> but<00:06:14.320> she

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
athletic player on her team but she

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.920 
athletic player on her team but she
makes<00:06:15.560> more<00:06:15.860> plays<00:06:16.130> than<00:06:16.160> anybody<00:06:16.730> else<00:06:16.940> and<00:06:19.930> I

makes more plays than anybody else and I

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.200 
makes more plays than anybody else and I
can't<00:06:21.290> say<00:06:21.500> enough<00:06:21.530> about<00:06:21.860> how<00:06:22.280> she's<00:06:22.940> picked

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
can't say enough about how she's picked
