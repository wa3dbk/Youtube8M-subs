00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
know that he's now basically he was

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.580 
know that he's now basically he was
always<00:00:12.509> designed<00:00:12.690> as<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:14.059> mage<00:00:15.139> sniper<00:00:16.139> type

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
always designed as a mage sniper type

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740 
always designed as a mage sniper type
idea<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.160> he<00:00:17.250> could<00:00:17.300> set<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.390> assault<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
idea where he could set up assault and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.060 
idea where he could set up assault and
he<00:00:18.869> could<00:00:19.020> pick<00:00:19.140> people<00:00:19.410> off<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.710> he<00:00:19.800> wanted

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
he could pick people off that he wanted

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.730 
he could pick people off that he wanted
to<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:21.119> because<00:00:21.480> his<00:00:21.900> damage<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.560> high

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
to but because his damage was so high

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.040 
to but because his damage was so high
because<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> sniper<00:00:23.699> idea<00:00:24.150> he<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.900> just

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
because of the sniper idea he was just

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.839 
because of the sniper idea he was just
nailing<00:00:25.560> people<00:00:25.859> close<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> him<00:00:26.340> that's<00:00:26.699> what

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
nailing people close to him that's what

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820 
nailing people close to him that's what
they're<00:00:26.970> saying<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> issue<00:00:27.480> right<00:00:27.869> so

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
they're saying is the issue right so

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.880 
they're saying is the issue right so
nerves<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> little<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:30.119> give<00:00:30.240> him<00:00:30.420> some

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
nerves it a little bit to give him some

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.860 
nerves it a little bit to give him some
so<00:00:31.890> incentive<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.669> try<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.000> snipe<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:33.719> other

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so incentive to try to snipe some other

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.569 
so incentive to try to snipe some other
people<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.800> there's<00:00:34.980> gonna<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
people so there's gonna be more of a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.010 
people so there's gonna be more of a
threat<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> back<00:00:36.059> line<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.510> less<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
threat to the back line and less of a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.690 
threat to the back line and less of a
threat<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.559> whoever<00:00:38.070> makes<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> first

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
threat to whoever makes the first

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.420 
threat to whoever makes the first
mistake<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.250> nicely

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
mistake you know it's kind of nicely

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.920 
mistake you know it's kind of nicely
they<00:00:41.820> basically<00:00:42.090> work<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.570> whole<00:00:42.690> kit

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
they basically work just whole kit

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.840 
they basically work just whole kit
there's<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.100> goes<00:00:44.219> into<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> just

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
there's a lot that goes into it just

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
there's a lot that goes into it just
know<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.719> he's<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> try<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> snipe<00:00:46.649> you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
know that he's going to try to snipe you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.660 
know that he's going to try to snipe you
if<00:00:46.890> you're<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.309> further<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
if you're a little bit further in the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.930 
if you're a little bit further in the
back<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:48.920> some<00:00:49.920> decent<00:00:50.250> changes<00:00:50.520> discarding

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
back now some decent changes discarding

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.490 
back now some decent changes discarding
here<00:00:52.969> mostly<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.449> how<00:00:54.870> his<00:00:55.079> abilities

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
here mostly to do with how his abilities

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
here mostly to do with how his abilities
work<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.090> much<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
work not how much not so much the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720 
work not how much not so much the
numbers<00:00:57.739> they<00:00:58.739> changed<00:00:59.160> things<00:00:59.340> from<00:00:59.609> one

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
numbers they changed things from one

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.510 
numbers they changed things from one
ability<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.180> another<00:01:00.420> different<00:01:01.379> ability<00:01:01.710> he

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
ability to another different ability he

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670 
ability to another different ability he
no<00:01:02.609> longer<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> heel<00:01:03.480> mechanic<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.320> one

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
no longer has the heel mechanic on one

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.980 
no longer has the heel mechanic on one
of<00:01:04.769> his<00:01:04.830> abilities<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.780> all<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> his

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
of his abilities and all of his

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.160 
of his abilities and all of his
abilities<00:01:07.409> basically<00:01:07.950> scale<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.549> now<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:10.080> he

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
abilities basically scale up now so he

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.120 
abilities basically scale up now so he
get<00:01:10.320> some<00:01:10.439> tak<00:01:10.619> speed<00:01:10.830> buff<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.220> he<00:01:11.460> uses<00:01:12.799> his<00:01:13.799> Q

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
get some tak speed buff as he uses his Q

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.440 
get some tak speed buff as he uses his Q
and<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> stacks<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> three<00:01:15.090> times<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
and it stacks up to three times but it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
and it stacks up to three times but it
yeah<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.630> sex<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> three<00:01:19.140> times<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.560> then

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
yeah it's sex up to three times and then

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859 
yeah it's sex up to three times and then
something<00:01:20.220> else<00:01:20.400> sorry<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.630> very

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
something else sorry this is very

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
something else sorry this is very
foolish<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> something<00:01:22.650> else<00:01:22.740> ramps<00:01:23.460> up

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
foolish and something else ramps up

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.240 
foolish and something else ramps up
there<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:23.939> crystalline<00:01:24.810> exoskeleton<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
there we are crystalline exoskeleton the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
there we are crystalline exoskeleton the
movement<00:01:26.400> speed<00:01:26.640> bumps<00:01:26.850> ramps<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.240> over<00:01:27.689> three

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
movement speed bumps ramps up over three

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
movement speed bumps ramps up over three
seconds<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.770> kind<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> makes<00:01:29.070> him<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> little

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
seconds so it kind of makes him a little

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.690 
seconds so it kind of makes him a little
bit<00:01:29.579> less<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.049> once<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.500> also<00:01:31.920> they<00:01:32.369> fixed

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bit less all at once and also they fixed

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.359 
bit less all at once and also they fixed
his<00:01:32.850> ultimate<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.780> he<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.439> say<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:35.159> I've

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
his ultimate so he doesn't say now I've

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
his ultimate so he doesn't say now I've
got<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.640> before<00:01:36.150> he<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.360> has<00:01:36.659> some<00:01:36.810> once

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
got you before he actually has some once

moves<00:02:09.179> faster<00:02:09.810> close<00:02:10.110> traveling<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> slows

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
moves faster close traveling and slows

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.850 
moves faster close traveling and slows
down<00:02:11.310> noticeably<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:13.200> gets<00:02:13.349> farther

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
down noticeably as it gets farther

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
down noticeably as it gets farther
so<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.250> does<00:02:14.400> hit<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.820> close<00:02:15.480> targets<00:02:15.900> so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
so that it does hit all close targets so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.360 
so that it does hit all close targets so
basically<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> right<00:02:16.950> beside<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.250> you'll

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
hate it with tonight you'll hit them

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.560 
hate it with tonight you'll hit them
with<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.390> every<00:02:18.570> time<00:02:19.190> kills<00:02:20.190> q<00:02:20.670> ap<00:02:21.360> ratio

has<00:02:21.630> been<00:02:21.780> nerfed<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.050> little<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.320> her<00:02:22.500> heel

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
has been nerfed a little bit her heel

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.820 
has been nerfed a little bit her heel
has<00:02:22.980> been<00:02:23.190> increased<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.670> little<00:02:23.760> bit<00:02:23.970> so

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
has been increased a little bit so

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.980 
has been increased a little bit so
that'll<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.890> nice<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.390> intervention<00:02:27.870> no

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
that'll be nice and then intervention no

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.980 
that'll be nice and then intervention no
longer<00:02:28.200> costs<00:02:28.410> mana<00:02:28.740> which<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.310> cool<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.540> guess

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
longer costs mana which is cool I guess

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.510 
longer costs mana which is cool I guess
because<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.440> lot<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.770> times<00:02:32.070> you'd<00:02:32.250> be<00:02:32.400> running

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
because a lot of times you'd be running

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.670 
because a lot of times you'd be running
away<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:32.970> no<00:02:33.090> mana<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:33.680> interesting

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
away and have no mana but interesting

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.840 
away and have no mana but interesting
change<00:02:34.920> i'm<00:02:35.070> not<00:02:35.190> sure<00:02:35.310> why<00:02:35.430> they<00:02:35.550> made<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> but

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
change i'm not sure why they made it but

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.060 
change i'm not sure why they made it but
they<00:02:35.910> did<00:02:36.320> Riven<00:02:37.320> got<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.800> f'ing<00:02:38.400> buff<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:40.070> don't

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
they did Riven got of f'ing buff I don't

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.920 
they did Riven got of f'ing buff I don't
get<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.220> her<00:02:41.820> base<00:02:42.060> health<00:02:42.330> regen<00:02:42.630> has<00:02:42.780> been

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
get it her base health regen has been

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.680 
get it her base health regen has been
cut<00:02:43.110> almost<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.740> little<00:02:44.520> bit<00:02:44.730> more<00:02:45.180> than<00:02:45.480> half

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
cut almost a little bit more than half

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.020 
cut almost a little bit more than half
so<00:02:46.530> that's<00:02:46.650> probably<00:02:46.890> good<00:02:47.220> actually<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.610> her

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so that's probably good actually but her

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.620 
so that's probably good actually but her
shield<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.810> her<00:02:48.930> valor<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:50.000> 20<00:02:51.000> stronger<00:02:51.480> at

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
shield on her valor is 20 stronger at

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.660 
shield on her valor is 20 stronger at
every<00:02:51.930> level<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.860> make<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.070> no<00:02:53.220> sense<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.640> me

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
every level that make a no sense to me

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.270 
every level that make a no sense to me
but<00:02:54.350> if<00:02:55.350> they<00:02:55.530> think<00:02:55.590> that's<00:02:55.770> what<00:02:55.950> balance<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
but if they think that's what balance is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.090 
but if they think that's what balance is
the<00:02:56.430> game<00:02:56.610> that's<00:02:57.480> cool<00:02:57.750> rumble<00:02:58.680> now<00:02:58.800> doesn't

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
the game that's cool rumble now doesn't

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.250 
the game that's cool rumble now doesn't
throw<00:02:59.430> meet<00:02:59.610> walls<00:02:59.790> he<00:03:00.030> throws<00:03:00.300> flames<00:03:00.720> that

throw meet walls he throws flames that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.780 
throw meet walls he throws flames that
was<00:03:01.380> kind<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.070> funny<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.400> because<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.700> never

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
was kind of a funny one because I never

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.600 
was kind of a funny one because I never
thought<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.239> until<00:03:03.540> i<00:03:03.570> read<00:03:03.720> that

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
thought of that until i read that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.010 
thought of that until i read that
Thresh's<00:03:05.610> auto<00:03:05.850> range<00:03:06.209> has<00:03:06.390> been<00:03:06.540> reduced<00:03:06.870> a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
Thresh's auto range has been reduced a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.390 
Thresh's auto range has been reduced a
little<00:03:07.110> bit<00:03:07.320> yeah<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.430> did<00:03:08.670> not<00:03:08.820> get<00:03:08.970> nerfed<00:03:09.260> so

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
little bit yeah so did not get nerfed so

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.910 
little bit yeah so did not get nerfed so
riot<00:03:11.400> we're<00:03:11.670> all<00:03:11.820> very<00:03:11.970> sad<00:03:12.360> um<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.650> you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.620 
decrease how much flow he gets so
hopefully<00:03:23.610> they<00:03:23.730> actually<00:03:24.150> nerve<00:03:24.330> from<00:03:24.450> in

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
hopefully they actually nerve from in

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.900 
hopefully they actually nerve from in
the<00:03:24.690> next<00:03:24.930> patch<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.440> we'll<00:03:26.160> really<00:03:26.489> hope<00:03:26.700> for

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
the next patch and we'll really hope for

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.009 
the next patch and we'll really hope for
that<00:03:27.000> because<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.330> don't<00:03:27.480> know<00:03:27.510> from<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.810> next

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
that because I don't know from the next

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:28.880 
that because I don't know from the next
patch<00:03:28.140> it's<00:03:28.380> probably<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.769> be<00:03:28.830> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
patch it's probably going to be a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.470 
patch it's probably going to be a
permanent<00:03:29.070> things<00:03:29.340> gonna<00:03:29.489> be<00:03:29.580> bad<00:03:31.700> ziggs<00:03:32.700> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
permanent things gonna be bad ziggs the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.789 
permanent things gonna be bad ziggs the
interesting<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.930> me<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.320> minefield

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
interesting one to me is the minefield

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.020 
interesting one to me is the minefield
you<00:03:34.890> only<00:03:35.010> take<00:03:35.160> forty<00:03:35.370> percent<00:03:35.549> damage<00:03:35.700> from

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
you only take forty percent damage from

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.370 
you only take forty percent damage from
each<00:03:36.269> mine<00:03:36.510> after<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.870> first<00:03:37.049> one<00:03:37.230> which<00:03:37.350> is

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
each mine after the first one which is

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.030 
each mine after the first one which is
really<00:03:37.799> nice<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.299> his<00:03:39.299> passive<00:03:39.830> scales<00:03:40.830> a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
really nice and his passive scales a

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.979 
really nice and his passive scales a
little<00:03:41.070> bit<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.030> early<00:03:42.420> levels<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.720> not<00:03:42.870> quite

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
little bit so early levels is not quite

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.100 
little bit so early levels is not quite
as<00:03:43.110> good<00:03:43.200> an<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.380> gets<00:03:43.440> better<00:03:43.680> better<00:03:44.610> they<00:03:44.820> do

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
as good an it gets better better they do

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.650 
as good an it gets better better they do
video<00:03:46.110> later<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.790> don't<00:03:48.299> believe<00:03:48.360> at<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.630> end

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
video later I don't believe at the end

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.420 
video later I don't believe at the end
game<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.200> not<00:03:49.769> as<00:03:50.010> good<00:03:50.190> anymore<00:03:51.110> um<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:53.310> only

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
game is not as good anymore um you only

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.410 
game is not as good anymore um you only
I'll<00:03:53.580> be<00:03:53.670> able<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.850> see<00:03:54.000> how<00:03:54.090> many<00:03:54.239> stacks

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
I'll be able to see how many stacks

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.780 
I'll be able to see how many stacks
akali<00:03:54.780> has<00:03:54.989> from<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.920> enemy<00:03:56.220> perspective

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
akali has from the enemy perspective

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.559 
akali has from the enemy perspective
kind<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.269> on<00:03:57.360> their<00:03:57.480> bottom<00:03:57.750> toolbar<00:03:57.930> thing

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.240 

and<00:04:03.569> then<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.319> rest<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.560> just<00:04:04.620> kind<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:04.980> little

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
and then the rest is just kind of little

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.070 
and then the rest is just kind of little
stuff<00:04:05.599> aesthetic<00:04:06.599> shears<00:04:06.780> probably<00:04:07.020> the

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
stuff aesthetic shears probably the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.050 
stuff aesthetic shears probably the
biggest<00:04:07.200> change<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:08.340> only<00:04:08.640> critically

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
biggest change it only critically

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.240 
biggest change it only critically
strikes<00:04:09.390> when<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.590> associated<00:04:11.099> tack

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
strikes when the associated tack

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.199 
strikes when the associated tack
critically<00:04:11.640> strikes<00:04:12.270> which<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:16.669> good<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.910> guess

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
critically strikes which is good I guess

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.550 
critically strikes which is good I guess
because<00:04:18.690> before<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.049> kind<00:04:19.230> of<00:04:19.260> do<00:04:19.350> its<00:04:19.470> own

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
because before it kind of do its own

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.500 
because before it kind of do its own
thing<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:19.950> everything<00:04:20.489> else<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.090> kind<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.389> bug

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
thing but everything else is kind of bug

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.120 
thing but everything else is kind of bug
fixes<00:04:21.540> oh<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.109> perseverance<00:04:22.650> got<00:04:22.770> nursed<00:04:22.980> by

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
fixes oh and perseverance got nursed by

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.520 
fixes oh and perseverance got nursed by
half<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.690> just<00:04:24.840> keep<00:04:24.900> your<00:04:25.020> eyes<00:04:25.139> out<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.350> that

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
half so just keep your eyes out for that

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.950 
half so just keep your eyes out for that
although<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.160> still<00:04:26.280> think<00:04:26.669> it's<00:04:26.790> probably<00:04:27.000> the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
although I still think it's probably the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.810 
although I still think it's probably the
best<00:04:27.990> option<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:29.070> those<00:04:29.250> are<00:04:29.340> my<00:04:29.400> patch<00:04:29.610> notes

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
best option so those are my patch notes

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.370 
best option so those are my patch notes
