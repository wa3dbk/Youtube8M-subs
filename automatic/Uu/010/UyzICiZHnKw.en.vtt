00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
growth of the school when you think now

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.060 
growth of the school when you think now
we<00:02:45.030> can't<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> whole<00:02:46.200> school<00:02:46.500> photo<00:02:46.890> we

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.620 
we can't have a whole school photo we
haven't<00:02:47.340> really<00:02:47.489> got<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> location<00:02:48.120> where<00:02:48.480> we

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
haven't really got a location where we

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.320 
haven't really got a location where we
can<00:02:48.840> conveniently<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.030> look<00:02:51.180> in

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
can conveniently do that and you look in

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.940 
can conveniently do that and you look in
the<00:02:51.420> yearbooks<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.440> see<00:02:52.620> these<00:02:52.739> very

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the yearbooks and you can see these very

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.100 
the yearbooks and you can see these very
small<00:02:53.610> clusters<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.390> children<00:02:54.959> being

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
small clusters of children being

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.800 
small clusters of children being
photographed<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.580> there<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.090> now<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.630> course

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
photographed and there and now of course

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.380 
photographed and there and now of course
it<00:02:58.110> was<00:02:58.230> spread<00:02:58.500> across<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.580> know<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.850> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
it was spread across you know the the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.440 
it was spread across you know the the
entire<00:03:00.750> page<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.500> there<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.920> more<00:03:02.459> well<00:03:03.420> I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
entire page in there and more well I

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.080 
entire page in there and more well I
came<00:03:03.840> from<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.170> UK<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> get<00:03:05.100> my<00:03:05.250> job<00:03:05.520> here<00:03:05.790> in

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
came from the UK to get my job here in

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.570 
came from the UK to get my job here in
west<00:03:06.480> island<00:03:06.690> school<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.980> contrast

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
west island school and the contrast

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.660 
west island school and the contrast
between<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.209> two<00:03:09.570> was<00:03:09.750> huge<00:03:10.230> because<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
between the two was huge because the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.610 
between the two was huge because the
school<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.120> taught<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.570> Essex<00:03:13.110> was<00:03:13.320> quite<00:03:13.590> a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
school I taught in Essex was quite a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.949 
school I taught in Essex was quite a
tough<00:03:13.920> school<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.520> then<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.360> took<00:03:15.510> me<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> while

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
tough school and then it took me a while

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.990 
tough school and then it took me a while
to<00:03:16.019> relax<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.160> realize<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.760> children

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
to relax and realize that the children

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240 
to relax and realize that the children
were<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.600> very<00:03:18.630> trustworthy<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.830> they

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
were really very trustworthy and they

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.890 
were really very trustworthy and they
could<00:03:20.549> leave<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.030> room<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.299> go<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.840> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
could leave the room and go and get a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.930 
could leave the room and go and get a
book<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.470> they<00:03:22.680> would<00:03:22.860> come<00:03:22.890> back<00:03:23.310> again<00:03:23.489> you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
book and they would come back again you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.810 
book and they would come back again you
know<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.739> was<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.220> thing<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
know and I think that was the thing the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.360 
know and I think that was the thing the
biggest<00:03:27.299> impression<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.230> had<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.920> how

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
biggest impression that I had was how

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.940 
biggest impression that I had was how
relaxing<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.510> was<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.959> teach<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.320> students

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
relaxing it was to teach the students

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.220 
relaxing it was to teach the students
because<00:03:32.340> they<00:03:32.370> were<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.330> easy<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.080> along

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
because they were so easy to get along

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.620 
because they were so easy to get along
with<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.920> they<00:03:35.190> enjoyed<00:03:35.549> being<00:03:35.790> at<00:03:35.940> school

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
with and they enjoyed being at school

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.100 
with and they enjoyed being at school
and<00:03:38.630> then<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.350> uniform<00:03:39.980> yes<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.610> uniform<00:03:41.270> was

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
and then the uniform yes the uniform was

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.330 
and then the uniform yes the uniform was
not<00:03:42.380> our<00:03:42.650> choice<00:03:43.420> we<00:03:44.420> went<00:03:44.600> through<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> choice

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
not our choice we went through a choice

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.590 
not our choice we went through a choice
mechanism<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.640> principal<00:03:47.150> at<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.360> time

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
mechanism but the principal at the time

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.110 
mechanism but the principal at the time
was<00:03:47.840> very<00:03:47.900> very<00:03:48.590> sure<00:03:48.950> she<00:03:49.310> wanted<00:03:49.670> not<00:03:49.880> just

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
well because the the teachers and the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.190 
well because the the teachers and the
students<00:05:42.950> were<00:05:43.070> very<00:05:43.280> aware<00:05:43.400> of<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.690> you

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
students were very aware of that you

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:53.129 
students were very aware of that you
know<00:05:45.320> high<00:05:45.530> level<00:05:45.860> of<00:05:45.979> parental<00:05:46.430> involvement

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.309 

and<00:05:53.819> the<00:05:54.819> the<00:05:55.060> other<00:05:55.210> thing<00:05:55.449> I<00:05:55.569> remember<00:05:56.080> that

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 
and the the other thing I remember that

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.709 
and the the other thing I remember that
most<00:05:56.889> vividly<00:05:57.370> I<00:05:57.520> think<00:05:57.909> was<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.180> fact<00:05:58.539> that

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
most vividly I think was the fact that

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.350 
most vividly I think was the fact that
the<00:05:58.960> students<00:05:59.469> decided<00:05:59.949> that<00:06:00.819> because<00:06:00.969> it<00:06:01.270> was

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
the students decided that because it was

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.269 
the students decided that because it was
such<00:06:01.659> an<00:06:01.900> old<00:06:02.080> building<00:06:02.379> there<00:06:02.889> must<00:06:03.099> be

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:03.279 
such an old building there must be

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.809 
such an old building there must be

of<00:07:05.020> them<00:07:05.169> were<00:07:05.289> even<00:07:05.349> born<00:07:05.860> then<00:07:06.180> so<00:07:07.180> that

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:07.659 
of them were even born then so that

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:09.990 
of them were even born then so that
makes<00:07:07.930> you<00:07:08.080> realize<00:07:08.620> how<00:07:08.649> much<00:07:09.279> time<00:07:09.699> has<00:07:09.939> gone

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
makes you realize how much time has gone

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.350 
makes you realize how much time has gone
past<00:07:10.449> since<00:07:10.930> then<00:07:11.560> makes<00:07:12.279> me<00:07:12.460> feel<00:07:12.699> very<00:07:12.729> old

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 
past since then makes me feel very old

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.679 
past since then makes me feel very old
such<00:07:14.399> and<00:07:15.399> again<00:07:15.639> I<00:07:15.669> think<00:07:15.789> at<00:07:16.060> that<00:07:16.089> time<00:07:16.270> we

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:16.689 
such and again I think at that time we

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.230 
such and again I think at that time we
were<00:07:16.779> looking<00:07:17.110> to<00:07:17.279> try<00:07:18.279> and<00:07:18.460> create<00:07:19.120> a

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 
were looking to try and create a

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.689 
were looking to try and create a
reputation<00:07:19.689> because<00:07:20.289> the<00:07:20.740> new<00:07:21.370> school

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:21.699 
reputation because the new school

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.510 
reputation because the new school
parents<00:07:22.180> weren't<00:07:22.389> sure<00:07:22.750> so<00:07:23.050> much<00:07:23.919> about<00:07:24.250> what

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
parents weren't sure so much about what

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.420 
parents weren't sure so much about what
we<00:07:24.879> could<00:07:25.089> offer<00:07:25.149> and<00:07:26.039> so<00:07:27.039> everyone<00:07:27.310> was

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
we could offer and so everyone was

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.279 
we could offer and so everyone was
really<00:07:27.610> ambitious<00:07:28.029> and<00:07:28.509> that<00:07:28.719> first<00:07:29.020> cohort

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:29.289 
really ambitious and that first cohort

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.920 
really ambitious and that first cohort
did<00:07:29.740> incredibly<00:07:30.219> well<00:07:30.310> and<00:07:30.699> right<00:07:31.659> from<00:07:31.839> the

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
did incredibly well and right from the

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.920 
did incredibly well and right from the
start<00:07:31.990> I<00:07:32.439> think<00:07:32.649> the<00:07:33.000> principles<00:07:34.000> that<00:07:34.120> have

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
start I think the principles that have

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.140 
start I think the principles that have
stayed<00:07:35.229> with<00:07:35.259> them<00:07:35.560> westland<00:07:36.159> school

stayed with them westland school

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.940 
stayed with them westland school

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950 
and they were there from the very

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:45.470 
and they were there from the very
beginning
