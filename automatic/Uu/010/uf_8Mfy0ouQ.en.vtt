00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:12.630
 I believe I'm here with the samsung 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:16.710
 2015 event and I have here in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.189
 hand the new samsung galaxy s 6 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.090
 that is characterized by the fact that it 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 Two pages bent is what I am right now 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.859
 read at gsm marina is that that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.009
 display is not bent in themselves 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.550
 but only the glass above and through it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.250
 then stop the effect that arises 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.559
 display is bent 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 otherwise this device records 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 Of course, then everything from what that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.920
 samsung galaxy s 6 aboard has it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.379
 an extremely high-resolution quad hd 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.670
 amoled display very bright very nice 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.539
 colors very high contrast and 577 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.489
 baby I totally overkill where the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.580
 pixel detection is concerned 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.590
 samsung has a user interface 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.770
 Fortunately slimmed down and that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.600
 Touch up very detoxifies it sets 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.890
 now more on claims than on 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.340
 symbols in which one does not necessarily know 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.009
 what they should mean and overall 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.900
 blends in the entire color scheme and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.869
 Everything was very nice in the material 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.920
 design by android lollipop 1 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.450
 the front camera is 5 megapixels with 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 blender 19 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.920
 the rear camera 16 megapixels with aperture 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.090
 19 and optical image stabilization and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.720
 so there is also there 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.240
 Actually be in there 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.130
 can 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.729
 the same with the processor and the frame 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.490
 samsung does not splash and has 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:02.890
 a 64 bit with the latest structure in it 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.439
 and 3 gb ram 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:11.069
 So overall, that's the promise you make 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.200
 no leaks everything looks very smooth running 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.389
 Today I also twitter heretical 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.260
 As long as it is android, it will 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.060
 probably longer and longer 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.519
 but so far that actually looks 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:29.750
 wonderful from everything extremely liquid the 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:31.560
 The Galaxy 6 Edge offers access 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.560
 right now I have these 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.950
 unlocked access to your favorite her 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.840
 your favorite five contacts yes 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.359
 also set in different 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.939
 colors then shine on the side if 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:49.230
 the device lies on the table in front of you 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:53.579
 and you can put on with a finger 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.199
 then you see the contact from both of you 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.560
 you then again with the 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.560
 settings 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.989
 I'll show you the same at the same time 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.250
 gc x6 one so far and here we have 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.780
 now the galaxy s 6 without edge that 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.090
 stands out at the edges then 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.390
 Of course not by the by the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.230
 rounded screen off but 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.360
 rather by a design that strongly 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.110
 apparently another competitor 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.670
 I happen to remember that 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.780
 also in the bag and you see 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.959
 stop is relatively similar but 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.959
 not equal offers still sufficient 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.319
 potential that you get it as a samsung 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:48.220
 can recognize that is mine too 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.690
 main criticism at galaxy s 6 that is 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.420
 very much 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.950
 similar to its predecessors looks since then 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.490
 It has four here in principle nothing 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.220
 done 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.530
 the back is just like now 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.800
 When sex ethos let you see me 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.250
 probably already there then reflect 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.580
 can be charged wirelessly why 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.590
 now also new is installed 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.140
 Overall, a round overall package 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.549
 where I actually tend to 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.579
 also newer 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.560
 Article design of the sextet tend 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.449
 would 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.020
 thanks for watching and see you 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.020
 the next days
