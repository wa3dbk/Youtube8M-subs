00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
was from target and then another one I

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.400 
was from target and then another one I
don't<00:05:01.060> even<00:05:01.240> remember<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.720> brand<00:05:01.930> but<00:05:02.200> it<00:05:02.320> was

like<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> metallic<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:05.110> one<00:05:05.350> didn't<00:05:05.710> last

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
like a metallic and that one didn't last

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.820 
like a metallic and that one didn't last
long<00:05:06.340> at<00:05:06.610> all<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.600> began<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:07.930> chip<00:05:08.410> but<00:05:08.680> then
