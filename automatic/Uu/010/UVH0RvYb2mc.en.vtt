00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.629
 Good day to all subscribers 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.900
 channel studio analytics with you ns and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.469
 today i would like to talk to you on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 also conduct in-depth analytics and volumes 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.230
 oktarin feed the matter is that the act and the battleship 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.050
 initially turned out to be almost myself 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.230
 embol this to you from all added 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.630
 but so far in the professional scene, he 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.119
 not at all, partly due to the fact that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.210
 games end quickly but they quickly 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.760
 end so far that day is not far 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.940
 when they start and not stretch when 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.520
 all the teams a little better Feel no 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.469
 especially when such serious things begin 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.610
 Internet type tournaments but there are few 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.320
 who prefers to risk as a rule 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 there people go to Leith take all sorts 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.230
 antimagovy farms farmed and so here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.579
 oktarin core first of all we 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.030
 look at what he gives 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 decrease in recharge 25 percent and 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.629
 the first thing that strikes us and mind 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.700
 this is zeus hunter 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.549
 enigma-like hero with long 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.810
 cooldown you weight ulta E which 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.479
 we can get up and get less 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.780
 recharge on sale 25 percent is 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.030
 very cool and actually everything is ok 3corda 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.759
 the scene here is just like there 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.979
 plus many immediately thought that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 Leshrac will be good chunking factoring 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.700
 a guy because in empiricism from cuts 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.009
 gives too 25 percent is obtained 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.619
 a fact can run away with their ultimate 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.060
 in the crowd cool region ca but so far this 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.310
 also we have not seen yet 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.799
 I would like to draw attention to the fact that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.920
 oktarin core is actually enough 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.670
 tricky artifact and still not clearly understood 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 his strength i am in that act battleship 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.689
 recharging not only more accurately reduces 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.630
 the application is not only 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.780
 skills but also items and here's the first 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.360
 immediately what can we do 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.380
 attention is bkb where is the answer i 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 specially made bkb 5 seconds to 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.770
 It was clearer because the doctor encore 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.160
 anyway those are bought there 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.110
 lateral usually 5 seconds 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.860
 so here is no octarin box bkb 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.890
 recharge 55 seconds with octarin feed 41 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.740
 that is actually in the heat of long 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.150
 tracks some cream can tie 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.180
 bkb twice 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.160
 further for some cary that's mine for 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.680
 example girokopter here another kid 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.080
 worth on it a bit later some carrick 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.060
 trine core just gives an unreal boost and 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.420
 Well, for example, many have seen a gyrocopter in 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.740
 past copper and which bought skadi 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.010
 I will honestly say for the shooting copter there 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.980
 average, frankly, but we have nothing 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.330
 gives there let's say from the bottle he notices 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.130
 it starts on the fact gives 25 agility 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.360
 t25 only attack speed 25 demage 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.650
 and 700 hp 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.350
 Well, for example, if we compare the slope then 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.270
 at 2600 efficiency factoring we will have two 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.960
 thousand three hundred i.e. three weave hp 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.140
 gives less and does not give us demage 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.630
 25 and 25 attack speed however gives 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.800
 other bonuses for example 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.320
 notice the following here 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.240
 suppose so here with one 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.990
 Ultimate Gyrocopters treats themselves 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.520
 approximately 800 hit points if 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.380
 got under five but gyrocopter 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.920
 Often gets on Peter them on 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.320
 really be a huge washes 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.660
 radius as well as with rocket barrage and we 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.970
 we saw about a hundred and one hundred and fifty 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.550
 hit points with exactly one hundred racket plus 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.170
 reloading our bkb 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.570
 this way without any floor 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.170
 Satanica in a fight using rocket 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.680
 barrage and 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.630
 and how all down on five we otkhilit and 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.130
 can potentially somewhere kosyrev at 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.930
 this we do not even need to beat quite often 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.910
 It happens that a gyrocopter can focus in 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.220
 do not miss out from tans and he even sata 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.900
 nobody there can do enough 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.180
 the number of strokes that settle here 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.360
 you run call down you press rocket 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.270
 barrage and you have already increased your 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.130
 the number of hit points of a whale by 1000 is also 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.850
 interesting interesting moment is that 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.720
 oktarin core works with radian itself 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.600
 Let's see 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.160
 that is, if we live five heroes 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.450
 again in the heat of a fight from normal 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.350
 the situation where we live five heroes 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.000
 also 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.650
 and churches from creeps it works well there 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.050
 only 5 percent well in general we 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.050
 Regen somewhere under a half -a- half ear n in 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.970
 a second to 50 tens of a second at the very 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.500
 business nifiga not a day if such at 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.890
 the pillar runs through the debt scrimmage 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.380
 how much he could potentially from 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.750
 riga not much more concreteness 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.580
 bek shone so lay for Radiance 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.650
 visibility specifically spies column 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.510
 still works such a thing i am that who 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.090
 encore works completely savage and pair 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.410
 and, moreover, with thorns that touch the ombra 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.360
 column or which flies him from 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.550
 backs and in and it turns out that run 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.040
 such a throne so on brawl throws spikes 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.510
 they drink it beats beat but you can turn 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.770
 attention to the club sent so there is not 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.690
 some kind of super from openwork in general 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.490
 nothing but oktarin bark no sleep and 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.180
 the truth is also not the strongest but 150 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.669
 damage they have 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.919
 but apparently they can't just pierce 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.690
 This and the column to not always be so much 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.620
 beat 5 back is not always he on all 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.450
 spiked 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.310
 it's all clear but no less 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.430
 It turns out that the column with active feed 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.100
 running around the fight a lot of myself 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.010
 potential pc belches with 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.020
 thorns besides cooldown on spikes becomes 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:38.630
 also 2.25 seconds instead of three again 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.390
 more often you can cast this whole thing 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.300
 concerns and kaldauny cooldowns oktarin 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.450
 cooldown food 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.960
 has 33 seconds to cool the object 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.919
 battleship 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.830
 45 is eight seconds it seems not so 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.530
 and many but not so little again 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.810
 much more often you can throw caldauns and 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.520
 rocket barrage too 4 and 1 second 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.650
 considering that it works 3 seconds 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.000
 actually crocop cycle dunbar your 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.550
 exact saying rocket barrage can 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.650
 do not turn off at all given that 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.620
 calico just gives a bunch of mana 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.190
 plus mana regeneration of problems with mom 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.860
 I don't have a gyrocopter either , but 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.540
 there is also testil thinking with amanim nails 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.030
 a battleship he can even run after one 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.520
 a hero endlessly to hang on it doom 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.100
 and it is constantly tummy from him 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.380
 treated for their land well and still great 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.910
 number of heroes 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.129
 is treated with ocarin bark very 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.589
 tough and to some extent 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.779
 in my opinion oktarin carp just have to 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.199
 replace vlad new builds for some 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.139
 heroes 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:46.779
 such a thing as of skadi and maybe 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.779
 even satanic thanks for watching
