00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
hardwired compressor which is that one

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.310 
hardwired compressor which is that one
see<00:04:04.220> how<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.430> not<00:04:04.550> turning<00:04:04.930> we<00:04:05.930> take<00:04:06.170> this

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
see how it's not turning we take this

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.810 
see how it's not turning we take this
wire<00:04:06.620> here<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:08.890> apply<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:09.950> positive<00:04:10.520> straight

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
wire here and apply it positive straight

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.180 
wire here and apply it positive straight
to<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.090> which<00:04:11.209> is<00:04:11.240> that<00:04:11.510> terminal<00:04:11.900> there<00:04:12.190> like

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
to it which is that terminal there like

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.599 
to it which is that terminal there like
so<00:04:17.230> I'm<00:04:18.230> having<00:04:18.470> great<00:04:18.500> difficulty<00:04:19.130> operating

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
so I'm having great difficulty operating

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.879 
so I'm having great difficulty operating
a<00:04:19.700> camera<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.810> at<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:20.989> same<00:04:21.169> time<00:04:21.440> so

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.559 

you<00:04:27.639> just<00:04:27.789> want<00:04:27.909> to<00:04:27.939> hold<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.180> like<00:04:28.419> that

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
you just want to hold that like that

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:41.120 
you just want to hold that like that
let's<00:04:28.840> go<00:04:28.930> see<00:04:29.050> if<00:04:29.139> she's<00:04:29.259> cold

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.630 

it's<00:04:41.640> kind<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:41.970> getting<00:04:42.120> cool<00:04:42.510> but<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.050> I

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
it's kind of getting cool but it's a I

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.710 
it's kind of getting cool but it's a I
don't<00:04:44.640> know<00:04:44.730> from<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.910> reasons<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.420> cutting

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
don't know from the reasons of cutting

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.750 
don't know from the reasons of cutting
it<00:04:45.840> as<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.110> pressure<00:04:46.560> switch<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.130> being<00:04:47.640> able

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
it as the pressure switch is being able

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.890 
it as the pressure switch is being able
to<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:47.970> turned<00:04:48.150> on<00:04:48.330> by<00:04:48.690> gas<00:04:48.870> in<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.080> system<00:04:49.410> so

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
to be turned on by gas in the system so

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.920 
to be turned on by gas in the system so
it's<00:04:51.900> cool<00:04:52.140> but<00:04:52.410> it's<00:04:52.470> not<00:04:52.620> cold<00:04:53.600> she's<00:04:54.600> low<00:04:54.780> on

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
it's cool but it's not cold she's low on

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.090 
it's cool but it's not cold she's low on
