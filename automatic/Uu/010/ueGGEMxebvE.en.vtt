00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.989

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.419
 Spanish will not be able to vote 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.060
 this time to introduce you the interface of ti and max 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.300
 the version they have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.280
 yes they have the 2007 version 3 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.880
 2008 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.570
 oo other versions that is a lover and more 6 7 8 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.820
 They are equal 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.300
 today even that they have 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.220
 avanti more advanced than mine 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.680
 our motto ponte gives the version of a 48 and is the same version 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 lesions the pigs maid 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 this time I have the 2009 version 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.810
 if they have it better yet if they do not have it, there is no problem because 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.440
 the same 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.360
 in the boxes 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.240
 Just to start 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.730
 let's explain 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.730
 basic tools 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.710
 any model 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.710
 basic commented 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.730
 I believe that it is inside 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 if we play to create something 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.230
 either to create effective training 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.130
 -be they are lines 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
 figures but only with 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 nyse cvx to be lights 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.090
 this time we can start using these three standing 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.590
 if I'm here it's to make beds 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.539
 we usually use 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.709
 three are the legislations 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 and well I'm taking more advanced positions 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.879
 in the formal thing that will be a shakespeare 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.879
 basic forms 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 sergio reforma 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.679
 for this we always create a way 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.539
 in the paramount tab 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.539
 jacques this decision 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.169
 and we have it that has selected 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.169
 select the base texts with this one 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.239
 indicated that we have it 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.459
 photos see here its features 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.669
 night within a radius of 20 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.139
 It has four segments 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.069
 they are shortened by the key 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.069
 f4 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.219
 rest format 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.939
 lemus that has 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.939
 the lines that I saw it well are the ones that are going nothing claimed 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.719
 are the elements 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.719
 including at least 20 others 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.439
 in what we were piÃ±era assured 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.439
 again t4 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.689
 efe four but 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.099
 to remove them to protect them 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 then we see that it has more definition 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.119
 good remains and pecam sa v tournament that played 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.069
 now that I felt like law classes to move the chair 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.999
 conaprole the mouse 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.389
 with the oppressed 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.829
 if we want to rotate samos 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.829
 this tool here 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.210
 today it does not do not want it with pines until here 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.759
 let's plan the alt key with the mouse wheel 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.159
 what is most comfortable 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.189
 If we want to make a 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.650
 we have these tools 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.159
 ceo of the Basque hsf 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.340
 if we want to move all 2 the views 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340
 with this text 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.249
 if we are going to be mom of the figure 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.249
 we can this fireman to eat with this one and with 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.440
 for example we can have many models and I want to move a few 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.909
 already with this one 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.639
 remove the positions that had sex 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.639
 they are all dying 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.430
 we can not play again with I'm comfortable here 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.620
 if you throw each one has a little window 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.860
 of many prospects 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.139
 do not know him 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.180
 I'm here 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.180
 is to be consumed depth 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.860
 as to be prospects 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.860
 and this perspective bulls 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.339
 for example if we have a very narrow space 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.129
 that does not help to make all that space 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.110
 because if we do it with this matter 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.839
 only the teros 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.839
 in exchange this one 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.389
 but I do not recommend them much to do 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.389
 It can be 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.919
 these views 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.740
 we select again 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.219
 and if we want to move it 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.839
 if it is
