Steve: Hi, it's Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.170
Today we're going to show you how to change
the siphon break elbow kit on your washer.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.170
It's a really easy job.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.519
All we are going to need is a 5/16th and 1/4
inch nut driver.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.200
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.540
Now the first step in this repair will be
to disconnect the fill hoses, unplug the washer

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.520
and pull it out of its opening so that you
can get to the very back of it.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.340
Next, we will remove the drain hose, if it
still has the factory clamp on it, it's a

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:40.579
matter loosing that 5/16th screw and giving
it a little sharp bump to loosen the clamp,

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.510
and then twist the drain hose off of the elbow.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.960
That's probably still full of water so carefully
set that aside.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.719
Next, we're going to remove the access cover
on the back, the single 1/4 inch hex head

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.920
screw, and lift that out of the way.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:20.409
And now we will remove the four, 5/16th screws
that hold that drain connector to the cabinet,

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:30.359
and once you removed all of the screws, you
can reach in and you will find that, drain

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:38.390
hose that comes from the pump up to the connector
now pull out away, push the drain hose down

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:48.610
and out, then you can slide the elbow through
the opening and remove that as well.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.330
Now to install the new elbow, reach inside
of the cabinet, push it out through the opening.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:05.100
Well, make sure that that gasket on the siphon
break is nice and clean; again we will push

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.380
that hose back into the cabinet.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.819
Make sure we don't get it tangled up in the
air dome tube, and bring it up until it engages

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.349
the elbow.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:26.190
You can rotate that until you get one screw
started in it.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:37.170
We won't tighten that first screw until we
get at least one more in place and replace

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.220
the remaining two.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:49.319
Now before we tighten them all secure make
sure that the elbow will still turn, and doesn't

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:58.890
bind up on either the cabinet or the siphon
break.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:09.590
Next, we're ready to reinstall the drain hose,
and caution should be taken when putting this

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.390
drain hose on because it is such a stiff hose
that you don't pull it outward on the elbow

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.010
or you may break and that as a joint.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:34.049
Now slide it up into position, retighten the
clamp.

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.210
Now we're ready to reinstall the access cover.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:47.730
I am going to take the square tab, position
that on the bottom inside of the cabinet and

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:59.680
align it up at the screw hole.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.780
Now we're ready to reposition the washer in
place, reconnect the fill hoses, and the drain

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.209
and our power, and our repair is complete.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.150
We told you it was an easy job.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.319
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
