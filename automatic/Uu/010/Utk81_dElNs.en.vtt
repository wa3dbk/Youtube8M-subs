already<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:02.070> what<00:00:02.550> you<00:00:02.730> see<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.600> base

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
already so what you see here is the base

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.430 
already so what you see here is the base
of<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.819> glycans<00:00:05.819> docking<00:00:06.270> station<00:00:06.839> as<00:00:07.020> you

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
of the glycans docking station as you

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.669 
of the glycans docking station as you
see<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.400> only<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:09.000> piece<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.599> wood<00:00:09.929> three

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
see here it's only a piece of wood three

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.850 
see here it's only a piece of wood three
quarter<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.099> an<00:00:11.250> inch<00:00:11.340> piece<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.910> wood<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.269> only

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
quarter of an inch piece of wood I only

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.279 
quarter of an inch piece of wood I only
prime<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.190> paint<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:15.120> black<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
prime it and paint it black the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
prime it and paint it black the
measurements<00:00:16.920> are<00:00:17.090> 24<00:00:18.090> x<00:00:18.600> 18<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:20.189> guess<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.420> I

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
measurements are 24 x 18 I guess so I

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.660 
measurements are 24 x 18 I guess so I
mean<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.199> doesn't<00:00:22.529> matter<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> size<00:00:23.279> as

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
mean it doesn't matter what the size as

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
mean it doesn't matter what the size as
long<00:00:23.880> as<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.119> feel<00:00:24.330> comfortable<00:00:24.680> you<00:00:25.680> know<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
long as you feel comfortable you know I

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
long as you feel comfortable you know I
did<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.109> thought<00:00:28.320> was

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
did it like this because I thought was

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.799 
did it like this because I thought was
the<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:31.019> size<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:33.480> docking

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the the right size so the docking

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.889 
the the right size so the docking
station<00:00:33.899> was<00:00:34.410> able<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.210> hold<00:00:36.210> either<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
station was able to hold either the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.790 
station was able to hold either the
canon<00:00:37.530> t2i<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.309> kind<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.610> XH<00:00:39.059> a1<00:00:39.350> okay<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
canon t2i or the kind of XH a1 okay so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.420 
canon t2i or the kind of XH a1 okay so
what<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> middle<00:00:42.469> is<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.890> black

steel floor flange I only put it in the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.569 
steel floor flange I only put it in the
center<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.629> mark<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.680> four<00:00:49.920> holes<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
center and mark the four holes that you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.529 
center and mark the four holes that you
see<00:00:50.789> where<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> screws<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.440> i<00:00:52.920> also<00:00:53.539> use

the<00:00:54.870> wing<00:00:55.140> nuts<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.590> attach<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.309> i<00:00:56.489> use<00:00:57.120> wing

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the wing nuts to attach it i use wing

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.639 
the wing nuts to attach it i use wing
nuts<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:59.329> guess<00:01:00.329> witness<00:01:01.020> are<00:01:01.289> better

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
nuts because I guess witness are better

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.579 
nuts because I guess witness are better
to<00:01:02.430> work<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.199> regular

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to work with then you know the regular

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.270 
to work with then you know the regular
nuts<00:01:04.850> especially<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.450> you're<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.280> break

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
nuts especially if you're going to break

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.500 
nuts especially if you're going to break
it<00:01:08.460> apart<00:01:08.580> okay<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.930> let's<00:01:10.710> move<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it apart okay so let's move on what you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:24.910 
it apart okay so let's move on what you
see<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.939> 36-inch<00:01:17.810> half-inch<00:01:22.310> y-pipe

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
see is a 36-inch half-inch y-pipe

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
see is a 36-inch half-inch y-pipe
threaded<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> both<00:01:26.280> sides<00:01:26.580> let's<00:01:27.540> stop<00:01:27.930> here

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
threaded in both sides let's stop here

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.039 
threaded in both sides let's stop here
on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> middle<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
on the middle and what you see in the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.530 
on the middle and what you see in the
middle<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> half<00:01:31.860> inch<00:01:32.130> copper<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
middle is a half inch copper and the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
middle is a half inch copper and the
reason<00:01:33.840> why<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> use<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> half<00:01:35.100> inch<00:01:35.340> copper<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
reason why I use of half inch copper is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.480 
reason why I use of half inch copper is
because<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:37.140> me<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:38.509> 55.6<00:01:39.509> tall<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.340> you

it pretty good the other thing the other
thing<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.910> had<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.060> go<00:03:02.269> with<00:03:02.300> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
thing that I just had to go with the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.160 
thing that I just had to go with the
eight<00:03:02.690> inches<00:03:03.110> because<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.430> notice<00:03:04.900> I'm<00:03:05.900> able

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
eight inches because you notice I'm able

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.620 
eight inches because you notice I'm able
to<00:03:06.350> move<00:03:06.819> freely<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.870> glycan<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:10.630> basically

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
to move freely the glycan and basically

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.449 
to move freely the glycan and basically
check<00:03:12.250> if<00:03:13.250> it's<00:03:13.519> level<00:03:14.000> in<00:03:14.330> all<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.750> positions

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
check if it's level in all the positions

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.870 
check if it's level in all the positions
okay<00:03:17.049> so<00:03:18.049> let's<00:03:18.500> move<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:18.980> other<00:03:19.100> side<00:03:19.400> and

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
okay so let's move to the other side and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.080 
okay so let's move to the other side and
I<00:03:20.360> will<00:03:20.630> show<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:22.280> other<00:03:22.400> side<00:03:22.579> what

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
I will show you on the other side what

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.090 
I will show you on the other side what
we<00:03:23.120> have<00:03:23.510> here<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:25.180> 4-inch<00:03:28.000> pipe<00:03:29.890> attach<00:03:30.890> it

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
we have here is a 4-inch pipe attach it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.850 
we have here is a 4-inch pipe attach it
to<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.280> 49<00:03:32.030> degrees<00:03:32.450> forty-five<00:03:32.959> degrees<00:03:33.410> elbow

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
to a 49 degrees forty-five degrees elbow

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.199 
to a 49 degrees forty-five degrees elbow
and<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.720> six<00:03:36.650> inches<00:03:36.920> pipe<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:38.180> a

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
and then we have six inches pipe with a

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.470 
and then we have six inches pipe with a
cap<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:39.730> did<00:03:40.730> these<00:03:41.140> two<00:03:42.140> things<00:03:42.440> for<00:03:43.299> for<00:03:44.299> two

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
cap I did these two things for for two

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.550 
cap I did these two things for for two
reasons<00:03:44.690> one<00:03:46.329> use<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.540> as<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> counterbalance

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
reasons one use it as a counterbalance

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.699 
reasons one use it as a counterbalance
something<00:03:48.950> like<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:49.880> two<00:03:50.660> because<00:03:51.560> you

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
something like that and two because you

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.650 
something like that and two because you
can<00:03:51.890> hang<00:03:52.100> something<00:03:52.549> else<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:53.000> mean<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.420> both

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
can hang something else I mean you both

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.560 
can hang something else I mean you both
the<00:03:53.840> best<00:03:53.870> or<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.829> are<00:03:55.269> building<00:03:56.269> your<00:03:56.329> own
