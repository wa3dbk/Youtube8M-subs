00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.170
 ae 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.250
 now 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.160
 everyone's motivation is not coming back 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.570
 Not today 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.480
 by the game it's not possible it was not 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.030
 had an excellent debut in 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.500
 of what the idea is to avoid people 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.490
 today to know cool 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 Now we have the desire to 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.550
 victory and not simply doing what it is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.010
 good to us individually sometimes 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.750
 I wish the victory there is in the action that the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.030
 We have people for the team. 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.040
 for the public to what we are 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.380
 doing on the pitch not for our 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.650
 benefit not for it to perform with 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.930
 a good defense or a big mistake and yes 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.540
 because the group is needed in that 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.610
 moment the donation with the team because the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.490
 The great accomplishment must 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.640
 be the ultimate victory and not the comfort of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.040
 a great game of being is to do what 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.320
 the goal of the game you did not go with the victory 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.300
 so the great gift of all is not 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.670
 for itself, but when the team 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.830
 wins so if you understand inside 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.250
 game are at ease they have already begun to 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.630
 Speak, say, change June on a lap. 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.680
 of the field so that the final result is 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.680
 the ideal is good 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:20.570
 elza access at 9 o'clock 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 ae 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.450
 great good 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:35.660
 your night and is is a different function but 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:53.180
 I like adapting and I think it's possible 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:58.510
 play it gives you so good bid speak 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.510
 half half half half of them earned 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.390
