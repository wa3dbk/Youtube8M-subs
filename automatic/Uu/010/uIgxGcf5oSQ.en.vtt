00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.610
 ricard la raid visual artist argentina 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.530
 and I come to be part of the campaign or with 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.029
 the petal of a rose from the day of his 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.029
 management in the year 2008 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.189
 with the petal of a rose is a campaign 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:31.029
 against gender violence that your 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.370
 objective is to sensitize inform and 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.640
 educate through art with the petal 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.480
 of a rose was born in 2008 from a 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.489
 meeting of women that we were very 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.239
 concerned about the issue of violence 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.850
 gender in Colombia and from this arises a 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.489
 campaign that had three moments up 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.190
 now that my body months were in 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.960
 which involved dolls 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.469
 white 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.790
 very subtle and they were had the 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.190
 artists and these artists that 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.619
 they violated all kinds of violence 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.140
 They caught the cut good show 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.330
 it was very important the second moment of 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.940
 the campaign was called for your punishment and for 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.960
 hardest time of the campaign because 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.090
 they were photographs 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.460
 the artists working with the image 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.110
 direct from women who had suffered 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.800
 violence also by time of the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 campaign in which we work the car the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.399
 self-violence that the woman is infringed 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.850
 at this time with the whole issue of 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.009
 operations and good the beauty that you 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.380
 imposed by society the third 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.899
 moment is called enough the word what 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.649
 we inaugurate in parallel the there is festival 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.539
 in Cartagena and it was a moment in which 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.800
 the language that the artists used 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.610
 was to work on him about the book 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.280
 artist and over the word the word already 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 as a brake against violence and 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.640
 also the word like violence to me 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.619
 and now let's go into the room 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.700
 moment of the campaign that is going to be called 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.700
 healthy who heals 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.479
 knows that healthy is this fourth moment that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.880
 it will be a process because healing 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.030
 it deserves a time of dedication 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.489
 will take all year and will go from March 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.590
 until November the first moment of 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.630
 sanaa that heals that is a healthy action 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.209
 let's make the artists that 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.030
 intervene in this at this moment of 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.090
 the campaign will heal their wounds more 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.310
 deep its more superficial and 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.160
 also viewers can feel 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.350
 the same the healthy that heals will have a 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.970
 unified color throughout the year that 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.970
 will be the target and this campaign will be 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.959
 also in its sound and in its image a 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.959
 healing mantra 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.100
 of healing is a three-dimensional object 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.650
 which can be a container a box one 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.080
 belly something that the artists where 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.790
 they want to put those objects of 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.960
 the daily life that accompany us that 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.510
 they do us good that make us feel 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.850
 better and that will make the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.770
 viewer when they see them and with all 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.200
 these kit that they send I hope they are 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.660
 very many we are going to build one of both 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.100
 will be a space generated within 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.860
 house assemble where all the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.900
 entering spectators are going to find 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.440
 boticas windows where these 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.450
 objects will be exposed and I think that 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.820
 will vibrate in such a way that everyone 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.500
 enter may heal those wounds 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.500
 visible invisible ones that carry with 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.480
 after serving with the inscription 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.950
 artists and everyone who participates 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.549

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.219

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.139
