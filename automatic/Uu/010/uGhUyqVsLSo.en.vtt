00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.090
 learn how to make this recipe 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.670
 the only ingredients in the recipe are 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 roasted peanuts and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.340
 without the shell 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.080
 you put only the hymn man 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.480
 blender and press the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.410
 search for that orange philosopher and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.510
 peanut 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.270

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.489
 peanut butter in a pan and mix until 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.440
 give the point it is important that you do not 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.440
 stop messing with the candy so it does not burn 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.720
 and when it has already thickened you 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.000
 put a little fire on him so he can stay 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.650
 point serginho the right point to roll 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.879
 that's when he was already breaking up 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.530
 completely from the bottom of the pan 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.270
 After you take the fire off you leave 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.119

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.160

 make the cashew format myself 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.020
 I wrap it up and make a snippet, and then I 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.490
 I find the top part boring and left 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.490
 lower rounded bottom 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.890
 put a little piece of peanut on top 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.250
 him and he stays like this is a cut and 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.290
 It's a delight, too . 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.330
