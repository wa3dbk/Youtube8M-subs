00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.459
 Come on I'm in the company of Eric Stan 5 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 chief engineer of chevrolet and 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:18.599
 today we will test the new 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.099
 chevrolet silverado 2500hd and I think 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.230
 that to test these trucks there must be 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.730
 do it in real life I think 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.650
 that it gives a chance to the future 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.070
 buyers to see as a truck can 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.779
 help them on a daily basis 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.890
 I totally agree you know we 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.329
 spend a lot of time developing a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.070
 truck there are no causes for 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.789
 perform in a real situation where the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.530
 People need 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.180
 then you have to go back to the board 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.829
 drawing ok what are we doing 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.359
 today one of the reasons that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.070
 explain the reliability of the silverado 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.859
 is that we built his box with 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.079
 rolled steel rolled steel versys what 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.399
 it is preferred to use rolled steel to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.379
 the crates of our light trucks and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.329
 hd trucks rather than aluminum or 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 of steel prints and unlike 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.050
 the prints industry and the process of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.579
 rolling allows us to use a steel 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 lighter and stiffer 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.179
 it contributes to sustainability and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.010
 rigidity of the body which allows us 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.140
 to improve the efficiency of the vehicle 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.710
 so today we will measure ourselves against 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.740
 ford f-250 2015 our so-called 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270
 competitor we will measure rigidity in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.620
 twist and we'll see how the crate 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 reacted when she is subjected to a 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.490
 torsion of the chassis torsion of the chassis 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.080
 it hurts just to think about it looks 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.730
 what does that mean complicated twist 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.380
 chassis attention of the chassis or the 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.030
 Torsional stiffness is a measure that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 indicates how the crate reacted on 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.670
 deformed roadways 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.110
 yeah as we saw today there are 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.090
 a lot of ground and butts in the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.680
 but it does not look like this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.670
 convoy will be construction sites 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.740
 exactly 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.590
 so ready to start let's go with 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.869
 the frog good a little competition 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.270
 that's where it gets interesting but 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.920
 a lot of separation at the gem not the sense 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 it's like me in the morning look like 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.899
 so tense it's about 95 points 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 push now try to open the 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.530
 cool tailgate stuck it's not surprising 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.759
 the cash is so tense even though 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.189
 is a truck load 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.259
 I'm confused are trucks that say 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.520
 to be able to do the job but 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.679
 if you can not even open the cashier 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.910
 how do you do the job well said 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.910
 now we try the silverado 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 you can see there is very little tension 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.750
 right here 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.180
 different is homeland 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.220
 see how much it gives a little bit 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.600
 more than a quarter of an inch and that's the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.040
 easy tailgate frankly if you find 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.540
 on a construction site with your 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640
 truck you will ride on land 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.930
 like that it is surprising that it is 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.880
 not something any 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.440
 truck can do we hired a 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.720
 independent company called and 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.400
 m6 has testing they realized the same 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.220
 test series that we did today they 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.660
 have certified similar results 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.130
 for me it's not complicated 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.450
 absolutely unable to open the crate 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.060
 of his truck will be construction site 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.080
 construction in algarve that one 30 and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.080
 dreams appeared annoyed
