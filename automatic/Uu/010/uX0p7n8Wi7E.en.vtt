00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.260

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.670
 and also to have a lot of chase bag 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.290
 and in this way we do not have to worry about getting them in the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.120
 game 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.080
 you just have to win all the sins from the list of the lists for 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.519
 unlock the bushes and the cars 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.390
