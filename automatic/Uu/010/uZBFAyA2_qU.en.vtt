is<00:06:06.509> all<00:06:06.719> and<00:06:07.520> maybe<00:06:08.520> we<00:06:08.669> should<00:06:08.819> let<00:06:08.909> the<00:06:09.030> games

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
is all and maybe we should let the games

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.270 
is all and maybe we should let the games
begin<00:06:09.740> so<00:06:10.740> we're<00:06:10.860> going<00:06:10.949> to<00:06:11.039> go<00:06:11.099> through<00:06:11.130> a
