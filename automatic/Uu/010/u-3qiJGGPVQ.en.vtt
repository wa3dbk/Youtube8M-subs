00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380

on YouTube doing animation animation is

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.340 
on YouTube doing animation animation is
really<00:00:42.450> hard<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.629> produce<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.110> takes<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
really hard to produce and it takes a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.590 
really hard to produce and it takes a
long<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.520> important<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.390> an

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
long time so it's really important as an

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
long time so it's really important as an
animator<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.010> call<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.190> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
animator to have a what we call a be

animator to have a what we call a be
content<00:00:47.879> strategy<00:00:48.300> which<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.309> essentially

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
content strategy which is essentially

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
content strategy which is essentially
content<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.420> doesn't<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> nearly<00:00:52.260> as

content that doesn't take you nearly as
long<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.160> much<00:00:53.309> effort<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.730> produce<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.239> a
