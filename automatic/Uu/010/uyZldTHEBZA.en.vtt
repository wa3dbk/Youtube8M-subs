00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
something this small I feel like it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.330 
something this small I feel like it
really<00:01:47.729> allows<00:01:48.659> window<00:01:48.960> its<00:01:49.110> 8.1<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.860> shine<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
really allows window its 8.1 to shine a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
really allows window its 8.1 to shine a
quick<00:01:50.909> word<00:01:51.090> about<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.479> internals

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
quick word about the internals

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.760 
quick word about the internals
so<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> CPU<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.850> an<00:01:54.000> AMD<00:01:54.360> a4<00:01:55.110> 1201

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
so the CPU is going to be an AMD a4 1201

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.609 
so the CPU is going to be an AMD a4 1201
gigahertz<00:01:56.219> processor<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.149> get<00:01:57.390> 2<00:01:58.200> gigabytes

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
gigahertz processor you get 2 gigabytes
