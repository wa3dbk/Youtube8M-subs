00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 in my time the bread cost help 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.210
 He poked his mouth and only pulled my grandfather 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.030
 to die left me that lot of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.719
 Old crap but how did he die? 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.049
 heart attack two girls and a glass o 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.049
 hook 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.080
 nice to know a little strange to me 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.960
 leave all these old things 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.960
 He hated what that is. 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.410
 way I love treasure map is like 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.559
 when my mother used to hide 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 my medication for asthma and left a 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.530
 letter antÃ´nio Possan your partner 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.899
 avoided using this map to find a 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.840
 treasure of great importance 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.340
 life partner he thought you were 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.850
 here because I could have said that you 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.949
 was it to make him well he was old that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.370
 I was really happy and now we are going 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.519
 look for the treasure 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.659
 Okay, well, we need the sword. 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.369
 to be able to defeat the guardian of 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.540
 treasure and then the key to power 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.360
 open the chest 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.420
 this is going to be the best adventure of all 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 the duo with gypsy maps of mou 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.090
 imagined they worried they ventured 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.110
 betray that being now that the bank is over 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.880
 to die 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.970
 going on an adventure let's find we look 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.970
 come on 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.259
 there are only people who are more attractive and 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.890
 have permission to enter 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.100
 Earth 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.100
 we do not have standards here you can pass 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.909
 you do not because because you are 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.740

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:04.270

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.270
 neighborhood - although my cel 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.230
