 the minced meat is combined with preserved chicken cuts, everything comes

 and aromas go 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.200
 the starch thickens the compound the aromas vary according to the country in which the bag is sold 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.650
 will be sold 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.800

 corn syrup is added and to give a sweet aftertaste 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 but then mix the mixture with plenty of water to distribute the way 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.709
 uniform the ingredients and make the sausage more tasty

 even the mashed meat ends up in a gut of 13 centimeters just the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.950
 length of a frankfurter 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.560
 six 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.280
 it takes only 35 seconds to produce a row of frankfurters of the length of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
