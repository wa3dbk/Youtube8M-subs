color<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.610> set<00:01:29.149> my<00:01:29.390> soup<00:01:29.689> base<00:01:29.899> closure<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:31.070> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
color I set my soup base closure in the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.279 
color I set my soup base closure in the
water<00:01:31.759> for<00:01:32.509> about<00:01:33.369> an<00:01:34.369> hour<00:01:34.429> and<00:01:35.360> when<00:01:36.049> I<00:01:36.079> came

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
water for about an hour and when I came

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.460 
water for about an hour and when I came
back<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.710> check<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.310> still<00:01:37.640> hat<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:38.210> not

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
back and check it is still hat is not

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.440 
back and check it is still hat is not
dark<00:01:39.470> enough<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.399> let<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.729> sit<00:01:41.060> for<00:01:41.090> another

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
dark enough so I let it sit for another

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.440 
dark enough so I let it sit for another
hour<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.590> when<00:01:43.189> I<00:01:43.220> took<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.579> out<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.210> was

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
hour and when I took it out it was

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.010 
hour and when I took it out it was
pretty<00:01:45.319> much<00:01:45.469> perfect<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.429> match<00:01:46.670> my<00:01:47.030> skin<00:01:47.450> so

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
pretty much perfect and match my skin so

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.950 
pretty much perfect and match my skin so
well<00:01:48.319> so<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.280> only<00:01:49.399> downside<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.119> using<00:01:50.420> this

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
well so the only downside to using this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.859 
well so the only downside to using this
semi<00:01:51.350> permanent<00:01:51.710> hair<00:01:52.159> color<00:01:52.189> is<00:01:52.819> that<00:01:53.539> if<00:01:53.720> you

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
semi permanent hair color is that if you

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.169 
semi permanent hair color is that if you
watch<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.319> closure<00:01:54.649> too<00:01:55.099> much<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.759> color

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
watch the closure too much the color

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.419 
watch the closure too much the color
could<00:01:56.450> actually<00:01:56.599> come<00:01:57.020> on<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:57.799> I<00:01:57.830> really<00:01:58.189> like

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
could actually come on but I really like

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:59.710 
could actually come on but I really like
using<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.819> just<00:01:59.149> in<00:01:59.240> case<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.509> make<00:01:59.689> a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
using that just in case you make a

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.339 
using that just in case you make a
mistake<00:01:59.840> or<00:02:00.939> whatever<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.329> case<00:02:02.479> may<00:02:02.780> be<00:02:02.810> my

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
mistake or whatever the case may be my

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.649 
mistake or whatever the case may be my
silk<00:02:03.770> base<00:02:03.979> closer<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:04.670> from<00:02:04.849> closer<00:02:05.179> store

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659
