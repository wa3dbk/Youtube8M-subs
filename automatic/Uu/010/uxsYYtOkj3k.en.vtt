00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
she had one of her friends I think the

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.060 
she had one of her friends I think the
confidence<00:01:01.730> wasn't<00:01:02.390> there<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.989> is<00:01:03.829> there

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
confidence wasn't there that is there

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.480 
confidence wasn't there that is there
now<00:01:04.339> because<00:01:04.699> she<00:01:05.059> knows<00:01:05.300> that<00:01:05.330> I<00:01:06.259> also<00:01:07.220> watch

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
now because she knows that I also watch

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.690 
now because she knows that I also watch
out<00:01:07.729> for<00:01:08.030> her<00:01:08.210> she'd<00:01:08.660> go<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.080> store<00:01:09.700> she

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
out for her she'd go to the store she

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.300 
out for her she'd go to the store she
can<00:01:10.910> go<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.539> the<00:01:11.720> movies<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:12.890> she's<00:01:13.130> really

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
can go to the movies so she's really

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.630 
can go to the movies so she's really

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
where I was so I just told Alice Alice

we've got to go home
she<00:01:34.729> said<00:01:34.940> Alice<00:01:35.450> never<00:01:35.660> hesitated<00:01:36.410> she<00:01:36.440> took

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
she said Alice never hesitated she took

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.710 
she said Alice never hesitated she took
her<00:01:36.830> right<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.160> her<00:01:37.340> door<00:01:37.550> I<00:01:37.819> trusted<00:01:38.569> her

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
her right to her door I trusted her

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.749 
her right to her door I trusted her
fully<00:01:38.989> after<00:01:39.410> that<00:01:39.560> because<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.099> knew<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.250> she

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
fully after that because I knew that she

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.760 
fully after that because I knew that she
would<00:01:40.910> help<00:01:41.360> me<00:01:41.479> if<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:41.840> absolutely<00:01:41.989> needed<00:01:42.530> it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
would help me if I absolutely needed it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.100 
would help me if I absolutely needed it
I<00:01:42.979> think<00:01:43.190> it's<00:01:43.340> been<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.580> relief<00:01:44.030> for<00:01:44.300> all<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.720> us

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
I think it's been a relief for all of us

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.430 
I think it's been a relief for all of us
to<00:01:45.649> see<00:01:45.830> how<00:01:46.009> much<00:01:46.190> she's<00:01:46.489> grown<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:48.289> how

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
to see how much she's grown and how

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.559 
to see how much she's grown and how
close<00:01:48.770> she's<00:01:49.099> gotten<00:01:49.489> with<00:01:49.670> Alice<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:50.360> we

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
close she's gotten with Alice that we

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.630 
close she's gotten with Alice that we
don't<00:01:50.780> have<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.289> be<00:01:51.580> that<00:01:52.580> concerned<00:01:53.349> that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
don't have to be that concerned that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.460 
don't have to be that concerned that
she'll<00:01:55.640> get<00:01:55.759> into<00:01:56.060> real<00:01:56.239> trouble<00:01:56.380> because<00:01:57.380> I

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
she'll get into real trouble because I

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.779 
she'll get into real trouble because I
don't<00:01:57.649> think<00:01:57.800> Alice<00:01:58.099> would<00:01:58.280> allow<00:01:58.489> that

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
don't think Alice would allow that

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.850 
don't think Alice would allow that

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.270 

about<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.610> year<00:04:34.000> ago<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:35.530> cane<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:36.100> was

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
about a year ago the cane that I was

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.520 
about a year ago the cane that I was
using<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.730> red<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:36.880> white<00:04:37.090> cane<00:04:37.360> just<00:04:37.690> wasn't

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
using the red and white cane just wasn't

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.310 
using the red and white cane just wasn't
cutting<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.920> I<00:04:39.250> was<00:04:39.850> getting<00:04:40.060> hurt<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.630> I

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
cutting it I was getting hurt and I

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.230 
cutting it I was getting hurt and I
really<00:04:41.680> felt<00:04:41.950> that<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.460> couldn't<00:04:42.850> go<00:04:43.000> anywhere

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
really felt that I couldn't go anywhere

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.230 
really felt that I couldn't go anywhere
by<00:04:43.510> myself<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:44.590> wasn't<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.280> good<00:04:45.610> for<00:04:45.910> my<00:04:46.030> mom

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
by myself it wasn't that good for my mom

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.590 
by myself it wasn't that good for my mom
because<00:04:46.750> if<00:04:47.620> she<00:04:48.520> couldn't<00:04:48.880> see<00:04:49.120> then<00:04:49.390> she

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
because if she couldn't see then she

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.670 
because if she couldn't see then she
couldn't<00:04:49.930> drive<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.860> car<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.640> felt<00:04:52.570> bad<00:04:53.200> for<00:04:53.230> her

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
couldn't drive a car I felt bad for her

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.800 
couldn't drive a car I felt bad for her
and<00:04:53.890> I<00:04:54.070> was<00:04:54.670> able<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.030> help<00:04:55.270> her<00:04:55.420> and<00:04:55.630> get

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
and I was able to help her and get

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.550 
and I was able to help her and get
around<00:04:56.310> places<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.490> she<00:04:57.700> needed<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.060> go

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
around places that she needed to go

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.230 
around places that she needed to go

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
because if she did not have a guide dog

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.180 
because if she did not have a guide dog
then<00:05:01.540> she<00:05:01.720> would<00:05:01.870> be<00:05:01.900> my<00:05:02.320> help<00:05:02.620> or<00:05:02.830> someone
