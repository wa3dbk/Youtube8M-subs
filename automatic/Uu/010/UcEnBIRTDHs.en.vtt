00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hi this is Rob even Ticknor photography

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.070 
hi this is Rob even Ticknor photography
I<00:00:02.100> want<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> do<00:00:02.850> another<00:00:03.030> test<00:00:03.389> with<00:00:03.929> my<00:00:04.049> I

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
I want to do another test with my I

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.650 
I want to do another test with my I
fight<00:00:04.529> card<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.160> got<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.330> time<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
fight card that I got so this time the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.629 
fight card that I got so this time the
configuration<00:00:07.379> has<00:00:07.500> changed<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.010> little<00:00:08.099> bit<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
configuration has changed a little bit I

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.270 
configuration has changed a little bit I
want<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.300> send<00:00:09.660> just<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.440> JPEG<00:00:11.010> because

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
want to send just the JPEG because

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.120 
want to send just the JPEG because
theoretically<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.540> smaller<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.139> size<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
theoretically it's smaller in size to a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.099 
theoretically it's smaller in size to a
device<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> wouldn't<00:00:15.450> be<00:00:15.540> sure<00:00:15.690> even<00:00:15.929> raw

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
device so I wouldn't be sure even raw

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.099 
device so I wouldn't be sure even raw
plus<00:00:16.529> JPEG<00:00:17.449> unfortunately<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.480> found<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
plus JPEG unfortunately I found with the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
plus JPEG unfortunately I found with the
a77<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.250> when<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.760> shoot<00:00:20.970> raw<00:00:21.240> plus<00:00:21.510> JPEG

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a77 that when you do shoot raw plus JPEG

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.320 
a77 that when you do shoot raw plus JPEG
you<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.289> no<00:00:22.500> control<00:00:22.949> over<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.699> quality<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
you have no control over the quality of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
you have no control over the quality of
the<00:00:24.420> JPEG<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.930> don't<00:00:25.080> know<00:00:25.199> exactly<00:00:25.740> what<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.490> is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the JPEG I don't know exactly what it is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
the JPEG I don't know exactly what it is
if<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.910> fine<00:00:27.269> extra<00:00:27.779> fine<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.230> standard

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
if it's fine extra fine or standard

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.479 
if it's fine extra fine or standard
whatever<00:00:29.340> quality<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.410> actually<00:00:31.410> saving<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
whatever quality is actually saving if I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
whatever quality is actually saving if I
had<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> option<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.329> choose<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:34.020> make<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
had the option to choose I would make it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.040 
had the option to choose I would make it
the<00:00:34.649> lowest<00:00:35.219> quality<00:00:35.489> JPEG<00:00:35.940> smallest<00:00:36.809> size

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the lowest quality JPEG smallest size

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.740 
the lowest quality JPEG smallest size
file<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.950> could<00:00:38.100> beam<00:00:38.370> across<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.910> air<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
file that I could beam across the air to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.190 
file that I could beam across the air to
verify<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:40.649> device<00:00:41.570> laptop<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
verify on my device laptop or in this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.950 
verify on my device laptop or in this
case<00:00:43.410> I'll<00:00:43.680> try<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.100> Android<00:00:44.700> phone<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
case I'll try an Android phone so I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380 
case I'll try an Android phone so I
tweaked<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> ëifí<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> software<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.239> now

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
tweaked the ëifí in the software so now

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
tweaked the ëifí in the software so now
it<00:00:48.690> will<00:00:48.989> ignore<00:00:49.350> RAW<00:00:49.620> files<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.190> it'll<00:00:50.370> only

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it will ignore RAW files and it'll only

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.720 
it will ignore RAW files and it'll only
transfer<00:00:51.480> JPEG<00:00:52.140> files<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> installed<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
transfer JPEG files then I installed the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
transfer JPEG files then I installed the
Android<00:00:53.850> application<00:00:54.719> which<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.230> easy

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
Android application which is really easy

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.750 
Android application which is really easy
it<00:00:55.920> had<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.340> login<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:58.050> Phi<00:00:58.859> comm<00:00:59.399> whatever

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it had you login to I Phi comm whatever

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.819 
it had you login to I Phi comm whatever
it<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.629> soon<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.960> did<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> knew

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
it is and as soon as I did that it knew

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.219 
it is and as soon as I did that it knew
what<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.340> card<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.390> knew<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> connect

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
what my card was it knew how to connect

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
what my card was it knew how to connect
and<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:05.760> easy<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.939> didn't<00:01:06.180> do

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and it was really easy I didn't do

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
and it was really easy I didn't do
anything<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.840> basically<00:01:07.170> popped<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
anything it basically popped up with the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
anything it basically popped up with the
card<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.330> said<00:01:09.630> here's<00:01:09.900> how<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> connect<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
card and said here's how you connect and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
card and said here's how you connect and
then<00:01:10.799> happen<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.180> Android<00:01:12.540> phone

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
then happen I have my Android phone

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.910 
then happen I have my Android phone
paired<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.479> camera<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.439> now<00:01:16.590> we'll<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
paired with the camera so now we'll do a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.570 
paired with the camera so now we'll do a
little<00:01:17.070> test<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:19.380> cameras<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.009> should<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
little test the cameras on should be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.190 
little test the cameras on should be
synced<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.119> network<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.750> should<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.080> all

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
synced to the network we should be all

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.399 
synced to the network we should be all
good<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> picture<00:01:24.409> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
good so I'm going to take a picture and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:38.580 
good so I'm going to take a picture and
now<00:01:26.180> we<00:01:27.180> wait

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.010

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
all right it just detected that we have

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:54.480 
all right it just detected that we have
an<00:01:41.140> incoming<00:01:42.000> picture

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490

this<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.369> more<00:01:57.610> detail<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.090> just<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.360> second<00:01:58.720> so

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this in more detail in just a second so

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.520 
this in more detail in just a second so
our<00:01:59.979> picture<00:02:00.310> just<00:02:00.490> came<00:02:00.729> across<00:02:01.409> onto<00:02:02.409> our

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
our picture just came across onto our

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:13.229 
our picture just came across onto our
phone<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:05.560> can<00:02:05.680> zoom<00:02:05.950> in<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.459> get<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
phone and we can zoom in and get a

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.809 
phone and we can zoom in and get a
fairly<00:02:13.630> detailed<00:02:13.840> view<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.620> check<00:02:14.830> focus<00:02:15.400> or

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
fairly detailed view to check focus or

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.290 
fairly detailed view to check focus or
whatever<00:02:16.300> else<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.750> need<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.930> do<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.910> app<00:02:19.150> is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
whatever else we need to do this app is

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.120 
whatever else we need to do this app is
a<00:02:19.330> little<00:02:19.569> bit<00:02:19.690> fidgety<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.350> likes<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.739> jump

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
a little bit fidgety it likes to jump

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.470 
a little bit fidgety it likes to jump
around<00:02:21.310> quite<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> bit

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
around quite a bit

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.949 
around quite a bit
but<00:02:23.020> for<00:02:23.380> checking<00:02:23.770> focus<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.970> works<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.840> now

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
but for checking focus that works so now

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.780 
but for checking focus that works so now
we'll<00:02:29.140> go<00:02:29.290> out<00:02:29.470> we'll<00:02:30.100> take<00:02:30.250> another<00:02:30.550> picture

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
we'll go out we'll take another picture

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.750 
we'll go out we'll take another picture
and<00:02:31.120> I'll<00:02:32.080> show<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.410> how<00:02:32.530> what<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.920> does<00:02:33.100> if

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
and I'll show you how what it does if

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.270 
and I'll show you how what it does if
you<00:02:33.820> full<00:02:34.720> view<00:02:34.989> there<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.709> see<00:02:35.950> when

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
you full view there so you can see when

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:46.350 
you full view there so you can see when
it<00:02:36.400> happens<00:02:39.720> picture<00:02:40.720> taken<00:02:45.030> alright<00:02:46.030> for

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
it happens picture taken alright for

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.350 
it happens picture taken alright for
detecting<00:02:46.810> incoming<00:02:47.290> picture<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.239> how

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
detecting incoming picture this is how

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.300 
detecting incoming picture this is how
long<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.690> takes<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.989> upload

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.589 

and<00:02:57.400> there<00:02:58.000> we<00:02:58.120> go<00:02:58.739> ready<00:02:59.739> for<00:02:59.980> viewing

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
and there we go ready for viewing

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.870 
and there we go ready for viewing
so<00:03:01.599> it's<00:03:02.280> substantially<00:03:03.280> faster<00:03:03.520> than

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
so it's substantially faster than

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.570 
so it's substantially faster than
transferring<00:03:04.180> RAW<00:03:04.540> files<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:06.430> was

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
transferring RAW files it's what was

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.000 
transferring RAW files it's what was
that<00:03:06.670> ten<00:03:06.910> seconds<00:03:07.300> maybe<00:03:07.480> RAW<00:03:08.440> files<00:03:08.650> we're

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
that ten seconds maybe RAW files we're

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.229 
that ten seconds maybe RAW files we're
at<00:03:09.099> least<00:03:09.310> thirty<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.819> was<00:03:09.940> going<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.209> a

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
at least thirty and I was going to a

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.150 
at least thirty and I was going to a
laptop<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.780> don't<00:03:10.930> even<00:03:10.989> know<00:03:11.140> what<00:03:11.860> they<00:03:12.010> would

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
laptop I don't even know what they would

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.380 
laptop I don't even know what they would
do<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.550> phone

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
do on a phone

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.300 
do on a phone
so<00:03:13.510> using<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.170> out<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.739> field<00:03:14.980> this

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
so using this out in the field this

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.640 
so using this out in the field this
could<00:03:15.700> be<00:03:15.819> practical<00:03:16.420> probably<00:03:17.319> not<00:03:17.470> with<00:03:17.590> a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
could be practical probably not with a

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.350 
could be practical probably not with a
phone<00:03:17.950> you'd<00:03:18.400> probably<00:03:18.580> want<00:03:18.880> at<00:03:19.000> least<00:03:19.060> a

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
phone you'd probably want at least a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.390 
phone you'd probably want at least a
tablet<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.989> some<00:03:20.200> sort<00:03:20.440> something<00:03:20.890> fairly

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
tablet of some sort something fairly

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.990 
tablet of some sort something fairly
large<00:03:21.580> or<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.269> laptop<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:23.319> ten<00:03:24.280> seconds<00:03:24.760> per

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
large or a laptop but ten seconds per

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.970 
large or a laptop but ten seconds per
picture<00:03:25.269> that's<00:03:25.660> not<00:03:26.170> too<00:03:26.349> bad<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.530> could<00:03:26.800> live

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
picture that's not too bad I could live

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.280 
picture that's not too bad I could live
with<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:28.060> check<00:03:28.630> focus<00:03:29.050> check

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
with that to check focus check

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.320 
with that to check focus check
composition<00:03:29.890> or<00:03:30.069> show<00:03:30.370> models<00:03:30.850> something

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
composition or show models something

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.140 
composition or show models something
like<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.500> only<00:03:32.830> potential<00:03:33.310> issue<00:03:33.790> with

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
like that the only potential issue with

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.180 
like that the only potential issue with
this<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.510> it'll<00:03:35.350> be<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> little<00:03:35.680> bit<00:03:35.860> slower

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
this is it'll be a little bit slower

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.190 
this is it'll be a little bit slower
writing<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.880> card<00:03:37.180> after<00:03:37.569> each<00:03:37.810> frame

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
writing to the card after each frame

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.420 
writing to the card after each frame
because<00:03:38.830> it's<00:03:39.580> writing<00:03:39.850> raw<00:03:40.750> plus<00:03:41.080> JPEG<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.310> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
because it's writing raw plus JPEG so it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.920 
because it's writing raw plus JPEG so it
might<00:03:42.580> fill<00:03:42.790> up<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> buffer<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.420> little<00:03:43.810> bit

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
might fill up the buffer a little bit

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.380 
might fill up the buffer a little bit
faster<00:03:44.349> if<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.620> were<00:03:44.769> firing<00:03:45.430> away<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.640> lot<00:03:46.000> but

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
faster if you were firing away a lot but

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.030 
faster if you were firing away a lot but
it<00:03:46.930> probably<00:03:47.410> wouldn't<00:03:47.620> be<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.739> problem

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
it probably wouldn't be a problem

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.860 
it probably wouldn't be a problem
killing<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.819> studio<00:03:49.150> setup<00:03:49.540> you're<00:03:49.690> not

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
killing the studio setup you're not

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.250 
killing the studio setup you're not
motor<00:03:50.769> driving<00:03:51.630> hundreds<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.720> pictures<00:03:52.840> or

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
motor driving hundreds of pictures or

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.990 
motor driving hundreds of pictures or
you're<00:03:53.560> not<00:03:53.650> filling<00:03:54.099> up<00:03:54.190> whatever<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
you're not filling up whatever the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.449 
you're not filling up whatever the
buffer<00:03:55.299> is<00:03:55.420> seventeen<00:03:56.049> pictures<00:03:56.319> in<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.500> row<00:03:56.530> so

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
buffer is seventeen pictures in a row so

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.160 
buffer is seventeen pictures in a row so
