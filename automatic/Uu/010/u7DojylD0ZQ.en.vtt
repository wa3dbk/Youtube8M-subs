he feels like he's winning the home so
they<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.780> by<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.770> fighter

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
they all go for a one by one the fighter

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
they all go for a one by one the fighter
gun<00:01:44.280> pistol<00:01:44.490> doesn't<00:01:44.939> help<00:01:45.270> him<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
gun pistol doesn't help him because it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.050 
gun pistol doesn't help him because it
means<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> longer<00:01:46.619> there's<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.820> cellar

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
means it is longer there's more cellar

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.460 
means it is longer there's more cellar
minutes<00:01:48.420> between<00:01:48.509> his<00:01:48.750> fingers<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.170> his<00:01:49.259> head

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
minutes between his fingers in his head

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.649 
minutes between his fingers in his head
so<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.250> takes<00:01:50.490> longer<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> nerve<00:01:51.390> system

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so it takes longer for the nerve system

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
so it takes longer for the nerve system
to<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.229> help<00:01:52.409> him<00:01:52.530> play<00:01:52.710> fifa

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
to actually help him play fifa

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.550 
to actually help him play fifa
dust<00:01:53.549> fact<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:54.030> proven<00:01:54.420> okay<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.320> if

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
dust fact that's proven okay so if

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.749 
dust fact that's proven okay so if
you've<00:01:55.680> ever<00:01:55.799> been<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.340> should<00:01:56.610> actually

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you've ever been you should actually

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580 
you've ever been you should actually
play<00:01:57.240> instead<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.140> you're<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> little

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
play instead of here is you're a little

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.139 
play instead of here is you're a little
bit<00:01:58.710> shorter<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.310> you've<00:01:59.759> actually<00:01:59.909> got<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
bit shorter so you've actually got the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.399 
bit shorter so you've actually got the
smaller<00:02:00.450> distance<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> hands<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
smaller distance in the hands of the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.020 
smaller distance in the hands of the
