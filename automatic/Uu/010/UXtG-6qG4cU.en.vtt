00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 Welcome to Haley viewers of this print 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.840
 again a new video and this video shows 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.750
 I see how you can easily make your own 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.969
 could make a sketch and this goes with a moth 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.529
 fries and you can be one 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.170
 in the description and you can 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.609
 install it very easily with 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.769
 power and terminal but so I'm going to 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.300
 explain how you can easily find this here 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.189
 make one's own skeptical 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.539
 iso soul i saw myself and did so 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.980
 control robot 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.619
 how is that possible I am going to you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 so I explain to you that moth and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.640
 Single player can also be the multiplayer 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.469
 as shown in the video 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.780
 for example, you put your camera here 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.129
 point down you press f and suddenly comes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 a doll appears because you 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.640
 camera frieze to i can is so easy 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.350
 let your character walk 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.610
 so he just goes forward and when you again 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.190
 on print you come back again 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 well that is very easy because now you can 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.879
 of course throw movie character 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 while you just sit here and you 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.710
 character lets you walk there for it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.120
 his nice shot we have over this bridge 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.070
 in you want a vian that makes you beautiful 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.229
 behind that island you see and a little bit 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.360
 if not intentionally aimed at the bridge 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.760
 but and do it and then you have to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.350
 keep a close eye on the controls and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.680
 Light whip and a nice walk 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.540
 effect you throw novels over it 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.020
 for example one is still further 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.790
 and depth trains 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.650
 we loved the place when you walk in a row 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.540
 a sketch 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.100
 he will walk well i am driving my own 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.650
 Poppetje can himself and I press and off 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.330
 I am once again back there and 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.540
 Whatever you can do is just for it 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.820
 from here you do it from a4 so and you 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.330
 copies let you grab just let you 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.040
 to turn 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.540
 it all controls itself in that 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.100
 as you normally will your puppet 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.750
 let them drive but you are just that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.090
 put your head straight and you walk straight ahead 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.430
 and you can also sam as your optifine 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.510
 I am impressed to turn it around as 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.640
 let you back over the bridges 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.840
 walk and that way 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.270
 look and then you see there with optifine 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.830
 run smart over it so I think it is 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.420
 really handy for example with a 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.310
 of course you always sketch a movie 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.630
 own character 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.850
 so then this is very handy if you just 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.290
 you can film your own doll 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 say but if you go here on the bridge 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.880
 stand or say where you are from a point 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.030
 and if you want to look nice out 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.280
 for example his so over you 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.870
 look over your country for example and you 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.580
 look so f8 so towards you from what 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.350
 be a nice and then see the zombie to it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.200
 the example you have just briefly 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.640
 look down a little something you can 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.340
 with zooming in on you from a young age 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 face and so on you leave the skerry 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.040
 pressure on bed and she leaves you whole 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.340
 easy just your own 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.860
 filming character and that is really bad 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.510
 I think it's handy to go to everyone 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.090
 from the part 2 you get even more so 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.530
 can do well then the second function is 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.360
 For example, as we now see in the box 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.330
 we stand still like this 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.739
 you can press g and then one comes 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.390
 jar emerge 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.170
 at least and my hour and then you do 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.310
 Mr. 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.170
 choose you all know it is 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.120
 of course well we put it here 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.890
 down station is that means statue 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.510
 and then click here 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.040
 well let's walk for a while so you can 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.110
 also to run after and so well then go 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.730
 we look there action 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.440
 it can look set view work we do so 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.150
 we must not go into the blog burdock 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.140
 during that we stand now I sit it 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:20.189
 stuff is with the head of ties and yes 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:23.439
 down no back yes alex and so on 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:26.049
 a little more behind 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.280
 okay so the shelf see he stands 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.319
 will be wrong on the wrong side 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.090
 place you can easily place and drop 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.950
 of course and then the corner 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.950
 For example, as real as you talk 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.549
 are through then we do so 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.459
 here we put the camera want more 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.840
 the one and poor well this is a bit 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.889
 wrong place but if you are good at that 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.659
 first of course you have a nice one 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.769
 and then you can talk with optifine 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.510
 all just a bit wrong neatly 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.250
 but you can talk so well 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.540
 of course you have a talk and so on 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.919
 so it gets like that in sketchup 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.810
 do not even need dep for example 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.459
 to help your friend with hey can 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.109
 you can also do it with a sketch crown 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.389
 do so 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.010
 and now the fnv back at poo doll and 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.659
 that right mouse button and if it is too 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.010
 gone well then of course several 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.459
 drop people if you come here for example 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.919

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.379

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.599
 and then you do here and so 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.889
 well we have a wait here if 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.900

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.070
 between and friend who frysk and has 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.220

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:33.130
 you want your g-forces 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.570
 statue like that and then have a look like this or not 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.650
 then it will do beautiful by come here like this 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.030
 walk in 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.530
 Well you can of course choose the let alone 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.449
 oh, I just talked to you like that 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.370
 the sketch leaves a bit wrong 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.630
 Well then you'll go here so just walk 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.150
 so look up and then you look 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.070
 For example, pretty much around and then hop 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.570
 he got by the camera after it quite a bit 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.659
 happens pretty good if you c that had 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.860
 now that I have not turned on that is 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.080
 a bit of a shame but now I am here 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.909
 of course when I'm very busy 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.860
 right mouse button right away and away 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.810
 well then you can speak i don't know 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.280
 whether it is a throne room in this building we 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.250
 just go smoothly to a throne room 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.740
 use if that is the well we go we 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.690
 use this even grain look the is 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.449
 nothing really not this whole building here 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:21.580
 after a call like that 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.670
 hg and then we do king and then not 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.460
 camera dutilh but 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.480
 that you look at me like that 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.950
 station and we will take a look f 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.170
 and then you see that he is beautiful in the cells 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.820
 really looks at it then for example 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.450
 Guardians who always stand up so she knows 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.310
 you are 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.050
 any b in england or so my king that 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.710
 just look neat to always cover 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.900
 in you fuck you 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.940
 but now ignore that you don't look now see 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.230
 just neatly so look hello king 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.060
 well if that's the intention but so can you 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.290
 so let you look at it and that is also 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.150
 very easy hour from scathed to 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.380
 Right mouse use again so the can 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.430
 you can make a king there you can 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.170
 here again watchmen of course must 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.930
 drop with no guide 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.650
 or about guard I mean a card them 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.370
 I wanted to say 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.320
 statue well and then wait 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.540
 station but the term just explained and explained 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.920
 then you just let them say vodka and 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.070
 you can actually do that so can you 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.550
 if you like them they really do justice to you 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.820
 stand 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.580
 so then you do so head up heads 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.820
 may yes so watch my turn them nice 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.350
 law is really good looking so right 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.460
 each other's eyes well then you have to 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.220
 that also run and then you really have 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.450
 waiting is now so f and the city you can 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.180
 off small you really have a very exciting one 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.650
 if you put the zoom music underneath 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.450
 and so you can actually do it very easily 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.550
 make my own scraps and I hope so 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.020
 have helped you in little how 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.790
 this mouth works the link like me in 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.340
 the beginning of the fourth, they state so 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.780
 the description and it was called fries 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.920
 you can also do whatever is nice 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.020
 to show 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.250
 the mouth is not only possible in single play 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.080
 you can just use it in 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.740
 use multiplay so we are going to ff one 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.680

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.390
 after one if I do so here in there 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.500
 does so ff one and then we go puppet 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.880
 that flying then he just goes there 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.440
 and you can easily fly like this 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.690
 of course, and she can do you 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.180
 you can always be in third person 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.880
 just record things and also the floor 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.920
 to here i do n't know which arm i am now 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.230
 use the bolt to you here I have the 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.880
 boom we see real shooting 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.490
 so you can really do things just 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.650
 what you doll so I can the black hand 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.590
 string word 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.419
 for example , you can scratch in 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.099
 you fight with your own doll 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.330
 but the controls are a bit 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:45.610
 difficult that you must be well under control 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.930
 of course you want that a bit 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.370
 learn as you must really want good 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.449
 start using it is just the same 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.639
 but it's always a bit difficult 

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:52.810
 because the kind of mirror image is but 

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.129

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.930
