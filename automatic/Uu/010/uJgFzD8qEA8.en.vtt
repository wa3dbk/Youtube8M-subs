00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.749 

one<00:00:08.830> thing<00:00:09.010> you'll<00:00:09.099> need<00:00:09.219> to<00:00:09.280> be<00:00:09.490> really

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:09.759 
one thing you'll need to be really

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.060 
one thing you'll need to be really
careful<00:00:10.150> of<00:00:10.240> if<00:00:10.749> you're<00:00:10.959> making<00:00:11.589> a<00:00:11.650> modular

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
careful of if you're making a modular

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.950 
careful of if you're making a modular
layout<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:15.280> tracks<00:00:15.579> are<00:00:16.059> aligned

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
layout is that the tracks are aligned

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.110 
layout is that the tracks are aligned
between<00:00:17.290> the<00:00:17.620> modules<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:21.340> you<00:00:21.490> can<00:00:21.730> see<00:00:21.880> there

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
between the modules as you can see there

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.140 
between the modules as you can see there
those<00:00:22.390> tracks<00:00:22.720> are<00:00:22.840> nicely<00:00:23.290> aligned<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.970> this

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
those tracks are nicely aligned in this

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.540 
those tracks are nicely aligned in this
tutorial<00:00:25.810> will<00:00:26.080> show<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.590> how<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:27.010> do<00:00:27.370> that

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
tutorial will show you how to do that

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.660 
tutorial will show you how to do that
how<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.120> make<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.600> tracks<00:00:28.870> nicely<00:00:29.380> aligned<00:00:29.710> so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
how to make the tracks nicely aligned so

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.739 
how to make the tracks nicely aligned so
that<00:00:30.700> your<00:00:31.000> trains<00:00:31.270> will<00:00:31.480> run<00:00:31.510> well<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.510> first

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:34.749 
that your trains will run well the first

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:36.840 
that your trains will run well the first
thing<00:00:34.929> we<00:00:35.050> need<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.260> do<00:00:35.469> is<00:00:35.980> put<00:00:36.339> some<00:00:36.609> screws

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
thing we need to do is put some screws

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.540 
thing we need to do is put some screws
into<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.960> board<00:00:38.260> where<00:00:38.499> the<00:00:38.620> track<00:00:38.859> is<00:00:39.370> going

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
into the board where the track is going

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.009 
into the board where the track is going
to<00:00:39.670> be<00:00:39.760> aligned<00:00:40.179> with<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.629> track<00:00:40.839> on<00:00:40.989> the

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
to be aligned with the track on the

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.209 
to be aligned with the track on the
other<00:00:41.260> module<00:00:41.679> I<00:00:43.050> normally<00:00:44.050> use<00:00:44.109> fairly<00:00:44.859> small

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
other module I normally use fairly small

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.910 
other module I normally use fairly small
screws<00:00:45.879> for<00:00:46.120> this<00:00:46.269> as<00:00:47.109> it<00:00:47.140> really<00:00:47.499> only<00:00:47.679> is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
screws for this as it really only is

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.029 
screws for this as it really only is
there<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:49.300> hold<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.600> track<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.019> place<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.589> to

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
there to hold the track in place and to

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.410 
there to hold the track in place and to
hold<00:00:51.219> it<00:00:51.399> in<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.670> base<00:00:52.030> board

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
hold it in the base board

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.549 
hold it in the base board
I<00:00:56.850> normally<00:00:57.850> drill<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:58.569> couple<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.989> small<00:00:59.289> holes

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
I normally drill a couple of small holes

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.889 
I normally drill a couple of small holes
just<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.010> help<00:01:00.159> to<00:01:00.249> guide<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.639> screws<00:01:01.149> in<00:01:01.329> -<00:01:01.539> it

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
just to help to guide the screws in - it

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:30.840 
just to help to guide the screws in - it
just<00:01:02.109> makes<00:01:02.289> it<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.530> little<00:01:02.649> bit<00:01:02.889> easier<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.339> do

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.780 

it's<00:01:31.850> important<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.630> align<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:34.130> track<00:01:34.400> on<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
it's important to align the track on the

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.550 
it's important to align the track on the
two<00:01:34.940> different<00:01:35.240> modules<00:01:35.540> vertically<00:01:36.140> as<00:01:36.500> well

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
two different modules vertically as well

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.690 
two different modules vertically as well
as<00:01:36.890> horizontally<00:01:41.740> one<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.890> those<00:01:43.040> needs<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.490> be

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
as horizontally one of those needs to be

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.630 
as horizontally one of those needs to be
adjusted<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.270> little<00:01:44.300> just<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.870> bring<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.410> down

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.450 

and<00:01:52.640> I<00:01:52.790> normally<00:01:53.300> just<00:01:53.330> put<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:54.130> small<00:01:55.130> track

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
and I normally just put one small track

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.120 
and I normally just put one small track
pin<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.790> just<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.150> hold<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.510> while<00:01:56.750> on<00:01:57.130> while

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
pin in just to hold it while on while

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:25.810 
pin in just to hold it while on while
I'm<00:01:58.340> soldering<00:02:23.980> one<00:02:24.980> thing<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.280> can<00:02:25.430> do<00:02:25.550> just

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
I'm soldering one thing you can do just

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.090 
I'm soldering one thing you can do just
to<00:02:25.940> test<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.780> alignment<00:02:27.290> before<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.740> solder

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
to test the alignment before you solder

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.520 
to test the alignment before you solder
it<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:29.150> just<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.540> run<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> piece<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.140> rolling

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
it is just to run a piece of rolling

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.640 
it is just to run a piece of rolling
stock<00:02:30.709> over<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:32.720> see<00:02:32.900> how<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.230> sounds

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
stock over it and just see how it sounds

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.740 
stock over it and just see how it sounds
and<00:02:34.120> how<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.239> feels

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.410 

and<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.020> feels<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.470> sounds<00:02:39.800> good<00:02:40.420> then

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
and if it feels and sounds good then

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.520 
and if it feels and sounds good then
you've<00:02:41.630> aligned<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.110> pretty<00:02:42.320> well<00:02:44.530> another

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
you've aligned it pretty well another

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.560 
you've aligned it pretty well another
thing<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:45.830> can<00:02:45.950> do<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.370> look<00:02:46.550> down<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:47.330> layout

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
thing you can do is look down the layout

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.009 
thing you can do is look down the layout
and<00:02:48.440> across<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.950> module<00:02:49.310> like<00:02:49.489> this<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.810> you

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
and across the module like this and you

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.570 
and across the module like this and you
can<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.320> see<00:02:51.470> how<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.739> track<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.070> lined<00:02:52.400> up

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
can just see how the track is lined up

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.920 
can just see how the track is lined up
as<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.030> can<00:02:53.150> see<00:02:53.269> it's<00:02:53.420> where<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.570> got<00:02:53.690> pretty

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
as you can see it's where I got pretty

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:03.870 
as you can see it's where I got pretty
well<00:02:54.140> there

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.130 

when<00:03:04.880> you're<00:03:05.030> putting<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.390> solar<00:03:05.630> on<00:03:05.840> put<00:03:06.110> a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
when you're putting the solar on put a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.790 
when you're putting the solar on put a
quite<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:06.980> bit<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:07.750> as<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.110> more<00:03:09.319> that<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.620> there

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
quite a bit on as the more that is there

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.980 
quite a bit on as the more that is there
bonding<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.490> screw<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> rails<00:03:11.330> the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
bonding the screw and the rails the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.340 
bonding the screw and the rails the
better<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.380> going<00:03:12.560> hold<00:03:13.870> but<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:14.989> don't

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
better it's going hold but you don't

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:24.320 
better it's going hold but you don't
want<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.560> have<00:03:15.680> too<00:03:15.890> much<00:03:16.040> even<00:03:16.430> still

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.900 

you

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.630 

that's<00:03:29.910> probably

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
that's probably

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.020 
that's probably
enough<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.890> then<00:03:33.040> we<00:03:33.220> do<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.610> other<00:03:33.790> track

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
enough and then we do on the other track

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.570 
enough and then we do on the other track
as<00:03:34.210> well<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:40.530> generally<00:03:41.530> do<00:03:41.709> just<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.130> outside

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
as well I generally do just the outside

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.510
