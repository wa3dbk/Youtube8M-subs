well I caught it it's it's better than

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.539 
well I caught it it's it's better than
not<00:03:46.629> it's<00:03:47.109> better<00:03:47.290> than<00:03:47.500> catching<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.950> at<00:03:48.159> like

before getting any of the badges because

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.129 
before getting any of the badges because
