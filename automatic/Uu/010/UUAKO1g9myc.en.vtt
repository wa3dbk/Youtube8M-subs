the<00:02:37.740> unboxing<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.970> far<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.140> unbox<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.770> I

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the unboxing so far I when I unbox it I

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.430 
the unboxing so far I when I unbox it I
wasn't<00:02:44.430> very<00:02:44.790> well<00:02:45.060> impressed<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.140> fact<00:02:46.380> that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
wasn't very well impressed the fact that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860 
wasn't very well impressed the fact that
it<00:02:46.650> used<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.280> blister<00:02:47.790> pack<00:02:48.000> considering<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
it used a blister pack considering that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.870 
it used a blister pack considering that
the<00:02:49.110> last<00:02:49.500> year's<00:02:49.709> version<00:02:49.980> came<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.700> nice

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the last year's version came in a nice

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.530 
the last year's version came in a nice
pretty<00:02:51.720> foam<00:02:52.320> encased<00:02:52.920> tomb<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.330> thought

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
pretty foam encased tomb and I thought

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540 
pretty foam encased tomb and I thought
that<00:02:54.870> made<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.260> figure<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> lot<00:02:55.680> more<00:02:55.890> classy

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
that made the figure a lot more classy

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.720 
that made the figure a lot more classy
and<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.820> lot<00:02:56.970> more<00:02:57.150> sophisticated<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:59.400> not<00:02:59.580> to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
and a lot more sophisticated it's not to

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.550 
and a lot more sophisticated it's not to
say<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.180> figure<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.540> any<00:03:00.690> less<00:03:01.019> quality

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
say that the figure is any less quality

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.740 
say that the figure is any less quality
it's<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.280> way<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.489> arrived<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
it's just the way it arrived this is a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.560 
it's just the way it arrived this is a
unique<00:03:04.500> figure<00:03:05.489> it's<00:03:05.850> really<00:03:06.269> hard<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
unique figure it's really hard to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.470 
unique figure it's really hard to
explain<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.019> fact<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:08.370> figure<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:11.480> so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
explain the fact that this figure is so

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.210 
explain the fact that this figure is so
radical<00:03:13.080> than<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.350> guess<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:13.739> I'm<00:03:13.890> used<00:03:14.100> to

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
radical than I guess the one I'm used to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.740 
radical than I guess the one I'm used to
and<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.320> can<00:03:16.440> tell<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:17.730> very<00:03:18.030> creepy<00:03:18.420> as

and as you can tell it's very creepy as

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.250 
and as you can tell it's very creepy as
a<00:03:19.110> very<00:03:19.739> creepy<00:03:20.220> feel<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.690> fact<00:03:21.989> that
