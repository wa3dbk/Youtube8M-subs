actually going to post this but then it
came<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.599> point<00:00:15.750> where<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.230> I'm

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
came to the point where as like I'm

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.810 
came to the point where as like I'm

gonna approach this video or no video
and<00:00:18.180> well<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.600> mean<00:00:18.660> there's<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.590> deciding

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and well I mean there's a deciding

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
factor for you I mentioned a couple

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.720 
factor for you I mentioned a couple
weeks<00:00:22.380> ago<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.189> never<00:00:23.310> start<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
weeks ago that I can never start a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.490 
weeks ago that I can never start a
sketch<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.750> sides<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> canvas

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
sketch with like all sides of the canvas

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.070 
sketch with like all sides of the canvas
showing<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.279> don't<00:00:26.490> know<00:00:26.609> why<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
showing I don't know why it's just a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.130 
showing I don't know why it's just a
weird<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:28.980> quirk<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.359> try<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.720> fight

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
weird little quirk but to try and fight

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 
weird little quirk but to try and fight
that<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:32.279> decided<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.759> zoom<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.510> I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that I just decided to zoom in like I

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.750 
that I just decided to zoom in like I
normally<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.559> then<00:00:34.710> draw<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.070> box<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
normally do but then draw a box that I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
normally do but then draw a box that I
want<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.180> keep<00:00:36.360> my<00:00:36.570> picture<00:00:36.930> inside<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
want to keep my picture inside of that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
want to keep my picture inside of that
way<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> could<00:00:38.550> work<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.969> drawing<00:00:39.239> bust-ups

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
way I could work on drawing bust-ups

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.020 
way I could work on drawing bust-ups
which<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.350> find<00:00:40.680> much<00:00:41.040> more<00:00:41.370> difficult<00:00:41.850> than

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
which I find much more difficult than

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.990 
which I find much more difficult than
drawing<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.170> full<00:00:43.379> body<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.710> don't<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.879> why

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
drawing the full body I don't know why

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
drawing the full body I don't know why
either<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> drew<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> box<00:00:47.250> I'm

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
either so because I drew like a box I'm

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
either so because I drew like a box I'm
able<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.300> where<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> border<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
able to I know where like the border is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
able to I know where like the border is
and<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> need<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> stay<00:00:50.670> within<00:00:50.850> but

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and where I need to stay within but

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.569 
and where I need to stay within but
because<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> isn't<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.710> actual<00:00:52.860> ends<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because it isn't the actual ends of the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
because it isn't the actual ends of the
canvas<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.360> still<00:00:54.600> draw<00:00:54.809> outside<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
canvas I can still draw outside of it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.139 
canvas I can still draw outside of it
and<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.670> more<00:00:56.850> freedom

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and that way I have a lot more freedom

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.869 
and that way I have a lot more freedom
to<00:00:57.780> adjust<00:00:57.899> things<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> need<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.550> future

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
to adjust things as I need in the future

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
to adjust things as I need in the future
or<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.449> progress<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.050> drawing<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> picture

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
or the progress of drawing the picture

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
or the progress of drawing the picture
and<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.969> actually<00:01:03.180> end<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.480> changing<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.019> size

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and I actually end up changing the size

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
and I actually end up changing the size
of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> box<00:01:04.799> quite<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> few<00:01:05.460> times<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
of the box quite a few times I think I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.990 
of the box quite a few times I think I
like<00:01:06.710> well<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:07.830> shrink<00:01:08.220> her<00:01:08.580> inside

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
like well I actually shrink her inside

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
like well I actually shrink her inside
the<00:01:09.119> box<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.630> change<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> size<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the box and then I change the size of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.130 
the box and then I change the size of
box<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.799> elongated<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> ended

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
box I like elongated it and so it ended

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
box I like elongated it and so it ended
up<00:01:13.200> being<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> much<00:01:13.590> taller<00:01:14.180> illustration<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
up being a much taller illustration that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.789 
up being a much taller illustration that
I<00:01:15.360> had<00:01:15.479> planned<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> beginning<00:01:16.049> but

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
I had planned at the beginning but

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.130 
I had planned at the beginning but
because<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.670> use<00:01:18.060> separate<00:01:18.390> layers<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.020> able

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
because I use separate layers I was able

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.160 
because I use separate layers I was able
to<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> creative<00:01:21.750> process

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to you know go with the creative process

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.170 
to you know go with the creative process
and<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> drew<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> adjust<00:01:23.580> things<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.060> way<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and as I drew it adjust things the way I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
and as I drew it adjust things the way I
wanted<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.100> once<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.369> had

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
wanted them to be and then once I had

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
wanted them to be and then once I had
sketched<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> layout<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
sketched out the layout of the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.289 
sketched out the layout of the
illustration<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.740> went<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.759> some<00:01:29.970> colors

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
illustration I went in with some colors

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.370 
illustration I went in with some colors
and<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.570> tried<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> figure<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.229> kind

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and just tried to figure out what kind

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
and just tried to figure out what kind
of<00:01:31.439> colors<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.829> wanted<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> use<00:01:32.400> later<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of colors I wanted to use later I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.300 
of colors I wanted to use later I
actually<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.140> add<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.470> line<00:01:34.650> art<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.100> then

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
actually do add some line art and then

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
actually do add some line art and then
recolor<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.900> sort<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
recolor it but this was just sort of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
recolor it but this was just sort of
just<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.860> mind<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.759> figure<00:01:39.060> out

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
just to get my mind go in and figure out

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
just to get my mind go in and figure out
what<00:01:39.540> colors<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.990> wanted<00:01:40.259> where<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.520> point

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
what colors I wanted where at this point

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.310 
what colors I wanted where at this point
I<00:01:41.820> realized<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.180> didn't<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I realized I didn't really want that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.170 
I realized I didn't really want that
weird<00:01:43.619> flood<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> butterflies<00:01:44.670> coming<00:01:45.000> out

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
weird flood of butterflies coming out

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.730 
weird flood of butterflies coming out
from<00:01:45.329> her<00:01:45.450> head<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.020> decided<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> change<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
from her head and I decided to change it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
from her head and I decided to change it
to<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> ponytail<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.820> mean<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.659> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
to like a ponytail I mean I like that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.990 
to like a ponytail I mean I like that
way<00:01:48.960> better<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:50.189> after<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.640> all<00:01:50.790> set

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
way better and then after I was all set

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.880 
way better and then after I was all set
with<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> colors<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.810> started<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> line<00:01:52.590> art

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
with the colors I started the line art

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
with the colors I started the line art
when<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> started<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.820> line<00:01:54.060> art<00:01:54.240> section<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
when I started this line art section it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.170 
when I started this line art section it
was<00:01:54.689> actually<00:01:55.470> meant<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.430> second<00:01:56.850> sketch

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
was actually meant to be a second sketch

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.359 
was actually meant to be a second sketch
layer<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.680> was<00:01:58.829> doing<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.250> I

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
layer but then as I was doing it I

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609 
layer but then as I was doing it I
realized<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.850> was<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.329> making<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.530> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
realized I was actually making a lot of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.499 
realized I was actually making a lot of
those<00:02:01.740> lines<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.610> were<00:02:02.670> final<00:02:03.299> line

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
those lines as if they were final line

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.539 
those lines as if they were final line
art<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.079> was<00:02:04.350> able<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.799> use<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.070> later

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
art so I was able to just use that later

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.479 
art so I was able to just use that later
although<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.270> few<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.409> lines<00:02:08.099> weren't

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
although a few of the lines weren't

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.969 
although a few of the lines weren't
closed<00:02:08.940> lines<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.690> liked<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.619> my

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
closed lines and I liked it when I do my

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.360 
closed lines and I liked it when I do my
line<00:02:11.250> art<00:02:11.520> close<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> lines<00:02:12.629> so

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
line art close all the lines so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.890 
line art close all the lines so
I<00:02:13.400> can<00:02:13.670> use<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.909> paint<00:02:14.090> bucket<00:02:14.239> tool<00:02:14.450> later

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
I can use the paint bucket tool later

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.630 
I can use the paint bucket tool later
but<00:02:15.590> because<00:02:15.860> some<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.099> these<00:02:16.250> lines<00:02:16.430> weren't

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
but because some of these lines weren't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.670 
but because some of these lines weren't
closed<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.239> did<00:02:17.450> have<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.049> go<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.500> fix

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
closed I did have to just go in and fix

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.380 
closed I did have to just go in and fix
some<00:02:18.890> things<00:02:18.920> later<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:19.549> I<00:02:19.879> think<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.269> still

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
some things later but I think it still

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.660 
some things later but I think it still
saved<00:02:20.599> me<00:02:20.750> time<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.170> long<00:02:21.349> run<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.739> think

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
saved me time in the long run I think

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.280 
saved me time in the long run I think
every<00:02:22.970> artist<00:02:23.120> has<00:02:23.569> those<00:02:23.980> 1<00:02:24.980> 2<00:02:25.159> 3

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
every artist has those 1 2 3

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.690 
every artist has those 1 2 3
37<00:02:27.290> things<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.920> they<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.190> trouble<00:02:28.400> with

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
37 things that they have trouble with

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.550 
37 things that they have trouble with
our<00:02:28.940> sometimes<00:02:29.900> they<00:02:30.049> don't<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.409> trouble

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
our sometimes they don't have trouble

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.110 
our sometimes they don't have trouble
with<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:30.890> then<00:02:31.010> some<00:02:31.190> days<00:02:31.340> they<00:02:31.519> just<00:02:31.730> really

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
with and then some days they just really

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.750 
with and then some days they just really
struggle<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.750> today<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.680> was<00:02:33.709> hands<00:02:34.129> for<00:02:34.610> me

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
struggle and today it was hands for me

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.680 
struggle and today it was hands for me
and<00:02:35.120> they<00:02:35.870> were<00:02:36.290> oh<00:02:36.620> my<00:02:37.099> goodness<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:38.390> can<00:02:38.540> see

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
and they were oh my goodness you can see

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.420 
and they were oh my goodness you can see
how<00:02:38.750> many<00:02:38.959> times<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.319> redraw<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.010> don't<00:02:40.220> I

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
how many times I redraw this I don't I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.660 
how many times I redraw this I don't I
don't<00:02:41.209> know<00:02:41.690> man<00:02:42.019> I<00:02:42.349> in<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:42.980> end<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:43.340> still<00:02:43.640> just

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
don't know man I in the end I still just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.970 
don't know man I in the end I still just
decided<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.360> go<00:02:44.510> with<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.379> knew<00:02:45.950> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
decided to go with it like I knew I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.190 
decided to go with it like I knew I
wasn't<00:02:46.549> gonna<00:02:46.910> get<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.329> today<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.989> just

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
wasn't gonna get it today so I just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.259 
wasn't gonna get it today so I just
decided<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.739> no<00:02:48.950> finish<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.609> illustration

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
decided to no finish the illustration

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.550 
decided to no finish the illustration
and<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.660> what<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.900> looked<00:02:51.049> like<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.349> end

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
and see what it looked like in the end

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.199 
and see what it looked like in the end
because<00:02:52.310> sometimes<00:02:52.640> when<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.849> comes<00:02:53.000> down<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
because sometimes when it comes down to

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.880 
because sometimes when it comes down to
those<00:02:53.450> things<00:02:53.750> you're<00:02:53.900> nitpicking<00:02:54.200> at<00:02:54.680> things

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
those things you're nitpicking at things

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.589 
those things you're nitpicking at things
that<00:02:55.069> no<00:02:55.220> one's<00:02:55.400> even<00:02:55.489> gonna<00:02:55.730> notice<00:02:56.060> except

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
that no one's even gonna notice except

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.720 
that no one's even gonna notice except
that<00:02:56.750> now<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:57.019> pointing<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.530> out<00:02:57.620> but<00:02:58.159> in<00:02:58.549> all

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
that now I'm pointing it out but in all

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.509 
that now I'm pointing it out but in all
honesty<00:02:59.299> you<00:03:00.019> you're<00:03:00.709> gonna<00:03:01.040> see<00:03:01.159> more

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
honesty you you're gonna see more

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.770 
honesty you you're gonna see more
problems<00:03:01.700> with<00:03:01.879> your<00:03:02.060> own<00:03:02.150> drawing<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.599> most

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
problems with your own drawing the most

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.589 
problems with your own drawing the most
people<00:03:03.140> will<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.459> decided<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.970> just<00:03:05.269> you

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.210 
sometimes when it's done something that
men<00:03:10.609> felt<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:11.989> such<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.140> huge<00:03:12.560> problem

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220

men felt like it was such a huge problem
with<00:03:13.370> your<00:03:13.519> drawing<00:03:13.760> ends<00:03:14.180> up<00:03:14.269> being<00:03:14.480> just

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
with your drawing ends up being just

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.330 
with your drawing ends up being just
something<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.049> was<00:03:15.260> kind<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.530> on<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.769> side<00:03:15.980> I

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
something that was kind of on the side I

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.309 
something that was kind of on the side I
think<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.419> one<00:03:17.569> I'm<00:03:17.660> starting<00:03:17.959> right<00:03:18.079> now<00:03:18.109> is

think the one I'm starting right now is
actually<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.680> hand<00:03:18.919> I<00:03:19.069> decided<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.849> go<00:03:19.970> with

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
actually the hand I decided to go with

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.400 
actually the hand I decided to go with
this<00:03:20.450> that's<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> point<00:03:21.079> where<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.230> was<00:03:21.319> just

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.490 
this is what we're gonna have the end oh
I<00:03:26.450> feel<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:26.840> come<00:03:27.109> here<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.349> really

I feel like come here is really

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.879 
I feel like come here is really
depressing<00:03:27.980> I'm<00:03:28.099> sorry<00:03:28.340> okay<00:03:28.790> no<00:03:29.569> from<00:03:30.049> this

depressing I'm sorry okay no from this

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.030 
depressing I'm sorry okay no from this
point<00:03:31.190> forward<00:03:31.579> we're<00:03:31.879> going<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.180> positive

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
point forward we're going to be positive

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.170 
point forward we're going to be positive
so<00:03:34.040> at<00:03:34.129> this<00:03:34.220> hand<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.489> realized<00:03:34.760> something<00:03:34.910> was

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
so at this hand I realized something was

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.300 
so at this hand I realized something was
missing<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.049> just<00:03:36.290> added<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.650> thumb<00:03:36.980> on

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
missing so I just added that thumb on

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.460 
missing so I just added that thumb on
that<00:03:37.340> space<00:03:38.090> between<00:03:38.329> like<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.840> forefinger

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
that space between like the forefinger

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.900 
that space between like the forefinger
and<00:03:39.620> middle<00:03:39.680> finger<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.790> definitely

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
and middle finger and it definitely

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.189 
and middle finger and it definitely
looked<00:03:41.239> better<00:03:41.359> afterwards<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.959> felt<00:03:42.079> more

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
looked better afterwards it felt more

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.530 
looked better afterwards it felt more
like<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.440> hand<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:43.220> wasn't<00:03:43.489> just<00:03:43.609> like<00:03:43.669> a<00:03:44.030> flat

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
like a hand it wasn't just like a flat

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.000 
like a hand it wasn't just like a flat
hand<00:03:44.780> now<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.109> was<00:03:45.230> like<00:03:45.379> oh<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.680> was<00:03:45.769> almost

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
hand now it was like oh it was almost

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.650 
hand now it was like oh it was almost
three-dimensional<00:03:46.430> because<00:03:47.030> hey<00:03:47.239> I<00:03:47.449> remember

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
three-dimensional because hey I remember

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.509 
three-dimensional because hey I remember
there<00:03:48.049> was<00:03:48.139> a<00:03:48.169> thumb<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.739> goes<00:03:48.949> somewhere<00:03:49.370> on

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
there was a thumb that goes somewhere on

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.580 
there was a thumb that goes somewhere on
that<00:03:49.549> hand<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.930> then<00:03:51.139> when<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.319> came<00:03:51.410> to

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
that hand and then when it came to

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.530 
that hand and then when it came to
drawing<00:03:51.769> like<00:03:51.949> the<00:03:52.069> long<00:03:52.280> flowy<00:03:52.910> hair<00:03:53.060> I

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
drawing like the long flowy hair I

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.300 
drawing like the long flowy hair I
really<00:03:53.840> enjoyed<00:03:54.139> that<00:03:54.169> part<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.799> was<00:03:54.949> a<00:03:54.980> lot<00:03:55.220> of

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
really enjoyed that part it was a lot of

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.039 
really enjoyed that part it was a lot of
fun<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.639> was<00:03:55.669> like<00:03:55.879> I<00:03:56.150> don't<00:03:56.780> know<00:03:56.870> there's

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
fun it was like I don't know there's

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.569 
fun it was like I don't know there's
just<00:03:57.079> so<00:03:57.379> much<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.859> it<00:03:57.980> was<00:03:58.099> like<00:03:58.250> defying

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
just so much and it was like defying

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.819 
just so much and it was like defying
gravity<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.090> going<00:03:59.389> up<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.930> set<00:04:00.169> it<00:04:00.199> down<00:04:00.319> and

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
gravity and going up and set it down and

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.520 
gravity and going up and set it down and
it<00:04:01.160> was<00:04:01.310> really<00:04:01.970> fun<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.180> emulate<00:04:02.629> I<00:04:02.810> just<00:04:03.349> I

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
it was really fun to emulate I just I

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.170 
it was really fun to emulate I just I
thought<00:04:03.829> I<00:04:04.099> liked<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.340> part<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.760> was<00:04:04.910> fun

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
thought I liked that part that was fun

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.150 
thought I liked that part that was fun
you<00:04:06.169> might<00:04:06.290> have<00:04:06.410> noticed<00:04:06.620> like<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.769> little<00:04:07.040> bit

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
you might have noticed like a little bit

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.159 
you might have noticed like a little bit
of<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.310> jump<00:04:07.579> um<00:04:07.849> that<00:04:08.419> was<00:04:08.510> because<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.780> really

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
of a jump um that was because I really

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.259 
of a jump um that was because I really
struggled<00:04:09.590> drawing<00:04:09.919> the<00:04:10.310> monarch<00:04:10.849> butterfly

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
struggled drawing the monarch butterfly

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.550 
struggled drawing the monarch butterfly
that<00:04:11.449> was<00:04:11.569> up<00:04:11.690> on<00:04:11.780> top<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:12.109> her<00:04:12.199> head<00:04:12.379> because

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
that was up on top of her head because

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.890 
that was up on top of her head because
since<00:04:13.519> it<00:04:13.639> was<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:13.879> big<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.359> needed<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.780> make

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
since it was so big I needed to make

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.180 
since it was so big I needed to make
sure<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.199> looked<00:04:15.379> kind<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.680> like<00:04:15.739> an<00:04:15.949> actual

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
sure it looked kind of like an actual

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.550 
sure it looked kind of like an actual
butterfly<00:04:16.699> not<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.269> my<00:04:17.419> weird<00:04:17.930> cartoony

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
butterfly not just my weird cartoony

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.849 
butterfly not just my weird cartoony
ones<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.250> always<00:04:19.459> draw<00:04:19.820> so<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:21.109> actually

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
ones that I always draw so I actually

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.260 
ones that I always draw so I actually
there<00:04:22.159> was<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.280> time<00:04:22.550> when<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:22.760> turned<00:04:23.030> off<00:04:23.240> my

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
there was a time when I turned off my

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.360 
there was a time when I turned off my
screen<00:04:23.870> recording<00:04:24.349> software<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:25.039> I<00:04:25.099> was<00:04:25.250> just

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
screen recording software and I was just

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.830 
screen recording software and I was just
like<00:04:25.520> really<00:04:25.909> trying<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.180> get<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.419> right

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
like really trying to get this right

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.270 
like really trying to get this right
and<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.110> spent<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.350> lot<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.500> time<00:04:27.710> off-camera

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
and I spent a lot of time off-camera

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.550 
and I spent a lot of time off-camera
doing<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.630> then<00:04:29.780> eventually<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.350> just

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
doing that and then eventually I just

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.250 
doing that and then eventually I just
came<00:04:30.680> back<00:04:30.919> and<00:04:31.540> once<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:32.660> was<00:04:32.720> sort<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:32.960> happy

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
came back and once I was sort of happy

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.560 
came back and once I was sort of happy
with<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.470> way<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.650> monarch<00:04:33.980> looked<00:04:34.370> like<00:04:34.580> so

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
with the way the monarch looked like so

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.840 
with the way the monarch looked like so
that's<00:04:36.169> that's<00:04:36.680> what<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:37.040> jump<00:04:37.310> was<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.730> you

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
that's that's what the jump was that you

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.420 
that's that's what the jump was that you
saw<00:04:38.230> then<00:04:39.230> after<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.770> liner<00:04:39.950> was<00:04:40.250> done

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
saw then after that the liner was done

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.420 
saw then after that the liner was done
and<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:41.030> decided<00:04:41.480> to<00:04:41.690> move<00:04:41.840> on<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.919> coloring

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
and I decided to move on to the coloring

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.290 
and I decided to move on to the coloring
and<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.940> gave<00:04:44.360> her<00:04:44.510> like<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.960> really<00:04:45.320> dark<00:04:45.560> almost

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
and I gave her like a really dark almost

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.790 
and I gave her like a really dark almost
well<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.450> really<00:04:47.960> dark<00:04:48.110> brown<00:04:48.350> but<00:04:48.680> it's

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
well it's a really dark brown but it's

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.770 
well it's a really dark brown but it's
like<00:04:48.950> almost<00:04:49.340> black<00:04:49.669> because<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.060> wanted<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.570> to

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
like almost black because I wanted it to

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.560 
like almost black because I wanted it to
like<00:04:51.020> go<00:04:51.290> well<00:04:51.500> with<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.980> dark<00:04:52.400> colors<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.450> the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
like go well with the dark colors on the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.850 
like go well with the dark colors on the
monarch<00:04:53.900> with<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.139> orange<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> black

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
monarch with the orange and the black

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.270 
monarch with the orange and the black
and<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:56.150> was<00:04:56.540> that<00:04:57.020> was<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.139> decent<00:04:57.500> choice<00:04:58.040> I

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
and that was that was a decent choice I

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.490 
and that was that was a decent choice I
think<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.760> worked<00:04:58.940> pretty<00:04:59.150> well<00:04:59.360> then<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.380> just

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
think it worked pretty well then I just

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.379 
think it worked pretty well then I just
had<00:05:00.620> two<00:05:00.740> flat<00:05:00.889> colors<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.490> rest<00:05:01.669> of<00:05:01.940> her

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
had two flat colors to the rest of her

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.969 
had two flat colors to the rest of her
like<00:05:02.750> her<00:05:02.930> skin<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.350> her<00:05:03.410> dress<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.919> her

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
like her skin and her dress and her

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:04.780 
like her skin and her dress and her
shirt

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
shirt

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.480 
shirt
well<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.690> butterflies<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.440> course<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:06.889> had<00:05:07.460> a

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
well and a butterflies of course I had a

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.820 
well and a butterflies of course I had a
little<00:05:07.669> bit<00:05:07.850> of<00:05:07.880> shading<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.870> black<00:05:09.229> parts

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
little bit of shading to the black parts

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.320 
little bit of shading to the black parts
of<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.100> drawing<00:05:10.370> because<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.970> black<00:05:11.150> was

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
of the drawing because the black was

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.570 
of the drawing because the black was
just<00:05:11.540> way<00:05:11.930> too<00:05:11.960> dark<00:05:12.440> with<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:13.040> lineart<00:05:13.280> and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
just way too dark with the lineart and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.520 
just way too dark with the lineart and
it<00:05:13.700> was<00:05:13.790> really<00:05:13.940> blending<00:05:14.419> in<00:05:14.600> so<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:14.990> used<00:05:15.380> like

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
it was really blending in so I used like

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.800 
it was really blending in so I used like
a<00:05:15.560> light<00:05:15.800> gradient<00:05:16.240> added<00:05:17.240> that<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.630> black

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
a light gradient added that to the black

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.350 
a light gradient added that to the black
all<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.650> black<00:05:18.800> sections<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.639> then<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:19.970> added

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
all the black sections and then I added

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.900 
all the black sections and then I added
a<00:05:20.540> bit<00:05:20.660> of<00:05:20.780> shine<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:22.160> butterflies<00:05:22.580> and

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
a bit of shine to the butterflies and

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.350 
a bit of shine to the butterflies and
like<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.419> skirt<00:05:23.889> then<00:05:24.889> I<00:05:25.160> set<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.639> work<00:05:25.790> on<00:05:25.970> the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
like the skirt then I set to work on the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.659 
like the skirt then I set to work on the
wings<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.110> butterfly<00:05:27.229> which<00:05:27.889> were<00:05:28.220> much

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
wings of the butterfly which were much

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.469 
wings of the butterfly which were much
more<00:05:28.940> complicated<00:05:29.479> than<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:30.590> had<00:05:31.010> set<00:05:31.789> myself

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
more complicated than I had set myself

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.279 
more complicated than I had set myself
up<00:05:32.930> for<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.680> don't<00:05:33.860> know<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:35.270> just<00:05:35.810> kept<00:05:35.990> kind<00:05:36.229> of

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
up for I don't know I just kept kind of

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.600 
up for I don't know I just kept kind of
lino<00:05:36.500> trying<00:05:36.890> out<00:05:37.010> some<00:05:37.190> different<00:05:37.220> things

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
lino trying out some different things

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.000 
lino trying out some different things
and<00:05:38.030> trying<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.140> figure<00:05:39.260> out<00:05:39.500> what<00:05:39.800> the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
and trying to figure out what the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.529 
and trying to figure out what the
butterfly<00:05:40.460> looked<00:05:40.789> like<00:05:41.030> I<00:05:41.300> had<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.479> few

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
butterfly looked like I had a few

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.719 
butterfly looked like I had a few
references<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:42.560> was<00:05:42.770> looking<00:05:43.550> back<00:05:43.669> at

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
references that I was looking back at

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.340 
references that I was looking back at
for<00:05:44.060> that

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
for that

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.900 
for that
it<00:05:45.860> turned<00:05:46.070> out<00:05:46.130> pretty<00:05:46.190> well<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:46.490> eventually

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
it turned out pretty well I eventually

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.750 
it turned out pretty well I eventually
realized<00:05:47.510> that<00:05:47.720> using<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:48.380> brush<00:05:48.800> with<00:05:49.190> the

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
realized that using a brush with the

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.270 
realized that using a brush with the
opacity<00:05:50.060> sensitivity<00:05:51.050> on<00:05:51.200> probably<00:05:52.160> wasn't

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
opacity sensitivity on probably wasn't

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.130 
opacity sensitivity on probably wasn't
the<00:05:52.370> best<00:05:52.430> bet<00:05:52.789> so<00:05:52.820> I<00:05:53.030> decided<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.690> just<00:05:53.960> went

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
the best bet so I decided I just went

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.430 
the best bet so I decided I just went
over<00:05:54.320> that<00:05:54.530> again<00:05:54.740> with<00:05:55.250> a<00:05:55.580> solid<00:05:56.180> brush<00:05:56.450> just

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
over that again with a solid brush just

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.520 
over that again with a solid brush just
to<00:05:57.560> make<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.830> colors<00:05:58.130> more<00:05:58.310> vibrant<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:58.970> more

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
to make the colors more vibrant and more

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.659 
to make the colors more vibrant and more
contrasting<00:06:00.530> with<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.770> orange<00:06:01.310> you<00:06:01.460> know<00:06:01.490> the

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
contrasting with the orange you know the

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.129 
contrasting with the orange you know the
black<00:06:01.820> and<00:06:02.030> orange<00:06:02.210> and<00:06:02.570> it<00:06:02.840> looks<00:06:02.990> a<00:06:03.050> lot

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
black and orange and it looks a lot

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.200 
black and orange and it looks a lot
better<00:06:03.200> that<00:06:03.590> way<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:03.740> definitely<00:06:04.490> like<00:06:04.669> that

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
better that way I definitely like that

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.999 
better that way I definitely like that
then<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:07.050> was<00:06:07.139> time<00:06:07.289> to<00:06:07.319> do<00:06:07.530> some<00:06:07.770> kind<00:06:07.979> of

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
then it was time to do some kind of

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.409 
then it was time to do some kind of
background<00:06:08.520> I<00:06:08.639> knew<00:06:08.789> I<00:06:08.819> didn't<00:06:09.060> want<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.300> just

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
background I knew I didn't want to just

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.920 
background I knew I didn't want to just
leave<00:06:09.509> it<00:06:09.870> white<00:06:10.620> and<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:12.180> decided<00:06:12.720> to<00:06:12.810> use<00:06:12.900> some

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
leave it white and I decided to use some

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.700 
leave it white and I decided to use some
purples<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.740> contrast<00:06:14.190> with<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.669> oranges<00:06:15.680> um

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
purples to contrast with the oranges um

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.529 
purples to contrast with the oranges um
turned<00:06:17.340> out<00:06:17.430> pretty<00:06:17.490> good<00:06:17.819> and<00:06:18.150> then<00:06:18.300> I

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
turned out pretty good and then I

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.020 
turned out pretty good and then I
realized<00:06:19.050> that<00:06:19.349> it<00:06:20.220> was<00:06:20.340> just<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.520> little<00:06:20.610> too

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
realized that it was just a little too

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.400 
realized that it was just a little too
boring<00:06:21.270> so<00:06:21.660> I<00:06:21.720> started<00:06:21.990> adding<00:06:22.139> some<00:06:22.349> more

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
boring so I started adding some more

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.140 
boring so I started adding some more
colors<00:06:22.770> and<00:06:22.800> throwing<00:06:23.460> them<00:06:23.580> in<00:06:23.699> there<00:06:23.910> and

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
colors and throwing them in there and

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.120 
colors and throwing them in there and
blending<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.080> together<00:06:25.229> and<00:06:25.740> just<00:06:25.800> trying<00:06:26.039> to

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
blending it together and just trying to

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.080 
blending it together and just trying to
make<00:06:26.190> something<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.669> little<00:06:26.880> bit<00:06:26.970> more

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
make something a little bit more

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.610 
make something a little bit more
interesting<00:06:27.690> in<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:27.840> background<00:06:28.259> than<00:06:28.380> just

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
interesting in the background than just

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.879 
interesting in the background than just
white<00:06:29.220> background<00:06:30.080> it<00:06:31.080> worked<00:06:31.259> pretty<00:06:31.410> well<00:06:31.620> I

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
white background it worked pretty well I

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.129 
white background it worked pretty well I
don't<00:06:32.280> know<00:06:32.460> if<00:06:32.639> I<00:06:32.819> would<00:06:33.210> do<00:06:33.389> it<00:06:33.509> again<00:06:33.690> this

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
don't know if I would do it again this

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.800 
don't know if I would do it again this
way<00:06:34.380> I<00:06:34.620> tried<00:06:35.099> something<00:06:35.430> different<00:06:36.120> but<00:06:36.630> it

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
way I tried something different but it

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.659 
way I tried something different but it
looks<00:06:36.990> pretty<00:06:37.169> cool<00:06:37.319> you<00:06:38.160> know<00:06:38.280> with<00:06:38.520> the

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
looks pretty cool you know with the

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.070 
looks pretty cool you know with the
drawing<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.150> I<00:06:39.210> like<00:06:39.389> that<00:06:39.570> it's<00:06:39.720> not<00:06:39.780> too

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
drawing and I like that it's not too

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.960 
drawing and I like that it's not too
complicated<00:06:40.500> so<00:06:41.099> that<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:41.400> drawing<00:06:41.669> still

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
complicated so that the drawing still

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.629 
complicated so that the drawing still
stands<00:06:42.210> out<00:06:42.419> from<00:06:42.690> it<00:06:42.930> then<00:06:43.560> I<00:06:43.590> just<00:06:43.979> added<00:06:44.400> an

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
stands out from it then I just added an

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.370 
stands out from it then I just added an
adjusted<00:06:45.180> like<00:06:45.330> the<00:06:45.449> hue<00:06:45.630> and<00:06:45.780> saturation<00:06:45.810> of

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
adjusted like the hue and saturation of

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.480 
adjusted like the hue and saturation of
the<00:06:46.440> whole<00:06:46.620> drawing<00:06:46.889> and<00:06:47.190> some<00:06:47.340> of<00:06:47.430> the

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
the whole drawing and some of the

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.550 
the whole drawing and some of the
contrast<00:06:48.030> and<00:06:48.330> the<00:06:48.389> levels<00:06:48.870> and<00:06:49.110> things<00:06:49.320> just

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
contrast and the levels and things just

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.650 
contrast and the levels and things just
because<00:06:50.130> it<00:06:50.460> wasn't<00:06:50.699> standing<00:06:51.180> out<00:06:51.300> quite

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
because it wasn't standing out quite

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.689 
because it wasn't standing out quite
enough<00:06:51.900> from<00:06:52.139> the<00:06:52.289> background<00:06:52.680> and<00:06:52.860> I<00:06:53.430> didn't

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 
enough from the background and I didn't

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.719 
enough from the background and I didn't
like<00:06:53.849> that<00:06:53.880> there<00:06:54.300> was<00:06:55.190> out<00:06:56.190> all<00:06:56.430> the<00:06:56.520> colors

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
like that there was out all the colors

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.149 
like that there was out all the colors
just<00:06:56.759> sort<00:06:57.000> of<00:06:57.030> mushed<00:06:57.240> together<00:06:57.800> that<00:06:58.800> was<00:06:58.949> it

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 
just sort of mushed together that was it

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.430 
just sort of mushed together that was it
