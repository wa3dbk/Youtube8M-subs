 find and 24 cents 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.440

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.259
 Phalle in the special variant though 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.940

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920

 Josef and since has these cowardly Sun. 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.360
 a small crunchy effect stands 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.920
 so on the map and you can 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.870
 also very nice to use for cooking 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.700
 or just to eat sausages and yes 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.140
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.030
 Hope you follow the followers of the loud 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.200
 I really like to show my love and taste 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.910
 in the wind, looking forward to the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.770
 combination simply with the essence 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.660
 it just wanted what is what you look for 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.880
 so there every day and I have something 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.500
 now specially never eaten and one 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.060
 Just always enjoy trying 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.800
 Incidentally, this is also in original size 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.930
 with 200 milliliters 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.670
 and it costs 45 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.980
 then I had a super great product 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.370
 in my box and that's it 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.680
 here 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.600
 I first thought it would be and smoothie 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.220
 just wanted to flip it down so 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.050
 I always like something you like 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.610
 but luckily once there and carefully 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.650
 I read that as a read once 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.080
 that it is here from the marked rainbow 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.600
 the taste purple with barry 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.070
 and great and that's 100 percent 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.530
 fruit and vegetables that's one 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.970
 concentrate and you can use that 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.400
 if you are looking for specific products 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.170
 to refine for example 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.239
 natural yoghurt or certain puddings 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.850
 even if you mix fruit juices 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.380
 or mixed or year for smoothies to 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.910
 example, you can use that well 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.560
 you really only really need it 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.019
 very little time like they said 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.000
 concentrate is and I think that will 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.730
 that can last for a long time is 100 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.560
 milliliter and that costs 14 euros 90 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.870
 yes, these are eleven different fruit and 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.430
 Vegetables with in it and me sounds 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.709
 In any case very interesting to video 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.660
 says Barry and break is also determined 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.390
 delicious taste and in the swim 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.950
 even if I can try it out yes 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.930
 then we come to the next one 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.000
 products from my box and that are 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.660
 Of course, these two here are without 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.430
 rubber box cry again 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.750
 what I have this month very exciting 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.210
 find that it is simply a 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.650
 bottle is how we are used to 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.210
 but that is now from the market 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.550
 could esswein and that's easy 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.350
 twice as packing here 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.600
 maybe just for a glass of wine that 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.520
 are each 100 millimeters in there and 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.320
 I think that's very interesting too 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.850
 very nice for the road so the box 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.430
 Now he is also a picnic box 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.930
 as I have read and I think that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.209
 at least take a picnic for 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.340
 Also a whole bottle of wine with that way 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.350
 you can just drink out and afterwards 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.420
 Dispose of and yes I like 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.470
 said very exciting than 100 milliliters 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.210
 are in it 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.160
 the names of the memory now times that 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.140
 the sayings I would be there 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.300
 do totally stupid I think that's why he 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.860
 I think you can read that well below 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.510
 as I said two pieces I think there 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.830
 in it and there will cost a pack ever 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.720
 a 250th 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.640
 then we come to the absolute 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.130
 highlight in my opinion and that 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.570
 is it this ham here you become 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.890
 Now ham in the gum wonder 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.320
 really was a bit first 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.150
 But when I am surprised then the proud 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.450
 I have been to the price very often 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.610
 I have to say that is now the cinco 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.080
 dias or yes, I would do that now 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.930
 of course I do not know if 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.690
 I do the right thing and 60 grams 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.180
 in it and the proud to cost 21 euros 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.010
 have seen and loved him for this gripping 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.720
 yes I eat super hams I like 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.550
 also totally like serrano ham with 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.800
 melon that tastes super super good 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.260
 and to send Slavic costs I think 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.630
 for 100 grams or 80 grams for the two 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.190
 euro and i am mostly there already 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.260
 too stingy because the vines are super fast 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.360
 is demanded away and long ham for 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.980
 Of course, 21 euro is really mine 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.720
 I'm so excited and I'm really excited 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.310
 how that will taste so there must be 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.419
 really great for that 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.070
 price I think 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.990
 and it closes you a best time 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.180
 little bit before water on the map 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.130
 and that is the best 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.070
 ibérico hams the ham 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.900
 master of 5 years with the nutty aroma 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.400
 Eichel leads around and they were in 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.590
 Slices cut by hand 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.240
 yes I have a little bit more for that 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.280
 read extended information 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.310
 you always get like that 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.320
 snack with the line rubber boxer 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.970
 concept ideas get to the individual 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.650
 products or more 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.090
 Information or shield has just something 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.190
 also on the ham with it 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.110
 As I said, the animals are the pigs 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.200
 with acorns lined to the 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.240
 bring special nutty aroma and yes 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.950
 it just finished very very high and 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.139
 I'm really looking forward to the test 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.760
 yes you can always write me if 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.740
 you also subscribed to the box and that 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.889
 I've already tried it 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.270
 the money is worth and as I said I am 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.970
 already super excited on the 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.590
 ham and in my opinion 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.750
 really the top product especially 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.460
 for the price and then we will come 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.740
 already for the last putt I read in my 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.180
 box had us is that here knows the 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.100
 would most of you know that 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.930
 it would be easy for her to brush 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.550
 You can use marinated meat 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.950
 wants to collect before it applies to 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.660
 for example or longer cookies 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.340
 Bakes and the eggs with egg yolk 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.160
 Of course it always wants to brush 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.540
 Unfortunately ours is not very practical 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.220
 that's why it's so beautiful 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.600
 Mom totally pleased about this here 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.510
 now go straight to the kitchen 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.120
 this is from the mark becky endicott 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.669
 brush is called becky and is from the brand 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.010
 the temptation is and the year 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.590
 costs 8 95 so again a very 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.810
 high quality brush and yes that was it 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.430
 even with my rubber box I
