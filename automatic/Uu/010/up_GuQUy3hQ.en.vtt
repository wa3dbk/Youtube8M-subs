00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.010 
other crazy ridiculous game plays it's
always<00:02:10.619> been<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.640> don't<00:02:12.270> see<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> day

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
always been like that I don't see a day

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.930 
always been like that I don't see a day
friends<00:02:13.230> from<00:02:13.410> back<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.770> days<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.580> I

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
friends from back in the days and now I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.520 
friends from back in the days and now I
guess<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> only<00:02:15.540> difference<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.380> of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
guess the only difference I can think of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.590 
guess the only difference I can think of
right<00:02:16.590> now<00:02:16.830> would<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.850> now<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.270> very

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
right now would be that now it's very

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.770 
right now would be that now it's very
easy<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.080> find<00:02:19.410> bad<00:02:20.130> players<00:02:20.580> especially<00:02:21.390> when

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
easy to find bad players especially when

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.560 
easy to find bad players especially when
your<00:02:21.930> KD<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.470> low<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.070> back<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> days<00:02:24.360> you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
your KD is low and back in the days you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.540 
your KD is low and back in the days you
had<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.840> use<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.260> lobby<00:02:25.680> surfing<00:02:26.190> method

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
had to use the lobby surfing method

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.780 
had to use the lobby surfing method
which<00:02:26.850> basically<00:02:27.300> was<00:02:28.040> players<00:02:29.040> going<00:02:29.430> around

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
which basically was players going around

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.150 
which basically was players going around
quitting<00:02:30.450> out<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.720> every<00:02:31.050> lobby<00:02:31.290> instead<00:02:32.040> of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
quitting out of every lobby instead of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.650 
quitting out of every lobby instead of
killing<00:02:32.400> yourself<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> heavy<00:02:33.180> lobby<00:02:33.450> you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
killing yourself in heavy lobby you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.080 
killing yourself in heavy lobby you
would<00:02:33.780> quit<00:02:34.020> out<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:35.070> every<00:02:35.370> lobby<00:02:35.610> until

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
would quit out out of every lobby until

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910 
would quit out out of every lobby until
you<00:02:36.180> find<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> perfect<00:02:36.900> lobby<00:02:37.290> where<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.770> can

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you find the perfect lobby where you can

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.990 
you find the perfect lobby where you can
drop<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.250> double<00:02:38.580> Moab<00:02:39.470> double<00:02:40.470> nuclear<00:02:41.130> hunter

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
drop a double Moab double nuclear hunter

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.570 
drop a double Moab double nuclear hunter
plus<00:02:42.270> or<00:02:42.810> whatever<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.530> gameplay<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:43.950> that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
plus or whatever the gameplay was that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.970 
plus or whatever the gameplay was that
you<00:02:44.670> wanted<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.090> go<00:02:45.270> for<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.740> keep<00:02:46.860> on

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
you wanted to go for you just keep on

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.200 
you wanted to go for you just keep on
backing<00:02:47.280> out<00:02:47.370> backing<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.760> backing<00:02:48.090> out

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
backing out backing out backing out

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.630 
backing out backing out backing out
until<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.870> got<00:02:49.110> those<00:02:49.350> perfect<00:02:49.920> opponents

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
until you got those perfect opponents

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.450 
until you got those perfect opponents
that<00:02:50.850> are<00:02:50.910> brain<00:02:51.510> dead<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:53.010> me<00:02:53.160> it's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
that are brain dead so to me it's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.640 
that are brain dead so to me it's
basically<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.030> similar<00:02:54.540> concept<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.260> reverse

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
basically a similar concept to reverse

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.530 
basically a similar concept to reverse
boosting<00:02:56.250> reverse<00:02:56.610> boosting<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.270> makes<00:02:57.450> it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
boosting reverse boosting just makes it

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.930 
boosting reverse boosting just makes it
easier<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.960> find<00:02:58.260> those<00:02:58.500> newbie<00:02:58.890> lobbies<00:02:59.310> but

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
easier to find those newbie lobbies but

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.480
