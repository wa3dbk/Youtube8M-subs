Mayweather<00:00:59.969> has<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.420> fight<00:01:00.660> step<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:00.989> his

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
Mayweather has to fight step on his

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
Mayweather has to fight step on his
contract<00:01:01.520> he<00:01:02.520> has<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.910> fight<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.420> he<00:01:03.719> has

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
two more tries to fight so what I think

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.810 
two more tries to fight so what I think
boxing<00:01:06.119> might<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.040> make<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.580> fight

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
boxing might do is make this this fight

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
boxing might do is make this this fight
a<00:01:08.970> draw<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.570> they'll<00:01:10.080> make<00:01:10.290> pack<00:01:10.799> yah

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
a draw and they'll make pack yah

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.410 
a draw and they'll make pack yah
probably<00:01:11.340> win<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> next<00:01:11.760> fight<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.299> then

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
probably win the next fight and then

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
probably win the next fight and then
Mayweather<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.229> try<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> make<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.830> win

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
Mayweather that's try to make them win

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.249

you<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.680> saying<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.420> one<00:01:18.420> reason

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you know what I'm saying so one reason

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
you know what I'm saying so one reason
why<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> cuz<00:01:19.619> boxing<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
why I think like that cuz boxing it is a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.280 
why I think like that cuz boxing it is a
sport<00:01:21.030> bad<00:01:21.210> end<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> day<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
sport bad end of the day it is a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
sport bad end of the day it is a
business<00:01:22.770> also<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.240> probably

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
business also so that's what probably

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.910

on what things are gonna win but if

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.430 
on what things are gonna win but if
anything<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.520> think<00:02:51.550> mayor<00:02:51.940> has<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.690> best

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
anything I think mayor has the best

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.110 
anything I think mayor has the best
opportunity<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.100> get<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.280> knockout<00:02:54.700> reset<00:02:55.000> of

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
opportunity to get a knockout reset of

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.210 
opportunity to get a knockout reset of
khaki<00:02:55.360> out<00:02:55.630> cuz<00:02:55.930> mayor<00:02:56.380> there<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.980> taller

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
khaki out cuz mayor there is the taller

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.970 
khaki out cuz mayor there is the taller
opponent<00:02:57.880> he's<00:02:58.240> bigger<00:02:58.600> has<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.290> longer<00:02:59.650> reach

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
opponent he's bigger has a longer reach

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.820 
opponent he's bigger has a longer reach
so<00:03:00.370> he<00:03:01.030> has<00:03:01.210> he<00:03:01.450> has<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.720> more<00:03:01.930> opportunity<00:03:02.740> to

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so he has he has the more opportunity to

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.620 
so he has he has the more opportunity to
get<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:02.980> knockout<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.520> fight<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:04.090> mean<00:03:04.510> I'm

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
saying so he's 47 to know for a reason

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.620 
saying so he's 47 to know for a reason
so<00:03:08.710> it's<00:03:08.950> kind<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.280> hard<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.970> know<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.210> blow<00:03:10.510> it
