00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.180
 now I want to share this recipe 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.120
 I'm going to put more of a light dinner 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.060
 ideas of things that I like to have dinner 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.580
 since it is important that at night not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.490
 Eat your strong food so you can 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.640
 rest better and this what we're going to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 use will be the chayotes in others 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.460
 countries that say stem is I those 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 I know how chayote is what I did 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.710
 I cooked a little bit and took away the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.409
 shell because you know that the shell is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.500
 I know half fibrous and now what we have 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:46.290
 what to do is scratch the because I'm going to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.659
 prepare a pasta truth we are going to 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.799
 Grate or you can use your processor 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:56.280
 This food serves very well as you see it 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:01:00.199
 the strips are left like that, that's what 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.199
 let's do with the 2 chayotes 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.979
 then since you have the chayote 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.430
 grated the only thing you're going to do 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:13.330
 How do you get like spaghetti? 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.479

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.600
 very very tasty then what are we going to 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.150

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.720
 since we have the chayote we are going to 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.119
 decorate with some mushrooms the 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.900
 mushrooms I like to wash them with 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.130
 cold water and dry them 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.720
