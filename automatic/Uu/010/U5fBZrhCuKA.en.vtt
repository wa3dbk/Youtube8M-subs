we've<00:00:01.500> been<00:00:01.620> building<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:02.100> 2014<00:00:03.030> Nissan<00:00:03.389> GTR

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
we've been building the 2014 Nissan GTR

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.740 
we've been building the 2014 Nissan GTR
gt3<00:00:04.589> ready<00:00:05.100> for<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.370> seasons<00:00:05.790> races<00:00:06.150> if<00:00:06.600> you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
gt3 ready for the seasons races if you

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.330 
gt3 ready for the seasons races if you
want<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.960> see<00:00:07.080> how<00:00:07.170> we<00:00:07.230> did<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:07.560> click<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
want to see how we did it click on the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
want to see how we did it click on the
link<00:00:08.490> below<00:00:08.610> but<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.719> time<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.990> make<00:00:10.110> it

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
link below but now it's time to make it

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:19.359 
link below but now it's time to make it
look<00:00:10.320> like<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> race<00:00:10.710> car<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.370> wraps<00:00:11.550> being<00:00:18.230> the

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
look like a race car the wraps being the

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.140 
look like a race car the wraps being the
design<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:21.300> today<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.470> Nissan<00:00:22.949> GTR<00:00:23.150> as

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
design for today to do the Nissan GTR as

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.240 
design for today to do the Nissan GTR as
it<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> very<00:00:25.140> much<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> white<00:00:25.619> car<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.010> minute

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
it is very much a white car as a minute

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
it is very much a white car as a minute
it's<00:00:40.940> similar<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.090> master<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.170> essentially

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it's similar for master but essentially

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.160 
it's similar for master but essentially
it<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.399> new<00:00:44.550> livery<00:00:44.910> every<00:00:45.690> season<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> new

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it is a new livery every season as a new

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.250 
it is a new livery every season as a new
design<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.800> make<00:00:46.950> an<00:00:47.070> impression<00:00:47.370> day<00:00:48.230> today<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
design to make an impression day today I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.069 
design to make an impression day today I
think<00:00:49.710> I'll<00:00:49.829> fully<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.250> doing<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.840> for<00:00:51.840> five

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
think I'll fully be doing this for five

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.930 
think I'll fully be doing this for five
hours<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.559> me

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
hours for me

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.360 
hours for me
so<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> big<00:00:54.750> job<00:00:57.949> yeah<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> follow<00:00:59.219> me

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so it's a big job yeah the follow me

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
so it's a big job yeah the follow me
using<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.210> XS<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.780> got<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> EZ<00:01:01.890> apply

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
using is the XS it's got the EZ apply

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
using is the XS it's got the EZ apply
grading<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> probably<00:01:02.940> can't<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.420> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
grading on it you probably can't see it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
grading on it you probably can't see it
but<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.799> basin<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.369> grid<00:01:05.489> form

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
but it's like a basin and grid form

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
but it's like a basin and grid form
between<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> glue<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.540> when<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.020> when<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> RC

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
between the glue so when and when the RC

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
between the glue so when and when the RC
applying<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.970> disperse<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.659> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
applying it the I can disperse there is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
applying it the I can disperse there is
gap<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.220> essentially<00:01:11.700> makes<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
gap so it kind of essentially makes a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.190 
gap so it kind of essentially makes a
problem<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.840> coordinate

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
problem for it it's coordinate

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:37.940 
problem for it it's coordinate
affordable<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> there

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.340 

for<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> giant<00:01:39.430> class<00:01:39.640> not<00:01:40.060> really<00:01:41.020> tricking

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
for the giant class not really tricking

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.870 
for the giant class not really tricking
it's<00:01:41.500> always<00:01:42.009> nice<00:01:42.189> but<00:01:42.430> piece<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.729> leather

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
it's always nice but piece of leather

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.219 
it's always nice but piece of leather
you're<00:01:43.060> working<00:01:43.420> on<00:01:43.509> citron<00:01:44.520> fall<00:01:45.520> over<00:01:45.850> East

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you're working on citron fall over East

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.570 
you're working on citron fall over East
once<00:01:47.229> you've<00:01:47.350> got<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.560> cut<00:01:47.830> lines<00:01:48.039> is<00:01:48.310> fine

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
once you've got the cut lines is fine

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.450 
once you've got the cut lines is fine
and<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:50.170> decide<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.470> take<00:01:50.679> a<00:01:50.740> bit<00:01:50.979> busted

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
and you decide to take a bit busted

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.370 
and you decide to take a bit busted
license<00:01:51.819> it's<00:01:51.970> always<00:01:52.569> to<00:01:52.780> try<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.020> make<00:01:53.200> it

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
license it's always to try to make it

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.239 
license it's always to try to make it
work<00:01:54.030> yeah<00:01:55.030> far<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:55.659> good

done finishing touches are going on

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.460 
done finishing touches are going on
there<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.630> around<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> front<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> car

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
there just around the front of the car

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.589 
there just around the front of the car
now<00:02:26.650> it's<00:02:27.580> not<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.849> bonnet<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.300> bumper

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599

and then we should be good to go at the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:47.320 
and then we should be good to go at the
track

there's<00:02:59.470> one<00:02:59.650> place<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.610> say<00:03:00.850> looking

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
there's one place I like to say looking

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:28.140 
there's one place I like to say looking
pretty<00:03:01.390> good<00:03:01.540> huh

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.880 

well<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.870> all<00:03:28.959> intents<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.319> purposes<00:03:29.709> it's

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
finished there's still new more bits and

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.720 
finished there's still new more bits and
