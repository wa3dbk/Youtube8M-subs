00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
tweak called I sounds in there actually

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.609 
tweak called I sounds in there actually
what<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.939> can't<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.390> called<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.869> sounds<00:01:49.439> it'll

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
what we can't be called I sounds it'll

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
what we can't be called I sounds it'll
be<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> long<00:01:50.280> code<00:01:50.729> type<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
be like a long code type thing that you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
be like a long code type thing that you
guys<00:01:51.750> won't<00:01:51.899> understand<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
guys won't understand but that but that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460 
guys won't understand but that but that
is<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.909> sounds<00:01:54.540> once<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> downloaded<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
is I sounds once you downloaded that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
is I sounds once you downloaded that
tweak<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> restrung<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.430> device<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.880> will

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
tweak and restrung your device it will

tweak and restrung your device it will
say<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> styles<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.840> cydia<00:01:58.110> alright<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.979> once

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
say I styles in cydia alright so once

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.760 
say I styles in cydia alright so once
you<00:01:59.189> guys<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.520> downloaded<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.119> sounds

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
you guys have downloaded I sounds

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.630 
you guys have downloaded I sounds
basically<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> you'll<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> little

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
volume up rocker buttons and once you on

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.960 
volume up rocker buttons and once you on
what<00:02:10.890> would<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.310> what<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.580> want<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.819> do

is actually what this tweak does is it
adds<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.980> little<00:02:14.280> sounds<00:02:14.730> from<00:02:15.030> from

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
adds just little sounds from from

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.440 
adds just little sounds from from
previous<00:02:16.290> os's<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.459> there<00:02:17.880> are<00:02:17.970> sounds<00:02:18.330> for

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
previous os's like there are sounds for

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.559 
previous os's like there are sounds for
mac<00:02:18.660> OS<00:02:18.870> 9<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.830> next<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.640> newton<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.390> there's

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
mac OS 9 the next the newton and there's

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
currently on the Newton sounds so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.170 
currently on the Newton sounds so
basically<00:02:28.950> out<00:02:29.069> when<00:02:29.430> i<00:02:29.519> open<00:02:29.730> an<00:02:29.819> app<00:02:30.000> that's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
basically out when i open an app that's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.860 
basically out when i open an app that's
what<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.540> sounds<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.569> guys<00:02:33.720> may

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
your device it sounds really cool like

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.800 
your device it sounds really cool like
when<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.900> open<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.500> folder<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:42.390> has<00:02:42.569> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
when I open up a folder it has that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.059 
when I open up a folder it has that
sounded<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.319> does<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> same<00:02:43.680> thing<00:02:43.920> when<00:02:44.040> I

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
sounded it does the same thing when I

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.509 
sounded it does the same thing when I
when<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.730> closed<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.150> folder<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.989> then

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
when I closed a folder and then

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.089 
when I closed a folder and then
basically<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.530> wanted<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.920> delete<00:02:50.190> app<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
basically on if I wanted to delete app I

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.839 
basically on if I wanted to delete app I
click<00:02:53.099> on<00:02:53.220> it

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.160 

that's<00:02:57.849> what<00:02:58.000> comes<00:02:58.180> up<00:02:58.360> at<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.959> nice

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
that's what comes up at this is a nice

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.320 
that's what comes up at this is a nice
little<00:02:59.349> effect<00:03:00.130> sounds<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.730> once<00:03:01.239> you

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
little effect sounds and once you

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.880 
little effect sounds and once you
actually<00:03:01.510> enter<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.020> app<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.709> actually

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
actually enter the app you can actually

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.070 
actually enter the app you can actually
test<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.270> once<00:03:04.450> you've<00:03:04.599> respawn<00:03:04.959> your

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
test it out so once you've respawn your

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.170 
test it out so once you've respawn your
device<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.349> can<00:03:05.620> click<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.040> again<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:07.030> can

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
device you can click on it again you can

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.240 
device you can click on it again you can
put<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.510> compressed<00:03:07.900> test<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.950> can<00:03:09.099> do

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
put a compressed test and you can do

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.800 
put a compressed test and you can do
stuff<00:03:09.430> some<00:03:09.790> sort<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.060> things<00:03:10.270> like<00:03:10.480> some<00:03:10.690> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
stuff some sort of things like some of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.110 
stuff some sort of things like some of
them<00:03:10.900> control<00:03:11.349> basically<00:03:11.980> like<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.459> text

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
them control basically like the text

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.750 
them control basically like the text
look<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.840> sobs<00:03:14.050> new<00:03:14.290> text<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:15.520> case

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
look like the sobs new text in this case

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.130 
look like the sobs new text in this case
it's<00:03:16.000> just<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.420> just<00:03:16.540> stays<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.930> same<00:03:17.080> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
it's just it just stays the same and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.300 
it's just it just stays the same and
like<00:03:17.440> right<00:03:17.709> here<00:03:17.830> if<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:17.980> click<00:03:18.130> on
