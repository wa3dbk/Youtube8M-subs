00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 there are so mysterious places in our 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.990
 planet earth that is not even the same 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.940
 science has managed to decipher what 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.150
 strange events happen in these 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.820
 places 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.820
 these are the most terrifying places and 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 mysterious of the earth 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 although at least they were in 2003 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.000
 the bridge of or scotland in mid 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 of the 20th century for some strange reason 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.669
 the dogs or the dogs that passed by 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.640
 this bridge looked out and they launched 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.100
 of the bridge the people who lived near 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.320
 of this bridge they did not know and understood the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.410
 why dogs usually get 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.420
 commit suicide 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.300
 the versions of the few people who 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.580
 they got to see why they write 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.890
 that dogs looked out from the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.379
 bridge to see rats or see some class 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.510
 of object under the bridge they succeeded and 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.329
 they threw and some dogs of them 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.179
 they managed to survive 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.559
 and forget and they went up the bridge just to 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.559
 go back to throw one more time 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.510
 he knows nothing more about 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.300
 the unknown bridge as the killer of 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.880
 cheer up 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.980
 sure you've already managed to hear 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.920
 about the village is simple 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.510
 which is located in the mountains 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 over this village there are many hypotheses 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.270
 but it is known by the name of 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.250
 cemetery of the stoppages for some reason 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.320
 during the month of August the birds that 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.810
 they pass near this place they divert their 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.490
 trajectory two people believe they are 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.800
 by the phenomena by the anomalies 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.970
 physical but has not been clarified 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.090
 what happens in this place 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.660
 for some strange reason the birds fall 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.640
 dead alone in this place is like 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.160
 if there was something that will kill them when 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.420
 they are paying over this place 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.420
 it's the outside 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.790
 there is a forest that surely does not 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.100
 You know what the forest is like and how it is 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.570
 known as the suicidal forest because a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.070
 from 1950 they say that more than 500 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.340
 people took their lives in this 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.870
 place is something weird is so weird that the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.540
 most people who enter 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.250
 this forest have more suicide do 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.620
 things that we would not do 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.260
 we are rope just go to the entrance 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.920
 that was so much the thing so many 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.170
 people who hung who had 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.240
 to put up posters that remind them of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.730
 visitors who have to think about 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.500
 loved ones everywhere there 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.320
 notices with phone numbers of 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.150
 psychological cabinets so that people 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.880
 do not commit suicide in this place is something 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.530
 super weird something that does not happen in the ordinary 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.930
 something that science has not achieved 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.659
 explain 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.129
 the Galician cndr marín quin edinburgh in 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.420
 Scotland about 400 years ago 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.310
 the alley was one of the places of 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.210
 those typical where people tend 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.030
 go take pictures with your family 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.000
 the busiest places of that 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.050
 city but for some strange reason a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.880
 day almost without warning 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.770
 city ​​was shaken by a pyramid of 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.940
 something big plague 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.460
 then the legend tells that what 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.890
 they did to avoid panic in this 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.510
 zone or in this city was to carry all 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.720
 the people who were infected at 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 alley and deprive them of the help just 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.270
 they took people to the alley that 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.700
 they were sick and they forgot 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.320
 they were like an area where they died 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.560
 the people who were infected with 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.900
 said disease since there was no cure 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.760
 receive leaving without further help from 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.840
 outside are people left 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.820
 abandoned 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.980
 then the alley forgets hugo 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.620
 as well as the death alley as 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.740
