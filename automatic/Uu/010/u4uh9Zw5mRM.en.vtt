00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.059
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.469
 welcome to the 5 x 1 point and as he says 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.070
 in the title welcome to a video 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.710
 where will I show more or less my 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.600
 points of view with which you might create 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.820
 hopes those you are waiting for 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.949
 an ipod touch or any of the others 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.410
 iPod models in the keynote of this 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.400
 Thursday I know you are many and I know that 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.589
 Many of you are asking me and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.380
 we watch to see an ipod touch in this 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.450
 keynote there you are seeing 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.240
 the conference that was made in September 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.610
 from 2012 year where the iphone 5 o went 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.430
 rather they presented the iphone 5 where 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.620
 they presented itunes 11 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.320
 it is important to emphasize that itunes 11 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.790
 and where they presented the last ipod that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.550
 we know and they are still for sale 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.370
 for many of the fifth-touch ipod touch 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.910
 generation let's see an ipod touch- of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.940
 sixth generation in the event of thursday 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.440
 on the theory we could say that no 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.869
 they did not present it with the new iphones 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.350
 as is tradition but there you are seeing 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.350
 just the ipod poster plus itunes 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.820
 that is one of the points that invites me to 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.530
 think that we could see some new 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 ipod in this keynote we go by part 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.479
 let's analyze Paul's invitation 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.159
 to the event there you are seeing the poster in 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.020
 the one who says it's been too long 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.509
 remember is the literal translation to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.479
 text that makes clear that we can 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.909
 govern several things between them to 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.549
 It has been too long since 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.590
 they released some products the ipod touch 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.159
 As I say the last one was released in 2012 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.979
 almost three years ago practically 2014 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.530
 2013 2012 that is to say this would be the third 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.190
 year if they do not throw it we would be in 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.330
 ipod touch so I think he plays 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.210
 also in the invitation I put back 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.030
 the poster is a colorful invitation is 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.490
 an invitation that gives me to think oysters 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.050
 the apple device that has happened 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.909
 too much time without updating has 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.710
 so many colors 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.379
 I can only think of the ipod touch- 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.179
 truth or the ipod in agreement I say 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.129
 touch because I know it's the one you're most 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.019
 Wishing everyone but understand what I 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.790
 I mean in general 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.930
 clear we analyze colors of the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.290
 invitation the famous poster also about 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.299
 no secret in the hypothesis one of 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.250
 the most punished devices in the 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.010
 sales and in the income of apple in the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.500
 last years less than 1 percent in 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.090
 the last in the last report of 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.980
 apple income what are the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.709
 pretty depressing income for a 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.120
 device so then this is the year 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.579
 renewed or die 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.190
 I do not know if you know that expression is to say 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.959
 yes to paul seeing that the ipod touch is 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.360
 in fall coat do not renew it this year 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.180
 we are definitely before the end of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.400
 Ipod life is saying this Thursday 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.109
 We will see what ipod awaits you if you do not 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.640
 I renewed already that they are not going to renew it and 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.260
 It's about time you started 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.819
 users who do not save you 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.340
 you could afford to buy an iphone 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.500
 and start thinking if you want to continue 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.170
 ios 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.420
 the iphone is your option would be a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.430
 but certainly worth the time and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.550
 then something else said it before 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.960
 itunes ipod a new version of itunes 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.720
 has always been accompanied by 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.060
 new ipod in the case of the previous 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.980
 Ipod generation was accompanied by 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.570
 itunes 11 together with the iphone 5 this year 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.850
 the iphone was not presented with any 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.860
 version of itunes but they decided 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.280
 monopolize the element with the nickname watch 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.500
 Maybe that 's the perfect excuse for 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.630
 be able to hope that with the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.900
 new itunes 12 that comes out this year 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:44.550
 we can see the new ipod two years ago 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.250
 years there are 211 and ipod touch two years 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.810
 then it can be there you have 12 that 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.450
 It is safe 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.430
 and ipod touch I do not know these are a bit 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.830
 my impressions of course I already say yes 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.650
 They do not release this year certainly no longer 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.450
 I think they throw it I never feel so 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.010
 cruel with some users that you have 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.349
 hope to see it but well I think 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.540
 that at the moment has given several clues that 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.840
 invite to think something optimism is not 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.849
 say in the possibility of seeing it because 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.650
 in the end it is a device very punished 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.900
 for the sale of smartphones will have to be 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.880
 see the price that you have because from 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.650
 then the qualities of an ipod touch 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.630
 no longer does any smartphone in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.400
 today so for my part 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.710
 guys, I hope I cheered you up 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.139
 little those who have to wait for that 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.940
 little bit of hope and nothing you already know 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.220
 Thursday we will be live commenting 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.200

 five for one so that we hope already 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.460

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.960
