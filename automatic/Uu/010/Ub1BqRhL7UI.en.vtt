00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.830 

there<00:03:39.930> here's<00:03:40.500> your<00:03:40.829> dough<00:03:41.599> now<00:03:42.599> at<00:03:42.720> this

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
there here's your dough now at this

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.990 
there here's your dough now at this
point<00:03:43.109> most<00:03:43.439> recipes<00:03:43.680> will<00:03:44.099> tell<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.519> to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
point most recipes will tell you to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.460 
point most recipes will tell you to
chill<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.390> dough<00:03:45.420> before<00:03:45.959> rolling<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.319> out

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
chill the dough before rolling it out

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.530 
chill the dough before rolling it out
and<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.579> where<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:47.849> method<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.329> bit

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
and this is where my method is a bit

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.110 
and this is where my method is a bit
different<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.109> roll<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.799> up<00:03:49.920> right<00:03:50.190> now<00:03:50.370> soft<00:03:50.909> as

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
different I roll it up right now soft as

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.240 
different I roll it up right now soft as
it<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.269> between<00:03:52.019> two<00:03:52.230> sheets<00:03:52.409> of<00:03:52.769> parchment

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
it is between two sheets of parchment

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.000 
it is between two sheets of parchment
paper<00:03:53.629> which<00:03:54.629> allows<00:03:55.139> me<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.500> make<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> very

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
paper which allows me to make a very

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.849 
paper which allows me to make a very
thin<00:03:56.459> layer<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.819> dough<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.540> then<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.290> fill<00:03:58.680> the

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
thin layer of dough and then I fill the

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.289 
thin layer of dough and then I fill the
whole<00:03:59.040> layer<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.430> dough<00:03:59.579> so<00:03:59.609> I<00:03:59.879> have<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> very

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
whole layer of dough so I have a very

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.780 
whole layer of dough so I have a very
crisp<00:04:00.889> dome<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.069> cut<00:04:02.250> out<00:04:02.340> when<00:04:02.459> they<00:04:02.579> cooking

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
crisp dome to cut out when they cooking

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.510 
crisp dome to cut out when they cooking
cookie<00:04:03.209> cutters
