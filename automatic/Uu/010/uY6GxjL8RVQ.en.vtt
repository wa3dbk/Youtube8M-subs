00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.300
So, as Josh was just saying,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.170
what's distinctive about
human intelligence

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.110
is not just its speed or capacity,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.920
but our ability to go beyond the
visible statistics of our environment

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.990
to infer the hidden causes
that explain what we see.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.290
So only one of these pictures
of wild flowers makes you infer

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.260
the presence of an invisible person.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.320
And similarly, when we see
something complicated or surprising,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.110
the invisible cause
we most often infer

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.620
is another person
or at least another mind.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.800
So think about crop circles
or intelligent design or, my favorite,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.700
an??? word that means

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.110
someone seen from a far off
and blamed for otherwise

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.110
inexplicable circumstances.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.060
So in a real sense human intelligence
is intelligence about humans.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.050
And correspondingly, if you look
inside the brain of a human adult,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.890
you find that in addition to the
older brain regions that we share

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.560
with other animals and that we use for
seeing, hearing, feeling,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.730
and for controlling our movements,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.330
humans also have another
distinctive set of brain regions

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.430
that we’re only discovering now
through modern or imaging technology,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.360
and whose functions are
specifically related to other people,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.310
to recognizing their faces and voices,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.410
seeing their actions and
understanding their emotions.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.210
And perhaps most surprisingly
is the brain region I study,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.970
a small brain region above
and behind your right ear

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.650
called the right temporal-parietal
junction or RTPJ for short,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.320
whose function is specifically related
to understanding other minds,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.430
people’s thoughts, beliefs,
desires, and intentions.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.580
This data come from a group
we call normal human adults.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.100
They’re MIT undergraduates.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.710
So this capacity to think about
other people’s minds

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.010
is a distinctive feature
of human intelligence

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.730
and it helps to explain why computers
could beat human opponents at chess

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.710
so many years before they could
beat them at poker

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.500
and why a human five-year old child
would still beat a computer

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.470
at understanding the plot of
Little Red Riding Hood.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.050
Or to give you another example
that’s maybe more --

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.870
World Economic Forum, compare
what a computer does when it solves

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.600
the complex differential equation
that describes a financial market

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.200
to what you do if you hear
Alan Greenspan say,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.900
"I know you think you understand
what you thought I said,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880
"but I’m not sure you realize that
what you heard was not what I meant."

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.230
So on all of these cases,
the ability to understand another mind

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.750
is the glue that binds together
our societies, our social relationships,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.880
and our families, which is why
its loss can be so devastating

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.010
to children with autism
and their families.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.460
So in minor research
we’re designing experiments

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.830
that allow us to measure
this human capacity.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.070
For example, we tell people stories.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.900
I’m gonna give you an example
right now.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.200
Grace is making a cup of coffee
for her friend and next to the coffee

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.170
is a jar of a white powder
which is just regular sugar.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.980
But because the powder is labeled
toxic poison,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.510
Grace thinks the powder is toxic poison
and she puts it in her friend’s coffee.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.810
Was that morally permissible?

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.990
So, hopefully, you think no,
and most adults, when we asked them,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.100
say no, it wasn’t permissible,
because she thought it was poison

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.660
even though it was really just sugar.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.160
And while they’re making that judgment

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.260
we see activities specifically in this
brain region and the amount of activity

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.020
in this brain region lets us predict
which moral judgment they’ll make.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.700
I’m also interested in how this
brain region matures in childhood,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.300
because if you ask similar questions
to children, you get different answers.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.470
Three-year olds and even five-year olds
will tell you there’s nothing wrong

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.980
with what Grace did
because nothing bad happened

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.620
and it’s not until children are seven that
they start to give the adult-like answer

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.920
that it was wrong because
she thought it was poison

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.490
even though nothing bad happened
in the end.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.760
And even in adults if we temporarily
disrupt function in this brain region

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.770
by passing a magnetic pulse
through their skull with the tool called

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.800
transcranial magnetic stimulation,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.770
we can temporarily change
the moral judgments that they make

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.180
making them more like the younger
children shifting attention away from

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.810
Grace’s thoughts and intentions
and towards the actual consequences.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.520
So recently I’ve also been interested
in how similar processes happen

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.190
outside the lab.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.320
How we use our RTPJ to decide
who’s honest or dishonest,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.790
who to blame and who to forgive
or when something bad happens,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.560
who was responsible based on
what they knew and when they knew it.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.290
I’m also interested in how
we use the same systems

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.660
to make decisions about
our own actions.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.900
I mean, just recent research in
psychology suggests that when people

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.870
are deciding whether to cheat
or whether to be corrupt,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.770
they’re paying attention not only
to the economic incentives

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.570
or the chance of being caught,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.980
but what they think
other people are doing,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.230
whether they think other people are
doing it, and also to their self concept,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.220
how the action will appear
to themselves.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.620
And then, finally, for me,
the research challenges

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.870
to connect these questions
with all the other themes in this issue

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.790
to understand how a group of nuns
wired together in a connectome

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.630
can construct something as abstract
as the idea of another mind.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.180
On the other hand, what happens
when you get many brains like this

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.550
linked together
all thinking about each other,

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.410
what new levels of complexity emerge?

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.540
And that’s the theme
of the next two talks.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.120
Thank you.
