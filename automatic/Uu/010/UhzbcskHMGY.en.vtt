don't know if these things bite or what
they<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.310> believe<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.820> aren't<00:00:30.000> any

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.080 
they do I believe there aren't any
leeches<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> UK<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> live<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.399> humans

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
leeches in the UK that live on humans

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.709 
leeches in the UK that live on humans
but<00:00:33.329> still<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.320> worrying<00:00:35.719> now

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
but still it's a little bit worrying now

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
but still it's a little bit worrying now
I'm<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:36.989> sure<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.410> likes<00:00:37.649> being<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
I'm not sure if it likes being out of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979 
I'm not sure if it likes being out of
the<00:00:38.489> water<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.210> I'd<00:00:39.510> better<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the water so I think I'd better put it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.150 
the water so I think I'd better put it
back<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.350> there

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.080 

here<00:00:47.790> we<00:00:48.030> go

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.399

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
size of that that is enormous now I've

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.969 
size of that that is enormous now I've
had<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> look<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.270> these<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.840> these<00:01:19.170> leeches

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
had a look into these and these leeches

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.030 
had a look into these and these leeches
are<00:01:20.700> totally<00:01:21.420> harmless<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.409> live<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.710> little

ones that lived on frogs on newts butt

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
ones that lived on frogs on newts butt
and<00:01:29.940> snails<00:01:30.420> especially<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.049> I've<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.290> lots

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.350 
and snails especially as I've got lots
nails<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.580> isn't<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.119> just

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
nails in there but it isn't it just

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
nails in there but it isn't it just
lives<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:34.020> tiny<00:01:34.200> worms<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.070> little

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
lives on little tiny worms and little

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.230 
lives on little tiny worms and little
tiny<00:01:35.520> insects<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.899> doesn't<00:01:37.229> bite<00:01:37.410> at<00:01:37.740> all

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
tiny insects so it doesn't bite at all

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
tiny insects so it doesn't bite at all
here's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.300> closer<00:01:39.630> look<00:01:39.929> every<00:01:40.679> time<00:01:40.830> I<00:01:40.890> find

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
here's a closer look every time I find

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.499 
here's a closer look every time I find
something<00:01:41.460> new<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:41.820> always<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.300> it<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
something new I always put it in a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.090 
something new I always put it in a
container<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> few<00:01:43.440> minutes<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.979> get

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
container for a few minutes so I can get

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
container for a few minutes so I can get
a<00:01:44.130> proper<00:01:44.550> look<00:01:44.700> at<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.509> make<00:01:45.659> sure<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.929> know

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
a proper look at it to make sure I know

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649 
a proper look at it to make sure I know
exactly<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:47.970> identify<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
exactly what it is I can identify it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.940 
exactly what it is I can identify it
again<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.619> also<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:50.190> see<00:01:51.000> how<00:01:51.179> it<00:01:51.240> behaves

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
again and also see see how it behaves

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
again and also see see how it behaves
I'm<00:01:52.950> surprised<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.580> can't<00:01:53.789> see<00:01:54.000> eyes<00:01:54.179> on<00:01:54.539> this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
I'm surprised I can't see eyes on this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.450 
I'm surprised I can't see eyes on this
but<00:01:55.050> it<00:01:55.140> does<00:01:55.500> seem<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> know<00:01:56.069> that<00:01:56.280> it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
but it does seem to know that it's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
but it does seem to know that it's
trapped<00:01:56.819> it<00:01:57.659> obviously<00:01:58.050> wants<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.530> back

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
trapped it obviously wants to get back

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.610 
trapped it obviously wants to get back
out

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.190 

I'm<00:02:02.400> gonna<00:02:02.520> quickly<00:02:02.940> put<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:03.360> fingers<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.930> just

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.520 
I'm gonna quickly put my fingers in just
to<00:02:04.470> reassure<00:02:05.370> myself<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.230> going

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
