00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.859
 hello and welcome to my gsm highlights today i will make you a 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.910
 little video tutorial on how to change the graphical interface of the dirty 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.069
 remember them 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.509
 so past a touchwiz hours interface 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.780
 it gets me drunk but with the widgets you can put the shot at will 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.370
 communism on the screen 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.769
 at the microsoft classic interface of great common causes devotes itself to it 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.089
 So to do this you first have to see by Mike Golding a lot 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.069
 less management of southern countries 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.290
 as you wish from the one you want 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.400
 do you mock difficult home that counts that two lines of the way 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.620
 next 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.770
 we see first on sherlock and trades 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.070
 this is then 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 we go down on safety 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.140
 so we go down on security that's it 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.190
 then we change we go directly art 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.140
 not wrong and to change paris sitting 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.590
 to zero instead of 20 points once it's done 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.500
 the short term 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.230
 the registry editor no need to recruit the product for theft 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.930
 for this to be taken into account 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.360
 so then you go to the start menu 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.740
 so we can see is a second parameter that appeared so 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.160
 the main 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.930
 with them it sucks me this one gaÃ«lle the one we just added 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.330
 parameter so far 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.360
 in this one allows you to change the scale of things 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.600
 everything lets discover them as we go on today we will linger 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.950
 only the graphical interface so we are in settings 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 so here we are in a new basket 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.990
 with them with the game again the balloon today the alarm panel 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.500
 clock I'm even more you see there the blues all the ringtones and the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.920
 customization and so on so we will linger on not 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.590
 today no here it is 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.560
 so I give you several themes that are predefined 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.770
 for that I'm going to touch it's just an hour 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.230
 the color chart of the products so that does not interest me 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.110
 on the other hand we will linger body not so much this one 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.550
 bakou we click on 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.270
 then 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.470
 paul maholm several tasks that allow us to 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.149
 to change the volume the GUI 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.619
 so here we see he talks to us too much 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.039
 the slab the thought all this appears on the screen is all the time in this 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.679
 convoy 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:25.869
 percent of his budget more consequent the interface that I know is that it does not 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.279
 are that next few months 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.279
 corinne is displayed on the control screen of course choose 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.329
 what we want to display a good game to the foot for a rise by default 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.999
 at the finish by the touch 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.969
 precisely that's it 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.549
 so logically no modification 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.729
 and per cent and we will just go out tact and that's it's magic 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.729
 new century new interface so not these leaks 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.819
 so very happy I prefer social besides personally for little we get 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.549
 found something much faster to use icloud interface 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.559
 a little slower 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.399
 so it went away that all that is needed can be added 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.839
 as much as we want arthur is an application that I will explain by 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.769
 following on the site 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.909
 which we envy we imagine to have widely shown images we have 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.679
 little arrows we can move 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:18.589
 let's see a bit of shine move me directly by clicking on it 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.889
 an officer 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.689
 see his lawyer 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.039
 without any problem we arrive at any time 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.859
 the same interface 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.819
 own classics the purpose of the system of that it would include a little in all 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:32.979
 the builders 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.629
 to go out so we also have access to our images which you can set 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.649
 all this so the date if I have to change my arrival I just have to 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.699
 click on here we are on the classic interface that we have forgiveness 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.959
 too much to use 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.199
 much more friendly and much more so much more beautiful I find that 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.489
 big budgets however neither by his knee 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.169
 for now if you ever have a few days it's a little tutorial 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.590
 video music photo 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.489
 for their part the five posts send me an email if they ever do things 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.200
 also i was not clear there it was nicolas to eat his points 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.379
 low
