00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
marks that had some scream washing
they're<00:01:11.330> simpler<00:01:12.650> there<00:01:13.650> they're<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.220> spruce

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
they're simpler there they're all spruce

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.539 
they're simpler there they're all spruce
there<00:01:14.880> might<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.619> some<00:01:16.619> masking<00:01:17.009> tape<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
there might be some masking tape as you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.270 
there might be some masking tape as you
can<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.150> put<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> appropriate<00:01:20.810> runner

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
can see I put the the appropriate runner

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.289 
can see I put the the appropriate runner
number<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.939> we're<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
number on there so that we're just

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.749 
number on there so that we're just
easier<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:25.200> rather<00:01:25.830> than<00:01:26.040> try<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> find

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
easier to see rather than try to find

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.929 
easier to see rather than try to find
the<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.600> small<00:01:27.900> rule<00:01:28.170> number<00:01:28.470> that's<00:01:29.340> multi<00:01:29.790> D

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the the small rule number that's multi D

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.300 
the the small rule number that's multi D
but<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:35.729> got<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> end<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.040> these<00:01:38.040> are

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
but we got there in the end so these are

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.220 
but we got there in the end so these are
literally<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.150> ready<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.509> painting

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
literally all ready for painting

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.060 
literally all ready for painting
so<00:01:41.030> what<00:01:42.030> else<00:01:42.150> did<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.480> do<00:01:42.780> regarding<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.800> work

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
so what else did I do regarding my work

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.760 
so what else did I do regarding my work
in<00:01:44.310> progress<00:01:44.900> one<00:01:45.900> thing<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.260> didn't<00:01:46.560> like

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
in progress one thing I didn't like

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.630 
in progress one thing I didn't like
really<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.210> much<00:01:48.390> about<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> kit<00:01:49.050> was<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
really that much about the kit was the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.260 
really that much about the kit was the
fuel<00:01:50.640> tanks<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.480> lack<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> detail<00:01:53.270> even

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
fuel tanks and the lack of detail even

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.180 
fuel tanks and the lack of detail even
the<00:01:54.630> fuel<00:01:54.840> tanks<00:01:55.230> there<00:01:55.410> was<00:01:55.500> basically<00:01:55.860> not

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
the fuel tanks there was basically not

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.940 
the fuel tanks there was basically not
so<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> decided<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.830> got<00:01:59.730> myself<00:02:00.950> my
