the moat or per se in the old medieval

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.990 
the moat or per se in the old medieval
times<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.500> moats<00:04:04.500> now<00:04:04.799> they<00:04:05.069> upgraded<00:04:05.879> them

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
times but moats now they upgraded them

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.789 
times but moats now they upgraded them
not<00:04:06.150> too<00:04:06.449> long<00:04:06.599> ago<00:04:06.900> they<00:04:07.290> used<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.560> be<00:04:07.620> very

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
not too long ago they used to be very

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.199 
not too long ago they used to be very
easy<00:04:07.889> to<00:04:08.159> get<00:04:08.220> through<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:08.669> nobody<00:04:09.000> actually

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
easy to get through so nobody actually

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.860 
easy to get through so nobody actually
put<00:04:09.510> them<00:04:09.629> down<00:04:10.099> but<00:04:11.099> they<00:04:11.159> increased<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
put them down but they increased the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.379 
put them down but they increased the
amount<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.680> time<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.129> takes<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.430> shovel<00:04:15.269> them

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
amount of time it takes to shovel them

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.080 
amount of time it takes to shovel them
up<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:15.900> decrease<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.620> amount<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.909> can

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
up but decrease the amount of you can

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.420 
up but decrease the amount of you can
have<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:19.109> before<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.680> could<00:04:19.859> have<00:04:20.010> as<00:04:20.159> many<00:04:20.310> as

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
have so before you could have as many as

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.949 
have so before you could have as many as
you<00:04:20.519> want<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:21.120> they<00:04:21.389> cost<00:04:21.659> more

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
you want but they cost more

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.050 
you want but they cost more
cost<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.470> 20<00:04:22.830> gold<00:04:23.039> each<00:04:23.310> each<00:04:24.240> tile<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:26.060> it's

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
cost you 20 gold each each tile so it's

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.980 
cost you 20 gold each each tile so it's
500<00:04:27.930> tiles<00:04:28.560> only<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.190> can<00:04:29.370> have<00:04:29.720> moat<00:04:30.720> around

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
500 tiles only you can have moat around

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.710 
500 tiles only you can have moat around
your<00:04:31.560> castle<00:04:31.949> so<00:04:32.280> choose<00:04:32.550> wisely<00:04:32.759> um<00:04:33.150> it's

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
your castle so choose wisely um it's

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.230 
your castle so choose wisely um it's

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
just to put out around your your moat

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.300 
just to put out around your your moat
but<00:04:36.990> that's<00:04:37.199> not<00:04:37.530> that's<00:04:37.740> for<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.949> castle

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
but that's not that's for a castle

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.830 
but that's not that's for a castle
building<00:04:38.520> techniques<00:04:38.970> that's<00:04:39.240> which<00:04:39.449> can<00:04:39.750> be

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
building techniques that's which can be

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.700 
building techniques that's which can be

but<00:04:43.710> as<00:04:43.860> it's<00:04:44.190> getting<00:04:44.340> near<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:45.000> clothes

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
but as it's getting near to the clothes

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.029 
but as it's getting near to the clothes
there's<00:04:46.680> not<00:04:46.919> much<00:04:47.190> left<00:04:48.440> depending<00:04:49.440> on<00:04:49.650> if

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
there's not much left depending on if

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.499 
there's not much left depending on if
the<00:04:50.400> swordsmen<00:04:51.030> are<00:04:51.300> on<00:04:52.940> attack<00:04:53.940> or<00:04:54.120> defense

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
the swordsmen are on attack or defense

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.710 
the swordsmen are on attack or defense
so<00:04:55.050> attacking<00:04:55.380> defenses<00:04:56.099> a<00:04:56.419> strategy<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:57.570> can

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
so attacking defenses a strategy you can

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.760 
so attacking defenses a strategy you can
use<00:04:57.780> on<00:04:58.259> your<00:04:58.490> defending<00:04:59.490> your<00:04:59.610> castle<00:05:00.080> if<00:05:01.080> you

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
use on your defending your castle if you

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.670 
use on your defending your castle if you
choose<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.460> defend<00:05:03.000> your<00:05:03.660> dives<00:05:04.320> will<00:05:04.530> not

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
choose to defend your dives will not

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.270 
choose to defend your dives will not
move<00:05:04.919> and<00:05:05.190> stop<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:06.349> opposing<00:05:07.349> force<00:05:07.590> but

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
move and stop the opposing force but

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.520 
move and stop the opposing force but
they'll<00:05:08.460> protect<00:05:08.880> as<00:05:09.150> much<00:05:09.360> as<00:05:09.479> they<00:05:09.570> can<00:05:09.630> but

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
they'll protect as much as they can but

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.379 
they'll protect as much as they can but
if<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.680> have<00:05:10.889> them<00:05:11.009> on<00:05:11.220> offense<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.759> what<00:05:12.060> run

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
if you have them on offense the what run

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.719 
if you have them on offense the what run
up<00:05:12.539> as<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:13.259> think<00:05:13.409> it's<00:05:13.620> four<00:05:13.830> or<00:05:13.860> five<00:05:14.099> tiles<00:05:14.370> if

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
up as I think it's four or five tiles if

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.089 
up as I think it's four or five tiles if
they're<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.180> range<00:05:15.389> of<00:05:15.599> the<00:05:16.380> enemy

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
they're in the range of the enemy

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.800 
they're in the range of the enemy
they'll<00:05:17.340> walk<00:05:17.550> up<00:05:17.789> and<00:05:17.970> start<00:05:18.030> attacking<00:05:18.389> and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
they'll walk up and start attacking and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.080 
they'll walk up and start attacking and
start<00:05:19.259> plugging<00:05:19.500> holes<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.220> making<00:05:20.759> them<00:05:20.849> get

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
start plugging holes and making them get

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.390 
start plugging holes and making them get
slower<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.720> which<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:22.710> smart<00:05:23.009> technique

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
slower and which is a smart technique

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.279 
slower and which is a smart technique
but<00:05:23.729> also<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.330> can<00:05:24.509> lose<00:05:24.720> all<00:05:24.870> your<00:05:24.930> troops

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
but also you can lose all your troops

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.649 
but also you can lose all your troops
that<00:05:25.440> are<00:05:25.560> sitting<00:05:25.830> in<00:05:25.979> that<00:05:26.099> one<00:05:26.310> area<00:05:26.509> so<00:05:27.509> if

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
that are sitting in that one area so if

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:28.939 
that are sitting in that one area so if
you<00:05:27.780> have<00:05:27.870> them<00:05:28.020> all<00:05:28.139> in<00:05:28.169> offense<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.770> can

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
you have them all in offense you can

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.409 
you have them all in offense you can
someone<00:05:29.280> can<00:05:29.520> draw<00:05:29.699> them<00:05:29.880> out<00:05:30.000> in<00:05:30.150> another

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
someone can draw them out in another

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.460 
someone can draw them out in another
false<00:05:31.050> attack<00:05:31.440> or<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.710> ruse<00:05:32.039> and<00:05:33.080> make<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.199> lose

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
false attack or a ruse and make you lose

places but they're very defensively good

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.580 
places but they're very defensively good
because<00:07:18.180> they<00:07:18.300> plug<00:07:18.569> the<00:07:18.750> hole<00:07:18.930> outside<00:07:19.080> and

because they plug the hole outside and

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.680 
because they plug the hole outside and
they're<00:07:19.710> very<00:07:19.860> strong<00:07:20.190> so<00:07:20.940> it<00:07:21.270> takes<00:07:21.509> them<00:07:21.630> a

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
they're very strong so it takes them a

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.689 
they're very strong so it takes them a
while<00:07:21.720> to<00:07:21.930> get<00:07:22.259> down<00:07:22.470> so<00:07:22.830> it<00:07:22.919> takes<00:07:23.069> about<00:07:23.159> five

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 
while to get down so it takes about five

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.409 
while to get down so it takes about five
six<00:07:24.120> full-size<00:07:24.750> full<00:07:25.229> health<00:07:25.440> units<00:07:25.860> of

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 
six full-size full health units of

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.719 
six full-size full health units of
pikemen<00:07:27.419> or<00:07:27.539> swordsmen<00:07:28.520> swordsmen<00:07:29.520> are

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:29.729 
pikemen or swordsmen swordsmen are

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.149 
pikemen or swordsmen swordsmen are
faster<00:07:30.240> units<00:07:30.569> that<00:07:30.780> actually<00:07:31.620> attack<00:07:31.860> really

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:32.159 
faster units that actually attack really

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.120 
faster units that actually attack really
fast<00:07:33.020> but<00:07:34.020> on<00:07:34.229> the<00:07:34.349> other<00:07:34.440> hand<00:07:34.560> pikeminnow

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.130 
fast but on the other hand pikeminnow

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.770 
fast but on the other hand pikeminnow
very<00:07:35.400> strong<00:07:35.729> and<00:07:36.000> they<00:07:36.060> have<00:07:36.150> a<00:07:36.180> lot<00:07:36.360> of<00:07:36.389> armor

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 
very strong and they have a lot of armor

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.909 
very strong and they have a lot of armor
so<00:07:37.440> in<00:07:37.740> contrary<00:07:38.900> swordsman's<00:07:39.900> are<00:07:40.199> faster

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 
so in contrary swordsman's are faster

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.149 
so in contrary swordsman's are faster
and<00:07:40.949> won't<00:07:41.430> beat<00:07:41.940> them<00:07:42.090> down<00:07:42.240> faster<00:07:42.780> but

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:43.159 
and won't beat them down faster but

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:46.159 
and won't beat them down faster but
pikemen<00:07:44.159> can<00:07:44.280> last<00:07:44.490> longer<00:07:44.849> and<00:07:45.210> stay<00:07:45.990> in<00:07:46.080> the

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:46.169 
pikemen can last longer and stay in the

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:47.420 
pikemen can last longer and stay in the
fight<00:07:46.320> longer<00:07:46.560> but<00:07:46.830> they<00:07:46.919> don't<00:07:47.130> have<00:07:47.280> the

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.430 
fight longer but they don't have the

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.439 
fight longer but they don't have the
best<00:07:47.909> attack<00:07:48.240> compared<00:07:48.780> to<00:07:49.130> swordsmen<00:07:50.449> i'll

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449 
best attack compared to swordsmen i'll

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:53.240 
best attack compared to swordsmen i'll
increase<00:07:51.750> the<00:07:51.900> speed<00:07:52.110> again<00:07:52.259> so<00:07:52.860> we<00:07:52.949> can<00:07:53.099> get<00:07:53.190> a

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.250 
increase the speed again so we can get a

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.939 
increase the speed again so we can get a
little<00:07:53.550> bit<00:07:53.669> farther<00:07:53.789> done<00:07:54.150> I<00:07:54.530> do<00:07:55.530> end<00:07:55.830> up

00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:55.949 
little bit farther done I do end up

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:59.149 
little bit farther done I do end up
doing<00:07:56.190> this<00:07:56.280> well<00:07:56.580> just<00:07:57.740> sadly<00:07:58.740> enough<00:07:58.919> that<00:07:59.130> I

00:07:59.149 --> 00:07:59.159 
doing this well just sadly enough that I

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:01.640 
doing this well just sadly enough that I
had<00:07:59.310> to<00:07:59.400> i<00:07:59.729> got<00:08:00.150> plugs<00:08:00.509> so<00:08:01.080> there's<00:08:01.320> a<00:08:01.380> little

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:01.650 
had to i got plugs so there's a little

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.670 
had to i got plugs so there's a little
hole<00:08:01.830> here<00:08:02.180> the<00:08:03.180> all<00:08:03.569> the<00:08:03.990> bars<00:08:04.229> are<00:08:04.409> lighting

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 
hole here the all the bars are lighting

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.159 
hole here the all the bars are lighting
up<00:08:04.770> here<00:08:05.039> but<00:08:05.340> I<00:08:05.370> see<00:08:06.000> now<00:08:06.120> I'm<00:08:06.300> slowly<00:08:06.870> but

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:07.169 
up here but I see now I'm slowly but

00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:09.110 
up here but I see now I'm slowly but
surely<00:08:07.199> moving<00:08:07.680> up<00:08:07.889> they<00:08:08.250> slowly<00:08:08.639> but<00:08:08.940> truly

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 
surely moving up they slowly but truly

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.800 
surely moving up they slowly but truly
get<00:08:09.360> killed

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:09.810 
get killed

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.899 
get killed
they<00:08:10.380> focus<00:08:10.770> on<00:08:10.860> the<00:08:10.979> closest<00:08:11.340> one<00:08:11.490> to<00:08:11.580> the<00:08:11.610> key

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:11.909 
they focus on the closest one to the key

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:16.309 
they focus on the closest one to the key
so<00:08:12.569> there<00:08:12.719> you<00:08:12.810> go<00:08:13.130> 34,000<00:08:14.130> honor<00:08:14.370> I<00:08:14.750> will<00:08:15.750> show

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 
so there you go 34,000 honor I will show

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:19.190 
so there you go 34,000 honor I will show
