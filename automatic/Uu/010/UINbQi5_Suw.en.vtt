00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.440
 for this first masculine style Carlos 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.670
 lourido begins by parading and cutting 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.670
 razor the area of ​​temples 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.539
 we take the next section and cut 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.539
 in the same way with the knife 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.570
 let's tear with the knife for 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.469
 get a slight parade at a time 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.469
 that we give the long 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.010
 we give the base to the birth zone 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.010
 of nape 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.560
 we separated a section of this area and the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.890
 we tear with the knife to give him the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.890
 long 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.610
 we are taking successive sections in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.610
 diagonal to give them the long 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.510
 we perform the same operation on the side 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.880
 contrary 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.600
 we are taking sections lightly 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 oblique to cut with the knife 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.009
 we separate the hair with the comb 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.229
 we hold the section between the fingers 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.900
 pulling the strap back and 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.110
 tear with the knife on the side 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.090
 we started the cut by the temple area 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.200
 we will move the cut back 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.210
 cutting the hair in its natural fall 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.039
 in the crown area we take a 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.130
 slightly oblique section and the 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.509
 we cut with the knife we are joining the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.649
 measurements of the neck area with the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.649
 hair from the upper area 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.650
 we separate the next section of the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.840
 high area we take with a first wick 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.200
 and we tear it with the knife to give it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200
 the long 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 let's also join the hair of the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.009
 upper zone with the measures of the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.009
 lateral 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.920
 we give the length to the bangs area 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.500
 let's give the length to the whole area 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.060
 superior holding the hair between 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.560
 fingers and pulling him tight towards 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.560
 go ahead to tear it with the knife 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.410
 we just gave the length to the area 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.410
 fringe 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.840
 then we made the neck area 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.970
 raising sections of hair with 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.810
 Comb and light nibbling with the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.810
 toothed scissors 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.370
 we continue to lighten the style by 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.370
 side area 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.480
 we perform the same operation in the area 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.480
 higher 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.060
 We clean the area of scissors 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.220
 neck births 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.110
 we review all the sections cut 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.440
 slightly oblique to join all the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.440
 areas 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.360
 we give birth to nape births 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.030
 we cleaned and we just defined the area 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.030
 of temples and temple 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.290
 we reduce the area from temples to comb and 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.290
 scissors 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.080
 we review the area by sections 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.080
 vertical 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.569
 we reviewed the measures of the area of 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.569
 Crown by horizontal sections 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.300
 we are eliminating the remaining tips of 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.710
 the upper zone working by 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.710
 slightly oblique sections 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.080
 we walked with the scissors the area of 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.080
 bangs to give a lot of movement 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.270
 we cleaned and we just defined the area 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.270
 of the blade with the knife 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.669
 Once the cut is finished we will make a 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.199
 color process in this case we have 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.489
 made some wicks from the area of 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.589
 crown to the front area 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:05:00.009
 applying a blonde tone and a tone 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.009
 copper 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.740
 Once the color is achieved we will take out 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.810
 fingers and we will give a few touches of gel 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.270
 we see in these planes the result that 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.630
 we have obtained a young male look and 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.630
 current 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.939
 ah 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.449
 ah 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.449
 ah 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.130
 we can get a different image 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.199
 applying gel to give the hair a 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.680
 Wet look and get a more look 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.680
 cool
