vent<00:04:59.760> in<00:04:59.909> the<00:05:00.090> front<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.539> then<00:05:00.750> you

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
vent in the front and then you

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.439 
vent in the front and then you
cinch<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.740> line<00:05:01.949> down<00:05:02.220> through<00:05:02.250> this<00:05:02.729> holder

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
cinch the line down through this holder

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.210 
cinch the line down through this holder
right<00:05:03.599> here<00:05:03.659> so<00:05:04.080> again<00:05:04.199> just<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.800> nice<00:05:04.949> basic

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
right here so again just a nice basic

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.820 
right here so again just a nice basic
functional<00:05:05.789> piece<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.240> then<00:05:06.659> you<00:05:07.080> know<00:05:07.199> for

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
functional piece and then you know for
