00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.310 
recently and the main reason why he got
it<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.710> because<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.310> really<00:00:17.670> cheap<00:00:17.940> and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
it is because it was really cheap and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.300 
it is because it was really cheap and
the<00:00:19.320> reason<00:00:19.529> why<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.680> was<00:00:19.830> cheap<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.279> because

the reason why it was cheap is because

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370 
the reason why it was cheap is because
the<00:00:20.789> front<00:00:21.180> door<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.750> panel<00:00:22.050> wouldn't

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
these machines it's not a big problem or

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.040 
these machines it's not a big problem or
not<00:00:27.990> such<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> big<00:00:28.800> issue<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:30.060> far<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.750> part

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
but trying to get everything apart and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
but trying to get everything apart and
put<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.059> back<00:00:33.149> together<00:00:33.510> that's<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.380> hard

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
put it back together that's the hard

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.250 
put it back together that's the hard
part<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> ever<00:00:36.840> find<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
part here so if you ever find a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.200 
part here so if you ever find a
Panasonic<00:00:37.440> Q<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> Panasonic<00:00:39.000> Q

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
Panasonic Q or if you have a Panasonic Q

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.790 
Panasonic Q or if you have a Panasonic Q
and<00:00:39.450> when<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.750> turn<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.410> can't<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and when you turn it on you can't to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.590 
and when you turn it on you can't to
open<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> think<00:00:42.300> will

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
open it up this one I think will

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.690 
open it up this one I think will
probably<00:00:43.020> open<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.680> I've<00:00:43.860> done<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
probably open up because I've done it a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.900 
probably open up because I've done it a
couple<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:45.030> times<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> did<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.340> if

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
couple of times what what I did is if

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.369 
couple of times what what I did is if
you<00:00:48.030> don't<00:00:48.210> want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> scratch<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> panel<00:00:49.170> here

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
you don't want to scratch the panel here

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.340 
you don't want to scratch the panel here
just<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> piece<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.219> thin<00:00:50.579> plastic<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:52.050> pry

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
just use a piece of thin plastic to pry

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.040 
just use a piece of thin plastic to pry
on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.739> door<00:00:52.949> too<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:54.420> give<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> little<00:00:54.840> bit

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
on the door too to give it a little bit

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
on the door too to give it a little bit
of<00:00:55.140> tension<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.770> force<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.090> main

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
of tension to force it out and the main

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.639 
of tension to force it out and the main
reason<00:00:57.270> why<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.719> want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.350> is

can see here this belt right here this
thing<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.049> bit<00:01:19.200> blurry

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
thing is going to be a little bit blurry

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
thing is going to be a little bit blurry
but<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> belt<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.400> down<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.479> over

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
but this belt that's down here this over

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.700 
but this belt that's down here this over
time<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.530> develop<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
time will develop a little bit of a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.950 
time will develop a little bit of a
round<00:01:25.710> spot<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> pulleys

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
round spot in it from one of the pulleys

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.770 
round spot in it from one of the pulleys
and<00:01:28.250> it'll<00:01:29.250> harden<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.090> what

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and it'll harden that way so what

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
and it'll harden that way so what
happens<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> press<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.890> eject<00:01:32.700> button

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
happens when you press the eject button

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.319 
happens when you press the eject button
is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.450> it'll<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.530> spin<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> slip<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
is that it'll just spin and slip as you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.730 
is that it'll just spin and slip as you
can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.380> one's<00:01:37.590> quite

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
can see this one here this one's quite

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.380 
can see this one here this one's quite
dirty<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> inside<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.790> well<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.240> got

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
dirty on the inside as well it's got

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.910 
dirty on the inside as well it's got
like<00:01:39.600> lots<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.320> dust

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
like lots of dust

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.700 
like lots of dust
lots<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.479> fuzz<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.649> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.219 
lots of fuzz I don't know what this is
but<00:01:44.189> yeah<00:01:44.549> what's<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.299> lots<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.810> stuff<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
but yeah what's up lots of stuff on the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.980 
but yeah what's up lots of stuff on the
inside<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> gears<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> bottom<00:01:48.659> here

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
inside and the gears on the bottom here

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
inside and the gears on the bottom here
as<00:01:49.140> well<00:01:49.490> if<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.210> flip<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.630> its

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
as well if we kind of flip it on its

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.130 
as well if we kind of flip it on its
side<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.119> teeth<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
side you can see the teeth here on the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.289 
side you can see the teeth here on the
bottom<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.340> happens<00:01:56.729> over<00:01:56.820> time<00:01:56.939> as

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
bottom but what happens over time as

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.359 
bottom but what happens over time as
these<00:01:57.450> things<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> dry<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.280> you

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
these things get kind of dry so what you

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
these things get kind of dry so what you
want<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.909> add<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:00.899> grease<00:02:01.500> or

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
want to do is add some grease or

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.800 
want to do is add some grease or
something<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.490> teeth<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> bottom

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
something to these teeth at the bottom

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450 
something to these teeth at the bottom
and<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.469> will<00:02:04.560> help<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> open<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.310> little

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and that will help it to open a little

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.690 
and that will help it to open a little
bit<00:02:05.549> easier<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.310> common

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
bit easier but this is one common

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.639 
bit easier but this is one common
problem<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.390> things<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.619> really

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
problem with these things it's a really

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.920 
problem with these things it's a really
small

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
small

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.929 
small
issue<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.590> as<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.129> see<00:02:13.189> I<00:02:13.370> mean<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.790> can

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
issue and as you can see I mean you can

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.819 
issue and as you can see I mean you can
see<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.239> belt<00:02:14.420> from<00:02:14.659> here<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.620> biggest

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
see the belt from here but the biggest

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.679 
see the belt from here but the biggest
problem<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.549> can't<00:02:16.790> replace<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.480> from

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
problem is you can't replace it from

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.179 
problem is you can't replace it from
here<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.079> main<00:02:18.230> reason<00:02:18.560> why<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.739> because<00:02:18.890> of

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
here the main reason why is because of

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.250 
here the main reason why is because of
this<00:02:19.370> white<00:02:19.610> gear<00:02:19.939> that's<00:02:20.360> laying<00:02:21.019> in<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
this white gear that's laying in the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.839 
this white gear that's laying in the
back<00:02:21.439> here<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:21.980> one's<00:02:22.189> actually<00:02:22.579> pinned

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
back here that one's actually pinned

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.850 
back here that one's actually pinned
down<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.689> you<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.959> remove<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.439> you<00:02:24.680> have

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
down so you have to remove that you have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.190 
down so you have to remove that you have
to<00:02:24.980> remove<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:26.239> belt<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.689> then<00:02:26.780> put<00:02:26.989> in<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
to remove the the belt and then put in a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.199 
to remove the the belt and then put in a
new<00:02:27.349> belt<00:02:27.590> sometimes<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.609> can<00:02:28.730> find<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:29.030> belt

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
new belt sometimes you can find a belt

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.569 
new belt sometimes you can find a belt
at<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> hardware<00:02:29.870> store<00:02:30.019> or<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.250> could<00:02:31.400> take<00:02:31.519> it

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
at a hardware store or you could take it

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.020 
at a hardware store or you could take it
out<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.819> an<00:02:31.970> old<00:02:32.090> VCR<00:02:33.700> trying<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.760> think<00:02:34.939> of

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
out of an old VCR trying to think of

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.500 
out of an old VCR trying to think of
what<00:02:35.150> else

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
what else

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.960 
what else
sometimes<00:02:36.170> even<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> plumbing<00:02:37.220> sections<00:02:37.730> at

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
sometimes even the plumbing sections at

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.000 
sometimes even the plumbing sections at
a<00:02:38.090> hardware<00:02:38.420> store<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.019> can<00:02:39.260> find<00:02:39.290> rubber

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
a hardware store you can find rubber

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.729 
a hardware store you can find rubber
gaskets<00:02:40.609> that<00:02:40.819> are<00:02:41.120> kind<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.629> thin<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.170> if<00:02:42.620> you

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
gaskets that are kind of thin and if you

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.229 
gaskets that are kind of thin and if you
can<00:02:42.859> find<00:02:43.099> those<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.549> can<00:02:43.670> replace<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.060> with

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
can find those you can replace it with

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.899 
can find those you can replace it with
those<00:02:44.569> as<00:02:44.810> well<00:02:45.010> what<00:02:46.010> I've<00:02:46.129> done<00:02:46.340> several

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
those as well what I've done several

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.430 
those as well what I've done several
times<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.480> past<00:02:47.659> is<00:02:47.959> I've<00:02:48.109> had<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.290> couple

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
times in the past is I've had a couple

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.670 
times in the past is I've had a couple
of<00:02:48.680> broken<00:02:48.859> X<00:02:49.280> boxes<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.599> X<00:02:50.750> Box<00:02:50.989> drives<00:02:51.409> I

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
of broken X boxes and the X Box drives I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.649 
of broken X boxes and the X Box drives I
was<00:02:51.889> able<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.159> take<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.060> belt<00:02:53.239> out<00:02:53.450> and

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
was able to take the the belt out and

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.360 
was able to take the the belt out and
put<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:53.989> there<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.409> it<00:02:54.950> worked<00:02:55.159> pretty

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
put it in there and it worked pretty

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.789 
put it in there and it worked pretty
well<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:56.120> that's<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.900> pretty<00:02:57.139> common<00:02:57.379> problem

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
well but that's a pretty common problem

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.110 
well but that's a pretty common problem
with<00:02:57.920> these<00:02:58.040> machines<00:02:58.220> as<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:58.970> it's

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
with these machines as you can see it's

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.300 
with these machines as you can see it's
opening<00:02:59.540> right<00:02:59.750> now<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> have<00:03:00.799> to<00:03:00.829> clean

to have to do is you can have to remove
a<00:03:10.879> lot<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.269> screws<00:03:11.569> there's<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.530> lot<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.799> panels

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
a lot of screws there's a lot of panels

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.470 
a lot of screws there's a lot of panels
on<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:13.970> inside<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.870> lot<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.560> circuitry<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.480> it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
on the inside a lot of circuitry and it

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.210 
on the inside a lot of circuitry and it
is<00:03:17.629> quite<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.900> bit<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.410> hassle<00:03:18.590> but<00:03:19.010> that's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
is quite a bit of a hassle but that's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.800 
is quite a bit of a hassle but that's
the<00:03:19.400> main<00:03:19.579> problem<00:03:19.790> with<00:03:20.030> these<00:03:20.299> things<00:03:20.359> if

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
the main problem with these things if

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.270 
the main problem with these things if
you're<00:03:20.959> not<00:03:21.079> able<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.620> get<00:03:21.769> your<00:03:21.829> door<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.250> open

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
you're not able to get your door to open

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.309 
you're not able to get your door to open
up<00:03:22.669> it's<00:03:23.239> basically<00:03:23.419> because<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.019> jammed

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
up it's basically because it's jammed

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.319 
up it's basically because it's jammed
because<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.739> this<00:03:24.799> little<00:03:25.040> belt<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.549> there's

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
because of this little belt and there's

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.289 
because of this little belt and there's
not<00:03:26.510> enough<00:03:26.780> grease<00:03:27.079> on<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.530> rails<00:03:28.280> here<00:03:28.669> but

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
not enough grease on the rails here but

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.610 
not enough grease on the rails here but
once<00:03:29.449> you<00:03:29.510> get<00:03:29.659> that<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:29.959> cleaned<00:03:30.230> up<00:03:30.409> you

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
once you get that all cleaned up you

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.839 
once you get that all cleaned up you
should<00:03:30.799> have<00:03:30.949> no<00:03:31.129> problems<00:03:31.519> with<00:03:31.609> these

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
should have no problems with these

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.360 
should have no problems with these
things<00:03:32.180> other<00:03:32.840> than<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.199> I<00:03:33.409> haven't<00:03:34.159> really

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
things other than that I haven't really

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.819 
things other than that I haven't really
had<00:03:34.579> any<00:03:34.639> other<00:03:35.060> issues<00:03:35.650> developed<00:03:36.650> with

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
of where each part goes and yeah if you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.699 
of where each part goes and yeah if you
if<00:04:05.359> you<00:04:05.479> have<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.629> camera<00:04:05.989> take<00:04:06.169> pictures<00:04:06.199> of

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
if you have a camera take pictures of

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.199 
if you have a camera take pictures of
stuff<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.099> you<00:04:07.250> don't<00:04:07.310> forget<00:04:07.609> where<00:04:07.909> it<00:04:08.060> goes

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.539 
stuff so you don't forget where it goes
and<00:04:08.569> it'll<00:04:09.440> make<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.709> lot<00:04:09.829> easier<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.310> put<00:04:10.459> it

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
and it'll make it a lot easier to put it

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.089 
and it'll make it a lot easier to put it
back<00:04:10.669> together<00:04:10.879> but<00:04:11.470> just<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:12.620> small<00:04:12.829> little

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
back together but just that small little

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.439 
back together but just that small little
belt<00:04:13.280> there<00:04:13.459> is<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.790> main<00:04:13.940> reason<00:04:14.150> why<00:04:14.329> these

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
belt there is the main reason why these

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.589 
belt there is the main reason why these
things<00:04:14.810> don't<00:04:14.989> open<00:04:15.290> up<00:04:15.379> so<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:17.060> my<00:04:17.269> clothes
