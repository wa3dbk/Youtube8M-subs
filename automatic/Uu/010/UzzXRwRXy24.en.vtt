00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:13.510
 of a video on the iPad, I'll give it to you 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.510
 and now we see a little thing inside 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.070
 well my head is left mouth I do not know how 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.670
 is about chocolate and I decided 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.699
 decided to try it because I try it myself 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.769
 knife and chocolate and let's try 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.309
 method this awakening this with chocolate 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:51.129
 infinite or I do not have infinite 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:55.750
 we are not today unfortunately but 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.750
 because the crazy head 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.479
 Well, we are already here prepared 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.619
 to try to do it 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.619
 I'm going to sing 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.430
 we save and put the video here at 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.259
 ayto 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.700
 and here the video 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.700
 and let's go see it at once 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.270
 for girl and girl and the first step 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.190
 says it's cut more or less like that 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.370
 more or less worth from the third until 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.230
 the second ok we're going to cut this way 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.230
 from the third to the second 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.680
 that's good it's worth my mother how am I going 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.680
 put these chocolate 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.220
 and this is not going to cut vale vale vale 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.740
 it's worth it, we have it 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.720
 and shook a pole 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.610
 the first is already cut it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.610
 next step 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.090
 it's worth the first row you have to cut it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 whole we are going to cut the first row 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.470
 entire 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.470
 Let's see if we get it right without it breaking 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.069
 ok ok we have the first row 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.870
 cut is also worth 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.460
 these 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.970
 there is Miguel and there, too 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.050
 ok and now we have to cut 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.920
 the cachito above it s 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.340
 this bit is perfect to remove from 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 we do not eat it here 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.640
 sea 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.640
 it's good 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.129
 and now the movement is this little bit what 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.760
 we take it off and we keep it for us 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.590
 attention that we are before a moment 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.290
 magical as they come out I will not believe it 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.400
 we just take it off and put it in this 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.550
 side 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.280
 we put it here 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.280
 and this we put here 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.730
 see what I put it 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.360
 incredible sir 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.160
 amazing 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.910
 but they have some terms to explain 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.360
 still 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.580
 we have taken out a square and we have the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.940
 whole chocolate 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.170
 we have chocolate exactly with the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.170
 same pieces that came 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.560
 my god 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.860
 sorry but I do not explain it or 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.530
 is that not like we have one and the kid 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.170
 It is just as we have taken it with your 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.489
 eight branches 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.370
 Well I hope we put on 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.880
 new in our little room for our 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.880
 european camera 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.459
 we see that a little light but good 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.459
 I do not explain it yet 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.560
 we have chocolate and we have taken a 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.560
 free ounce 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.460
 To understand 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.800
 well here is my proof 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.630
 here we are again 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:45.240
 the first is short here that is already 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.780
 cut is worth now it's short is from here 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.920
 he made short that is here 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.920
 every time if we get it right 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.939
 it is difficult to cut it 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.650
 this is supposed to go together they were worth 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.300
 together that as no, we do not have another 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.670
 in it is good and now it is cut 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.760
 the first square above because 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.730
 we have cut this part of here we have 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.350
 cut this and now we cut the first 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.180
 good little square above me 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.340
 match but we cut the first of 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.270
 up vale this is supposed to go together 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.970
 ok and we cut the first one from above 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.260
 and we do the same movement myself 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.650
 here I was here 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.190
 and this thorn 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.190
 Bah 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.810
 my mother 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.810
 we return to take out another piece 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.440
 by others 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.270
 what madness is this 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.270
 what madness is this 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.470
 well we have taken another occasion 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.580
 look 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.249
 but as a dessert like the tablet I got 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.559
 I'm going to another tablet 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:16.659
 I do not know what 's happening but there's the 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:18.669
 proof that you lose the video is that 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.079
 there's running on twitter I've seen it 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:25.409
 wrong and he decided it 

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:25.409
 this video 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:30.189
 tell me the comments what the 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.900
 prove if there is a firm desire 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.910
 has left 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.780
 and how far you have come therefore 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:41.660
 It is important to highlight this tablet more 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.260
 It makes you think good if you liked the 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.630
 I like video give comment on what 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.800
 comment comment in the comments 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.680
 you are not going to comment 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.810
 in the band and rim but good if it has 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.220
 liked you already know and share services 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.320
 so that your friends to that in

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.830
 free chocolate for everyone good a 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:06.790
