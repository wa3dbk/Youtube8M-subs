legends champion idea for rise this is

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.560 
legends champion idea for rise this is
the<00:00:08.189> updated<00:00:08.519> version<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.000> 1<00:00:09.179> i'd<00:00:09.330> previously

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the updated version of 1 i'd previously

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.940 
the updated version of 1 i'd previously
made<00:00:10.700> but<00:00:11.700> i<00:00:12.030> thought<00:00:12.480> i'd<00:00:13.049> revisit<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.920> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
made but i thought i'd revisit it and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.310 
made but i thought i'd revisit it and
hopefully<00:00:14.690> create<00:00:15.690> something<00:00:15.870> off<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.139> it

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
hopefully create something off of it

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.990 
hopefully create something off of it
better<00:00:16.890> quality<00:00:17.430> than<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.699> other<00:00:17.850> one

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
better quality than the other one

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.160 
better quality than the other one
because<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.300> was<00:00:18.480> when<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.750> starting<00:00:18.990> out

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
because that was when I was starting out

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.179 
because that was when I was starting out
and<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.439> wasn't<00:00:19.710> great<00:00:20.810> so<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:23.039> gonna

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and it wasn't great so I'm just gonna

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.710 
and it wasn't great so I'm just gonna
say<00:00:23.310> i<00:00:23.640> started<00:00:24.029> off<00:00:24.060> getting<00:00:24.240> her<00:00:24.359> sapphire

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
say i started off getting her sapphire

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.279 
say i started off getting her sapphire
crystals<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> boots<00:00:25.560> because<00:00:27.289> rises

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
crystals to the boots because rises

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.290 
crystals to the boots because rises
spells<00:00:28.560> some<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.490> not<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.849> them<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
spells some of them not all of them I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.990 
spells some of them not all of them I
think<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.900> some<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.619> them<00:00:31.740> get<00:00:32.160> bonus<00:00:32.759> down

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
think but some of them get bonus down

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.780 
think but some of them get bonus down
magic<00:00:33.390> damage<00:00:33.570> based<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> amount<00:00:35.100> maximum

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
magic damage based on the amount maximum

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.569 
magic damage based on the amount maximum
amount<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.329> mana<00:00:36.570> he<00:00:36.870> has<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> obviously

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
amount of mana he has so obviously

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.889 
amount of mana he has so obviously
getting<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.940> bit<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.149> extra<00:00:39.360> mana<00:00:39.570> means<00:00:39.780> he

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
getting a bit of extra mana means he

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.229 
getting a bit of extra mana means he
actually<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.320> more<00:00:40.530> damage<00:00:41.309> he<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.940> but

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
actually has more damage he can do but

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
actually has more damage he can do but
he's<00:00:42.420> also<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.170> mana<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.829> spells

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
he's also got more mana for more spells

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.690 
he's also got more mana for more spells
sort<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.030> things<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.530> I'll<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.590> quickly<00:00:46.950> run

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
sort of things so I'll just quickly run

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.410 
sort of things so I'll just quickly run
down<00:00:48.329> his<00:00:49.399> spells<00:00:50.399> themselves<00:00:50.850> his<00:00:51.000> passive

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
down his spells themselves his passive

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.700 
down his spells themselves his passive
means<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.780> whenever<00:00:51.930> he<00:00:52.199> cast<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.530> spell

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
means that whenever he cast a spell

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
means that whenever he cast a spell
reduces<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> cooldown<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.329> other

which you know is pretty sick
it<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.860> fairly<00:02:14.220> weak<00:02:14.790> early<00:02:15.450> game<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.260> in

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
it is fairly weak early game so in

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.320 
it is fairly weak early game so in
actually<00:02:17.400> picking<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.910> killer<00:02:18.150> or<00:02:18.300> anything

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
over pretty much also a extra feature I

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.909 
over pretty much also a extra feature I
quite<00:04:15.510> like<00:04:15.660> about<00:04:15.900> rise<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.650> fact<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
quite like about rise is the fact that

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.440 
quite like about rise is the fact that
all<00:04:17.099> of<00:04:17.190> these<00:04:17.280> cool<00:04:17.549> downs<00:04:17.760> are<00:04:18.000> very<00:04:18.180> low

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
all of these cool downs are very low

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.830 
all of these cool downs are very low
because<00:04:19.820> every<00:04:20.820> time<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:21.090> use<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.329> spell<00:04:21.659> you

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
because every time you use a spell you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.120 
because every time you use a spell you
reduce<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.140> core<00:04:22.409> downs<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.800> other<00:04:22.919> ones

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
reduce the core downs of the other ones

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.810 
reduce the core downs of the other ones
so

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
so

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.490 
so
it's<00:04:25.820> Sam<00:04:26.060> why<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> don't<00:04:27.020> want<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.200> say<00:04:27.260> you<00:04:27.320> can

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
it's Sam why I don't want to say you can

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.560 
it's Sam why I don't want to say you can
just<00:04:27.650> spam<00:04:27.920> your<00:04:28.100> spell's<00:04:28.370> but<00:04:28.670> sort<00:04:29.480> of

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
just spam your spell's but sort of

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.680 
just spam your spell's but sort of
cannon<00:04:29.960> away<00:04:30.200> because<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:32.120> reduces<00:04:32.330> the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
cannon away because it reduces the

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.180 
cannon away because it reduces the
cooldown<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.260> other<00:04:33.380> ones<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.740> get<00:04:33.980> so

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
cooldown of the other ones you get so

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.860 
cooldown of the other ones you get so
much<00:04:34.340> manner<00:04:34.640> anyway<00:04:34.850> because<00:04:35.300> that's<00:04:35.630> what

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
much manner anyway because that's what

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.780 
much manner anyway because that's what
increases<00:04:36.590> your<00:04:36.860> magic<00:04:37.190> damage<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.610> don't

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
increases your magic damage you don't

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.820 
increases your magic damage you don't
really<00:04:38.000> go<00:04:38.150> for<00:04:38.480> ability<00:04:39.350> power<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.800> much

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
really go for ability power so much

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.150 
really go for ability power so much
which<00:04:40.820> means<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.360> can<00:04:41.510> sort<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.980> can

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
which means that you can sort of you can

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.370 
which means that you can sort of you can
just<00:04:43.370> keep<00:04:43.880> casting<00:04:44.450> spells<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.200> can

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
just keep casting spells and you can

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.030 
just keep casting spells and you can
stand<00:04:45.590> live<00:04:45.860> ages<00:04:46.790> which<00:04:47.120> is<00:04:47.330> um<00:04:47.980> it's<00:04:48.980> pretty

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
stand live ages which is um it's pretty

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.760 
stand live ages which is um it's pretty
pretty<00:04:49.670> good<00:04:49.850> fun<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.480> also<00:04:50.750> right<00:04:51.440> towards

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
pretty good fun and also right towards

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.710 
pretty good fun and also right towards
the<00:04:51.860> end<00:04:51.980> of<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.130> game<00:04:52.220> he<00:04:52.790> gets<00:04:52.970> extremely

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
the end of the game he gets extremely

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.480 
the end of the game he gets extremely
tanky<00:04:54.350> if<00:04:55.340> you've<00:04:55.880> got<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.060> level<00:04:56.360> 18<00:04:56.690> rise<00:04:57.020> and

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
tanky if you've got a level 18 rise and

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.520 
tanky if you've got a level 18 rise and
so<00:04:58.490> you've<00:04:58.730> still<00:04:58.970> got<00:04:59.150> some<00:04:59.750> champion<00:05:00.200> it's<00:05:00.380> a

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
so you've still got some champion it's a

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.700 
so you've still got some champion it's a
level<00:05:00.680> 14<00:05:01.460> 15<00:05:02.000> 16<00:05:02.270> they're<00:05:03.020> just<00:05:03.050> going<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.650> get

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
level 14 15 16 they're just going to get

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.020 
level 14 15 16 they're just going to get
bullied<00:05:03.950> so<00:05:04.600> that's<00:05:06.430> probably<00:05:07.430> not<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:07.820> fun<00:05:08.000> to

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
bullied so that's probably not so fun to

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.660 
bullied so that's probably not so fun to
play<00:05:08.270> against<00:05:08.690> but<00:05:09.380> it's<00:05:09.740> great<00:05:10.070> fun<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.310> play

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
play against but it's great fun to play

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.780 
play against but it's great fun to play
as<00:05:10.880> rise<00:05:11.480> is<00:05:11.780> also<00:05:12.230> not<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.220> particularly

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
as rise is also not a particularly

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.840 
as rise is also not a particularly
difficult<00:05:14.140> champion<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.380> just<00:05:15.830> sort<00:05:16.040> of<00:05:16.100> pick

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
difficult champion to just sort of pick

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.540 
difficult champion to just sort of pick
up<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:17.300> be<00:05:17.480> able<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.780> play<00:05:18.410> after<00:05:18.920> a<00:05:18.950> couple<00:05:19.400> of

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
up and be able to play after a couple of

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.730 
up and be able to play after a couple of
games<00:05:19.580> so<00:05:20.390> if<00:05:20.720> you<00:05:20.960> sort<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.200> fairly<00:05:21.440> new<00:05:21.710> to

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
games so if you sort of fairly new to

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.960 
games so if you sort of fairly new to
