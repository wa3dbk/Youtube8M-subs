00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
grandstand seating I guess God and again

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.359 
grandstand seating I guess God and again
just<00:02:05.850> adds<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.300> more<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:07.080> detail<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.040> this

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
