00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.379
 for young people we mean that I lived in the afp 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.439
 so I know 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.239
 three cruisers 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.070
 finally that tqs 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.470
 on a repulsed corner 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.820
 so we can 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
 to harvest the seeds 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 I think we know that many printing agents 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.490
 the cold stuffed all that does not tempt me 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.820
 I think he's all alone 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 story whether it's December 31 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 I'm so sad 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.720
 so 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.310
 It's ready 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.710
 then we will take 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 Too much to make you smile 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.400
 alone 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 Why 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.600
 I suffered 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.560
 m 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.790
 for me 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.270
 they are actually 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 the deck 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.870
 obviously I pe-cho euros 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.810
 torches 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 all the college that you stay there 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.630
 so here I have to do 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 barriers 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.900
 in europe the goal on batteries 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.820
 what can I do to forget 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
 we want to ask 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.510
 was she head the world 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 raised by 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.449
 Let's go 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.509
 Why 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.539
 organize all that 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:25.019
 why some 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.019
 so if I do it 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.579
 right here 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.779
 in this role 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.529
 Why 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.529
 now 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.839
 not very how to say 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.369
 she's still asking me about it 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.959
 main success for all 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.129
 m 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.159
 close still not see this barrier 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.529
 above 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.249
 so what am I already 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.849
 she'll do some movements but this time at least it's the strength with 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.469
 the man 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.469
 these clarity the little tunes 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.819
 all the terrible 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.279
 gold 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.659
 but no-one 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.609
 with this level of competition 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.329
 s 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.959
 you are going 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.379
 piece 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.739
 two sides this sport 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.050
 you want to see what I'm going to leave you ap kouchner courtois crespo 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.449
 here's the real one because it shows 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.379
 what is sweet 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.149
 belga 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.189
 good the game see 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.569
 always followed 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.599
 so they are not 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.719
 for his skates roms ships were the videos because the man 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.789
 the game I'm not against zurich will soon 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:00.339
 is three points that I think I believe 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.289
 small and big that 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.289
 what I think I did after 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.099
 translink 10 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.099
 all this on this fifth episode 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:14.640
 the group 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.169
 closing at the third pious 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.370
 it's more than elsewhere 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.370
 because in fact that we're going both sides 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.189
 ok coulthard 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.919
 48 football teams 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.919
 for the youth effort 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.840
 gerba de logitech and songs 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.169
 I'm going to do just one row 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.169
 this progress so m proof 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.729
 I know we have to find all of us like that 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.180
 so I think it's 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.349
 no reason that it does not grow 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.349
 many do not think of date the opening of the barriers 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.749
 with what type of game too 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.389
 no matter 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.180
 and here she is 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.710
 the super gt 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.879
 the depor two months already 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.879
 it's just right we'll continue 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.129
 dance 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.229
 yet from here 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.229
 so good 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.559
 to the public 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.199
 the sco goes shopping 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.569
 at least that 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.569
 to limit other inmates to fear 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:55.800
 the satio of sony music 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.220
 at the pop level who would walk win low and clear of his time 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.469
 q 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.869
 they were giving him a free kick never seen before 

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.869
 I have never seen so many layers 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.979
 this one a lot of helped 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.979
 as well as the choices 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.939
 we sell more limited 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.989
 but it's breaded chops egypt that I can find out about the value 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.770
 paolo messier 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.539
 no matter what 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.539
 julie know how to be pretty 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.860
 now aside I'm glad that those of big low prices of my 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.050
 luck 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.499
 everything I wanted 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:46.499
 including 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.099
 constant day under water with the old 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.909
 which of the recourse to the law 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.909
 so why do not you find 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:08.589
 christine girard 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.960
 ap yes 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.710
 jg font 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.050
 for me the mystery of the human readable 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.050
 we hear again fear 

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:29.029
 good already I have a lot of chops 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:33.279
 to them so I think we'll leave on lucky luke from pig pillage or 

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:34.469
 two 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:36.559
 we have to shovel as we say 

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:39.159
 lester m 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.399
 12% 

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:44.020
 so why also kitty sure the prices are good 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.550
 of coquettes no sir estrosi to the next so next time I'll have 

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:50.960

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.610
 and so that we'll see heitz had the grace that shot down a little more 

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:57.399
 world
