of<00:00:23.679> plastic<00:00:24.070> packaging<00:00:24.250> every<00:00:25.089> year<00:00:25.509> so

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
of plastic packaging every year so

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.450 
of plastic packaging every year so
that's<00:00:26.079> a<00:00:26.230> very<00:00:26.470> good<00:00:26.679> reason<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.099> start

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
that's a very good reason to start

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.540 
that's a very good reason to start
recycling<00:00:30.809> on<00:00:31.809> there<00:00:32.110> next<00:00:32.410> time<00:00:32.589> round<00:00:32.890> these

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.660 
recycling on there next time round these
could<00:00:33.969> be<00:00:34.089> transformed<00:00:34.629> into<00:00:34.870> carpet<00:00:35.829> compost

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
could be transformed into carpet compost

bins or clothes pigs they could even

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.670 
bins or clothes pigs they could even
wind<00:00:39.430> up<00:00:39.550> in<00:00:39.699> a<00:00:39.790> museum<00:00:40.149> but<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:40.989> causes<00:00:41.470> more

materials were hard to obtain plastic

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.850

was<00:00:58.600> seen<00:00:58.839> as<00:00:59.049> a<00:00:59.080> good<00:00:59.290> hard-wearing

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
was seen as a good hard-wearing

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.609 
was seen as a good hard-wearing
alternative<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:00.820> now<00:01:01.509> it's<00:01:01.869> a<00:01:01.960> material<00:01:02.500> of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
alternative and now it's a material of

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.440 
alternative and now it's a material of
choice<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:03.189> its<00:01:03.400> own<00:01:03.640> right<00:01:06.180> people<00:01:07.180> came

choice and its own right people came

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.210 
choice and its own right people came
from<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.659> island<00:01:08.170> saying<00:01:08.470> they<00:01:08.740> had<00:01:09.070> been

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
from the island saying they had been

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.310 
from the island saying they had been
used<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.549> a<00:01:09.579> lot<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:09.729> color<00:01:10.150> they'd<00:01:10.750> just<00:01:11.049> been

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
used to a lot of color they'd just been

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
used to a lot of color they'd just been
used<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.710> lot<00:01:11.829> of<00:01:12.009> natural<00:01:12.880> fibers<00:01:13.360> and<00:01:14.340> came

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
used a lot of natural fibers and came

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.219 
used a lot of natural fibers and came
here<00:01:15.579> they<00:01:15.759> had<00:01:15.880> difficulty<00:01:16.450> finding<00:01:16.750> those

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
here they had difficulty finding those

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.270 
here they had difficulty finding those
materials<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:19.270> also<00:01:19.570> if<00:01:19.869> they<00:01:20.250> try<00:01:21.250> to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
materials and then also if they try to

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.710 
materials and then also if they try to
get<00:01:21.610> them<00:01:21.790> from<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.060> islands<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.540> would<00:01:22.630> be

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
get them from the islands it would be

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.990 
get them from the islands it would be
quite<00:01:22.899> expensive<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.860> what<00:01:24.400> they<00:01:24.520> decided<00:01:24.640> to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
quite expensive so what they decided to

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.840 
quite expensive so what they decided to
do<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.600> look<00:01:25.870> around<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:27.460> know<00:01:27.580> see

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
do is look around and you know see

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.360 
do is look around and you know see
material<00:01:28.479> that<00:01:28.630> was<00:01:28.810> easily<00:01:29.200> available<00:01:29.500> quite

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
material that was easily available quite

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.930 
material that was easily available quite
reasonably<00:01:31.240> priced<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:32.170> in<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.280> they<00:01:33.550> sort

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
reasonably priced and in that they sort

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.510 
reasonably priced and in that they sort
of<00:01:34.030> discovered<00:01:34.600> plastics<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:36.100> think<00:01:36.460> in

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
of discovered plastics and I think in

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.670 
of discovered plastics and I think in
New<00:01:36.670> Zealand<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.180> $2<00:01:37.570> shop<00:01:37.840> helped<00:01:38.200> hearts

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
New Zealand the $2 shop helped hearts

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.880 
New Zealand the $2 shop helped hearts
they<00:01:39.670> use<00:01:40.090> all<00:01:40.390> kinds<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:40.990> plastic<00:01:41.440> materials

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
they use all kinds of plastic materials

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.820 
they use all kinds of plastic materials
from<00:01:42.100> things<00:01:42.700> like<00:01:42.790> this<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:43.720> she<00:01:43.780> lay<00:01:44.140> here<00:01:44.500> we

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
from things like this so she lay here we

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.789 
from things like this so she lay here we
source<00:01:45.610> those<00:01:45.820> bottles<00:01:46.420> were<00:01:46.630> used<00:01:46.900> washed

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
source those bottles were used washed

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.520 
source those bottles were used washed
and<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.940> then<00:01:49.119> created<00:01:49.690> into<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> lovely

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
and and then created into a lovely

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.980 
and and then created into a lovely
niklas<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.490> then<00:01:52.119> over<00:01:52.330> there<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.810> see

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
niklas and then over there you can see

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.530 
niklas and then over there you can see
kipper<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.740> raffia<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.970> now<00:01:55.119> you'll<00:01:55.270> notice

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
kipper and raffia and now you'll notice

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.170 
kipper and raffia and now you'll notice
that<00:01:55.920> behind<00:01:56.920> those<00:01:57.159> powers<00:01:57.490> would<00:01:57.760> be<00:01:57.909> the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
that behind those powers would be the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.450 
that behind those powers would be the
sticky<00:01:58.659> type<00:01:58.900> which<00:01:59.740> will<00:01:59.860> of<00:02:00.010> course<00:02:00.040> come

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
sticky type which will of course come

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.240 
sticky type which will of course come
off<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.479> becomes<00:02:02.049> an<00:02:02.560> issue<00:02:02.770> for<00:02:03.100> us

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
off so that becomes an issue for us

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.250 
off so that becomes an issue for us
which<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.549> not<00:02:04.030> as<00:02:04.270> bad<00:02:04.540> as<00:02:04.720> some<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.140> other

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
which is not as bad as some of the other

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.649 
which is not as bad as some of the other
problems<00:02:05.619> because<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.640> can<00:02:06.790> always<00:02:06.939> reattach

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
problems because you can always reattach

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.740 
problems because you can always reattach
those<00:02:07.990> with<00:02:08.289> using<00:02:08.679> some<00:02:08.709> other<00:02:09.009> material

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
those with using some other material

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.240 
those with using some other material
sticky<00:02:10.750> tape<00:02:10.959> is<00:02:11.140> one<00:02:11.379> thing<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:12.129> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
sticky tape is one thing but the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.699 
sticky tape is one thing but the
conservators<00:02:12.879> main<00:02:13.150> issue<00:02:13.450> now<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.170> some

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
conservators main issue now is that some

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.190 
conservators main issue now is that some
plastics<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.640> aren't<00:02:15.970> built<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.269> last<00:02:16.510> these

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
plastics just aren't built to last these

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.710 
plastics just aren't built to last these
hats<00:02:17.560> what's<00:02:17.860> happening<00:02:18.189> of<00:02:18.310> them<00:02:18.549> you<00:02:19.480> can

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
hats what's happening of them you can

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.449 
hats what's happening of them you can
see<00:02:19.900> they're<00:02:20.049> three<00:02:20.319> hats<00:02:20.590> here<00:02:20.890> one<00:02:21.189> looks

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
see they're three hats here one looks

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.520 
see they're three hats here one looks
very<00:02:21.580> stay<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.299> actually<00:02:22.659> it<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.080> oldest

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
very stay but actually it is the oldest

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.589
