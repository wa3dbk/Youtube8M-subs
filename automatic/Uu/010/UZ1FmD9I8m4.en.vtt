00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 guys girls about all I am with 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.740
 this state if they see graf today 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.810
 I bring a seed so you can 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.269
 find in a very easy way the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.099
 temple of water or submerged temple that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.410
 has been added to a 1.8 version of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 agreement for the title having everything in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 call it the temple of water according 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.080
 we're going to get creative and the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.660
 seed is going to be the next 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.800
 and obviously we have to be in a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.140
 version superior to the sna shop 14 vw 25 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.470
 agree that is when the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 Water temple is worth it let's start 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 before I start telling you that there is a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.820
 a little cold is possible who at 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.769
 Throughout this video I missed some 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 crazy sneeze of those that can be 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.420
 break the ears the eardrums are left 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.620
 deaf etc. and so on etc. 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.309
 I remember and after this speech 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.379
 let's start good the seed is minus 4 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.140
 891 3 048 4 2 7 62 39 02 27 according 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.930
 without any space then let's avoid the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.360
 space well there it is and we're going to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 remain to create we do not change any of 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.250
 other options of agreement because if not 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.920
 it will not create 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.500
 and a single tp evidently so that what 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.790
 let's find an easier way 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 we appear here surely you have a 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.450
 little bit of the because I'm good 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.040
 recording a very unstable version of 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.420
 agreement then come and stable equaled 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.550
 We put our name in agreement for 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.310
 do a tp here we can do it without 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.430
 name also and it is 10,000 voucher ie 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.330
 they are four zeros 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.130
 40 to 100 that are 100 zeros that the 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.310
 100 zeros two zeros and then it's a million 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.960
 it is worth six one two three four 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.229
 five or six more according so 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.910
 simple 10,100 a million if this one goes to 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.790
 take for sack is worth but what can 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.620
 to do is but without creative and those here 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.160
 ideas here and look for what's worth 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.160
 we give him 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.100
 let's fall 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 we are falling and well you are 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.420
 seeing 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.230
 here you can already see the entrance of the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 temple 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.660
 in fact good let's spend the magic is 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.020
 wait and now we are going to put 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.800
 quietly a night vision is worth 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.360
 to see a little under the water 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.930
 and be able to find things more 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.150
 easily good if you do not know this is 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.670
 a quick explanation worth this is the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.530
 Water temple added for des in 1.8 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 agree these are from friends 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.600
 new ones that are around here better 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.280
 they are the guardians and what European coal 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.970
 European of a lot of objects 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.520
 different vale and good come on let's 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.780
 enter quietly worth these are the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.570
 new blocks of agreement this is 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.660
 bright for example and nothing here we have 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.220
 the block is worth the entrance 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.380
 and that we would have to go breaking for 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.990
 to be able to go through in different areas 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.160
 okay but well let's go to what 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.640
 important of this temple is worth 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.860
 yes you appreciate there is so much an entry here 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.470
 what would this main entrance be and there's 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.020
 a corner here a corner here and the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.540
 center ok let's put some light 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.850
 light blocks 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:25.940
 How can they be the ones you like? 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.880
 and we will start in this lateral vale 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.560
 these laterals if we go inside we're going 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.910
 to find the box this is a 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.130
 little bit more and will give you a 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.900
 sponge of agreement guys here inside 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.550
 you will find a sponge 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.520
 here between killed this sponge is worth 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.820
 well on this side post the 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.070
 five years and we'll go to the other side 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.870
 we will find here another vice to the position of 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.950
 those who will give us another sponge I suppose 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.680
 what will turn out to be a 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.010
 wet sponge we found there is 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.010
 you see her 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.650
 is this and tarragÃ³ is easy to tacho 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.780
 and there it is there we have once 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.230
 kill those two we already have two 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.170
 sponges and let's say here to the last 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.410
 sponge 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.540
 according to another view of these facts 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.320
 which we will have to kill there 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.320
 different floors 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.889
 let's go good let's go up 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.720
 all from above it looks better for 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.509
 they would already take that they are being 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.520
 the three boxes is worth a little bit 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.349
 but do not worry kill you 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.039
 sure it would kill us to go fast and in 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.039
 these laterals 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.419
 we will have to look here 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:46.120
 just entered by a lateral 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.969
 we will find this area in which 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.990
 we will find in total what comes 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:56.290
 being two silos are 4 and 48 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.670
 8 gold blocks is to say I think it's 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.740
 a good reward for entering here 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.000
 apart from creating different blocks that 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.310
 we can take away from our time 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.990
 home 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.520
 and you do not see this seems here that is 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.500
 totally different from the one in there true 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.510
 and that means that there is a whole 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.690
 this intake of sponges according 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:23.520
 you have one two three we are going to count 1 2 3 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:30.390
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:34.040
 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 28 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.530
 sponges for the face vale 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.750
 then look 28 sponge I think that 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.249
 you comes in handy for you to be one 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.129
 little bit more new in this version 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:47.219
 tell you how you currently do not know 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.839
 how many temples there are per world 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:51.889
 There may be more than one surely 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:54.239
 I do not know if there are going to be three how it can be 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.909
 portals of read but if you have 

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:59.369
 got the sponges are they going to 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.319
 come already wet you will be able to remove the 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:03.629
 moisture with a sponge what are you going to 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.089
 need is an oven and cook them from 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:09.239
 agreement once you do this you go to 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:11.519
 be able to have the normal sponge with the 

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:15.709
 what if you know what a bit this 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.709
 game you know something but 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.810
 let's be able to do this let's do it 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.340
 here improvised according if you think 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.350
 so you know a little bit for what is a 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.270
 sponge well six very new in this 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.790
 version is worth 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.810
 let's fill this with water and so we see 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.810
 the sponges 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.489
 there it is full 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.469
 Aryan see sponges and are dry 

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:43.449
 agree and a sponge what is useful is 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.649
 to remove all water and touch from 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.989
 water and when in breaking the sponge back 

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:49.749
 you carry moisture and then the dry ones in the 

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:51.549
 oven and the seed is already here 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:53.169
 there and I hope you liked it
