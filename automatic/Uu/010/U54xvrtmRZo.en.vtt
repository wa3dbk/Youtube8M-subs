00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.920

complement<00:03:36.060> each<00:03:36.090> other<00:03:36.329> so<00:03:36.510> much<00:03:36.629> is<00:03:36.780> because

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
complement each other so much is because

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.929 
complement each other so much is because
you<00:03:37.139> come<00:03:37.349> from<00:03:37.379> similar<00:03:37.650> backgrounds<00:03:37.980> so

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939
