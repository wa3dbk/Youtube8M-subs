00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
it couldn't be a truer kind of
translation<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:01.370> sonic<00:01:02.370> vision

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
translation of like the sonic vision

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.359 
translation of like the sonic vision
that<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.940> had<00:01:03.059> been<00:01:03.300> working<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.110> years<00:01:04.530> and

that I had been working on for years and
I<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.689> did<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> completely<00:01:08.250> uncommon

major<00:02:05.549> dreams<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.570> since<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.990> was<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
major dreams you know since I was a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.059 
major dreams you know since I was a
child<00:02:07.610> but<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.420> dream<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.810> never<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.709> become

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
child but the dream was never to become

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.430 
child but the dream was never to become
a<00:02:11.099> singer<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:12.360> wasn't<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.140> know

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a singer that wasn't it you know

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.630 
a singer that wasn't it you know
I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.760> dream<00:02:15.090> was<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.640> full-on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I think the dream was to be a full-on

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.860 
I think the dream was to be a full-on
artist<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:20.430> think<00:02:20.820> one<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.690> most

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
artist and I think one of the most

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.220 
artist and I think one of the most
innovative<00:02:25.970> things<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.480> most<00:02:27.720> meaningful

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
innovative things and most meaningful

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.190 
innovative things and most meaningful
things<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.800> think<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.160> history<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:30.000> any<00:02:30.630> medium
