00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.130
 they tell that once all the feelings and qualities of man were gathered 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.440
 starting with the wind said this Saturday for the third time the madness and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.249
 absurdity 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.339
 ollanta let's play hide and seek 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.239
 the intrigue raised eyebrows and curiosity 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.359
 Unable to contain himself, he asked 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.189
 the companies 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.189
 the excitement was only removed from the euphoria 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.029
 the joy came so much saints that it ended up convincing the doubt and the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.029
 apathy that they were never interested in anything 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.090
 kaos 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.090
 Perez started telling the madness 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.109
 the first one to hide was the expert who as always 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 fell behind the first stone of the road 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.750
 the fed went up to heaven and envy hid behind the shadow of the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.930
 triumph 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.940
 that by his own efforts he had managed to climb to the highest level of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.260
 highest tree 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.770
 generosity 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.620
 he almost did not manage to hide 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.050
 The place they found was wonderful for one of their friends 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.530
 if it was a crystal clear voice 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.650
 ideal for bikes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320
 if it was the queen's cup 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.730
 perfect for shyness 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.060
 magnificent warning for freedom 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 so he ended up hiding in a ray of sunshine 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.990
 all the way 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.270
 in a good place from the beginning ventilated 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.960
 but only for them 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.640
 the lie hid behind the rainbow 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.500
 and passion and desire 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.130
 in the center of the volcanoes 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.299
 When the madness ended contact, love had not yet found 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.480
 place to hide 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.930
 Well, everyone was already busy 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.740
 until he found a rosebush 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 and affectionately decided to hide among its flowers 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.760
 the madness concluded 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.690
 and how we sound like seeing 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.190
 the first to appear was the press 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.720
 barely three steps on earth 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.509
 so it will force the passion and desire of the volcanoes 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.089
 in an oversight he found envy 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.189
 and of course he could deduce where the triumph was 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.829
 to selfishness 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.539
 did not have to look 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.950
 he just shot out of his hiding place that really 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.859
 it was a nest of wasps 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.859
 from so much walking without gods 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.059
 and when approaching a lake 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.059
 discovered the crisis 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.229
 it was easier to find 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.809
 I was sitting on a hill without deciding where to hide 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.139
 and so he was finding the acts 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.229
 to the talent among the fresh grass 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.659
 to the anguish 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.659
 in a dark cave 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.839
 it did not appear anywhere 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:04.099
 the madness I do not look for behind each arch under each rock of the planet and over 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.979
 from the mountains 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.839
 when I was about to give up 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.199
 found a thing 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.929
 and he began to move his weapons 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:15.519
 so 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.809
 He heard a painful scream 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.819
 there was merit to love 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.689
 In the eyes 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.689
 the madness did not know what to do to apologize 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.779
 hilton 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.779
 he apologized and promised to be enough forever 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.989
 that's why 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.939
 that back then 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.789
 love is blind 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.019
 and the madness 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.219
 always with you
