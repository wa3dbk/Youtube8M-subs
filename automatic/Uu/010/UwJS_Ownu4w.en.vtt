has been recently discovered and this is

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.390 
has been recently discovered and this is
the<00:00:10.660> x-ray<00:00:11.019> vision<00:00:11.259> glitch<00:00:11.589> basically<00:00:12.250> what

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
the x-ray vision glitch basically what

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.650 
the x-ray vision glitch basically what
you<00:00:12.490> do<00:00:12.639> is<00:00:12.790> you<00:00:12.910> need<00:00:13.799> tnt<00:00:14.799> pistons<00:00:15.580> and<00:00:16.090> one

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
you do is you need tnt pistons and one

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.679 
you do is you need tnt pistons and one
pressure<00:00:16.930> plate<00:00:17.199> and<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:19.029> this<00:00:19.180> allows<00:00:19.510> you

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
pressure plate and what this allows you

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.839 
pressure plate and what this allows you
to<00:00:19.810> do<00:00:19.960> is<00:00:20.170> you<00:00:20.769> go<00:00:21.010> on<00:00:21.039> the<00:00:21.279> ground<00:00:21.430> and<00:00:21.760> you

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
to do is you go on the ground and you

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.250 
to do is you go on the ground and you
also<00:00:22.180> need<00:00:22.420> a<00:00:22.480> friend<00:00:22.750> or<00:00:22.900> split-screen

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
also need a friend or split-screen

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.410 
also need a friend or split-screen
player<00:00:23.590> as<00:00:23.920> well<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.220> do<00:00:24.340> this<00:00:24.519> for<00:00:25.179> them<00:00:25.269> to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
player as well to do this for them to

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.880 
player as well to do this for them to
stand<00:00:25.570> on<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.810> pressure<00:00:25.990> plate<00:00:26.080> but<00:00:26.800> what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
stand on the pressure plate but what

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.259 
stand on the pressure plate but what
this<00:00:27.009> allows<00:00:27.070> you<00:00:27.550> to<00:00:27.580> do<00:00:27.789> is<00:00:28.000> when<00:00:28.119> you're

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
this allows you to do is when you're

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.730 
this allows you to do is when you're
underground<00:00:28.539> you<00:00:28.840> can<00:00:28.960> see<00:00:29.140> all<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.529> caves

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
underground you can see all the caves

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.380 
underground you can see all the caves
around<00:00:30.099> you<00:00:30.250> all<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.519> mobs<00:00:30.849> all<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.179> mobs

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
around you all the mobs all the mobs

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
spawn it and you can find mobs like

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.280 
spawn it and you can find mobs like
slimes<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:33.670> you<00:00:33.820> can<00:00:33.940> basically<00:00:34.149> see<00:00:34.690> any<00:00:35.110> for

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
slimes and you can basically see any for

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.229 
slimes and you can basically see any for
everything<00:00:35.890> underground<00:00:36.309> so<00:00:36.879> with<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.090> case

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
everything underground so with the case

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.420 
everything underground so with the case
so<00:00:37.930> and<00:00:38.110> what<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:38.320> need<00:00:38.469> to<00:00:38.559> do<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:38.890> first<00:00:39.010> unit

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
so and what you need to do is first unit

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.940 
so and what you need to do is first unit
you<00:00:39.730> just<00:00:39.879> need<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.149> dig<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.559> 1-1<00:00:41.559> hole<00:00:41.770> down

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
you just need to dig a 1-1 hole down

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.639 
you just need to dig a 1-1 hole down
here<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.280> needs<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.579> pressure<00:00:43.059> plate<00:00:43.239> here

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
here it needs a pressure plate here

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.240 
here it needs a pressure plate here
basically<00:00:44.649> the<00:00:45.059> five<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.539> believe<00:00:46.930> it<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.649> five

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
basically the five I believe it is five

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.420 
basically the five I believe it is five
blocks<00:00:48.610> under<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:51.579> two<00:00:52.059> three

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
blocks under that that's one two three

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.970 
blocks under that that's one two three
four<00:00:54.430> five<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.719> you<00:00:58.809> put<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> piston<00:00:59.469> under<00:00:59.890> the

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
four five and you put a piston under the

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.200 
four five and you put a piston under the
dirt<00:01:00.190> with<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.370> pressure<00:01:00.640> plate

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
dirt with the pressure plate

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.020 
dirt with the pressure plate
it<00:01:02.079> must<00:01:02.289> be<00:01:02.379> facing<00:01:02.590> towards<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:03.910> you

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
it must be facing towards you and you

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.430 
it must be facing towards you and you
put<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.180> piece<00:01:04.240> of<00:01:04.390> TNT<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.140> cover<00:01:08.350> the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
put a piece of TNT when you cover the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.190 
put a piece of TNT when you cover the
rest<00:01:08.590> back<00:01:08.770> up<00:01:09.480> then<00:01:10.480> you<00:01:10.570> get<00:01:10.780> your<00:01:10.900> friend<00:01:11.110> to

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
rest back up then you get your friend to

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.450 
rest back up then you get your friend to
stand<00:01:11.350> on<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.560> pressure<00:01:11.770> plate<00:01:11.860> safe<00:01:12.250> dose

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
stand on the pressure plate safe dose

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.930 
stand on the pressure plate safe dose
every<00:01:13.360> day<00:01:13.480> and<00:01:13.920> simple<00:01:14.920> as<00:01:15.010> that<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.790> can
