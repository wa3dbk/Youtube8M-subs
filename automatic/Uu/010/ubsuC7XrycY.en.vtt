 they keep going very fast from sant 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.100

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.590
 to show them that I was missing the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 last shield that give it at level 100 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.460
 is the last element that you get when 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.890
 you are already at the highest level 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.720
 in the cars and I just wanted to see what 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 bought to see how much is the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.369
 value that they give me for the car totally 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.020
 modified ok ok to the only thing that 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.270
 we have to do is ask our 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.950
 friend to go with the one driving 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.290
 saying to go piloting the charge 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.210
 voice that simply lifted us up has been 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 easy try to get a friend who 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 be good lifting the only say by 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.000
 a friend tomato this one does not know the guy 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.860
 how to lift a car it takes like a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 hour and you can never raise them so 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.160
 try to get a friend to be 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.970
 good lifting the cars and what 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.020
 make it easy once you are already flying 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.179
 you consider a height 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 considerable for example I say that 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.140
 here is already good we are going to be 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.600
 and we're going to go to the xbox 360 store 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.940
 playstation3 latina water remember 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.710
 that this works for both platforms 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.409
 here is not racism if they have widgets and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.739
 ching I think that not even dgt for 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.269
 see this good once we are here 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.790
 in the xbox store do not do what I 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.220
 I did, I put it on, I left, and how can 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.570
 see this in a solitary game not 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.100
 They have to do that, they do not have to gas 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.270
 tell your friend that he was in his 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.550
 same lobby in this one 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.380
 Slim care that invites them back as 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.780
 can see here I was alone that 's what 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.640
 what we need then they will be 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 invite them back to the lobby where 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.440
 they were ok here is going to appear another fail 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.000
 and I leave it on purpose so that you 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.390
 do not pass crumbs so please 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.240
 see that I'm already entering here 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.690
 a causality 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.300
 we do not want we do not want to be in the house 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.980
 because it does not affect anything in gray eye this 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.170
 it does not affect anything in gray and do not worry 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.370
 but they're going to waste time and that's not what 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.960
 who wants it they really do not want 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.060
 waste time have fast everything 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.680
 well money time is money like that 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.660
 that as you can see here I thought that the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.180
 had in last location change the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.070
 place of appearance to last location not 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.510
 a property if you got this one 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.010
 fail just as I do not worry 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.090
 just go down to the garage and 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.090
 go back to grab the bugatti 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.050
 what there is now once we leave 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.940
 let's meet the saints custom is 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.010
 again if you did it well and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.000
 Press it last location 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.160
 you should just see the bugatti 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.350
 cloned a bugatti that falls from the sky 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.840
 but it's usually parked 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.000
 Turned as you can see now I'm going to 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.560
 ask my friend linker to bring me 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.450
 new the car that was flying him 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.250
 you have to have the car flying all the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.470
 time all the time you can not let go 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.090
 or anything so I tell him he will intervene 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.740
 in the car with care web please 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.360
 very carefully is the damn thing that 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.060
 way to deliver the cars true what 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.760
 How to deliver insurance linker before 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.310
 all then as you can see there are two the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.460
 duplicate will be again at a 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.020
 friend to get on that car eye if not 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.880
 have been many friends and have several 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.470
 friends in this lobby is much better but 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.400
 if not simply tell the charge 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.410
 vote in this case would be the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.360
 interpretation of the car and that it targets 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.220
 my car because there is once the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.050
 another person in the car all the time 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.580
 we will be able to enter and sell 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.079
 the vehicle for 7 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.940
 24 thousand 200 dollars if they can so 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.130
 sell as you can see we sold a car 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.270
 duplicated the other car is here see 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.040
 that my friend was driving him 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.530
 will be all the time inside these 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.970
 essential parts of the glitch and crumbs in 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.280
 the most important thing I am going to return to 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.680
 repeat that the box position is always 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.450
 flying with your car and that when 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.060
 go to sell the person to your friend 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.860
 is mounted on your original car not on 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.750
 the car duplicated this can be done 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.550
 unlimited crumbs but not with the 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.380
 same car then simply 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.610
 they would have to go back to their house or call 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.680
 I prefer to call the mechanic the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.870
 mechanic and grab another super car 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.700
 Do the same thing again ask the friend 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.830
 to raise it up as you can see here there 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.740
 lift raise me grab a height 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.690
 that you consider unfair I do not know very 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.400
 well what is the height and we are going to 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.260
 go to the xbox or playstation3 store 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.720
 we wait for them to invite us and 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.910
 we sell again it has been easy and gas is 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.800
 very easy this clichÃ© I think they give a lot 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.530
 money for this is very easy it will take 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.480
 how much two minutes and they do it well 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.520
 they get what they are 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.560
 very easy million more than half a million is 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.400
 and they have very good cars so I 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.350
 I'm talent and gas 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.139

 brought the kings the csu juan and all that 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.340
 so to another thing friends that see here 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.350
 it is likely that sometimes your clone 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.900
 be in your car and treat them 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.970
 run over so please kill what 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.710
 mate not so he does not steal his car and 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.270
 can enter with this car duplicated 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.350
 as you see here that is the duplicate and what 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.350
 sell it that easy 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.030
 why
