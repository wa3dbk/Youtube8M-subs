00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
remote start system here in order to

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.850 
remote start system here in order to
take<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.130> out<00:01:12.399> first<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.119> need<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.630> take<00:01:13.990> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
take it out first you need to take the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.120 
take it out first you need to take the
exhaust<00:01:15.280> out<00:01:15.970> this<00:01:16.570> is<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.259> tune<00:01:17.560> pipe<00:01:17.890> you

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
exhaust out this is the tune pipe you

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.690 
exhaust out this is the tune pipe you
need<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.399> take<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.729> out<00:01:18.880> so<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:20.080> got<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.710> spring

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
need to take it out so I got this spring

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.410 
need to take it out so I got this spring
tool<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.690> get<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.110> exhaust<00:01:23.619> spring<00:01:24.130> out<00:01:24.420> let

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
tool to get the exhaust spring out let

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.870 
tool to get the exhaust spring out let
us<00:01:25.450> do<00:01:26.080> it

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.980 

carefully<00:01:32.750> remove<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.080> spring<00:01:34.630> what<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:35.660> would

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
carefully remove the spring what I would

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.740 
carefully remove the spring what I would
do<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.380> simply<00:01:36.800> take<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.820> exhaust<00:01:38.240> out<00:01:38.480> from

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
do is simply take the exhaust out from

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.660 
do is simply take the exhaust out from
here<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:40.570> then<00:01:41.570> try<00:01:41.870> to<00:01:41.930> remove<00:01:42.380> this<00:01:42.620> one<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
here and then try to remove this one the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.310 
here and then try to remove this one the
complete<00:01:44.150> piece<00:01:49.750> okay<00:01:50.750> after<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.170> have

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
complete piece okay after you have

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.410 
complete piece okay after you have
removed<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.830> exhaust<00:01:52.280> pipe<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:53.180> easy

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
removed the exhaust pipe the easy

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.960 
removed the exhaust pipe the easy
approach<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.979> take<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.490> rear<00:01:55.700> suspension

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
approach is to take the rear suspension

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.990 
approach is to take the rear suspension
out<00:01:56.630> which<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.470> very<00:01:57.650> easy<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.580> have<00:01:58.790> one

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
out which is very easy you have one

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.650 
out which is very easy you have one
screw<00:01:59.450> here<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.500> take<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.950> out<00:02:01.100> from<00:02:01.430> this

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
screw here to take it out from this

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.900 
screw here to take it out from this
support<00:02:02.660> and<00:02:02.870> four<00:02:03.560> screws<00:02:03.979> here<00:02:04.310> back<00:02:04.610> side

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
support and four screws here back side

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.270 
support and four screws here back side
so<00:02:05.570> what<00:02:05.720> I'm<00:02:05.840> going<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.080> do<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.530> take<00:02:07.070> these

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
so what I'm going to do is take these

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:17.740 
so what I'm going to do is take these
four<00:02:07.640> screws<00:02:07.940> out<00:02:08.300> first

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.350 

next<00:02:18.750> one<00:02:19.050> more<00:02:19.260> screw<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.830> take<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.580> we

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
next one more screw to take out and we

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:30.270 
next one more screw to take out and we
can<00:02:21.540> take<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> suspension<00:02:22.260> out<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.770> here

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.060 

now<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.760> pull<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.120> out<00:02:35.740> alright<00:02:36.740> now<00:02:37.010> that

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
now just pull it out alright now that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.310 
now just pull it out alright now that
the<00:02:37.340> suspension<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.940> out<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.480> very<00:02:38.780> easy<00:02:39.080> to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
the suspension is out it's very easy to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.220 
the suspension is out it's very easy to
take<00:02:39.500> these<00:02:39.770> four<00:02:40.100> screws<00:02:40.460> out<00:02:40.640> I'm<00:02:40.940> using<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
take these four screws out I'm using a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:52.340 
take these four screws out I'm using a
two<00:02:42.440> millimeter<00:02:42.800> hex<00:02:43.100> wrench

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.050 

these<00:02:53.350> are<00:02:53.530> pretty<00:02:53.740> long<00:02:54.040> screws<00:02:54.520> actually

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
these are pretty long screws actually

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.780 
these are pretty long screws actually
but<00:02:55.930> once<00:02:56.170> they<00:02:56.350> are<00:02:56.410> out<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.520> easily

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
but once they are out you can easily

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.100 
but once they are out you can easily
pull<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:59.020> remote<00:02:59.350> start<00:02:59.680> out<00:02:59.920> now<00:03:01.110> these

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.960 
wires are soldered here so do not pull
on<00:03:05.080> them<00:03:05.290> but<00:03:05.800> you<00:03:05.860> can<00:03:06.160> actually<00:03:06.340> fix<00:03:06.760> them

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970

see<00:03:22.170> what<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.410> wrong<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:24.760> gear<00:03:25.180> is

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
see what is wrong and which gear is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:36.789 
see what is wrong and which gear is
broken<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:26.230> there

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.259

actually<00:03:56.340> they<00:03:56.459> do<00:03:56.639> not<00:03:56.819> break<00:03:57.060> easily<00:03:57.620> but

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
actually they do not break easily but

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.740 
actually they do not break easily but
actually<00:03:59.159> what<00:03:59.340> happens<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.790> when<00:04:00.569> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
actually what happens that when the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.360 
actually what happens that when the
engine<00:04:01.079> is<00:04:01.170> flooded<00:04:01.620> which<00:04:01.799> actually<00:04:02.189> gets

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
engine is flooded which actually gets

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.849 
engine is flooded which actually gets
flooded<00:04:02.669> very<00:04:02.969> soon<00:04:03.299> using<00:04:03.719> remote<00:04:04.319> start<00:04:04.680> and

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
flooded very soon using remote start and

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.800 
flooded very soon using remote start and
we<00:04:05.099> still<00:04:05.430> try<00:04:05.669> to<00:04:05.730> crank<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.239> engine<00:04:06.510> out<00:04:06.629> by

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
we still try to crank the engine out by

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.899 
we still try to crank the engine out by
pressing<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.319> button<00:04:07.620> that's<00:04:08.310> where<00:04:08.669> we

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
pressing the button that's where we

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.909 
pressing the button that's where we
actually<00:04:09.090> damage<00:04:09.689> the<00:04:09.840> gears<00:04:10.079> because<00:04:10.500> we<00:04:10.829> are

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
actually damage the gears because we are

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.039 
actually damage the gears because we are
trying<00:04:11.219> to<00:04:11.430> stop<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.939> flooded<00:04:12.359> engine<00:04:12.870> and

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
trying to stop the flooded engine and

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.709 
trying to stop the flooded engine and
starting<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.069> flooded<00:04:14.489> engine<00:04:14.730> actually<00:04:15.449> can

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:15.719 
starting a flooded engine actually can

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.860 
starting a flooded engine actually can
rip<00:04:16.079> or<00:04:16.340> actually<00:04:17.340> can<00:04:17.549> snap<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.239> string<00:04:18.570> cord

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
rip or actually can snap the string cord

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.039 
rip or actually can snap the string cord
on<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.199> pull<00:04:19.500> start<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.979> can<00:04:20.579> easily<00:04:20.789> break<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
on a pull start it can easily break the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.770 
on a pull start it can easily break the
gears<00:04:22.500> which<00:04:22.949> are<00:04:23.130> given<00:04:23.490> here<00:04:23.759> as<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.599> can

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
gears which are given here as you can

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.850 
gears which are given here as you can
see<00:04:25.020> all<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.349> these<00:04:25.680> gears<00:04:26.099> are<00:04:26.599> ok<00:04:27.599> in<00:04:28.050> my<00:04:28.500> case

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
see all of these gears are ok in my case

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.820 
see all of these gears are ok in my case
in<00:04:29.190> my<00:04:29.250> remote<00:04:29.699> start<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.690> this<00:04:31.080> last<00:04:31.410> gear

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
in my remote start this this last gear

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.650 
in my remote start this this last gear
which<00:04:32.039> actually<00:04:32.400> comes<00:04:32.639> here<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.090> fits<00:04:33.389> on

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
which actually comes here and fits on

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.710 
which actually comes here and fits on
the<00:04:33.960> crankshaft<00:04:34.460> piece<00:04:35.460> given<00:04:35.880> there<00:04:36.060> this

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
the crankshaft piece given there this

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.770 
the crankshaft piece given there this
one<00:04:36.930> has<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.830> slipper<00:04:38.370> clutch<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:39.030> here<00:04:39.389> as<00:04:39.539> you

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
one has a slipper clutch in here as you

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.029 
one has a slipper clutch in here as you
can<00:04:39.990> see<00:04:40.380> which<00:04:41.039> is<00:04:41.250> fixed<00:04:41.610> just<00:04:42.539> in<00:04:42.780> case<00:04:43.110> so

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
can see which is fixed just in case so

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.860 
can see which is fixed just in case so
that<00:04:44.250> if<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:45.150> engine<00:04:45.509> is<00:04:45.599> flooded<00:04:46.610> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
that if the engine is flooded the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.870 
that if the engine is flooded the
slipper<00:04:48.870> clutch<00:04:48.900> will<00:04:49.590> make<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.099> gears<00:04:50.370> just

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
slipper clutch will make the gears just

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.659 
slipper clutch will make the gears just
slip<00:04:51.509> instead<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.199> breaking<00:04:52.500> however<00:04:53.280> still

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
slip instead of breaking however still

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.600 
slip instead of breaking however still
there<00:04:54.150> is<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> chance<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:54.990> if<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.500> do<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.979> too

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
there is a chance that if you do it too

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.700 
there is a chance that if you do it too
much<00:04:56.789> on<00:04:57.060> a<00:04:57.120> flooded<00:04:57.449> engine<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.409> slipper

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
much on a flooded engine the slipper

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.790 
much on a flooded engine the slipper
clutch<00:04:58.830> will<00:04:59.310> burn<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.909> we<00:05:00.750> stop<00:05:01.050> working<00:05:01.289> and

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
clutch will burn and we stop working and

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.129 
clutch will burn and we stop working and
finally<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.759> course<00:05:02.820> all<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.479> load<00:05:03.659> comes<00:05:03.960> to

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
finally of course all the load comes to

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.110 
finally of course all the load comes to
the<00:05:04.229> gears<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:05.370> gears<00:05:05.610> will<00:05:05.820> start

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
the gears and the gears will start

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.230 
the gears and the gears will start
breaking<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:06.960> this<00:05:07.199> is<00:05:07.349> it<00:05:07.530> um<00:05:07.880> let's<00:05:08.880> just

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
breaking so this is it um let's just

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.680 
breaking so this is it um let's just
assume<00:05:09.659> that<00:05:09.720> we<00:05:10.199> have<00:05:10.229> got<00:05:10.380> new<00:05:10.860> gears<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.759> we

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
assume that we have got new gears and we

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.899 
assume that we have got new gears and we
are<00:05:12.780> just<00:05:12.930> putting<00:05:13.110> them<00:05:13.380> back<00:05:13.560> in<00:05:13.880> make<00:05:14.880> sure

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
are just putting them back in make sure

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.860 
are just putting them back in make sure
this<00:05:15.360> one<00:05:15.599> is<00:05:16.400> facing<00:05:17.400> down<00:05:17.639> to<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.570> engine

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
this one is facing down to the engine

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:29.530 
this one is facing down to the engine
crankshaft

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.290 

see<00:05:30.540> all<00:05:30.810> cogs<00:05:31.230> are<00:05:31.620> meshed<00:05:32.250> together<00:05:32.700> very

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
see all cogs are meshed together very

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.240 
see all cogs are meshed together very
well<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.990> they're<00:05:34.200> not<00:05:34.380> very<00:05:34.440> easy<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:35.070> break

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
well and they're not very easy to break

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.850 
well and they're not very easy to break
unless<00:05:35.700> you're<00:05:36.270> trying<00:05:36.480> to<00:05:36.660> crank<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:37.200> flooded

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
unless you're trying to crank a flooded

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.140 
unless you're trying to crank a flooded
engine<00:05:38.040> over<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.580> over<00:05:38.790> again

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
engine over and over again

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.060
