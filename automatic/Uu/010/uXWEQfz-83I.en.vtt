first ever GPU review and you know why

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.189 
first ever GPU review and you know why
I'm<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.130> excited<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:15.570> isn't<00:00:15.960> really

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
I'm so excited because this isn't really

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.470 
I'm so excited because this isn't really
rocking<00:00:16.890> GPU<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.699> they're<00:00:17.789> finally<00:00:18.060> letting

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
rocking GPU and they're finally letting

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.630 
rocking GPU and they're finally letting
me<00:00:18.660> review<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.260> stuff<00:00:19.289> right<00:00:19.830> alright<00:00:20.460> so

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
me review some stuff right alright so

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.000 
me review some stuff right alright so
this<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> msi<00:00:21.539> gtx<00:00:22.609> 660ti<00:00:24.320> power<00:00:25.320> edition

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
this is the msi gtx 660ti power edition

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.210 
this is the msi gtx 660ti power edition
this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.820> crazy<00:00:27.300> GPU<00:00:27.869> card<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.560> has<00:00:28.710> triple

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
this is a crazy GPU card it has triple

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is a crazy GPU card it has triple
over<00:00:29.490> voltage<00:00:29.849> which<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.210> an<00:00:30.300> MSI<00:00:30.779> branding

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
over voltage which is an MSI branding

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.910 
over voltage which is an MSI branding
thing<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.130> enhanced<00:00:32.700> p<00:00:33.120> WM<00:00:33.809> design<00:00:34.290> not

thing and an enhanced p WM design not
bad<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.630> particular<00:00:37.079> card<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
bad right so this particular card is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.860 
bad right so this particular card is
designed<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.670> based<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> scene<00:00:39.329> chip<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the 676 80 and 690 from Nvidia it's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.930 
the 676 80 and 690 from Nvidia it's
great<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.469> enthusiasts<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.340> great<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
great for enthusiasts it's great you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.310 
great for enthusiasts it's great you
know<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.239> you're<00:00:45.390> trying<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> next

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
know if you're trying to get to the next

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260 
know if you're trying to get to the next
level<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.070> trying<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> spend<00:00:47.730> too<00:00:48.090> much

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
level but not trying to spend too much

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
level but not trying to spend too much
money<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.980> perfect<00:00:50.160> card

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
money so this is really a perfect card

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.810 
money so this is really a perfect card
now<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> also<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> twin<00:00:52.320> frozer<00:00:53.010> for

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
now it also comes with a twin frozer for

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.939 
now it also comes with a twin frozer for
this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> fourth<00:00:54.510> edition<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.500> cooler

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this is the fourth edition of the cooler

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
this is the fourth edition of the cooler
that's<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:56.940> mounted<00:00:57.449> onto<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> GPU

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that's actually mounted onto the GPU

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.130 
that's actually mounted onto the GPU
it's<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.530> dual<00:00:58.770> fan<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.359> blades<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.840> really

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
it's a dual fan so the blades are really

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
it's a dual fan so the blades are really
cool<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.410> we'll<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.949> into<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:03.210> open

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
cool and we'll get into that as we open

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
cool and we'll get into that as we open
up<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> package<00:01:03.809> let's<00:01:04.379> check<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> out<00:01:04.830> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
up the package let's check it out so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
up the package let's check it out so
since<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.090> first<00:01:06.240> ever<00:01:06.780> GPU<00:01:07.590> card

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
since this is my first ever GPU card

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.399 
since this is my first ever GPU card
review<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.430> hope<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.659> my<00:01:09.810> research<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
review I hope that with my research and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.990 
review I hope that with my research and
with<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.710> I've<00:01:10.830> played<00:01:11.460> around<00:01:11.670> with<00:01:11.820> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
with what I've played around with this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
with what I've played around with this
card<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.080> excited<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.680> am

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
card you get just as excited as I am

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
card you get just as excited as I am
because<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> finally<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.030> car<00:01:15.390> that's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
because this is finally a car that's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.920 
because this is finally a car that's
affordable<00:01:16.320> enough<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.009> buy<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:18.119> has<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
affordable enough to buy but has all the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
affordable enough to buy but has all the
amazing<00:01:19.350> technology<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.240> 600<00:01:21.960> series

amazing technology as in the 600 series
from<00:01:22.380> Nvidia<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.070> said<00:01:23.250> before<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.700> got

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
from Nvidia like I said before it's got

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.830 
from Nvidia like I said before it's got
the<00:01:24.200> gk104<00:01:25.200> chip<00:01:26.070> design<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.540> all

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the gk104 chip design so you get all

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
the gk104 chip design so you get all
that<00:01:28.020> greatness<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> same<00:01:29.430> clock

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that greatness like the same clock

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
that greatness like the same clock
speeds<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.750> only<00:01:30.960> difference<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
speeds the only difference really is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.859 
speeds the only difference really is
that<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.060> hundred<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.659> ninety-two

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that there is a hundred and ninety-two

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.280 
that there is a hundred and ninety-two
bit<00:01:34.200> memory<00:01:34.439> bus<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.700> versus<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
256-bit memory bus on the gtx 670 now it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.480 
256-bit memory bus on the gtx 670 now it
also<00:01:41.310> has<00:01:41.549> two<00:01:41.759> gigs<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.210> gddr5<00:01:43.020> memory<00:01:43.460> with<00:01:44.460> a

also has two gigs of gddr5 memory with a
GPU<00:01:45.030> boost<00:01:45.479> which<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.920> does<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
GPU boost which what that does is it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.330 
GPU boost which what that does is it
adjusts<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.149> clock<00:01:48.479> speeds

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
adjusts your clock speeds

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.039

something<00:01:56.869> called<00:01:57.049> adaptive<00:01:57.350> vsync<00:01:57.979> now<00:01:58.490> what

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
something called adaptive vsync now what

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.059 
something called adaptive vsync now what
adaptive<00:01:59.119> vsync<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.600> it's<00:01:59.869> when<00:02:00.170> your<00:02:00.679> frame

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
adaptive vsync is it's when your frame

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.340 
adaptive vsync is it's when your frame
rate<00:02:01.100> goes<00:02:01.609> above<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.359> refresh<00:02:02.750> rate<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:03.170> your

adaptive these sinks turns off there's

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.370 
adaptive these sinks turns off there's
also<00:02:18.410> really<00:02:19.280> good<00:02:19.549> idle<00:02:20.209> power<00:02:20.510> consumption

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
also really good idle power consumption

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.039 
also really good idle power consumption
which<00:02:21.860> means<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.700> know<00:02:22.819> gamers<00:02:23.360> don't<00:02:23.690> game

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
which means you know gamers don't game

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.680 
which means you know gamers don't game
all<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.799> time<00:02:24.940> maybe<00:02:25.940> all<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.329> time<00:02:26.510> but

all the time maybe all the time but

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.420 
all the time maybe all the time but
there<00:02:26.870> are<00:02:26.989> some<00:02:27.200> times<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:27.799> you<00:02:28.250> take<00:02:28.400> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
there are some times when you take a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.430 
there are some times when you take a
break<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.150> actually<00:02:29.360> are<00:02:29.930> checking

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
is really cool and what I want to point

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.759 
is really cool and what I want to point
out<00:03:01.069> is<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.519> actual<00:03:01.850> blade<00:03:02.269> technology<00:03:02.870> now

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
out is the actual blade technology now

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.650 
out is the actual blade technology now
if<00:03:03.889> you<00:03:03.980> see<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> blades<00:03:04.609> are<00:03:04.790> kind<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.150> coded

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
if you see the blades are kind of coded

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.800 
if you see the blades are kind of coded
and<00:03:06.049> slanted<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.459> special<00:03:07.849> way<00:03:08.030> what<00:03:08.660> this

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
and slanted in a special way what this

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.920 
and slanted in a special way what this
does<00:03:09.079> is<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.709> allows<00:03:09.920> for<00:03:10.579> reduction<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.660> noise

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
does is it allows for reduction of noise

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.309 
does is it allows for reduction of noise
and<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:13.489> allows<00:03:13.790> for<00:03:14.030> better<00:03:14.180> air<00:03:14.510> flow<00:03:14.840> so

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
and it allows for better air flow so

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.289 
and it allows for better air flow so
you've<00:03:15.500> got<00:03:15.530> less<00:03:16.370> noise<00:03:16.639> more<00:03:17.090> airflow

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
you've got less noise more airflow

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.960 
you've got less noise more airflow
thanks<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.410> really<00:03:18.680> cool<00:03:19.099> design<00:03:19.760> and

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
thanks to that really cool design and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.300 
thanks to that really cool design and
coding<00:03:20.239> on<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.720> blade<00:03:20.959> now<00:03:21.470> another<00:03:22.190> thing

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
coding on the blade now another thing

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.819 
coding on the blade now another thing
that<00:03:22.700> they<00:03:22.819> did<00:03:22.880> here<00:03:23.329> msi<00:03:23.870> is<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.440> actual

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
that they did here msi is the actual

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.210 
that they did here msi is the actual
dust<00:03:25.419> propellant<00:03:26.419> technology<00:03:27.139> now<00:03:28.010> what<00:03:28.190> that

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
dust propellant technology now what that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.420 
dust propellant technology now what that
does<00:03:28.669> is<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.269> fan<00:03:29.480> spins<00:03:30.049> in<00:03:30.349> full<00:03:30.739> reverse<00:03:31.160> at

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
does is the fan spins in full reverse at

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.610 
does is the fan spins in full reverse at
system<00:03:31.970> start<00:03:32.239> for<00:03:32.510> about<00:03:32.660> 30<00:03:32.930> seconds<00:03:33.440> or

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
system start for about 30 seconds or

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.009 
system start for about 30 seconds or
until<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:34.310> system<00:03:34.609> drivers<00:03:35.000> load<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.510> that's

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
until the system drivers load and that's

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.409 
until the system drivers load and that's
pretty<00:03:36.500> much<00:03:36.620> how<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.310> reduces<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.120> removes

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
pretty much how it reduces and removes

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.259 
pretty much how it reduces and removes
dust

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
dust

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.330 
dust
and<00:03:40.269> take<00:03:40.629> a<00:03:40.659> look<00:03:40.959> at<00:03:41.079> these<00:03:41.230> pipes<00:03:41.650> these<00:03:42.219> are

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
and take a look at these pipes these are

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.630 
and take a look at these pipes these are
really<00:03:42.579> cool<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:44.260> way<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.620> msi<00:03:45.040> set<00:03:45.310> this<00:03:45.459> up

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
really cool the way that msi set this up

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.550 
really cool the way that msi set this up
is<00:03:45.849> you<00:03:45.969> see<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.239> have<00:03:46.450> your<00:03:46.780> your<00:03:47.230> thicker

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
is you see you have your your thicker

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.979 
is you see you have your your thicker
pipe<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.219> you're<00:03:48.340> thinner<00:03:48.579> type<00:03:48.879> now<00:03:49.150> this

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
pipe and you're thinner type now this

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.649 
pipe and you're thinner type now this
pipe<00:03:50.349> which<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.159> bigger<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.420> one<00:03:52.569> that's

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
pipe which is bigger is the one that's

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.899 
pipe which is bigger is the one that's
furthest<00:03:53.019> away<00:03:53.109> from<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.530> actual<00:03:53.950> GPU<00:03:54.609> in<00:03:54.819> it

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
furthest away from the actual GPU in it

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.580 
furthest away from the actual GPU in it
and<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.239> takes<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.780> heat<00:03:55.959> away<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:56.290> it

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
and it takes the heat away so it

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.020 
and it takes the heat away so it
transfers<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.129> hottest<00:03:57.430> feet<00:03:57.579> away<00:03:57.700> from<00:03:57.879> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
transfers the hottest feet away from the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.830 
transfers the hottest feet away from the
GPU<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.720> then<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.900> smaller<00:03:59.170> ones<00:03:59.500> actually

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
GPU and then the smaller ones actually

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.170 
GPU and then the smaller ones actually
carry<00:04:01.840> less<00:04:02.230> heat<00:04:02.560> around<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:03.220> GPU<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:04.000> it

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
carry less heat around the GPU so it

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.030 
carry less heat around the GPU so it
kind<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.510> evenly<00:04:04.900> distributes<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.799> heat

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
kind of evenly distributes the heat

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.099 
kind of evenly distributes the heat
throughout<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.700> entire<00:04:07.030> radiator<00:04:07.689> which<00:04:07.959> is

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
throughout the entire radiator which is

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.140 
throughout the entire radiator which is
pretty<00:04:08.290> much<00:04:08.439> covering<00:04:09.310> almost<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:10.120> whole

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
pretty much covering almost that whole

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.020 
pretty much covering almost that whole
card<00:04:10.719> now<00:04:11.549> let's<00:04:12.549> take<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.790> look<00:04:13.060> at<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.599> actual

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
power edition card which is what

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.529 
power edition card which is what
features<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.289> triple<00:05:14.919> over<00:05:15.639> voltage<00:05:16.240> so<00:05:16.419> this

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
features the triple over voltage so this

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.610 
features the triple over voltage so this
is<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.780> only

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
is the only

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.580 
is the only

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
660 that has triple overvoltage this

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.050 
660 that has triple overvoltage this
will<00:05:20.970> over<00:05:21.970> vote<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.540> core<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.560> PLL<00:05:24.130> and<00:05:24.370> the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
will over vote the core the PLL and the

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.600 
will over vote the core the PLL and the
memory<00:05:25.449> there<00:05:26.260> won't<00:05:26.470> be<00:05:26.620> another<00:05:26.860> 660<00:05:27.490> that

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
memory there won't be another 660 that

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.210 
memory there won't be another 660 that
will<00:05:27.699> be<00:05:27.790> able<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.300> over<00:05:28.960> both<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.199> core<00:05:29.710> so

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
will be able to over both the core so

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.129 
will be able to over both the core so
this<00:05:30.729> is<00:05:30.940> what<00:05:31.120> makes<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:31.479> a<00:05:31.540> very<00:05:31.570> unique

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
this is what makes it a very unique

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.050 
this is what makes it a very unique
unique<00:05:32.620> card<00:05:33.100> all<00:05:33.490> right<00:05:33.610> so<00:05:33.729> what<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:33.940> guys
