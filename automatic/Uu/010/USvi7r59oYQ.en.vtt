00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
bizarro something you can have you can

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.460 
bizarro something you can have you can
have<00:01:38.400> tremendous<00:01:39.000> rates<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.689> example<00:01:40.079> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
have tremendous rates for example you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.719 
have tremendous rates for example you
could<00:01:40.590> end<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.829> winning<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.159> hundred<00:01:41.549> K

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
could end up winning a hundred K

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
could end up winning a hundred K
depending<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
depending on you know what I what I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
depending on you know what I what I
decide<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.430> after<00:01:44.850> we've<00:01:45.000> I've<00:01:45.270> played

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
decide to do and after we've I've played

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
decide to do and after we've I've played
all<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> teams<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> maybe<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.399> expand<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
all the teams and maybe we can expand it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.929 
all the teams and maybe we can expand it
and<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.630> any<00:01:49.170> international<00:01:50.130> team<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.820> can

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and do it any international team you can

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.219 
and do it any international team you can
be<00:01:51.030> preserved<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> Brazil<00:01:51.780> whatever<00:01:52.079> or

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
be preserved as a Brazil whatever or

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.389 
be preserved as a Brazil whatever or
maybe<00:01:52.409> we'll<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.740> change<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> straight<00:01:53.369> up

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
maybe we'll just change it straight up

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
maybe we'll just change it straight up
to<00:01:53.670> normal<00:01:54.570> wages<00:01:54.720> again<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.229> we'll<00:01:55.619> just

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
to normal wages again I think we'll just

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.679 
to normal wages again I think we'll just
host<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.490> once<00:01:57.090> I've<00:01:57.270> played<00:01:57.509> every

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
host it as just once I've played every

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
host it as just once I've played every
single<00:01:58.200> team<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> world<00:01:59.640> cup<00:01:59.820> just

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
single team that's in the world cup just

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.819 
single team that's in the world cup just
to<00:02:00.090> make<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> one-month<00:02:01.049> fun<00:02:01.350> series<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
to make it like a one-month fun series I

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.170 
to make it like a one-month fun series I
think<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.250> them<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> promote<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> world

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
think that's them to promote the world

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.639 
think that's them to promote the world
cup<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.540> way<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> best

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
cup in a way I think that's the best

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.020 
cup in a way I think that's the best
solution<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.159> anyway<00:02:05.490> let's<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.759> into<00:02:05.880> this

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
solution so anyway let's get into this

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.940 
solution so anyway let's get into this
game<00:02:06.240> enough<00:02:06.450> jibber-jabber<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:07.530> note<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.740> me

from<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.450> gameplay<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.379> not<00:02:45.590> exactly<00:02:45.950> that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
from the gameplay it's not exactly that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.099 
from the gameplay it's not exactly that
I'm<00:02:46.250> dominating<00:02:46.669> it's<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.120> very<00:02:47.419> very<00:02:47.840> close

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109
