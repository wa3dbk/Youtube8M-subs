a little bit more and depth into the
game<00:00:32.199> so<00:00:32.860> let's<00:00:33.220> get<00:00:33.340> started<00:00:33.489> right<00:00:34.330> here

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
game so let's get started right here

game so let's get started right here
what<00:00:34.839> you<00:00:34.870> see<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.320> first<00:00:35.680> building<00:00:35.920> that

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
what you see is the first building that

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.920 
what you see is the first building that
you<00:00:36.549> start<00:00:36.909> off<00:00:37.059> with<00:00:37.360> which<00:00:37.629> is<00:00:37.780> your

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
you the ability to build other buildings

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.880 
you the ability to build other buildings
right<00:00:43.360> here<00:00:43.540> on<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.720> top<00:00:43.900> left<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:44.379> see<00:00:44.620> that

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
right here on the top left you see that

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.100 
right here on the top left you see that
you<00:00:45.610> will<00:00:45.729> have<00:00:45.879> your<00:00:46.030> construction<00:00:46.720> in<00:00:46.839> your

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
you will have your construction in your

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.729 
you will have your construction in your
production<00:00:47.860> q<00:00:48.809> here's<00:00:49.809> I'm<00:00:49.989> going<00:00:50.229> to<00:00:50.589> see

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
production q here's I'm going to see

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.579 
production q here's I'm going to see
that<00:00:50.860> I'm<00:00:50.949> going<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.190> build<00:00:51.400> a<00:00:51.580> supply<00:00:51.970> depot

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
that I'm going to build a supply depot

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.710 
that I'm going to build a supply depot
supply<00:00:53.589> depots<00:00:54.070> are<00:00:54.309> where<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:54.820> get<00:00:55.030> use<00:00:55.210> your

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
supply depots are where you get use your

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.859 
supply depots are where you get use your
resources<00:00:56.080> initially<00:00:57.010> from<00:00:57.220> so<00:00:57.909> buildings

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
resources initially from so buildings

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.359 
resources initially from so buildings
and<00:00:59.019> ruses<00:00:59.199> have<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.680> be<00:00:59.799> built<00:01:00.010> somewhere

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
and ruses have to be built somewhere

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.280 
and ruses have to be built somewhere
near<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.790> road<00:01:01.119> so<00:01:01.390> if<00:01:01.510> there's<00:01:01.689> no<00:01:01.869> road<00:01:02.110> you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
near a road so if there's no road you

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.530 
near a road so if there's no road you
can<00:01:02.530> build<00:01:02.830> it<00:01:02.949> supply<00:01:03.580> depots<00:01:03.970> are<00:01:04.089> even<00:01:04.360> more

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
can build it supply depots are even more

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.210 
can build it supply depots are even more
limited<00:01:04.750> because<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.530> can<00:01:05.650> only<00:01:05.710> build<00:01:06.040> them

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
limited because you can only build them

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.700 
limited because you can only build them
where<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.940> supply<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:07.630> which<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.320> where<00:01:08.500> those

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
where the supply is which is where those

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.520 
where the supply is which is where those
yellow<00:01:09.250> squares<00:01:10.030> are<00:01:10.360> right<00:01:11.140> here<00:01:11.260> you<00:01:11.350> see

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
yellow squares are right here you see

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.290 
yellow squares are right here you see
that<00:01:11.650> I<00:01:11.740> have<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:12.130> construction<00:01:12.700> truck<00:01:12.970> going

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
that I have a construction truck going

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.440 
that I have a construction truck going
from<00:01:13.480> my<00:01:13.570> headquarters<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.440> my<00:01:14.620> supply<00:01:15.010> depot

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
from my headquarters to my supply depot

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.790 
from my headquarters to my supply depot
and<00:01:16.450> once<00:01:17.020> he<00:01:17.110> gets<00:01:17.410> there<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.710> the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
and once he gets there to the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.860 
and once he gets there to the
construction<00:01:18.190> begins<00:01:18.670> that's<00:01:19.270> important

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
construction begins that's important

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.420 
construction begins that's important
because<00:01:19.990> if<00:01:20.290> my<00:01:20.410> construction<00:01:20.800> truck<00:01:21.160> does

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
because if my construction truck does

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.880 
because if my construction truck does
not<00:01:21.700> get<00:01:22.000> there<00:01:22.240> if<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.140> killed<00:01:23.440> along<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
not get there if it's killed along the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.650 
not get there if it's killed along the
way<00:01:24.010> then<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.280> lose<00:01:24.550> that<00:01:24.610> money<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.300> spent

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
way then I lose that money that I spent

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.410 
way then I lose that money that I spent
trying<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.080> build<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.470> supply<00:01:26.800> depot<00:01:26.910> I<00:01:27.910> hear

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
trying to build a supply depot I hear

trying to build a supply depot I hear
you<00:01:28.540> see<00:01:28.690> that<00:01:28.870> I<00:01:28.900> have<00:01:29.020> supplied<00:01:29.560> trucks<00:01:29.950> now

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
you see that I have supplied trucks now

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.740 
you see that I have supplied trucks now
going<00:01:30.430> from<00:01:30.610> my<00:01:30.760> depot<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.390> my<00:01:31.540> headquarters

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
going from my depot to my headquarters

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.290 
going from my depot to my headquarters
that's<00:01:32.530> every<00:01:33.130> time<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.490> those<00:01:33.700> trucks<00:01:34.030> get

anymore<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.540> that's<00:03:06.720> something<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.020> keep<00:03:07.200> in

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
anymore so that's something to keep in

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.860 
anymore so that's something to keep in
mind<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:08.360> administrative<00:03:09.360> buildings<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
mind and administrative buildings is a

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.780

way for you to build resources sort of

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.360 
way for you to build resources sort of
mid<00:03:12.030> game<00:03:12.300> too<00:03:12.600> late<00:03:12.810> game<00:03:13.140> they're<00:03:13.920> expensive

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
mid game too late game they're expensive

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.900 
mid game too late game they're expensive
so<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.820> better<00:03:15.180> use<00:03:15.420> them<00:03:15.630> wisely<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:17.640> see

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
so you better use them wisely you see

allows you to only build in certain
parts<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.400> map<00:03:26.610> otherwise<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.270> see

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
parts of the map otherwise you see

the middle of nowhere in the middle of
the<00:03:31.140> map<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.280> kind<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.610> gives<00:03:32.760> the

the map so it just kind of gives the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.640 
the map so it just kind of gives the
game<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.360> little<00:03:33.450> bit<00:03:33.690> more<00:03:33.930> structure<00:03:34.470> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
game a little bit more structure and

the layout of the map so here you see
I'm<00:03:56.130> putting<00:03:56.430> some<00:03:56.580> infantry<00:03:56.970> inside<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.750> a

town for an ambush that's important and

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.620 
town for an ambush that's important and
it's<00:04:01.560> sometimes<00:04:02.459> even<00:04:02.730> more<00:04:02.760> powerful<00:04:03.270> than

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
it's sometimes even more powerful than

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.820 
it's sometimes even more powerful than
putting<00:04:03.959> them<00:04:04.170> inside<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.070> woods<00:04:05.660> because

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
putting them inside of the woods because

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.220 
putting them inside of the woods because
you<00:04:07.830> can't<00:04:08.190> see<00:04:08.790> those<00:04:09.150> units<00:04:09.630> unless<00:04:09.989> you

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
you can't see those units unless you

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.470 
you can't see those units unless you
pretty<00:04:10.590> much<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.830> drive<00:04:11.400> over<00:04:11.430> them<00:04:11.940> or<00:04:12.180> fly

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
pretty much a drive over them or fly

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.720 
pretty much a drive over them or fly
over<00:04:12.810> them<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.650> if<00:04:13.770> your<00:04:13.920> drive<00:04:14.130> over<00:04:14.280> them<00:04:14.550> is

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
over them and if your drive over them is

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.220 
over them and if your drive over them is
too<00:04:14.910> late<00:04:15.060> because<00:04:15.270> you're<00:04:15.570> being<00:04:15.720> ambushed

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
too late because you're being ambushed

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.090 
too late because you're being ambushed
so<00:04:16.770> really<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.130> only<00:04:17.250> way<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.520> find<00:04:19.100> troops

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
so really the only way to find troops

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.680 
so really the only way to find troops
that<00:04:20.310> are<00:04:20.340> inside<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.910> town<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.480> really

that are inside of a town is to really

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.050 
that are inside of a town is to really
fly<00:04:22.020> over<00:04:22.289> them<00:04:22.470> away
