00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
these starters so first off for me

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.620 
these starters so first off for me
looking<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.159> macdanial<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.909> Meganium<00:01:51.420> comes

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
looking at macdanial now Meganium comes

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240 
looking at macdanial now Meganium comes
with<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.869> hidden<00:01:52.229> ability<00:01:52.619> leaf<00:01:52.920> guard

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
with this hidden ability leaf guard

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.399 
with this hidden ability leaf guard
which<00:01:53.490> prevents<00:01:54.329> status<00:01:54.750> conditions<00:01:55.229> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
which prevents status conditions in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.050 
which prevents status conditions in
sunny<00:01:55.770> weather<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> guess<00:01:56.549> that's<00:01:56.670> ok<00:01:57.030> for

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
sunny weather so I guess that's ok for

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.789 
sunny weather so I guess that's ok for
Sun<00:01:57.450> team<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.899> although<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.469> best

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
Sun team is although it's not the best

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.950 
Sun team is although it's not the best
in<00:01:58.979> ability<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.270> comes<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> random

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
in ability and it comes with a random

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
in ability and it comes with a random
nature<00:02:01.170> let's<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.920> comes<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> classic

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
nature let's see it comes with a classic

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.319 
nature let's see it comes with a classic
ribbon<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.090> can't<00:02:03.420> trade<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> GTS

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
ribbon so you can't trade it on the GTS

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.850 
ribbon so you can't trade it on the GTS
next<00:02:06.329> up<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.600> Typhlosion<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> hidden

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
next up we have Typhlosion with a hidden

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.529 
next up we have Typhlosion with a hidden
ability<00:02:07.950> flash<00:02:08.580> fire<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.209> actually<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
ability flash fire which is actually a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.510 
ability flash fire which is actually a
really<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:10.050> hidden<00:02:10.349> ability<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.860> basically

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
really good hidden ability it basically

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
really good hidden ability it basically
makes<00:02:11.760> Typhlosion<00:02:12.120> immune<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.900> fire<00:02:13.110> type

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
makes Typhlosion immune to fire type

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
makes Typhlosion immune to fire type
so<00:02:14.100> he<00:02:14.220> doesn't<00:02:14.370> take<00:02:14.490> any<00:02:14.670> damage<00:02:15.000> from<00:02:15.030> fire

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so he doesn't take any damage from fire

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330 
so he doesn't take any damage from fire
moves<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.870> when<00:02:16.410> he<00:02:16.470> gets<00:02:16.620> hit<00:02:16.830> by<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> fire

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
moves and when he gets hit by a fire

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.610 
moves and when he gets hit by a fire
move<00:02:17.580> his<00:02:17.880> fire<00:02:18.150> moves<00:02:18.420> will<00:02:18.600> get<00:02:18.750> stronger<00:02:19.110> so

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
move his fire moves will get stronger so

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.650 
move his fire moves will get stronger so
it's<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.860> really<00:02:20.190> good<00:02:20.370> ability<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.120> also<00:02:21.300> comes

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
it's a really good ability it also comes

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.120 
it's a really good ability it also comes
with<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> classic<00:02:22.230> ribbons<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.680> once<00:02:22.890> again

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
with the classic ribbons so once again

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
with the classic ribbons so once again
you<00:02:23.220> can't<00:02:23.430> trade<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:23.790> pokemon<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> GTS

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
you can't trade these pokemon on the GTS

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.470 
you can't trade these pokemon on the GTS
and<00:02:25.760> last<00:02:26.760> but<00:02:26.910> not<00:02:27.030> least<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.450> have

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and last but not least we have

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.270 
and last but not least we have
Feraligatr<00:02:27.900> who<00:02:28.440> comes<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> best

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
Feraligatr who comes with the best

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.190 
Feraligatr who comes with the best
ability<00:02:29.700> out<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.970> all<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.300> them<00:02:30.450> called<00:02:30.750> shear

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
ability out of all of them called shear

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.010 
ability out of all of them called shear
force<00:02:31.500> now<00:02:32.250> shear<00:02:32.610> force<00:02:32.910> although<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.750> does

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
force now shear force although it does

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.930 
force now shear force although it does
remove<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.530> second<00:02:34.950> effect<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.370> moons<00:02:35.640> so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
remove the second effect of moons so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.820 
remove the second effect of moons so
like<00:02:36.120> ice<00:02:36.540> punches<00:02:37.050> chance<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.530> freeze<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
like ice punches chance to freeze a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.010 
like ice punches chance to freeze a
pokemon<00:02:38.430> when<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.730> hit<00:02:38.850> them<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.360> makes<00:02:39.810> those

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
pokemon when you hit them it makes those

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.320 
pokemon when you hit them it makes those
moves<00:02:40.320> stronger<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:40.830> think<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.330> 33.3%

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
moves stronger I think it's 33.3%

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.570 
moves stronger I think it's 33.3%
stronger<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.170> it's<00:02:43.320> really<00:02:43.620> good<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.430> could

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
stronger so it's really good you could

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.250 
stronger so it's really good you could
also<00:02:44.700> combine<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.330> with<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.540> life<00:02:45.780> orb<00:02:46.050> to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
also combine this with a life orb to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.350 
also combine this with a life orb to
increase<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.710> damage<00:02:46.890> even<00:02:47.310> more<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.790> sheer

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
increase the damage even more and sheer

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.970 
increase the damage even more and sheer
force<00:02:48.630> will<00:02:48.840> move<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.260> damage<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.860> comes

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
force will move the damage that comes

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.220 
force will move the damage that comes
from<00:02:50.190> own<00:02:50.340> life<00:02:50.490> orb<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.030> shear<00:02:51.720> force<00:02:51.960> is<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
from own life orb so shear force is a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.930 
from own life orb so shear force is a
great<00:02:52.620> ability<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.250> increasing<00:02:53.640> your<00:02:53.730> moves

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
great ability for increasing your moves

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.120 
great ability for increasing your moves
