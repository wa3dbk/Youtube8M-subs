turning<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.219> boat<00:02:04.849> at<00:02:05.849> the<00:02:06.000> start<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.840> wind

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
turning the boat at the start the wind

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.990 
turning the boat at the start the wind
was<00:02:07.289> very<00:02:07.349> light<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> southeast<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
was very light from the southeast and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.509 
was very light from the southeast and
then<00:02:09.269> became<00:02:09.599> variable<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.310> difficult

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
then became variable so it was difficult

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.589 
then became variable so it was difficult
to<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.879> where<00:02:12.239> exactly<00:02:12.329> to<00:02:12.840> go<00:02:14.299> while<00:02:15.299> we

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
to know where exactly to go while we

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.280 
to know where exactly to go while we
drifted<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:17.190> blue<00:02:17.400> house<00:02:17.670> tener<00:02:18.299> found<00:02:18.959> peace

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
drifted the blue house tener found peace

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.770 
drifted the blue house tener found peace
on<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> mainland<00:02:20.099> shore

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.869 

eventually<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.260> breeze<00:02:25.500> lifted<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.760> we

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
eventually the breeze lifted and we

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.670 
eventually the breeze lifted and we
found<00:02:27.120> ourselves<00:02:27.299> on<00:02:27.750> collision<00:02:28.140> course<00:02:28.170> with

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
found ourselves on collision course with

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:41.619 
found ourselves on collision course with
a<00:02:28.980> more<00:02:29.280> Croatian<00:02:29.910> forget

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.259 

obviously<00:02:42.409> we<00:02:42.500> need<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.799> we<00:02:43.579> need<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.790> not<00:02:44.030> to

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
obviously we need it we need it not to

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.929 
obviously we need it we need it not to
attack<00:02:44.540> because<00:02:44.720> we<00:02:45.079> have<00:02:45.409> to<00:02:45.620> put<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.430> tax<00:02:46.760> in

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
attack because we have to put to tax in

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.490 
attack because we have to put to tax in
to<00:02:47.060> get<00:02:47.150> out<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.420> shallow<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:47.900> back<00:02:48.079> into<00:02:48.409> the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
to get out the shallow and back into the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.380 
to get out the shallow and back into the
deep<00:02:48.650> water<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.519> get<00:02:49.610> around<00:02:49.790> our<00:02:49.939> next<00:02:50.209> mark

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
deep water to get around our next mark

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.920 
deep water to get around our next mark
so<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.530> definitely<00:02:51.739> needed<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.400> stay<00:02:52.930> upwind

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
so we definitely needed to stay upwind

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.460 
so we definitely needed to stay upwind
of<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.569> needed<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.930> push<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.319> to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
of it so we just needed to push that to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.809 
of it so we just needed to push that to
the<00:02:57.530> last<00:02:57.680> limit<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.129> I<00:02:58.159> think<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:58.430> did<00:02:58.579> I

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
the last limit and I think we did I

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.210 
the last limit and I think we did I
think<00:02:58.879> everyone<00:02:59.329> stayed<00:02:59.780> focused<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:00.980> got

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
think everyone stayed focused and got

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.339 
think everyone stayed focused and got
out<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.579> rail<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.060> we<00:03:02.540> all<00:03:02.659> went<00:03:02.989> for<00:03:03.079> it

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
out on the rail and we all went for it

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.080 
out on the rail and we all went for it
we<00:03:03.439> all<00:03:03.560> knew<00:03:03.680> what<00:03:03.859> was<00:03:03.950> happening<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.519> so<00:03:04.700> it

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.600 
reason I'm doing it this year is because
I<00:04:12.670> recently<00:04:13.360> done<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.320> sale<00:04:14.500> plea<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
I recently done to sale plea and the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.460 
I recently done to sale plea and the
last<00:04:15.790> year<00:04:16.060> thought<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:17.020> would<00:04:17.140> be<00:04:17.260> quite<00:04:17.440> a

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
last year thought it would be quite a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.260 
last year thought it would be quite a
good<00:04:17.590> thing<00:04:17.860> for<00:04:18.070> me<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.190> do<00:04:18.370> as<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.730> bit<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.150> a

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
good thing for me to do as a bit of a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.150 
good thing for me to do as a bit of a
challenge<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.870> it's<00:04:20.260> quite<00:04:20.410> tough<00:04:20.560> race<00:04:23.160> he's

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
challenge and it's quite tough race he's

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.320 
challenge and it's quite tough race he's
the<00:04:24.280> best<00:04:24.460> cowboy

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.899

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
a dramatic change of cloud formation

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.929 
a dramatic change of cloud formation
signaled<00:04:38.810> an<00:04:38.990> approaching<00:04:39.500> school<00:04:39.939> and

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
signaled an approaching school and

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.730 
signaled an approaching school and
required<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:41.509> rapid<00:04:41.840> sale<00:04:42.080> change<00:04:42.439> to<00:04:42.710> a
