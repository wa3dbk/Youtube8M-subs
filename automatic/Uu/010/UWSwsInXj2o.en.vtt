00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
so I can't really say much about the

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.570 
so I can't really say much about the
gameplay<00:06:33.990> I've<00:06:34.470> read<00:06:34.800> that<00:06:34.830> it<00:06:35.070> is<00:06:35.190> very<00:06:35.460> much

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
gameplay I've read that it is very much

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.850 
gameplay I've read that it is very much
like<00:06:35.970> Mega<00:06:36.210> Man<00:06:36.450> and<00:06:36.660> it's<00:06:36.750> pretty<00:06:36.990> decent<00:06:37.200> so

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
