00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.980
 now we are waiting for the characteristics of the mitochondria, the functions of the structure and 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:08.979
 mitochondrial pathologies 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.519
 mitochondria are present in both animal and vegetable cells and theirs 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.369
 function the main one to get energy from the nourishment substances 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.890
 in addition to energy production the mitochondria intervene in the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.810
 regulation of the cell cycle in the regulation of the radox state of the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.320
 cell and cholesterol synthesis 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 furthermore mitochondrial mtdna ribosome proper 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 in this one of a thousand we are the mitochondria structure as it can be 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.940
 note has a generally elongated shape and consists of various 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 set off 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.490
 I put you in doggie and bounded by a double outer membrane in chat that 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.490
 allows the passage of small molecules 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.730
 in addition to the outer membrane there is also the internal cassidy ti membrane 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.190
 laments for me ante diem 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.360
 the space between the two membranes is called the mass in tons 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.700
 vespa center membrane accumulates mariani bianchina cabrio compact against 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.350
 the mitochondrial matrix gelatinous consistency 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.250
 ps contains numerous bolzano enzymes via moretti pdl to the circular double 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 filament 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.650
 as you can see the candy image inside - when it comes in shape 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.560
 of number and we are forgotten protruding 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.290
 these were called world holidays 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.160
 and who have the task of his feet, greater acclaim katty piva 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.140
 the main manifestations of mitochondrial diseases 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.090
 are first and foremost those of the central nervous system excel migraine la 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.170
 migraine dementia 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.080
 we find a pain on his side of the head feeling of nausea that pain 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.080
 gets worse with movement 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.059
 the dimension disturbance that concerns orientation language memories 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.989
 temporal space 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.940
 these are the links we copy obtained information on silent conversion of
