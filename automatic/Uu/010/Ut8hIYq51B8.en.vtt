review coming here is a lone wolf Lobo
it<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.350> dual<00:00:07.680> action<00:00:08.150> automatic<00:00:09.150> blade<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
it is a dual action automatic blade and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.499 
it is a dual action automatic blade and
it's<00:00:10.440> not<00:00:10.590> cheap<00:00:10.889> around<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.000> two<00:00:12.179> hundred

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
it's not cheap around the two hundred

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180 
it's not cheap around the two hundred
dollar<00:00:12.690> mark<00:00:12.960> probably<00:00:13.620> less<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
dollar mark probably less on the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.580 
dollar mark probably less on the
internet<00:00:14.639> if<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.820> look<00:00:14.910> around<00:00:15.379> very<00:00:16.379> unusual

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
internet if you look around very unusual

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.640 
internet if you look around very unusual
design<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.449> cool<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.080> cool<00:00:19.320> blade

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
design and it's cool it's a cool blade

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.220 
design and it's cool it's a cool blade
and<00:00:20.000> by<00:00:21.000> double<00:00:21.420> action<00:00:21.600> let<00:00:21.930> me<00:00:22.020> show<00:00:22.199> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and by double action let me show you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
and by double action let me show you
what<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> mean<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:23.220> off<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.910> function<00:00:24.210> as

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
what I mean first off it can function as

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.339 
what I mean first off it can function as
an<00:00:24.840> automatic<00:00:25.410> knife<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.609> actuate<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
an automatic knife if you actuate this

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
an automatic knife if you actuate this
scale<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.820> just

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
scale and the way we do that is just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.979 
scale and the way we do that is just
kind<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> slide<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.809> see<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:33.960> that

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
kind of slide it like so see now that

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
kind of slide it like so see now that
moves<00:00:34.469> that's<00:00:35.250> how<00:00:35.489> you're<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.850> actuate

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
moves that's how you're going to actuate

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.680 
moves that's how you're going to actuate
it<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.690> an<00:00:36.960> automatic<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> double<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
it as an automatic not the double or the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.810 
it as an automatic not the double or the
second<00:00:40.230> way<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> actuated<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> blade<00:00:41.489> will<00:00:41.700> be

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
second way of actuated the blade will be

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.930 
second way of actuated the blade will be
just<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.210> manual<00:00:42.690> action<00:00:42.899> folder<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> can

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
just a manual action folder so you can

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.180 
just a manual action folder so you can
actually<00:00:45.180> carry<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.320> knife<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
actually carry and use this knife as you

out in an automatic fashion and then

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.330 
out in an automatic fashion and then
you'll<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> they'll<00:02:01.799> say<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> don't<00:02:02.280> know

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
small too small for me that's not to say

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.420 
small too small for me that's not to say
it<00:03:11.810> couldn't<00:03:12.050> function<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.590> way<00:03:12.740> if<00:03:12.890> surely

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
it couldn't function that way if surely

it<00:03:13.550> could<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:15.110> will<00:03:16.100> that's<00:03:16.460> just<00:03:16.670> a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it could I just will that's just a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.340 
it could I just will that's just a

down give us options also the clip is

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.820 
down give us options also the clip is
very<00:05:40.880> simplistic<00:05:41.570> for<00:05:41.780> this<00:05:41.900> price<00:05:42.260> point<00:05:42.290> of

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
very simplistic for this price point of

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.740 
very simplistic for this price point of
a<00:05:42.890> knife<00:05:43.070> I<00:05:43.310> would<00:05:43.430> expect<00:05:43.790> a<00:05:44.030> little<00:05:44.360> bit<00:05:44.510> more

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
a knife I would expect a little bit more

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.250 
a knife I would expect a little bit more
and<00:05:45.700> i<00:05:46.700> can't<00:05:47.210> really<00:05:47.330> critique<00:05:47.600> its<00:05:47.990> strong

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
and i can't really critique its strong

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.440 
and i can't really critique its strong
strength<00:05:49.100> it<00:05:49.370> seems<00:05:49.580> like<00:05:49.730> a<00:05:49.760> very<00:05:49.820> strong

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
strength it seems like a very strong

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.320 
strength it seems like a very strong
clip<00:05:50.840> but<00:05:51.620> i<00:05:51.980> would<00:05:52.190> definitely<00:05:52.550> like<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:52.850> have

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
clip but i would definitely like to have

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.150 
clip but i would definitely like to have
the<00:05:53.450> option<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:53.990> course<00:05:54.230> for<00:05:54.500> tip<00:05:54.680> up<00:05:54.860> carry

the option of course for tip up carry

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.300 
the option of course for tip up carry
but<00:05:56.120> can't<00:05:56.900> have<00:05:57.020> everything<00:05:57.350> by<00:05:58.100> the<00:05:58.160> way

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
it identical just identical so if you

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.570 
it identical just identical so if you
like<00:06:29.870> the<00:06:30.080> spyderco<00:06:30.590> where<00:06:31.160> the<00:06:31.280> pellet

paramilitaries<00:06:32.510> handles<00:06:33.020> you'll<00:06:33.200> like<00:06:33.440> this

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
paramilitaries handles you'll like this

so<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.449> same<00:06:35.660> can<00:06:35.840> be<00:06:35.870> said<00:06:35.930> for<00:06:36.169> the<00:06:36.949> crkt

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
so the same can be said for the crkt

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.999 
so the same can be said for the crkt
drifter<00:06:38.240> same<00:06:38.569> type<00:06:38.810> they're<00:06:39.229> probably<00:06:39.560> the

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
drifter same type they're probably the

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.010 
drifter same type they're probably the

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
same supplier that's doing them you can

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.779 
same supplier that's doing them you can
take<00:06:42.259> the<00:06:42.289> scales<00:06:42.650> off<00:06:42.889> thankfully<00:06:43.340> they're

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
take the scales off thankfully they're

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.900 
take the scales off thankfully they're

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
using mini Torx screws there to do it so

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.210 
using mini Torx screws there to do it so
that<00:06:46.940> should<00:06:47.419> be<00:06:47.449> an<00:06:47.630> easy<00:06:47.900> affair<00:06:48.410> the
