comment<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:11.479> notice<00:01:12.479> how<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.750> guys<00:01:13.020> we've

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
comment I notice how these guys we've

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
comment I notice how these guys we've
got<00:01:13.380> quite<00:01:15.140> cool<00:01:16.189> redhounds<00:01:17.240> which<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.360> think

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
got quite cool redhounds which I think

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.130 
got quite cool redhounds which I think
are<00:01:18.720> quite<00:01:18.900> rare<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.530> relatively<00:01:20.070> rare<00:01:21.140> that's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
are quite rare or relatively rare that's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.990 
are quite rare or relatively rare that's
certainly<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:23.299> everyday<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.630> eight<00:01:24.780> pieces

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
certainly not everyday like eight pieces

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.030 
certainly not everyday like eight pieces
and<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.090> finally<00:01:27.540> had<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.960> droid<00:01:28.320> who<00:01:28.799> has

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and I finally had this droid who has

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.649 
and I finally had this droid who has
this<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> large<00:01:29.520> gun<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.280> sits<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> back

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.050 

this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.810> why<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.700> little<00:01:38.700> ships

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this is why this is the little ships

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.859 
this is why this is the little ships
compartment<00:01:40.490> he<00:01:41.490> swaps<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.909> their<00:01:42.090> members<00:01:42.840> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
compartment he swaps in their members to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.520 
compartment he swaps in their members to
folding<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> then<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.229> guy's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
folding and then here is this guy's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.070 
folding and then here is this guy's
little<00:01:46.920> house

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
it's a little space and that just goes

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.120 
it's a little space and that just goes
neatly<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.110> top<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.890> that

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
neatly on top like that and that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.440 
neatly on top like that and that
completes<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.959> vehicle<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:07.670> vehicle<00:03:07.700> has

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
completes the vehicle the vehicle has

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.160 
completes the vehicle the vehicle has
some<00:03:09.080> really<00:03:09.739> really<00:03:09.950> cool<00:03:10.130> wheel<00:03:11.020> wheels<00:03:12.020> it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
some really really cool wheel wheels it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.710 
some really really cool wheel wheels it
has<00:03:12.290> ten<00:03:12.620> wheels<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.070> total<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:14.420> they're

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
has ten wheels in total and as they're

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.180 
has ten wheels in total and as they're
on<00:03:14.840> two<00:03:15.050> different<00:03:15.380> layers<00:03:15.530> they<00:03:15.830> spin<00:03:16.100> in

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
on two different layers they spin in

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.890 
on two different layers they spin in
opposite<00:03:16.550> directions<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.450> looks<00:03:17.630> very

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
opposite directions so it looks very

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.250 
opposite directions so it looks very
impressive<00:03:18.110> as<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.769> moves<00:03:18.950> along<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.840> body<00:03:21.050> of

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
impressive as it moves along the body of

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.229 
impressive as it moves along the body of
it<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.830> shape<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.400> it's<00:03:22.670> just<00:03:22.970> quite

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
it just the shape of it it's just quite

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.740 
it just the shape of it it's just quite
impressive<00:03:23.840> house<00:03:24.110> so<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:25.459> starts<00:03:25.790> very<00:03:25.970> very

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
impressive house so it starts very very

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.930 
impressive house so it starts very very
wide<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.800> then<00:03:27.920> comes<00:03:28.250> up<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.670> then<00:03:28.760> goes

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
wide and then comes up and then goes

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.090 
wide and then comes up and then goes
back<00:03:28.970> out<00:03:29.360> again<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.590> get<00:03:30.709> these<00:03:30.830> big

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
back out again and you get these big

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.759 
back out again and you get these big
shoulders<00:03:32.050> here<00:03:33.050> you've<00:03:33.170> got<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.290> nice<00:03:33.500> solid

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
shoulders here you've got a nice solid

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.360 
shoulders here you've got a nice solid
base<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.400> big<00:03:34.700> sort<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.180> big<00:03:35.570> top<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:37.220> that

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
base and big sort of big top and that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.630 
base and big sort of big top and that
could<00:03:37.610> swivel<00:03:37.910> around<00:03:38.090> as<00:03:38.420> much<00:03:38.600> as<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.810> like

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
could swivel around as much as you like

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.530 
could swivel around as much as you like
and<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:41.239> arms<00:03:41.860> also<00:03:43.000> there<00:03:44.000> are<00:03:44.060> hints<00:03:44.300> in<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
and the arms also there are hints in the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.930 
and the arms also there are hints in the
middle<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:44.989> they<00:03:45.080> can<00:03:45.310> move<00:03:46.310> around<00:03:46.370> like<00:03:46.730> that

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
middle so they can move around like that

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.290 
middle so they can move around like that
yeah<00:03:47.510> grab<00:03:47.930> on<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:49.090> also<00:03:50.090> spins<00:03:50.600> around

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
yeah grab on here also spins around

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.420 
yeah grab on here also spins around
obviously<00:03:53.300> you've<00:03:53.690> got<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:54.019> magnet<00:03:54.800> so<00:03:55.340> you

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
obviously you've got that magnet so you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.470 
obviously you've got that magnet so you
could<00:03:55.580> hold<00:03:55.820> up<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.150> box<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.130> back<00:03:58.480> you

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
could hold up that box on the back you

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.870 
could hold up that box on the back you
have<00:03:59.660> two<00:03:59.900> levers<00:04:00.110> up<00:04:00.350> there

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
have two levers up there

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:10.610 
have two levers up there
so<00:04:03.440> let's<00:04:04.440> lift<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.770> up<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.130> then<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:09.630> or<00:04:09.900> you

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
so let's lift it up and then that or you

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.540 
so let's lift it up and then that or you
could<00:04:10.770> just<00:04:10.830> go<00:04:11.070> crying<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:14.010> case<00:04:14.280> there<00:04:14.460> are

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
could just go crying in case there are

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.770 
could just go crying in case there are
any<00:04:14.580> black<00:04:14.970> drones<00:04:16.730> trying<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.880> reach<00:04:18.060> it

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
any black drones trying to reach it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.370 
any black drones trying to reach it
black<00:04:19.470> Tron<00:04:19.800> was<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.540> opposing<00:04:21.540> series<00:04:22.170> to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
black Tron was the opposing series to

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.700 
black Tron was the opposing series to
the<00:04:22.440> spurious<00:04:24.170> there<00:04:25.170> was<00:04:25.260> only<00:04:25.380> ever<00:04:25.590> one

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
the spurious there was only ever one

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.100 
the spurious there was only ever one
series<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.550> spyrius<00:04:27.150> whereas<00:04:27.480> then<00:04:27.660> there

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
series of spyrius whereas then there

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.260 
series of spyrius whereas then there
have<00:04:28.200> been<00:04:28.250> two<00:04:29.250> blacks<00:04:29.610> from<00:04:29.940> there<00:04:30.180> have

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
have been two blacks from there have

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.800 
have been two blacks from there have
been<00:04:30.330> about<00:04:30.510> three<00:04:30.990> space<00:04:31.350> police<00:04:32.810> Safari

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
been about three space police Safari

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.720 
been about three space police Safari
it's<00:04:34.020> never<00:04:34.230> really<00:04:34.620> caught<00:04:34.920> on<00:04:34.950> but<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.430> still

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
it's never really caught on but I still

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.500 
it's never really caught on but I still
think<00:04:35.940> it's<00:04:36.060> quite<00:04:36.210> this<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.970> yeah<00:04:38.970> that

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
think it's quite this is the yeah that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.260 
think it's quite this is the yeah that
this<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.870> how<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.230> actual<00:04:41.030> function<00:04:42.030> works

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
this is how the actual function works

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.790 
this is how the actual function works
you<00:04:42.690> can<00:04:42.840> see<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.140> a<00:04:43.170> gray<00:04:43.380> piece<00:04:43.620> of

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
you can see that a gray piece of

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.830 
you can see that a gray piece of
stuffing<00:04:44.160> that<00:04:44.250> cog<00:04:44.520> from<00:04:45.240> moving<00:04:45.450> but<00:04:45.690> one

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
stuffing that cog from moving but one

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.880 
stuffing that cog from moving but one
let's<00:04:45.990> lift<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.320> up<00:04:47.330> young<00:04:48.330> Bulls<00:04:48.600> down<00:04:51.890> very

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
let's lift it up young Bulls down very

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.390 
let's lift it up young Bulls down very
simple

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
simple

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.570 
simple
I<00:04:53.720> very<00:04:54.720> easy<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.170> build<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:56.070> when<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.280> first

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
I very easy to build that when I first

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.370 
I very easy to build that when I first
got<00:04:56.760> this<00:04:56.910> set<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.300> didn't<00:04:57.570> appreciate<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
got this set I didn't appreciate the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.340 
got this set I didn't appreciate the
number<00:04:59.280> of<00:04:59.340> pieces<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.700> you<00:04:59.850> get<00:05:00.060> in<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.350> it's

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
number of pieces that you get in it it's

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.650 
number of pieces that you get in it it's
a<00:05:01.470> proper<00:05:01.710> solid<00:05:02.280> later<00:05:02.640> set<00:05:03.180> they're<00:05:03.480> out

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
a proper solid later set they're out

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.680 
a proper solid later set they're out
there<00:05:03.930> are<00:05:04.020> no<00:05:04.140> sort<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.740> really<00:05:05.070> large<00:05:05.250> pieces

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
there are no sort of really large pieces

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.290 
there are no sort of really large pieces
substituting<00:05:06.710> ten<00:05:07.710> or<00:05:07.920> more<00:05:08.100> pieces<00:05:08.790> all<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
substituting ten or more pieces all the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.240 
substituting ten or more pieces all the
proper<00:05:09.750> LEGO<00:05:09.960> pieces<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.610> that's<00:05:11.790> good<00:05:12.980> but<00:05:13.980> so

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
proper LEGO pieces so that's good but so

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.300 
proper LEGO pieces so that's good but so
if<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.490> like<00:05:14.670> you<00:05:14.880> can<00:05:15.030> recreate<00:05:15.480> it<00:05:15.600> in<00:05:15.870> two

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
if you like you can recreate it in two

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.680 
if you like you can recreate it in two
different<00:05:17.310> things<00:05:17.760> so<00:05:18.210> there's<00:05:18.360> plenty<00:05:18.480> of

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
different things so there's plenty of

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.660 
different things so there's plenty of
building<00:05:19.020> on<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.890> obviously<00:05:20.160> we're

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
building on that and obviously we're
