00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
interesting kind of technique actually

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.860 
interesting kind of technique actually
Ryan<00:02:11.810> people<00:02:12.230> who<00:02:12.290> had<00:02:12.470> expectations

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.110 

what<00:02:18.470> do<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.560> need<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.769> take<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.459> step<00:02:22.120> well

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
what do you need to take that step well

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.050 
what do you need to take that step well
I<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.450> year<00:02:23.659> I'm<00:02:23.870> doing<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.830> know

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
I think this year I'm doing it you know

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.729 
I think this year I'm doing it you know
you<00:02:26.060> consider<00:02:26.360> this<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.780> next<00:02:26.989> step<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.530> can

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
you consider this the next step I can

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.460 
you consider this the next step I can
win<00:02:27.860> today<00:02:28.069> for<00:02:28.280> example<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.940> will<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:30.349> do<00:02:30.440> you

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
win today for example I will what do you

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.170 
win today for example I will what do you
mean<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.799> next<00:02:30.920> step<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.430> know<00:02:31.489> cracking<00:02:31.849> up

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
mean the next step you know cracking up

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.710 
mean the next step you know cracking up
Andre<00:02:33.909> yeah<00:02:34.909> for<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.299> people<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.629> takes

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
Andre yeah for some people it takes

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.990 
Andre yeah for some people it takes
longer<00:02:35.989> than<00:02:36.110> others<00:02:36.440> i<00:02:36.560> guess<00:02:37.000> i'm

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
longer than others i guess i'm

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.520 
longer than others i guess i'm
continuing<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.690> work<00:02:38.810> out<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.200> doing<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
