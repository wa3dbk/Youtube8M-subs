legs rotate there's nothing here at the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.400 
legs rotate there's nothing here at the
knees<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.569> want<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.110> swing

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
knees and if you want to you can swing

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.220 
knees and if you want to you can swing
these<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.130> that's<00:02:21.280> more<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:21.959> robot<00:02:22.959> mode

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
these in but that's more for robot mode

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.940 
these in but that's more for robot mode
and<00:02:23.560> leg<00:02:23.830> mode<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:26.020> there's<00:02:26.290> not<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> lot<00:02:26.920> of

and leg mode so there's not a lot of
articulation<00:02:27.670> or<00:02:27.909> may<00:02:28.060> not<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.209> lot<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.420> poses

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
leg

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.509 
leg
he's<00:02:33.670> very<00:02:34.030> very<00:02:34.269> front<00:02:34.989> heavy<00:02:35.219> as<00:02:36.219> you<00:02:36.400> can

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
he's very very front heavy as you can

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.770 
he's very very front heavy as you can
see<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.790> legs<00:02:37.000> are<00:02:37.180> all<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.480> way<00:02:37.540> back<00:02:37.719> here

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
see the legs are all the way back here

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.589 
see the legs are all the way back here
and<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:40.060> bulk<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.750> body<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.200> up<00:02:41.379> over<00:02:41.469> here

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
and the bulk of the body is up over here

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.410 
and the bulk of the body is up over here
so<00:02:44.219> it's<00:02:45.219> really<00:02:45.370> all<00:02:45.549> there<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.939> it<00:02:45.969> this

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
so it's really all there is to it this

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.509 
so it's really all there is to it this
robot<00:02:46.840> mode<00:02:47.170> head<00:02:47.409> as<00:02:48.010> soon<00:02:48.219> as<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.400> go<00:02:48.489> to

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
robot mode head as soon as you go to

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.929 
robot mode head as soon as you go to
move<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.939> it<00:02:49.150> doesn't<00:02:49.420> move<00:02:49.689> it<00:02:50.019> just<00:02:50.170> pops<00:02:50.439> out

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
move it it doesn't move it just pops out

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.030 
move it it doesn't move it just pops out
so<00:02:51.939> when<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.480> do<00:02:52.629> finally<00:02:52.989> find<00:02:53.349> this<00:02:53.500> guy<00:02:53.680> or

all<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> way<00:03:35.769> until<00:03:35.889> they<00:03:36.040> tab<00:03:36.250> then<00:03:36.730> you

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
all the way until they tab then you

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.199 
all the way until they tab then you
basically<00:03:37.060> fold<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.659> limbs<00:03:37.870> up<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:40.269> like<00:03:41.229> so

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
basically fold the limbs up so like so

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.969 
basically fold the limbs up so like so
and<00:03:43.209> now<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.569> have<00:03:43.780> Ripper<00:03:44.109> snapper<00:03:44.590> in<00:03:44.799> his

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
and now you have Ripper snapper in his

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.680 
and now you have Ripper snapper in his
robot<00:03:45.340> mode<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.060> do<00:03:46.120> like<00:03:46.389> the<00:03:46.449> overall

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
robot mode and I do like the overall

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.119 
robot mode and I do like the overall
appearance<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.349> robot<00:03:47.590> mode<00:03:47.799> he's<00:03:47.949> got<00:03:48.099> a

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
appearance of the robot mode he's got a

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.240 
appearance of the robot mode he's got a
very<00:03:48.459> stocky<00:03:48.970> huge<00:03:49.540> upper<00:03:49.870> torso<00:03:50.260> with<00:03:51.129> these

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
very stocky huge upper torso with these

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.449 
very stocky huge upper torso with these
monstrous<00:03:51.879> massive<00:03:52.389> arms<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.129> what<00:03:54.129> would<00:03:54.400> be

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
monstrous massive arms and what would be

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.909 
monstrous massive arms and what would be
little<00:03:55.120> bitty<00:03:55.329> legs<00:03:55.629> unless<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:56.560> look<00:03:56.769> at

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
little bitty legs unless you look at

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.379 
little bitty legs unless you look at
them<00:03:57.069> in<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.280> Laird<00:03:57.669> section<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.419> they<00:03:58.540> are

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
them in the Laird section that they are

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.360 
them in the Laird section that they are
so<00:04:01.389> articulations<00:04:02.229> actually<00:04:02.739> improved<00:04:03.069> here

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
so articulations actually improved here

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.240 
so articulations actually improved here
legs<00:04:04.299> are<00:04:04.449> on<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.569> ball<00:04:04.750> joint<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.799> can<00:04:06.069> get

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
legs are on a ball joint so you can get

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.119 
legs are on a ball joint so you can get
around<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:07.629> feet<00:04:07.959> do<00:04:08.319> pivot<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.859> part<00:04:09.069> of

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
around the feet do pivot is part of

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.479 
around the feet do pivot is part of
transformation<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.959> he<00:04:11.290> can<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:12.099> know<00:04:12.129> do

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
transformation so he can you know do

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.909 
transformation so he can you know do
some<00:04:12.699> running<00:04:12.819> poses<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.620> given<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.680> unique

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
some running poses and given the unique

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.879 
some running poses and given the unique
nature<00:04:15.159> of<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.669> kibble<00:04:16.209> around<00:04:16.630> his<00:04:16.840> feet<00:04:17.079> you

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
nature of the kibble around his feet you

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.500 
nature of the kibble around his feet you
can<00:04:18.010> kind<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.250> use<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.549> as<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.699> stability<00:04:19.120> thing

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
can kind of use it as a stability thing

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.620 
can kind of use it as a stability thing
so<00:04:20.310> there's<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.489> top<00:04:21.669> of<00:04:21.849> his<00:04:21.970> foot<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.449> an

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
so there's the top of his foot and an

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.200 
so there's the top of his foot and an
