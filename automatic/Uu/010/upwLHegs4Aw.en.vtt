00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 my friends and I would like to finish 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 bring a result and again in the new 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.930
 the door summed up everything we said here 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.010
 still for beginners would like to 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.080
 beginners come 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.600
 the brink of sports nutrition he doesn't know what 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.010
 he take what to buy all the same 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 financial component of sports 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.109
 power it is also important and many about it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.450
 think and wanted to understand something 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.790
 the initial stage what set to collect 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.309
 minimum set for a beginner 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.649
 athlete here and also summarize again 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.260
 when we repeat that takes situation 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.579
 am man and go to bed 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.480
 what is the day of training that take as 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.590
 in short now the usual day 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 let's not start training probably with proteins 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.489
 before sports gainers probably because 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.119
 most popular supplements 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.400
 if you are lean and bad typing 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.780
 muscle mass then most likely the garden 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.780
 excitation supplement 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.580
 and how much we always need to grow 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.189
 muscle mass of carbohydrates from the label then this 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.500
 for us a suitable product gainer 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.150
 best taken between meals 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.790
 food that is to have breakfast 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.159
 then you took a gainer then through to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.000
 remove dinner then another portion 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.890
 gainer and already this way gainer can 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.610
 equate meals since he 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.939
 its composition to similar there let's say with 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.950
 a plate of rice and chicken breast therefore 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.450
 it turns out that the additions to the three main 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 direct food turns us still 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.750
 additionally by societies 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.220
 five meals a day protein 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.659
 as we said it is necessary to take 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.180
 at the rate of 2 grams of protein per kilogram 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.399
 weight for that is, we calculate the daily 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 rate of normal protein food and what we 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.440
 not got we choose from protein 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.550
 minimum 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.320
 for those who are up quite right here then 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.180
 same thing we can turn it on if 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.430
 in the morning do not have breakfast and can not 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.640
 for some reason, have breakfast before you 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.530
 need to take a serving of protein if 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.570
 you have breakfast you can in two hours 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.130
 after breakfast take a portion of the protein and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.200
 also breaks between and if you're between 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.850
 dinner and in the meantime when you lie down 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.570
 sleep and here's a big gap as well 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.940
 before bedtime you can take pore quotes 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.690
 as far as amino acids are concerned 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.380
 acids fuck irreplaceable necessary 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.050
 take also in the morning 5 grams and 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.750
 training days we take 5 grams 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.850
 before training and 5 grams after or if 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 this is you powder yes you can do it right with 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.540
 a stir at the same 10 grams 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.800
 training do not beat a little more 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.890
 than ordinary amino acids 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.410
 comprehensive we accept the same 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.300
 in the morning after training before someone can 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.980
 take out enough food 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.700
 have attached microelements can take 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.850
 training eating we take the afterbirth 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.670
 scheme if we take creatine monohydrate 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.950
 we take 5 gran every day 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.040
 have this teaspoon daily in the morning 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.810
 we take 5 grams over 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.820
 probably a month later and a month to make 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.940
 break and then again you can resume 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.370
 taking creatine if it's creatine with 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.050
 transport system or creatine fast 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.230
 forms like and formed hydrochloride 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.980
 alkalay and you take a 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.269
 just before training 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.640
 hydrochloride there is a little less 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.290
 soda somewhere 3 grams takes 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.880
 also such alkaline can be beautiful 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.400
 take directly somewhere for 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.380
 half an hour before training 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.510
 as well as pre-workout complexes 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.489
 they, too, take only training 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.100
 days and immediately before training 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.700
 somewhere half an hour 40 minutes before her 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.640
 started 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.209
 that is, our set is basic for 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.370
 newbies 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.010
 probably I would advise all the same protein 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.400
 or gainer depending on how 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.519
 okay you gain muscle mass further 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.500
 must be included fighter 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.910
 essential amino acids gave 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.770
 compulsory creatine 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.250
 which will be more convenient for you 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.840
 intakes and vitamins 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.970
 Here are the main supplements that are probably 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.610
 must be in the diet in 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.330
 beginners that is the main set we 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.010
 collected 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
 yes this is the minimum set which 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.010
 necessary in order to normal 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.770
 progresses to the gym and sports friends 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.940

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.190
 perhaps mainly about sports nutrition 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.680
