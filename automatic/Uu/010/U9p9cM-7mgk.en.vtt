weight<00:02:22.090> steady<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.690> needed<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.319> eat<00:02:23.610> 3,200

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
weight steady I needed to eat 3,200

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.600 
weight steady I needed to eat 3,200
calories<00:02:25.060> per<00:02:25.480> day<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.650> lost<00:02:27.040> weight<00:02:27.400> and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
calories per day then I lost weight and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.800 
calories per day then I lost weight and
weight<00:02:28.709> 163<00:02:29.709> pounds<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.340> at<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.330> point<00:02:31.600> I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
weight 163 pounds and at that point I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
weight 163 pounds and at that point I
needed<00:02:32.050> about<00:02:32.970> 2,500<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.170> 2,600<00:02:35.170> calories<00:02:35.350> per

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
needed about 2,500 of 2,600 calories per

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.330 
needed about 2,500 of 2,600 calories per
day<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:36.870> let's<00:02:37.870> say<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.709> those<00:02:38.950> five<00:02:39.310> years

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
day now let's say in those five years

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.449 
day now let's say in those five years
where<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.299> worked<00:02:40.720> out<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.260> only<00:02:41.590> gained<00:02:42.160> a

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
where I worked out I only gained a

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.570 
where I worked out I only gained a
measly<00:02:43.120> 20<00:02:43.690> pounds<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.200> muscle<00:02:44.290> mass<00:02:44.799> just<00:02:45.100> 20

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
measly 20 pounds of muscle mass just 20

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.390 
measly 20 pounds of muscle mass just 20
pounds<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.239> five<00:02:46.630> years<00:02:47.290> let's<00:02:47.920> be<00:02:48.069> really

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
pounds in five years let's be really

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.810 
pounds in five years let's be really
conservative<00:02:48.850> here<00:02:49.360> if<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.380> was<00:02:50.560> correct<00:02:50.860> that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
conservative here if it was correct that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.900 
conservative here if it was correct that
one<00:02:52.090> pound<00:02:52.299> of<00:02:52.600> muscle<00:02:52.900> mass<00:02:53.230> burned<00:02:54.130> 50

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
one pound of muscle mass burned 50

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.220 
one pound of muscle mass burned 50
calories<00:02:55.150> than<00:02:55.989> 20<00:02:56.320> times<00:02:56.500> 50<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.510> 1000<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.630> if

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
calories than 20 times 50 is 1000 and if

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.130 
calories than 20 times 50 is 1000 and if
you<00:02:59.380> take<00:03:00.090> number<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.150> calories<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.720> needed<00:03:01.989> at

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
you take number of calories I needed at

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.420 
you take number of calories I needed at
at<00:03:02.290> 163<00:03:03.250> pounds<00:03:03.910> plus<00:03:04.660> those<00:03:04.930> 1000<00:03:05.859> today

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
at 163 pounds plus those 1000 today

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.960 
at 163 pounds plus those 1000 today
should<00:03:07.209> be<00:03:07.420> eating<00:03:08.010> 3600<00:03:09.010> calories<00:03:09.040> per<00:03:09.760> day

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
should be eating 3600 calories per day

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.930 
should be eating 3600 calories per day
to<00:03:10.480> keep<00:03:10.660> my<00:03:10.900> weight<00:03:11.109> steady<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.549> as<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> matter

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
to keep my weight steady but as a matter

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.610 
to keep my weight steady but as a matter
of<00:03:13.090> fact<00:03:14.250> today<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.459> weigh<00:03:15.850> about<00:03:16.290> 167<00:03:17.290> pounds

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
of fact today I weigh about 167 pounds

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.370 
of fact today I weigh about 167 pounds
or<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.130> if<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> calories<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.420> eat<00:03:19.480> per<00:03:19.959> day<00:03:20.140> are

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
or so if the calories I eat per day are

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.830 
or so if the calories I eat per day are
much<00:03:20.769> closer<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.640> two<00:03:21.910> thousand<00:03:22.480> seven

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
much closer to two thousand seven

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.080 
much closer to two thousand seven
hundred<00:03:22.989> two<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.980> two<00:03:24.400> thousand<00:03:24.910> eight

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
hundred two to two thousand eight

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.380 
hundred two to two thousand eight
hundred<00:03:25.329> so<00:03:26.109> if<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.680> were<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.310> eat<00:03:27.340> what<00:03:28.090> these

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
hundred so if I were to eat what these

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.920 
hundred so if I were to eat what these
50<00:03:29.079> calories<00:03:29.320> per<00:03:29.739> pound<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.190> muscle<00:03:30.489> guys<00:03:31.180> say

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
50 calories per pound of muscle guys say

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.000 
50 calories per pound of muscle guys say
that<00:03:32.560> muscle<00:03:32.980> burns<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.579> would<00:03:34.329> be<00:03:34.870> just<00:03:35.530> as<00:03:35.709> fat

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
that muscle burns I would be just as fat

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.970 
that muscle burns I would be just as fat
as<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.430> was<00:03:36.730> before<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.239> lost<00:03:37.600> weight<00:03:37.870> because<00:03:38.590> I

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
as I was before I lost weight because I

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.970 
as I was before I lost weight because I
would<00:03:39.190> be<00:03:39.340> eating<00:03:39.549> five<00:03:40.030> hundred<00:03:40.510> six<00:03:40.750> hundred

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
would be eating five hundred six hundred

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.400 
would be eating five hundred six hundred
useless<00:03:41.980> extra<00:03:42.760> calories<00:03:43.420> per<00:03:43.660> day<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.140> I

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
useless extra calories per day and I

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.830 
useless extra calories per day and I
would<00:03:44.650> end<00:03:44.859> up<00:03:45.040> exactly<00:03:45.459> where<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.000> started<00:03:46.660> all

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
would end up exactly where I started all

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:55.130 
would end up exactly where I started all
those<00:03:47.650> years<00:03:47.709> ago

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.140 

of<00:03:55.290> course<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.160> doesn't<00:03:56.370> mean<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.640> working

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
of course that doesn't mean that working

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.240 
of course that doesn't mean that working
out<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:57.300> useless<00:03:57.990> because<00:03:58.290> working<00:03:59.100> out

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
out is useless because working out

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.540 
out is useless because working out
suddenly<00:04:00.060> improves<00:04:00.630> your<00:04:00.840> health<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.550> having

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
suddenly improves your health and having

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.120 
suddenly improves your health and having
bigger<00:04:02.760> muscles<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.690> course<00:04:04.140> also<00:04:04.680> makes<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
bigger muscles of course also makes you

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.030 
bigger muscles of course also makes you
look<00:04:05.580> better<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:06.660> I'd<00:04:06.840> say<00:04:07.140> let's<00:04:07.620> be<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:07.980> bit

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
look better but I'd say let's be a bit

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.640 
look better but I'd say let's be a bit
realistic<00:04:08.820> here<00:04:09.030> about<00:04:09.270> all<00:04:09.300> this<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.080> don't

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
realistic here about all this and don't

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.100 
realistic here about all this and don't
lead<00:04:10.920> people<00:04:11.190> into<00:04:11.580> working<00:04:12.090> out<00:04:12.240> by<00:04:12.690> making

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
lead people into working out by making

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.009 
lead people into working out by making
false<00:04:13.440> promises<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.610> that<00:04:15.240> being<00:04:15.510> said<00:04:15.780> as

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
false promises and that being said as

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.130 
false promises and that being said as
always<00:04:16.680> thank<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.430> watching<00:04:17.640> guys<00:04:18.150> until

always thank you for watching guys until
