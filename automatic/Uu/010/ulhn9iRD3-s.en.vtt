the<00:00:15.269> macdaddy<00:00:15.660> two<00:00:15.990> wedges<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> very

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
the macdaddy two wedges have a very

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.480 
the macdaddy two wedges have a very
high-performance<00:00:18.660> face<00:00:18.980> we've<00:00:19.980> talked<00:00:20.310> about

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
high-performance face we've talked about

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.570 
high-performance face we've talked about
the<00:00:20.789> five<00:00:20.970> degree<00:00:21.359> groove<00:00:21.980> but<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.189> top<00:00:23.400> of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the five degree groove but on top of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.820 
the five degree groove but on top of
that<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> sandblast<00:00:25.289> that's<00:00:25.589> very

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that we have a sandblast that's very

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.009 
that we have a sandblast that's very
aggressive<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:27.060> top<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> sandblast

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
aggressive and on top of the sandblast

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.589 
aggressive and on top of the sandblast
we<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> laser<00:00:28.740> etch<00:00:29.240> right<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
we have a laser etch right to the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.740 
we have a laser etch right to the
maximum<00:00:31.140> allowable<00:00:31.349> by<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> USGA<00:00:32.610> all<00:00:33.420> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
maximum allowable by the USGA all this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.819 
maximum allowable by the USGA all this
adds<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.289> to<00:00:34.800> control<00:00:35.219> spin<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> better<00:00:37.230> shots

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
adds up to control spin and better shots

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.590 
adds up to control spin and better shots

going to talk about this shot which is a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.920 
going to talk about this shot which is a
little<00:00:52.230> semi<00:00:52.620> rough<00:00:52.890> here<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.390> soft

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

little semi rough here and a little soft
lob<00:00:55.260> shot<00:00:55.620> over<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> bunker<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:56.670> always

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
lob shot over a bunker which always

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
lob shot over a bunker which always
intimidates<00:00:58.019> everybody<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.739> tough<00:00:58.980> shot

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
intimidates everybody so tough shot

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.849 
intimidates everybody so tough shot
I<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.519> tight<00:00:59.820> flag<00:01:00.120> over<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> bunker<00:01:01.140> but

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I got a tight flag over a bunker but

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.310 
I got a tight flag over a bunker but
with<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.670> grooves<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
with the grooves that we have in the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050 
with the grooves that we have in the
face<00:01:04.530> roughness<00:01:05.100> by<00:01:05.370> way<00:01:05.550> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.850> laser

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
face roughness by way of the laser

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.840 
face roughness by way of the laser
etching<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.310> sandblast<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.729> you're

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
etching and sandblast I think you're

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.249 
etching and sandblast I think you're
going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> control<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.930> gives<00:01:10.170> you

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
going to control this that gives you

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.510 
going to control this that gives you
your<00:01:10.439> best<00:01:10.619> chance<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.100> got<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> best

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
your best chance you got the best

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
your best chance you got the best
opportunity<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.930> technique

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
opportunity that and a little technique

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
opportunity that and a little technique
but<00:01:13.530> yeah<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:13.979> face<00:01:14.220> technology<00:01:14.820> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
but yeah with this face technology we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
but yeah with this face technology we
got<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> great<00:01:15.479> shot<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:15.869> making<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.350> pulling

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
got a great shot at making this pulling

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.260 
got a great shot at making this pulling
the<00:01:16.830> shot<00:01:17.040> off<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.610> what's<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> technique

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the shot off so what's the technique

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
the shot off so what's the technique
what<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.439> shot<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
what do you do well this shot is one of

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.679 
what do you do well this shot is one of
the<00:01:20.250> rare<00:01:20.490> shots<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.000> golf<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.329> fact<00:01:21.540> probably

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the rare shots in golf in fact probably

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.020 
the rare shots in golf in fact probably
the<00:01:21.930> only<00:01:22.079> time<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.920> set<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.790> your

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the only time you set up with your

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
the only time you set up with your
weight<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.439> actually

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
weight back a little bit you actually

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.990 
weight back a little bit you actually
move<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> ball<00:01:26.280> forward<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.670> lean<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
move the ball forward and lean the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
move the ball forward and lean the
handle<00:01:27.390> slightly<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.079> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.439> about

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
handle slightly back and this is about

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
handle slightly back and this is about
the<00:01:28.920> only<00:01:29.159> shot<00:01:29.430> where<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> ever<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:30.150> do

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the only shot where you ever really do

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.789 
the only shot where you ever really do
that<00:01:30.600> most<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.229> time<00:01:31.380> when<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.560> hit<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that most of the time when you hit the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.319 
that most of the time when you hit the
ball<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.460> trying<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> shaft<00:01:33.149> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
ball you're trying to get the shaft to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.910 
ball you're trying to get the shaft to
lean<00:01:33.479> forward<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.049> impact<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> trap

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
lean forward at impact so you can trap

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.649 
lean forward at impact so you can trap
the<00:01:35.070> ball<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> shot<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.360> actually

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the ball but in this shot you actually

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.510 
the ball but in this shot you actually
want<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.899> club<00:01:37.140> head<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> outrace<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> handle

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
want the club head to outrace the handle

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.100 
want the club head to outrace the handle
because<00:01:38.909> dynamically<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:39.810> trying<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
because dynamically you're trying to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.480 
because dynamically you're trying to
increase<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.619> loft<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.250> hit<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
increase the loft so you can hit the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
increase the loft so you can hit the
ball<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.939> air<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> need<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> little

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
ball up in the air so you need a little

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
ball up in the air so you need a little
bit<00:01:43.290> bigger<00:01:43.500> swaying<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.490> bit<00:01:44.820> slower

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
bit bigger swaying a little bit slower

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
bit bigger swaying a little bit slower
swing<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.259> need<00:01:46.409> more<00:01:46.560> speed<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
swing because you need more speed to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.740 
swing because you need more speed to
create<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.790> trajectory<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> ball<00:01:48.719> up

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
create the trajectory to get the ball up

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
create the trajectory to get the ball up
in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> air<00:01:49.110> I've<00:01:49.680> seen<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> many<00:01:50.640> people

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
in the air I've seen that many people
