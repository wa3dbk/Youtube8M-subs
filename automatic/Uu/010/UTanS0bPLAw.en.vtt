00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.130
 It is also fluff masu 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.000
 It is a critter of sinking now It is raw using this 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:16.950
 It's a unit , that one without using a chainic 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.950
 Why I think that like to go look around immediately by say you can capture 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:25.970
 The facility where the other's headquarters is in range 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.950
 I want to go red, so I have a shock launcher, a boom cano and that same bombardment 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.090
 Configuration 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:36.330
 It is after the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.790
 After that you destroy the side earphones and the next section where that HQ will go into range 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:44.100
 I think it will almost disappear 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 It is a strategy I mean Ugh's go put the critters toward the end to many of the rocket launcher 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.860
 Ne 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.860
 Let's go look in 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.719
 ben 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.590
 The rocket launcher for marriage has a wide range, but the distance is still 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:38.359
 That they can not attack Nde has become that close 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:43.460
 Why the rocket launcher is like that and it is alone 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:46.960
 Be put to Tteyuu Aru such a place in the to be destroyed by using a fine Critter 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.960
 I think I can do it 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.110
 I have never seen the attack of other critters so far, but inside 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:04.670
 There are a lot of things like this 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:09.679
 It is such a feeling that it is soberly cut into rice plain taste, but how is that attack? 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:15.370
 Really that with you me cut to fine residents I'd kinda cute feeling 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:21.959
 Rocket launcher, etc. It is close to places that are left alone 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.959
 I think that I want to use it in the future because it destroys that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:37.409
 If yes let me step on the fritter and use it, this is the only one this time 2 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.790
 By all means in fact that was that pine forest without integral another input 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:44.069
 When it becomes usable flitter, because the scope of such a strategy spreads , try variously 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.500
 And I think that you 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.569
 Then thank you for watching this time This time in this area also post high evaluation channel registration 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.170
 Thank you 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.170
 Hate it Ayabai 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.170
 Hmm 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.600
 me 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 Hmm
