the phone the phone is not going
anywhere<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.140> looks<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> think<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
anywhere and it looks like I think you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.570

can move the stand at the same

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.350
