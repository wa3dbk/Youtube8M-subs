00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
in a soft C shape you gradually feel

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.869 
in a soft C shape you gradually feel
back<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.559> nipple<00:00:50.039> until<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> feel<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
back from your nipple until you feel a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
back from your nipple until you feel a
change<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.600> texture<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.620> bit<00:00:52.710> like

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
change in texture it's a little bit like

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.990 
change in texture it's a little bit like
a<00:00:52.890> Ridge<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.610> gently<00:00:54.539> squeeze<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.350> compress

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
a Ridge and gently squeeze or compress

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.310 
a Ridge and gently squeeze or compress
it<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.149> take<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> few<00:00:57.600> minutes<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.960> anything

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it can take a few minutes for anything

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.290 
it can take a few minutes for anything
to<00:00:58.440> come<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.370> that's<00:00:59.579> fine<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.090> keep

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
to come out but that's fine just keep

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
to come out but that's fine just keep
going<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.840> gradually<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> colostrum<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
going and gradually the colostrum or the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.369 
going and gradually the colostrum or the
milk<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.609> start<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> slowly<00:01:03.390> drip<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
milk will start to slowly drip out and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
milk will start to slowly drip out and
then<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> might<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.670> faster

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
then it might get a little bit faster

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.440 
then it might get a little bit faster
once<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.290> slows<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.060> move<00:01:09.240> your

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
once that slows down you can move your

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
once that slows down you can move your
fingers<00:01:09.810> around<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.409> breast<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.860> you're

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
fingers around your breast so you're

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
fingers around your breast so you're
expressing<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.119> areas<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.900> breast

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
expressing from all areas of your breast

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
expressing from all areas of your breast
and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.950> once<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.220> flows<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:15.030> again<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and then once that flows down again you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.730 
and then once that flows down again you
can<00:01:15.600> move<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> other<00:01:16.200> side

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
can move to the other side

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.649 
can move to the other side
repeat<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> process<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.540> go<00:01:18.630> back

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
repeat the process then you can go back

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
repeat the process then you can go back
to<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> first<00:01:19.259> side<00:01:19.619> again<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.280> again

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
to the first side again and do it again

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210 
to the first side again and do it again
you'd<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.509> surprised<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.470> milk<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> can

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you'd be surprised how much milk you can

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.630 
you'd be surprised how much milk you can
actually<00:01:23.670> express<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.299> by<00:01:24.509> doing<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.640> there

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
actually express out by doing that there

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270 
actually express out by doing that there
are<00:01:26.790> other<00:01:27.030> methods<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.600> expressing<00:01:28.290> either<00:01:29.159> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
are other methods of expressing either a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.270 
are other methods of expressing either a
hand<00:01:29.610> pump<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.299> an<00:01:30.990> electric<00:01:31.530> pump<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.159> there

hand pump or an electric pump and there

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.039 
hand pump or an electric pump and there
are<00:01:32.369> lots<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.729> different<00:01:33.090> makes<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.540> hand<00:01:33.750> and

are lots of different makes of hand and
electric<00:01:34.560> pumps<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> market<00:01:35.850> and

electric pumps out on the market and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.149 
electric pumps out on the market and
it's<00:01:36.210> probably<00:01:36.390> better<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:37.860> advice

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
it's probably better to get some advice

it's probably better to get some advice
