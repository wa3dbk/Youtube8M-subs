take a quick break and we'll get here

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.560 
take a quick break and we'll get here
out<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> package<00:00:59.120> all<00:01:00.120> right<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.390> have

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
out of the package all right we have

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.070 
out of the package all right we have
Karen<00:01:00.989> Ross<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> package<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
Karen Ross here out of the package and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.929 
Karen Ross here out of the package and
first<00:01:04.080> off<00:01:04.260> yeah<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.280> made<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:05.670> Kenner

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
first off yeah these are made by Kenner

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.160 
first off yeah these are made by Kenner
and<00:01:06.979> they<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.119> real<00:01:09.390> likeness<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and they have a real likeness to the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
and they have a real likeness to the
figures<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.479> aliens<00:01:12.960> line<00:01:13.650> also<00:01:14.189> made<00:01:14.610> by

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
figures for the aliens line also made by

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
figures for the aliens line also made by
Kenner<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:16.080> think<00:01:16.290> they're<00:01:16.439> actually

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
Kenner and I think they're actually

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
Kenner and I think they're actually
about<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.130> same<00:01:17.159> time<00:01:17.369> period<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> mean

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
about the same time period so I mean

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.399 
about the same time period so I mean
that<00:01:18.659> makes<00:01:18.810> sense<00:01:19.640> but<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.810> body<00:01:21.990> molds<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that makes sense but the body molds that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
that makes sense but the body molds that
everything<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.860> has<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> real<00:01:23.490> likeness<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
everything just has a real likeness to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.469 
everything just has a real likeness to
the<00:01:24.119> aliens<00:01:24.570> line<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.860> I'll<00:01:26.670> probably<00:01:27.000> end<00:01:27.299> up

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the aliens line so I'll probably end up

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
the aliens line so I'll probably end up
just<00:01:28.110> playing<00:01:28.409> these<00:01:28.530> guys<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:29.220> aliens

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
just playing these guys with my aliens

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.530 
just playing these guys with my aliens
Kevin<00:01:30.299> figures<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.829> I'm<00:01:32.310> pretty<00:01:32.520> sure<00:01:32.579> if

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
Kevin figures and I'm pretty sure if

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
Kevin figures and I'm pretty sure if
this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> gun<00:01:34.350> she<00:01:34.590> comes<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.280> I'm

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
this is the gun she comes with and I'm

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
this is the gun she comes with and I'm
pretty<00:01:36.240> sure<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.960> exact<00:01:37.290> mold<00:01:37.710> as

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
pretty sure this is the exact mold as

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
pretty sure this is the exact mold as
one<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> Kinner<00:01:39.570> aliens<00:01:40.079> figures<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:42.200> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
one of the Kinner aliens figures so and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.319 
one of the Kinner aliens figures so and
it<00:01:43.290> also<00:01:43.439> comes<00:01:43.829> with<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.250> big<00:01:44.880> goofy-looking

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.810 
it also comes with a big goofy-looking
diamond<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.380> plug<00:01:46.619> into<00:01:46.829> any<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
diamond that can plug into any one of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.560 
diamond that can plug into any one of
these<00:01:47.970> holes<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> side<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> gun<00:01:50.570> just
