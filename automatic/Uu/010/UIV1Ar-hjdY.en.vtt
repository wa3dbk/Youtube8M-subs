00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.300
 so today we will meet for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.170

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.770
 three bikes that are the three bikes that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.200
 are presented 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.059
 so there are two dinka vidic wrong of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.780
 show you in tension the legendary 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.250
 motorsport one that there are two jeans caby 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.649
 indicator so this is the new bike 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.670
 which has been added 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.930
 so this is the new motorcycle 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.100
 khater add to it in the second 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.079
 part of the dlc 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 So here the a6 130 miles off against 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 the dig 4e is so it's the same 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.299
 mark and look alike that's why 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.490
 that they decided to compare or this one 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.630
 said 4 sel to 75000 dollars 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.290
 so it's still more affordable 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.500
 that's why I compare them 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.720
 so here I'm going to compare 2 12 k bine 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.560
 10 14 the championship there will be one 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.119
 get the booth the other co will not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.460
 and here he said even 4th so it's 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.570
 this one is on bousquet above 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 besides the chains of my friends 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.720
 will be description that those who 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 came to see them so we got our 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.439
 cleavages and place as well as at all a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.920
 grenade as usual for 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.649
 start but at the same time I 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.340
 exploded buddy so you'll see 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.390
 that I'm going 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.610
 then no yeah it's me who uses 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 the boost at the beginning to show you so 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.840
 So here is then by loeb so the bike 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.090
 green 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.360
 he has the same bike as me but he did not 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.010
 not used the boost you could see that 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.650
 the idea of ​​going out a lot 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.720
 faster with the nitro after on the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.670
 long time I do not know so 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.560
 Moreover, there is a subscriber who 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.120
 made me remark that the track of a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.060
 report it was pretty strong and we knew 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.959
 not if you are if it was the case in the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.930
 long term so if you have any ideas 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.720
 route or location to make the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.130
 dna ocean comment tests so here is 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.830
 this time we want to reverse the roles 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.470
 dubai look so low he's not going to use the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.730
 five to use the eelv boost at quillan 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.560
 hole and I'm not going to use a 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 microphone 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.040
 yeah you'll see that so I 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.570
 I left you saw that the him there 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.209
 know - the nitro parties he took 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.260
 a big boost 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.720
 so I 'm still a little bit of 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.430
 assembé wind but you will see 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.830
 only after on the gameplay I'm going 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.600
 repeat a test and that there is no 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.890
 big difference finally I think that the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.180
 life strikes me a little bit more 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.570
 fast but there is not a lot of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.459
 difference so tell me again 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.900
 inventory which vehicles between 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.160
 two prefects had a lot of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.950
 character I still prefer the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.180
 vinadie 14 even though he has quite expensive she has 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.350
 still nitro there is a small 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.299
 more 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.320
 there we will just redo a third 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.280
 the surfer is real name that during this 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.840
 time so I want to thank you 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.330
 for for 8400 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.519
 and some subscribers their current here is 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.700
 so we come out of 8000 subscribers on 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.160
 will be good we go to the 8,500 so 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.769
 it's really huge 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.510
 well there you could see that in the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.610
 skin there is even but suspends everything 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.440
 what happens to catch up to me sees 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.180
 like what does not mean its price 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.190
 in fact it's just the nitro that are not 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.870
 the more I think 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.970
 so here's your opinion on both 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.440
 motorcycles in comment then me on this I 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.540
 will leave you on these images 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.250
 so as usual do not hesitate to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.530
 like to comment and why not share 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.530
