straight away I could have done this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.360 
straight away I could have done this
literally<00:00:49.469> three<00:00:49.710> hours<00:00:49.739> after<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.309> were

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
gonna be like my typical squad builder

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
gonna be like my typical squad builder
you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.770> because<00:00:56.460> well<00:00:57.030> there's<00:00:57.239> no

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
you know because well there's no

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
you know because well there's no
chemistry<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.870> anything<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.100> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
chemistry or anything so I just was this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
chemistry or anything so I just was this
is<00:00:59.489> more<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.699> less<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.000> showcase<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.140> see

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
is more or less a showcase we can see

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.619 
is more or less a showcase we can see
how<00:01:01.469> they<00:01:01.620> look<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.329> make

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
how they look if there was a way to make

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.690 
how they look if there was a way to make
every<00:01:04.019> single<00:01:04.140> pink<00:01:04.530> card<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.949> squad<00:01:05.549> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
every single pink card in that squad you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.149 
every single pink card in that squad you
know<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.390> hard<00:01:07.159> continuing

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
know it is really hard continuing

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.859 
know it is really hard continuing
there's<00:01:08.400> no<00:01:08.549> Ryback<00:01:08.760> effects<00:01:09.299> centre-backs

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
there's no Ryback effects centre-backs

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.560 
there's no Ryback effects centre-backs
so<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.650> pretty<00:01:10.740> much<00:01:10.890> impossible<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.729> still

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so it's pretty much impossible but still

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.880 
so it's pretty much impossible but still
at<00:01:12.810> least<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> look<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.590> how<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
at least we can have a look at it how it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.289 
at least we can have a look at it how it
looks<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> also<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.119> two<00:01:15.270> things

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
looks here and also there are two things

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
looks here and also there are two things
I<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> say<00:01:15.840> since<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.369> see

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
I want to say since you can really see

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.800 
I want to say since you can really see
these<00:01:17.700> players<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.360> chemistry

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
these players on there for chemistry

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.749 
these players on there for chemistry
I've<00:01:19.020> pretty<00:01:19.950> much<00:01:20.040> switched<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> team

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I've pretty much switched the team

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.670 
I've pretty much switched the team
around<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.540> least<00:01:21.720> I'll<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
around so we can at least I'll have a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.980 
around so we can at least I'll have a
BPL<00:01:23.130> team<00:01:23.340> /<00:01:23.520> Bundesliga<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> i'll<00:01:24.689> make<00:01:24.810> some

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
BPL team / Bundesliga and i'll make some

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.600 
BPL team / Bundesliga and i'll make some
subs<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.950> give<00:01:26.070> everyone<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.430> nice

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
subs on and we can give everyone a nice

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.120 
subs on and we can give everyone a nice
little<00:01:26.759> run<00:01:26.939> around<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:28.020> i'm<00:01:28.470> also<00:01:28.799> working

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
was just lucky enough to think about it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.969 
was just lucky enough to think about it
cuz<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.150> when<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> best<00:01:37.650> times

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
cuz you know when we are the best times
we<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.579> these<00:01:38.790> ideas<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.540> we

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
we think about these ideas or when we

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
we think about these ideas or when we
have<00:01:39.990> plans<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.640> when

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
