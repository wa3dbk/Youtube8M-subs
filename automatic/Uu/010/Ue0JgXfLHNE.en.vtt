00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.600 
and I thought well I'll try those and
hope<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:01.079> work<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
hope that they work because this is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.240 
hope that they work because this is
fairly<00:02:02.880> expensive<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.200> worth<00:02:04.680> every<00:02:05.040> penny

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
fairly expensive it is worth every penny

fairly expensive it is worth every penny
