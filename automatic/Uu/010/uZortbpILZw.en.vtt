00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859

the<00:00:29.760> texture<00:00:30.359> fluorescence<00:00:31.289> tickets<00:00:31.529> are

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the texture fluorescence tickets are

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.749 
the texture fluorescence tickets are
actually<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.099> thicker<00:00:32.309> than<00:00:32.520> let's

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
actually a little bit thicker than let's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.200 
actually a little bit thicker than let's
say<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.360> wide<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:35.340> blue<00:00:35.880> sticker

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
say like a wide or a blue sticker

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.119 
say like a wide or a blue sticker
because<00:00:37.050> they're<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.380> some<00:00:37.649> thicker<00:00:37.890> like

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
because they're on some thicker like

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
because they're on some thicker like
vinyl<00:00:38.399> paper<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:40.079> feel<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.320> raised

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
vinyl paper and I can feel it raised

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.310 
vinyl paper and I can feel it raised
when<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> cube<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> makes<00:00:41.610> me<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.149> don't<00:00:43.079> know

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
when I cube and it makes me I don't know

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
when I cube and it makes me I don't know
I<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> feeling<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.760> i

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
I just don't like the feeling of it so i

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.750 
I just don't like the feeling of it so i
have<00:00:45.059> actually<00:00:45.739> one<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:46.980> i<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.700> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
have actually one of these i think it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
have actually one of these i think it
was<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.120> i<00:00:48.300> actually<00:00:48.450> went<00:00:48.750> through<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
was this one i actually went through and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
was this one i actually went through and
reese<00:00:49.289> Tikrit<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> back<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.460> regular

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
reese Tikrit it back to just regular

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
reese Tikrit it back to just regular
down<00:00:50.969> color<00:00:51.390> scheme<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.110> stickers<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.500> then

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
down color scheme the stickers are then

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310 
down color scheme the stickers are then
they<00:00:53.370> rate<00:00:53.670> they'll<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.899> flush

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
they rate they'll a really really flush

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
they rate they'll a really really flush
and<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.210> weird<00:00:57.510> race

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and they don't have that weird race

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.599 
and they don't have that weird race
feeling<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.739> fluorescent<00:00:59.219> stickers<00:00:59.460> have

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
feeling that fluorescent stickers have

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.790 
feeling that fluorescent stickers have

think<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.240> main<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> be

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
think it's not my main it's going to be

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.350 
think it's not my main it's going to be
at<00:01:58.649> least<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> top<00:01:59.520> three<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.149> sure

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
at least in the top three for sure

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
at least in the top three for sure
probably<00:02:00.899> pop<00:02:01.079> too<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.979> was<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.280> good

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
probably pop too but it was really good

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.359 
probably pop too but it was really good
it's<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.299> smooth<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:04.619> love<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
feeling of this it feels different than

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.540 
feeling of this it feels different than
an<00:02:06.869> original<00:02:07.320> plastic<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.429> the

likely<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.490> be<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.940> original<00:03:15.360> plastic<00:03:16.080> but

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
likely to be the original plastic but

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.540 
likely to be the original plastic but
there<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> big<00:03:17.070> difference<00:03:17.190> between

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
there is a big difference between

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.610 
there is a big difference between
original<00:03:18.210> plastic<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.110> regulars<00:03:19.230> aunt

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
original plastic and it regulars aunt

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.250 
original plastic and it regulars aunt
you<00:03:19.740> would<00:03:19.860> by<00:03:19.980> now<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:21.210> plastic<00:03:21.600> I'm<00:03:21.990> from

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
you would by now the plastic I'm from

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.410 
you would by now the plastic I'm from
back<00:03:22.440> home<00:03:22.560> day<00:03:22.740> is<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> lot<00:03:23.160> smoother<00:03:23.640> softer

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
back home day is a lot smoother softer

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.240 
back home day is a lot smoother softer
so<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.020> cube<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.350> smoother<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.920> hasn't

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
so it's cube is smoother and hasn't

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.590 
so it's cube is smoother and hasn't
walked<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.550> flied<00:03:26.640> feeling<00:03:27.240> that's<00:03:27.420> what<00:03:27.480> I

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
walked and flied feeling that's what I

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.050 
walked and flied feeling that's what I
really<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:27.900> like<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.710> this<00:03:29.400> here<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.730> an

48-point<00:04:14.730> edgemont<00:04:15.240> hopefully<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.720> camera

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
48-point edgemont hopefully the camera

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.449 
48-point edgemont hopefully the camera
will<00:04:16.290> focus<00:04:16.320> here<00:04:17.930> but<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.080> is<00:04:19.109> rounded<00:04:19.770> right

in<00:04:20.609> there<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.320> there<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:22.740> round<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.250> off

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
in there and there I just round that off

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.160 
in there and there I just round that off
really<00:04:23.610> really<00:04:23.790> good

that<00:04:50.130> I've<00:04:50.430> actually<00:04:50.670> like<00:04:51.120> rounded<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.140> off

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
that I've actually like rounded this off

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.050 
that I've actually like rounded this off
here<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:53.010> I've<00:04:53.190> kind<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.490> got<00:04:53.640> rid<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:53.850> some<00:04:54.030> of

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
here so I've kind of got rid of some of

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.940 
here so I've kind of got rid of some of
that<00:04:54.270> flak<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.840> I've<00:04:55.320> right<00:04:55.500> on<00:04:55.590> these<00:04:55.740> off<00:04:55.920> a

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
that flak and I've right on these off a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.370 
that flak and I've right on these off a
little<00:04:56.190> bit<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.610> also<00:04:57.420> there's<00:04:58.230> like<00:04:58.350> a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
little bit and also there's like a

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.440 
little bit and also there's like a
little<00:04:58.680> bump<00:04:58.980> that's<00:04:59.790> there<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.060> I've

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
little bump that's there to I've

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.780 
little bump that's there to I've
actually<00:05:00.600> went<00:05:00.960> through<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.670> rounded<00:05:02.670> that

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
actually went through and rounded that

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.760 
actually went through and rounded that
off<00:05:02.970> as<00:05:03.150> well<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.990> can<00:05:04.140> see<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.380> piece<00:05:04.590> looks

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
off as well you can see the piece looks

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
off as well you can see the piece looks
pretty<00:05:05.100> good<00:05:05.390> see<00:05:06.390> if<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:06.630> can<00:05:06.840> refocus<00:05:08.300> or<00:05:09.300> not

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
pretty good see if I can refocus or not

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.860 
pretty good see if I can refocus or not
forget<00:05:11.790> it<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:12.000> doesn't<00:05:12.150> want<00:05:12.390> to<00:05:12.450> focus<00:05:12.570> but

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
forget it it doesn't want to focus but

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.310 
forget it it doesn't want to focus but
you<00:05:12.990> get<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.410> point<00:05:13.650> right<00:05:13.800> there<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:15.320> this

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
you get the point right there and this

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.650 
you get the point right there and this
cube<00:05:16.680> i<00:05:16.920> lubed<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.730> same<00:05:17.940> way<00:05:18.150> that<00:05:18.330> Arctic

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
cube i lubed it the same way that Arctic

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.410 
cube i lubed it the same way that Arctic
drew<00:05:18.960> shown<00:05:19.740> how<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:19.890> lubys<00:05:20.280> too<00:05:20.460> but<00:05:21.150> that

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
drew shown how to lubys too but that

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.240 
drew shown how to lubys too but that
sound<00:05:21.750> like<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.110> be<00:05:22.200> very<00:05:22.230> gummy<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.010> I'm

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
sound like you to be very gummy and I'm

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.840 
sound like you to be very gummy and I'm
not<00:05:23.430> sure<00:05:24.050> now<00:05:25.050> he<00:05:25.110> uses<00:05:25.800> like<00:05:26.010> lubick<00:05:26.460> stew

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
not sure now he uses like lubick stew

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.610 
not sure now he uses like lubick stew
loop<00:05:27.000> his<00:05:27.150> cues<00:05:27.480> i<00:05:27.660> use<00:05:27.810> algo<00:05:28.170> loop<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.560> how

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
loop his cues i use algo loop and how

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.650 
loop his cues i use algo loop and how
they<00:05:28.800> lose<00:05:28.950> a<00:05:28.980> lot<00:05:29.190> thicker<00:05:29.400> then<00:05:30.060> lubick<00:05:30.420> just

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
they lose a lot thicker then lubick just

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.960 
they lose a lot thicker then lubick just
because<00:05:30.870> i<00:05:30.900> like<00:05:31.260> gummy<00:05:31.950> feeling<00:05:32.280> cubes<00:05:32.550> and

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
because i like gummy feeling cubes and

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.570 
because i like gummy feeling cubes and
so<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.390> actually<00:05:33.510> had<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.810> do<00:05:34.770> my<00:05:34.950> I<00:05:35.250> didn't<00:05:35.550> have

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
so I actually had to do my I didn't have

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.430 
so I actually had to do my I didn't have
a<00:05:35.700> video<00:05:35.940> on<00:05:36.030> how<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.210> UM<00:05:36.420> gum<00:05:36.660> your<00:05:36.870> cube<00:05:37.110> and

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
a video on how to UM gum your cube and

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.110 
a video on how to UM gum your cube and
actually<00:05:37.830> have<00:05:37.920> to<00:05:37.980> do<00:05:38.100> it<00:05:38.250> too<00:05:38.550> you<00:05:39.000> know<00:05:39.090> I

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
actually have to do it too you know I

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.370 
actually have to do it too you know I
did<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.510> light<00:05:39.630> side<00:05:39.810> on<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:39.990> other<00:05:40.050> side

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
did to the light side on the other side

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.960 
did to the light side on the other side
and<00:05:40.650> then<00:05:40.920> worked<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.250> little<00:05:41.370> back<00:05:41.550> around<00:05:41.820> it

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
and then worked a little back around it

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.520 
and then worked a little back around it
was<00:05:42.030> fine<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.780> one<00:05:42.930> is<00:05:43.020> really<00:05:43.170> good<00:05:43.380> it's

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
was fine this one is really good it's

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.920 
was fine this one is really good it's
really<00:05:43.560> smooth<00:05:43.920> and<00:05:43.950> fast<00:05:44.660> it's<00:05:45.660> kind<00:05:45.810> of

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
really smooth and fast it's kind of

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.730 
really smooth and fast it's kind of
snappy<00:05:46.380> but<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.880> sound<00:05:48.210> does<00:05:48.600> not<00:05:48.810> go<00:05:49.590> with

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
snappy but the sound does not go with

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.290 
snappy but the sound does not go with
how<00:05:49.950> it<00:05:50.100> feels<00:05:50.400> like<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.670> feels<00:05:50.820> so<00:05:51.030> smooth

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
how it feels like it feels so smooth

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.060 
how it feels like it feels so smooth
like<00:05:51.420> it<00:05:51.510> would<00:05:51.600> be<00:05:51.630> so<00:05:51.840> quiet<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.440> know<00:05:52.860> it

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
like it would be so quiet I know it

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.190 
like it would be so quiet I know it
sounds<00:05:53.280> snappy<00:05:53.850> and<00:05:54.060> it's<00:05:54.210> just<00:05:54.480> real<00:05:54.780> buttery

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
sounds snappy and it's just real buttery

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.060 
sounds snappy and it's just real buttery
soon<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.530> clicking<00:05:58.830> noise<00:05:58.860> you

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
soon and the the clicking noise you

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.290 
soon and the the clicking noise you
probably<00:05:59.280> hear<00:05:59.400> is<00:05:59.490> also<00:05:59.700> because<00:05:59.880> the<00:05:59.970> pieces

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
probably hear is also because the pieces

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.030 
probably hear is also because the pieces
are<00:06:00.420> modded<00:06:00.810> especially<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.650> edge<00:06:01.770> pieces

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
are modded especially the edge pieces

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.540 
are modded especially the edge pieces
are<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.490> notice<00:06:02.760> that<00:06:02.880> when<00:06:02.970> you<00:06:03.090> edge<00:06:03.210> when<00:06:03.570> you

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
are I notice that when you edge when you

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.680 
are I notice that when you edge when you
mod<00:06:05.550> edge<00:06:05.820> pieces<00:06:06.150> they<00:06:06.480> tend<00:06:06.780> to<00:06:07.160> get<00:06:08.160> more

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
mod edge pieces they tend to get more

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.000 
mod edge pieces they tend to get more
like<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.720> real<00:06:09.930> scratchy<00:06:10.290> like<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.650> noise<00:06:10.980> and

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
like a real scratchy like a noise and

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.370 
like a real scratchy like a noise and
stuff<00:06:11.340> like<00:06:11.490> that<00:06:11.550> and<00:06:11.910> so<00:06:12.720> this<00:06:13.050> cube<00:06:13.320> is

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
stuff like that and so this cube is

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.140 
stuff like that and so this cube is
pretty<00:06:13.560> good<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:14.430> little<00:06:14.640> sluggish<00:06:14.850> in<00:06:14.970> the

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
pretty good the little sluggish in the

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.320 
pretty good the little sluggish in the
middle<00:06:15.420> but<00:06:15.570> it's<00:06:15.720> not<00:06:15.840> too<00:06:15.990> bad<00:06:16.140> I<00:06:17.000> like<00:06:18.000> it<00:06:18.210> I

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
middle but it's not too bad I like it I

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.840 
middle but it's not too bad I like it I
like<00:06:18.360> my<00:06:18.870> cube<00:06:19.080> slow<00:06:19.350> and<00:06:19.500> gummy<00:06:19.710> so<00:06:20.040> it<00:06:20.430> fits

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
like my cube slow and gummy so it fits

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.140 
like my cube slow and gummy so it fits
me<00:06:21.060> really<00:06:21.450> good<00:06:21.750> as<00:06:21.960> far<00:06:21.990> as<00:06:22.290> how<00:06:22.410> that<00:06:22.620> goes

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
me really good as far as how that goes

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.580 
me really good as far as how that goes
these<00:06:24.150> auntie's<00:06:24.480> are<00:06:24.600> faster<00:06:25.170> and<00:06:25.200> little<00:06:25.500> bit

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
these auntie's are faster and little bit

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.460 
these auntie's are faster and little bit
snappier<00:06:26.240> but<00:06:27.240> that's<00:06:27.600> also<00:06:27.780> because<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.380> how

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
snappier but that's also because of how

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.920 
snappier but that's also because of how
goo<00:06:28.710> hyung<00:06:28.830> be<00:06:29.010> to<00:06:29.190> feel<00:06:29.430> so<00:06:29.700> yeah<00:06:30.480> this<00:06:30.780> is

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
goo hyung be to feel so yeah this is

main<00:06:43.770> cues<00:06:44.070> but<00:06:44.100> lately<00:06:44.730> these<00:06:45.030> three<00:06:45.390> for<00:06:45.960> the

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
main cues but lately these three for the

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.540 
main cues but lately these three for the
ones<00:06:46.200> I'm<00:06:46.350> finding<00:06:46.620> myself<00:06:46.740> playing<00:06:47.130> but<00:06:47.370> in

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
ones I'm finding myself playing but in

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.680 
ones I'm finding myself playing but in
the<00:06:47.700> fact<00:06:47.910> that<00:06:47.970> they're<00:06:48.180> black<00:06:48.450> and<00:06:48.480> half

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
the fact that they're black and half

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.600 
the fact that they're black and half
dine<00:06:48.900> stickers<00:06:49.260> on<00:06:49.380> there<00:06:49.530> don't<00:06:50.160> seem<00:06:50.520> to

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
dine stickers on there don't seem to

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.070 
dine stickers on there don't seem to
bother<00:06:50.730> me<00:06:51.030> and<00:06:51.090> actually<00:06:51.450> i<00:06:51.510> think<00:06:51.540> my<00:06:51.810> color

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
bother me and actually i think my color

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.480 
bother me and actually i think my color
recognition<00:06:52.260> might<00:06:52.800> be<00:06:52.920> a<00:06:52.950> little<00:06:53.130> bit<00:06:53.310> better

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
recognition might be a little bit better

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.520 
recognition might be a little bit better
because<00:06:53.730> these<00:06:54.450> are<00:06:54.570> just<00:06:54.690> simple<00:06:54.930> stickers

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
because these are just simple stickers

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.660 
because these are just simple stickers
and<00:06:55.680> they're<00:06:55.770> not<00:06:55.890> all<00:06:56.040> those<00:06:56.190> wild<00:06:56.400> wacky

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.670 
and they're not all those wild wacky

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.760 
and they're not all those wild wacky
colors<00:06:57.180> but<00:06:57.960> yeah<00:06:58.140> i<00:06:58.170> just<00:06:58.350> wanted<00:06:58.680> to<00:06:58.710> give
