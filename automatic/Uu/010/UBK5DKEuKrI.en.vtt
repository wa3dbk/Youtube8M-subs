00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
like design embedded here in this latch

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.969 
like design embedded here in this latch
device<00:05:52.860> because<00:05:53.860> this<00:05:54.069> here<00:05:54.399> opens<00:05:54.819> up<00:05:55.029> and

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
device because this here opens up and
