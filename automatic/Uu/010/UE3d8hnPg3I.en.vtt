00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.660
 a path much less dear friend of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.830
 yours since I have not studied 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.170
 fashion 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.080
 I helped as a model, not 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.220
 put in place a kind of theft with 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.470
 dexterity all laboratory the crisis has 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.320
 diverted that I have been looking for 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.220
 to understand the work methods the points of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.109
 view 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.019
 at one point i saw i was 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.140
 exactly where I needed to be 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:35.430
 within the modern music fair me not 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.870
 it was my role as illustrator and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.380
 I realized that I have to go through the other 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.920
 part 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.290
 I felt darker than my clothes 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.430
 creator started it with one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.210
 line that today can be defined 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.129
 experimental because there was a bit of everything 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.199
 more of everything my first passion 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 that the artisan bastard of the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.460
 painting on fabric and making a big one 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.030
 I use and I talk about time 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.630
 both the Rome also because the deus ex 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.690
 machine of my story 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:12.530
 conceal the applications for the competition 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.930
 who's on next to present mine 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.690
 collection that will come but a lot on the garments 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.390
 indeed, mind you, let's say a little 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.710
 best staff to present ha 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.460
 overwhelmed 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:33.830
 in 2009 my candidacy for an ex 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.470
 events soundly rejected is 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.789
 always start with this I trust that 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.090
 the meeting experts who 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.520
 yes that was sung before the beginning 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.920
 of the battles all the nets networks are 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.990
 always with this this scream 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.619
 maybe there is no question but the character 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.320
 the signature at the bottom that a woman chickens 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.619
 on their own look and time of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.630
 his character 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.550
 the dress the base must be updated 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 however who gave it ours 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.520
 communication 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.959
 I choose to do, or combinations of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.390
 pairings I put a minimum 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.310
 meaning my story make me redesigned 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.980
 what I do and more help difference 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.319
 organized by drawing sketches e 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.959
 I have to spend many hours of 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.130
 laboratory and as long as the dress I have 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.500
 won everything 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.150
 the styles of the first rehearsal queen of 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.920
 write against non- money areas not 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.100
 you must go must stay perfectly 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.319
 on him and that as he said bione registered 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.510
 they can be beautiful to show 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.299
 mesh the concerts of france a body 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.730
 that is, real real Sony groups 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.019
 below and not even bruises perfect 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.660
 not be just crimes 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.520
 the garments dedicated to the quarrels are the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.880
 sample 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.610
 stila galles still but beckham however one 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.500
 goddess despite the mud despite the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.780
 tragedy is all he has then 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.580
 brought the earthquake are the clothes of 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.030
 closing of the museum next yes that as from 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.710
 a subject so poor and popular yes 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.010
 can be traced back to tailoring 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:23.560
 Italian through cuts and earth 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.350
 through laboratory knowledge 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:32.770
 all are all completely made in 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:35.620
 italy for us very important and we have 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.380
 laboratories for each type of 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.760
 clothing on shirts, etc. e 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.970
 all viruses are made by hand 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.770
 I don't want to have chosen it specifically 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.020
 so far so different to be able to 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.030
 show that dialogue is always 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.460
 however not possible it is not even a 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.040
 fact that they made the right choice o 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.410
 wrong of culture is right paternÃ² 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.340
 any culture totally 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.910
 always transmitted the bridge to 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.450
 another is always a speech by 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.430
 of equal comparison and we can 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.100
 to succeed now so now it must be 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.000
 owns because thrown too long of 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.220
 dark a freeing of the farmer 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.920
 now it must be so must be must 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.660
 be a 4 and who better than young people 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.890
 of their generation can understand it and 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.560
 make it understood 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.180
 after some experience from a sector 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.190
 this worlds in the neighboring world 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.580
 art in an art gallery 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.800
 here then many of these service 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.140
 initiatives because this facilitates and 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.370
 guys that the presentation that is the 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:54.310
 initial step but it is more difficult for 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.580
 lots of economic components from 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.500
 to realize is not a personal piece 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.500
 designers because we don't want it
