00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
it on the nice flat straight bit that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.010 
it on the nice flat straight bit that
you've<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.250> cut<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:49.270> it's<00:01:49.420> nice<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.899> firm

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
you've just cut so it's nice and firm

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.540 
you've just cut so it's nice and firm
against<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.500> board<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.039> you've<00:01:51.130> got<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.310> good

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
against the board and you've got a good

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.389 
against the board and you've got a good
cutting<00:01:51.789> surface<00:01:52.590> tip<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.740> your<00:01:53.770> knife<00:01:54.009> on<00:01:54.280> the

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
cutting surface tip of your knife on the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:02.279 
cutting surface tip of your knife on the
board<00:01:59.850> fingers<00:02:00.850> out<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.149> way<00:02:01.299> using<00:02:02.259> your

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
board fingers out the way using your

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.460 
board fingers out the way using your
fingertips<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.229> then<00:02:05.319> when<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.560> get<00:02:05.739> halfway

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
fingertips and then when you get halfway

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.100 
fingertips and then when you get halfway
it<00:02:08.470> makes<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.950> bit<00:02:09.069> easier<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.849> just

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it makes it a bit easier if you just

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.740 
it makes it a bit easier if you just
flip<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.140> over<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.239> getting<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.599> bit

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
flip it over because it's getting a bit

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.300 
flip it over because it's getting a bit
narrow<00:02:13.959> now<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.440> your<00:02:14.560> fingers<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.099> flip

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
narrow now with your fingers just flip

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:24.930 
narrow now with your fingers just flip
it<00:02:15.459> over<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:16.660> start<00:02:17.050> again<00:02:23.819> then<00:02:24.819> if

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
it over and then start again then if

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:36.199 
it over and then start again then if
you've<00:02:25.120> got<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.330> bit<00:02:25.510> at<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.780> end

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.320 

push<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.599> one<00:02:37.720> side<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.599> then<00:02:40.780> we'll<00:02:40.989> do

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
push that to one side and then we'll do

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.110 
push that to one side and then we'll do
fine<00:02:43.410> finely<00:02:44.410> chopped<00:02:44.680> onion<00:02:45.129> so<00:02:45.879> if<00:02:46.000> you've

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
fine finely chopped onion so if you've

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.910 
fine finely chopped onion so if you've
got<00:02:46.330> your<00:02:46.510> half<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:46.959> still<00:02:47.170> got<00:02:47.379> its<00:02:47.410> bottom

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
got your half it's still got its bottom

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.080 
got your half it's still got its bottom
it<00:02:48.069> on<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.430> keeps<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.760> all<00:02:48.879> together<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.849> want

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it on it keeps it all together you want
