00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
the original that was a core development

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.300 
the original that was a core development
principle<00:01:22.870> for<00:01:23.050> us<00:01:23.230> as<00:01:23.410> this<00:01:23.560> game<00:01:23.770> needed<00:01:24.220> to

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
principle for us as this game needed to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.670 
principle for us as this game needed to
play<00:01:24.520> exactly<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.660> way<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.960> did<00:01:26.110> 10<00:01:26.380> years<00:01:26.410> ago

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
play exactly the way it did 10 years ago

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.860 
play exactly the way it did 10 years ago
I<00:01:27.010> mean<00:01:27.190> this<00:01:27.730> is<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.000> game<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.210> launched<00:01:28.750> a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
I mean this is the game that launched a

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.960 
I mean this is the game that launched a
generation<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.470> shooters<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.400> we<00:01:30.520> had<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.820> make

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
generation of shooters so we had to make

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.700 
generation of shooters so we had to make
sure<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.450> feeling<00:01:32.020> was<00:01:32.110> identical<00:01:32.560> to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
sure that that feeling was identical to

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.290 
sure that that feeling was identical to
that<00:01:32.800> experienced<00:01:33.460> everybody<00:01:33.850> remembered

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
that experienced everybody remembered

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.970 
that experienced everybody remembered
ten<00:01:34.540> years<00:01:34.750> ago<00:01:34.900> because<00:01:35.110> this<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.710> really<00:01:35.830> a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
ten years ago because this is really a

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.430 
ten years ago because this is really a
gift<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.430> fans<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.970> is<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.180> way<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.440> relive

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
gift of the fans this is a way to relive

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.050 
gift of the fans this is a way to relive
the<00:01:38.590> experience<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:39.130> playing<00:01:39.310> halo<00:01:39.610> one<00:01:39.850> for

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
the experience of playing halo one for

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.400 
the experience of playing halo one for
the<00:01:40.120> first<00:01:40.270> time<00:01:40.510> so<00:01:40.750> we<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:41.080> wanted<00:01:41.290> to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
the first time so we really wanted to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.140 
the first time so we really wanted to
make<00:01:41.530> sure<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.770> was<00:01:41.860> identical<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.090> way

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
make sure it was identical and the way

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.090 
make sure it was identical and the way
we<00:01:43.300> did<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.600> was<00:01:43.660> actually<00:01:44.260> a<00:01:44.440> fun<00:01:44.650> technical

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
we did that was actually a fun technical

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.590 
we did that was actually a fun technical
trick<00:01:45.310> we're<00:01:45.460> actually<00:01:45.610> running<00:01:45.910> portions<00:01:46.480> of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
trick we're actually running portions of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.810 
trick we're actually running portions of
two<00:01:46.750> engines<00:01:47.080> at<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.290> same<00:01:47.500> time<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
two engines at the same time so the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.490 
two engines at the same time so the
underlying<00:01:49.210> code<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.630> code<00:01:49.780> controlling<00:01:50.410> how

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
underlying code the code controlling how

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.260 
underlying code the code controlling how
the<00:01:50.560> game<00:01:50.800> feels<00:01:51.070> how<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.310> AI<00:01:51.520> reacts<00:01:51.970> all<00:01:52.150> of

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.360 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of
that<00:01:52.390> stuff<00:01:52.660> is<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.260> lot<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.620> it's<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.980> original

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.980 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original
halo<00:01:54.520> 1<00:01:54.760> code<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.330> was<00:01:55.480> really<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> best

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
halo 1 code and that was really the best

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.360 
halo 1 code and that was really the best
way<00:01:56.140> for<00:01:56.440> us<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.560> ensure<00:01:56.800> that<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.220> game

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
way for us to ensure that the game

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.100 
way for us to ensure that the game
played<00:01:57.670> exactly<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.330> same<00:01:58.510> as<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.780> did<00:01:58.870> 10

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
played exactly the same as it did 10

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.080 
played exactly the same as it did 10
years<00:01:59.140> ago<00:01:59.380> but<00:02:00.220> on<00:02:00.340> top<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.580> that<00:02:00.760> we've

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
years ago but on top of that we've

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.120 
years ago but on top of that we've
layered<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.630> new<00:02:01.750> graphics<00:02:01.990> engine<00:02:02.350> that

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
layered a new graphics engine that

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.620 
layered a new graphics engine that
allows<00:02:03.220> us<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:04.030> know<00:02:04.150> make<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.450> game<00:02:04.600> look

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
allows us to you know make the game look

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.149 
allows us to you know make the game look
fantastic<00:02:05.230> and<00:02:05.530> look<00:02:05.650> like<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> current

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
fantastic and look like a current

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.890 
fantastic and look like a current
generation<00:02:06.610> title<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.210> really<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.570> great

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
generation title so it's really a great

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.020 
generation title so it's really a great
mix<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.590> two<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.459> at<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.640> end<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:09.909> day

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
mix of the two so at the end of the day

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.339 
mix of the two so at the end of the day
you<00:02:10.090> know<00:02:10.239> your<00:02:10.420> halo<00:02:10.569> fan<00:02:10.780> gets<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.110> game<00:02:11.230> that

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
you know your halo fan gets a game that

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.530 
you know your halo fan gets a game that
plays<00:02:11.500> exactly<00:02:12.159> like<00:02:12.310> they<00:02:12.430> remember<00:02:12.909> but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
plays exactly like they remember but

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.839 
plays exactly like they remember but
looks<00:02:13.930> like<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.200> current<00:02:14.500> generation<00:02:14.950> title<00:02:15.280> we

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
looks like a current generation title we

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.130 
looks like a current generation title we
get<00:02:15.970> some<00:02:16.150> other<00:02:16.239> benefits<00:02:16.720> from<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:16.959> as

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
