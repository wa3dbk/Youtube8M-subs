vegetable grilling is all about altering

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.249 
vegetable grilling is all about altering
the<00:00:24.640> surface<00:00:24.999> to<00:00:25.119> mass<00:00:25.269> ratio<00:00:25.539> with<00:00:26.019> the<00:00:26.109> food

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
the surface to mass ratio with the food

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.810 
the surface to mass ratio with the food
so<00:00:26.470> that<00:00:26.650> it's<00:00:26.769> compatible<00:00:27.339> with<00:00:27.429> the<00:00:27.519> thermal

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
so that it's compatible with the thermal

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.460 
so that it's compatible with the thermal

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
dimensions of the grapes look here just

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.420 
dimensions of the grapes look here just
multiply<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.500> masses<00:00:32.890> that's<00:00:33.039> why<00:00:33.219> by

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
multiply the the masses that's why by

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.080 
multiply the the masses that's why by
the<00:00:33.460> coefficient<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:36.160> know<00:00:36.309> you're<00:00:36.789> right

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
the coefficient of you know you're right

the coefficient of you know you're right
why<00:00:37.510> work<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:37.930> out<00:00:38.079> when<00:00:38.289> you<00:00:38.410> can<00:00:38.590> cook<00:00:38.859> it<00:00:39.010> out

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
why work it out when you can cook it out

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.610 
why work it out when you can cook it out
now<00:00:40.000> let's<00:00:40.210> consider<00:00:40.390> this<00:00:40.840> problem<00:00:41.140> food

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
me and then run another onion onto it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.920 
me and then run another onion onto it
now<00:01:24.370> you<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.580> use<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.910> skewers<00:01:25.330> as<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.540> guide

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
now you can use the skewers as a guide

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.190 
now you can use the skewers as a guide
for<00:01:26.230> cutting<00:01:26.860> or<00:01:27.160> slicing<00:01:27.670> those<00:01:28.030> onions<00:01:28.570> into

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
for cutting or slicing those onions into

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.350 
for cutting or slicing those onions into
three<00:01:29.830> sections<00:01:30.160> so<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.790> end<00:01:30.940> up<00:01:31.090> with

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
three sections so that you end up with

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.590 
three sections so that you end up with
well<00:01:31.630> six<00:01:32.590> pieces<00:01:32.920> all<00:01:33.250> day<00:01:33.520> will<00:01:34.150> those<00:01:34.390> up

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
well six pieces all day will those up

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.970 
well six pieces all day will those up
lay<00:01:34.960> them<00:01:35.140> right<00:01:35.170> out<00:01:35.350> on<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.770> grill<00:01:35.950> right

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
lay them right out on the grill right

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.190 
lay them right out on the grill right
now<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.250> skewers<00:01:36.670> are<00:01:36.820> going<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.210> prevent<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
now the skewers are going to prevent the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.740 
now the skewers are going to prevent the
pieces<00:01:38.740> from<00:01:38.950> coming<00:01:39.580> undone<00:01:39.790> during<00:01:40.420> cooking

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
pieces from coming undone during cooking

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.470 
pieces from coming undone during cooking
after<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.500> few<00:01:41.800> minutes<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.550> can<00:01:42.820> then<00:01:43.030> use<00:01:43.300> the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
after a few minutes you can then use the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.810 
after a few minutes you can then use the
stuarts<00:01:43.810> handles<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.800> flip<00:01:45.250> with<00:01:45.550> your

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
stuarts handles to flip with your

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.240 
stuarts handles to flip with your
spatula<00:01:46.180> yeah<00:01:47.020> that's<00:01:47.350> very<00:01:47.710> very<00:01:47.950> nice
