00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
pokemon at this energy card is attached

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.880 
pokemon at this energy card is attached
to<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:50.180> reduced<00:01:50.780> by<00:01:50.900> 10<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:51.620> there's<00:01:51.800> only

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
to is reduced by 10 but there's only

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.470 
to is reduced by 10 but there's only
cash<00:01:52.160> for<00:01:52.400> metal<00:01:52.640> Pokemon<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:53.270> we

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
cash for metal Pokemon so we

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.660 
cash for metal Pokemon so we
I<00:01:53.540> also<00:01:54.290> suggest<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.890> put<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.160> work<00:01:55.370> with

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
I also suggest you put in work with

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.400 
I also suggest you put in work with
skarmory<00:01:56.060> from<00:01:56.270> indented<00:01:56.750> or<00:01:57.110> color<00:01:57.320> of

legends and your deck together with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.820 
legends and your deck together with
Cesaro<00:01:59.150> they<00:01:59.810> could<00:01:59.990> be<00:02:00.110> really<00:02:00.350> great<00:02:00.590> if<00:02:00.740> you

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
Cesaro they could be really great if you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.500 
Cesaro they could be really great if you
have<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.280> start<00:02:01.490> with<00:02:01.550> them<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.090> can<00:02:02.270> set

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
have to start with them so you can set

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.180 
have to start with them so you can set
up<00:02:02.600> your<00:02:02.630> sizes<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.260> bench<00:02:03.470> with<00:02:03.800> special

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
up your sizes on the bench with special

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.920 
up your sizes on the bench with special
metal<00:02:04.430> energies<00:02:04.760> or<00:02:04.880> basic<00:02:05.390> ones<00:02:05.600> really

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
metal energies or basic ones really

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.780 
metal energies or basic ones really
quick<00:02:06.230> then<00:02:06.440> after<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.950> turn<00:02:07.190> or<00:02:07.340> two<00:02:07.370> you<00:02:07.670> can

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
quick then after a turn or two you can

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.220 
quick then after a turn or two you can
evolve<00:02:08.030> those<00:02:08.270> side<00:02:08.480> rest<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.990> on<00:02:09.140> the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
evolve those side rest and go on the

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.990 
evolve those side rest and go on the
attack<00:02:09.320> now<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.920> may<00:02:10.190> take<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.610> sniping

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
attack now you may take the sniping

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.400 
attack now you may take the sniping
decks<00:02:11.240> are<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.510> main<00:02:11.660> weakness<00:02:12.050> right<00:02:12.230> now

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
decks are the main weakness right now

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.140 
decks are the main weakness right now
but<00:02:12.800> if<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:12.980> put<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.280> some<00:02:13.460> chuckles<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
but if we put in some chuckles and a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.240 
but if we put in some chuckles and a
cling<00:02:14.450> clang<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.990> won't<00:02:15.170> be<00:02:15.260> any<00:02:15.470> problem<00:02:15.500> so

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
cling clang that won't be any problem so

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.860 
cling clang that won't be any problem so

I<00:02:29.300> suggest<00:02:29.780> given<00:02:30.020> us<00:02:30.110> many<00:02:30.290> energies<00:02:30.770> to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
I suggest given us many energies to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.680 
I suggest given us many energies to
chuckle<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:31.610> only<00:02:31.850> if<00:02:31.970> you're<00:02:32.120> up<00:02:32.210> against<00:02:32.570> my

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
chuckle but only if you're up against my

chuckle but only if you're up against my
pink<00:02:32.900> pokemon<00:02:33.320> charcoal<00:02:33.950> will<00:02:34.070> protect<00:02:34.430> all

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
pink pokemon charcoal will protect all

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.100 
pink pokemon charcoal will protect all
those<00:02:34.820> metal<00:02:35.090> energies<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.660> once<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.990> have

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
those metal energies and once you have

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.540 
those metal energies and once you have
cling-clang<00:02:36.500> out<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.130> give<00:02:37.280> all<00:02:37.400> those

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
cling-clang out you can give all those

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.460 
cling-clang out you can give all those
metal<00:02:37.820> energies<00:02:38.150> who<00:02:38.420> says<00:02:38.630> all<00:02:38.780> prime<00:02:38.990> the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
metal energies who says all prime the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
don't have any good cards in your hand

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.710 
don't have any good cards in your hand
you<00:02:42.980> can<00:02:43.280> give<00:02:43.430> an<00:02:43.550> energy<00:02:43.850> card<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.330> chuckle

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
you can give an energy card to chuckle

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.510 
you can give an energy card to chuckle
and<00:02:44.870> do<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.410> spoke<00:02:45.620> about<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.160> can<00:02:46.340> draw

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
and do to it spoke about it you can draw

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.430 
and do to it spoke about it you can draw
a<00:02:46.550> card<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.090> would<00:02:47.420> score<00:02:47.660> his<00:02:47.930> first<00:02:47.960> attack

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
a card I would score his first attack

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.230 
a card I would score his first attack
you<00:02:48.740> can<00:02:48.920> give<00:02:49.070> another<00:02:49.280> metal<00:02:49.610> energy<00:02:49.970> to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
you can give another metal energy to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.060 
you can give another metal energy to
chuckle<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:51.050> would<00:02:51.170> give<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.470> two<00:02:51.650> extra
