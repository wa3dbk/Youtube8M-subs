00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
how not not with this processor I think

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.269 
how not not with this processor I think
I<00:06:27.759> think<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.330> selarón<00:06:28.839> can<00:06:29.110> run<00:06:29.589> Windows<00:06:29.830> 8<00:06:30.250> a

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
I think the selarón can run Windows 8 a

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.679 
I think the selarón can run Windows 8 a
but<00:06:30.610> this<00:06:31.389> processor<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:32.169> not<00:06:32.639> supported
