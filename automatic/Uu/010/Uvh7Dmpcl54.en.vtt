00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 just as we have a megatrend in the industry there is a system that 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.839
 will revolutionize the dynamics of the distribution of products and services 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.269
 we are talking about the second piva followed by the businessmen Jorge and Renato 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.560
 gaucho 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.199
 multilevel marketing 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.449
 currently two marketing systems are common in the market 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.409
 the traditional method that follows the flow wholesale distributor factory and 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.950
 end consumer retailer 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.410
 and marketing 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.020
 multilevel simplest method and without 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.260
 in this system we have manufactures 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.050
 distributor 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 final costumer 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.650
 the traditional production and distribution system that in each of its 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.690
 farms has raised the price of the cost reaching up to 80% of its 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.080
 initial value 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.410
 considerably reduces profit margins. 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.210
 already in multilevel marketing that does not have intermediate steps 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.180
 73% of the value of the product goes directly to the distributor 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.080
 it is 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.050
 it's real profit 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.180
 another advantage of multilevel marketing is that it does not require large 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.890
 installations 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.720
 excellent for those who want to start a business with low investment and apathy 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.650
 in your house 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.290
 helton jorge with your business vision explain to me how it's possible 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.280
 Thrive havoc I'll give you an example 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.020
 imagine that I have a company with only one employee I work eight 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.240
 hours per day from Monday to Friday and my employee also 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.630
 therefore I earn the equivalent of 16 hours of work deducting from the salary 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.970
 of the employee 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.480
 the employee is leveraging my business through his work 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.749
 thus theoretically 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.270
 The more employees I have, the higher the press performance. 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.579
 however it is very difficult to get business leverage 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.560
 with employees 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.020
 no employee works so hard as a business owner to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.270
 achieving real leverage, we need to create a situation where all 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.179
 they win 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.489
 I will give an example of how the effort 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.239
 I keep a real estate contract and train a broker 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.659
 every sale I made and the broker earned a percentage 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:26.949
 both of us 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.929
 the same interest in the business 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:32.069
 but there is a flaw in these themes of leveraging 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.879
 I as the real estate owner may have more brokers to increase the income 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.309
 but the corridor does not 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:43.529
 the tendency is for this employee to do what every real estate owner 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.969
 I apologize that he starts his own business there two things with it 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.989
 happens the first of these is that with the departure of the employee I lose my 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.029
 source of income 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:59.049
 the second mp hour still here he becomes a competitor who knows all the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.789
 strengths and weaknesses 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.349
 but this does not happen only with furniture 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.169
 any year of activity is subject to problems like this 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.490
 Have you heard that famous term? 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.209
 I'm going to work there just to gain experience. 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.289
 knows what that means an employee with the ambition to win 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.429
 knowledge start your own business 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:23.569
 if you entrepreneur should know how many people have already trained that do not work 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.809
 more for you 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:29.689
 how many people have you prepared to become your competitors and 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.019
 It does not stop growing, you actually create and train a chain of 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.039
 competitors 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.900
 now I'll show you how multilevel marketing 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.649
 can be a brilliant business choice 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.670
 Let's say from the beginning 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.859
 I helped my broker open a branch of me furniture 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.839
 so that we both have the opportunity to earn their status as a fine of 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.849
 broker for furniture adornment and will no longer be my competitor 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.789
 will be my partner 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:59.090
 This allows me 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.150
 sponsor their own brokers who in the future may become owners of 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.839
 furniture and also 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:10.589
 the more I have incentives new brokers to have their own 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:15.309
 subsidiaries which in turn sponsor other teams of brokers 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.509
 but I win and they too 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:22.930
 it is exactly this system that our company uses to pass on commissions from 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.110
 up to 73% for its distributors
