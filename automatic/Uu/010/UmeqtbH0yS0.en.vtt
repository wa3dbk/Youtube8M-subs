Vaude Kinderhaus,
Working to make y(our) world a better place.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.700
I bring Max to the Kinderhaus because
we like the concept,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.160
the staff members are really well trained
and extremely motivated.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.640
The size of the groups is manageable.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.340
For us it's great because it lets us balance
family and work life really well.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.580
The Kinderhaus was established in 2001.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.860
Altogether we look after 31 kids.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.180
21 are in a group with children ranging from
1 to 10,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.400
and 10 in the nursery ranging between half a year and 3 years.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.260
For the parents it's a great advantage to have the kids so close to their work place.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.260
Especially women at VAUDE have the chance to stay in their managerial positions,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.060
working part-time because their children are taken care of at the Kinderhaus.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.900
We have been bringing Elena for the past two years to the Kinderhaus,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.340
it's directly at my workplace, which means
I don't have an additional commute

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.640
and she has contact with older children

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.540
where she learns so much.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.040
We're amazed every time about all the things she picks up when she's there.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.470
Autonomy is generally very important subject in the Kinderhaus.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.181
The kids organize their areas, clean up by
themselves, get dressed on their own,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.960
our kids also have a strong need for movement,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.540
which they can live out here in rooms that
provide enough space,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.700
and also outside where they can move around freely

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.240
with lots of romping around, running, climbing, sliding.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.100
Our kids are also well equipped and so it's
fun to be out with them.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.300
When we test the children's products, we take them outside, of course.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.500
There you can see right away what's good and what needs improvement.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.620
At noon we all eat lunch together.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.160
Here it's important for us that at least 50% is vegetables.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.700
Twice a day we meet in a circle

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.849
to see who's there and how everyone is doing,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.440
to do things together in order to strengthen the community spirit.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.000
What interests everyone, what do they want to see.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.820
At the kid's conference everyone decides together what's next on the agenda.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.460
I like to look back on many days in the forests

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.560
where the children are very observant and
aware of what is going on around them.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.320
Where they discover many living organisms

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.640
and where it's simply exciting to be there
with them.
