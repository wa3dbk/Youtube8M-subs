00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.940 
the ribbons they can either undo the
Bipin<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.780> then<00:03:41.870> add<00:03:42.049> them<00:03:42.320> or<00:03:42.620> do<00:03:42.890> it

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
Bipin and then add them or do it

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.640 
Bipin and then add them or do it
afterwards<00:03:43.570> just<00:03:44.570> slide<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.989> one<00:03:45.230> back<00:03:45.440> in

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
afterwards just slide that one back in

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.880 
afterwards just slide that one back in
there<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:47.120> as<00:03:47.239> i<00:03:47.359> say<00:03:47.570> more<00:03:47.989> stamping<00:03:48.590> going

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
there and as i say more stamping going

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.400 
there and as i say more stamping going
on<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.190> here<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.579> blitzer<00:03:50.030> lots<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.930> space<00:03:51.200> for

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
on in here and blitzer lots of space for

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.479 
on in here and blitzer lots of space for
adding<00:03:51.709> six<00:03:51.980> by<00:03:52.190> four<00:03:52.250> photographs<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> each

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
adding six by four photographs so each

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.569 
adding six by four photographs so each
page<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:56.120> slightly<00:03:56.390> different<00:03:57.100> as<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.190> see

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
page is slightly different as you see

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.690 
page is slightly different as you see
I've<00:03:58.850> sort<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.090> tried<00:03:59.299> to<00:03:59.709> do<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.859> pages<00:04:01.370> each

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
I've sort of tried to do the pages each

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.819 
I've sort of tried to do the pages each
one<00:04:01.970> individually<00:04:02.269> different<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.530> gives<00:04:03.739> a

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
one individually different so it gives a

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.300 
one individually different so it gives a
different<00:04:03.859> look<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.810> them<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.200> album<00:04:06.709> but

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
different look to them to the album but

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.879 
different look to them to the album but

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
of the big project in the other video I

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.790 
of the big project in the other video I
thought<00:05:01.300> I'll<00:05:01.540> make<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.750> slider<00:05:02.110> card<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.650> go

with<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.370> then<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.580> can<00:05:03.700> be<00:05:03.760> given<00:05:04.000> away<00:05:04.360> as

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690
