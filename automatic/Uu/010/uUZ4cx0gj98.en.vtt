00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.679 
often I'm like okay I'm just going to
figure<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> make<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.390> work<00:01:48.570> with

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
figure out how to make it work with

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.440 
figure out how to make it work with
bobby<00:01:48.960> pins<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> top<00:01:50.820> knot<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.149> make<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
bobby pins and the top knot will make it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.370 
bobby pins and the top knot will make it
look<00:01:51.630> nice<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.110> sometimes<00:01:52.590> too<00:01:53.750> alright<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
look nice for sometimes too alright so

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
look nice for sometimes too alright so
now<00:01:55.829> I'm<00:01:55.979> back<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:57.180> put<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.479> ponytail

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
now I'm back here I have put my ponytail

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
now I'm back here I have put my ponytail
up<00:01:58.290> higher<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.790> will<00:01:59.939> show<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> guys<00:02:00.270> how

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
up higher and I will show you guys how

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.319 
up higher and I will show you guys how
to<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> top<00:02:01.439> knot<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.240> going

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to do a top knot up here and it's going

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.380 
to do a top knot up here and it's going
to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.509> similar<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.399> talked<00:02:05.880> about<00:02:06.030> for

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to be similar to what I talked about for

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.719 
to be similar to what I talked about for
the<00:02:06.479> low<00:02:06.689> bun<00:02:07.399> essentially<00:02:08.399> you're<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the low bun essentially you're going to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
the low bun essentially you're going to
start<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.179> twisting<00:02:09.780> your<00:02:09.899> hair<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
start off with twisting your hair like I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.630 
start off with twisting your hair like I
did<00:02:10.979> last<00:02:11.250> time

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
did last time

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.680 
did last time
and<00:02:13.430> sometimes<00:02:14.430> my<00:02:14.580> hair<00:02:14.790> prefers<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.270> go<00:02:15.420> in

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and sometimes my hair prefers to go in

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.090 
and sometimes my hair prefers to go in
one<00:02:15.870> direction<00:02:15.990> or<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.620> other<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.890> don't

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
one direction or the other I don't

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.660 
one direction or the other I don't
really<00:02:17.640> know<00:02:17.959> why<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:20.069> so

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
really know why it's just like that so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.220 
really know why it's just like that so
you're<00:02:21.270> twisting<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:21.930> you're<00:02:22.080> just

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
you're twisting it and then you're just

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.470 
you're twisting it and then you're just
going<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.410> kind<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.709> wrap<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:22.980> around<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
going to kind of wrap it around the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.949 
going to kind of wrap it around the
center<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.880> my<00:02:27.030> layers<00:02:27.300> are<00:02:27.569> going<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.930> a

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
center and my layers are going to be a

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.730 
center and my layers are going to be a
little<00:02:28.350> temperamental<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:31.170> requires<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
little temperamental so it requires a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.680 
little temperamental so it requires a
little<00:02:32.070> bit<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.459> just<00:02:32.670> kind<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.970> finessing<00:02:33.570> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
little bit of just kind of finessing and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.949 
little bit of just kind of finessing and
just<00:02:33.930> mess<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:35.700> also<00:02:36.090> use<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.750> rubber

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
just mess with it I also use the rubber

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.320 
just mess with it I also use the rubber
band<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.410> really<00:02:37.650> help<00:02:37.830> me<00:02:37.980> out<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:39.120> put

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
band to really help me out like just put

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.910 
band to really help me out like just put
it<00:02:39.420> around<00:02:39.600> once<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:40.350> maybe<00:02:40.560> I'll<00:02:40.739> go

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it around once and then maybe I'll go

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.890 
it around once and then maybe I'll go
around<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.370> second<00:02:41.790> time<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.239> make<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.450> tighter

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
around a second time to make it tighter

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.970 
around a second time to make it tighter
and<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.470> make<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.800> bun<00:02:44.070> better<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.860> know

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
and just make the bun better so you know

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.880 
and just make the bun better so you know
this<00:02:47.700> one<00:02:47.910> came<00:02:48.540> out<00:02:48.660> kind<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.350> silly<00:02:49.590> it's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
this one came out kind of silly it's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.720 
this one came out kind of silly it's
like<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> little<00:02:50.370> bit<00:02:50.550> higher<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:51.510> essentially

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
like a little bit higher but essentially

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.520 
like a little bit higher but essentially
you<00:02:53.730> know<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.150> could<00:02:54.720> bobby<00:02:54.870> pin<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.230> if<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
you know I could bobby pin this if I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.610 
you know I could bobby pin this if I
decided<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.980> stick<00:02:56.340> with<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.630> bun<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.200> this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
decided to stick with the bun like this

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.229 
decided to stick with the bun like this
way<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.070> know<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.580> should<00:02:59.700> probably<00:02:59.760> pin<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
way you know I should probably pin the

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.720 
way you know I should probably pin the
hair<00:03:00.420> down<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.830> can<00:03:02.160> have<00:03:02.400> your

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
hair down and now you can have your

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.870 
hair down and now you can have your
really<00:03:03.239> high<00:03:03.450> top<00:03:03.989> not<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.739> um<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
really high top not like that um and

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.490 
really high top not like that um and
again<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.360> know<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.720> make<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.900> messy<00:03:07.200> or

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
again you know you can make it messy or

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.850 
again you know you can make it messy or
cleaner<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:09.120> prefer<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.530> last<00:03:10.739> thing

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
cleaner as you prefer and the last thing

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.340 
cleaner as you prefer and the last thing
I'll<00:03:10.980> add<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.550> rather<00:03:12.450> than<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.750> couch<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.200> can

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
I'll add is rather than a couch you can

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.610 
I'll add is rather than a couch you can
also<00:03:13.530> use<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> bed<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:15.390> sit<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.110> ground<00:03:16.140> with

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
also use a bed I sit on the ground with

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.250 
also use a bed I sit on the ground with
my<00:03:16.739> back<00:03:17.010> up<00:03:17.190> against<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.549> bed<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.090> then<00:03:18.390> it's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
my back up against the bed and then it's

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.080 
my back up against the bed and then it's
about<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.860> right<00:03:20.070> height<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.579> put<00:03:20.730> your<00:03:20.880> hair

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
about the right height to put your hair

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.350 
about the right height to put your hair
up<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:22.530> for<00:03:22.680> some<00:03:22.860> reason<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.340> prefer<00:03:23.760> couches

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
up but for some reason I prefer couches

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.789 
up but for some reason I prefer couches
because<00:03:24.570> they<00:03:24.750> provide<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> little<00:03:25.440> bit<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.709> a

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
because they provide a little bit of a

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.170 
because they provide a little bit of a
better<00:03:25.950> friction<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.730> really<00:03:27.030> do<00:03:27.150> need

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
better friction and you really do need

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.150 
better friction and you really do need
friction<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.440> your<00:03:28.560> hair<00:03:28.709> doesn't<00:03:28.920> kind

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
friction so that your hair doesn't kind

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.079 
friction so that your hair doesn't kind
of<00:03:29.250> fall<00:03:29.519> back<00:03:29.730> down<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.480> get<00:03:30.810> loose
