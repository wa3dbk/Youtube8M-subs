what the piss is a super role because

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.190 
what the piss is a super role because
you<00:01:20.340> also<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> regular<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you also have like the regular kind and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
you also have like the regular kind and
then<00:01:22.619> these<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:22.979> big<00:01:23.250> roles<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> get

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
regular role why can't there just be one

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
regular role why can't there just be one
size<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.530> needs<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.920> standard<00:01:35.340> I'd

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
size there needs to be a standard I'd

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
size there needs to be a standard I'd
size<00:01:35.850> because<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:37.079> know<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
size because I don't know if this is the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
size because I don't know if this is the
better<00:01:37.979> deal<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.329> better<00:01:39.479> deal

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
better deal or if that's the better deal

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
better deal or if that's the better deal
because<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.950> 10<00:01:41.250> regular

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
because this one you get 10 regular

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.899 
because this one you get 10 regular
which<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> eight<00:01:42.930> big<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.250> six<00:01:44.490> super
