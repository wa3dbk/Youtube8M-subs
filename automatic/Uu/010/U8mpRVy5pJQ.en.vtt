00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello everyone with you automatic and today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.090
 we play maykravt in this issue I 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.639
 I want to tell you about such a company from 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.010
 magic farm solarium is all here to us 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.850
 clearly visible at a glance of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.550
 streams of such craft pipe swing but in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.470
 all in order, why did I put 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.920
 sorting machine and times limits 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.920
 resources 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.840
 all due to the fact that here iz-3 for this 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.040
 the pipe went resources and lay down 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.879
 auto workbench they went first 100 chris 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 here is a sign to the sheet of dough backstage here and if 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.350
 go these pipes then they lie down exactly 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.350
 and immediately out the product 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.490
 here I recommend to put the fight well 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.200
 or more or more powerful engine 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.489
 so he immediately somehow the cat came 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.850
 resources he immediately pumped them out here but 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.280
 principle, everything is just out of what 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.310
 in diesel fuel diesel fuel itself stands out 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.120
 coal dust glass 2 is the circuits 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.270
 microcircuits and one generator here us 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.690
 there is a generator, it goes on black 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.350
 pipe here we accordingly lay down the stove 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.630
 and mechanism 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.380
 battery comes from and from the workbench 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.930
 here tin 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.990
 red dust and solid copper wire 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.990
 it goes through the red tube here 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.370
 chips, too, that's not amenable too 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.340
 here are six wires 2 redstone 1 but for 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.760
 knee iron it all goes on yellow 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 pipe 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.780
 so again 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.220
 so same thing same thing here 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.480
 sorting machine here on the chip 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.280
 on batteries to generators and here you are 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.869
 glass and coal dust and they immediately go 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.240
 directly here on the green tube green 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.300
 sections at once three glasses and requirements 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.300
 were 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.840
 put such here engine is not they 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.670
 until such 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 Electric much more hassle 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.680
 you will spend the wires but this is someone 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.110
 whatever one wants it of course 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.370
 overdone with this charge literally over 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 a couple of seconds okay here we have 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.340
 the timer it gives the signal I set 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.900
 inside second 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.770
 like okay suck i already 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.530
 tried to do 1 point solar well 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.510
 same let's try the chest the chest i 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.940
 folded immediately finished glass red were 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.820
 the stove mechanism me a little tin leg 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.680
 insulated wire hardened 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.540
 iron and coal dust 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.510
 let's see oh 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.510
 it can not sort out the more 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.890
 polish alive 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.969
 yes, in principle, it works like that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.489
 hour mouse Well, I made a special 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.319
 slower that everything was clear you can 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.650
 put the golden pipes they are seeking 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:35.170
 will quickly be shorter here go series 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.180
 first as seen and glass judge and erased 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.269
 cars we put on here so that's to 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.189
 she immediately took no bars when 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.439
 will end bioresources yes here are masters who 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.859
 plays do not sit down only IT resources 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.659
 dofig there you can put this mode 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.239
 all look finished and then show 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.510
 measles can be put 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:59.889
 just get lost here were the glass here 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.430
 went here right now this is on a microchip 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.949
 let's go 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:10.260
 it's head and head for batteries 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:10.260
 here it went to the generators 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.980
 he will quietly sat 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.550
 so here on the series approached threw 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.880
 resources all spinach tactics set 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.340
 threw resources and everything and then forgot 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.130
 sects come and pick up diesel 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.610
 its on many servers are compaq 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.729
 heart allers here from these diesel fuel can 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.330
 further make craft such powerful 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.330
 Solyara here went microcircuits 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.950
 let's go battery 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.880
 batteries now the battery will go and 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.760
 the generator will come out now 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.520
 generator when singleplayer read it 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.040
 quick trimming unusual 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.620
 multiplayer carp reliably began to appear 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.250
 wait and she just come out here 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.250
 somehow fast 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.480
 here 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.480
 such a routine such dirty 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.480
 I will come now and the generator will come out 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.480
 diesel fuel are full 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.810
 Here came the solar. 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.030
 as you can see production as 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.949
 staying resources increases more precisely 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.949
 does not increase but the standard goes 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.100
 2 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.080
 third he came out 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.120
 so i wanted to say 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.129
 if anyone has a game in the north there are few resources 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.530
 he has this sorting machine 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.229
 nasty just stop when 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.969
 something is missing and it delivered here 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.819
 such a chaotic mode 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:15.430
 he just shoves all the resources 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.860
 shoves and all principle it is also possible 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.090
 I don't know what to use. 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.090
 try to do it by the way 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.409
 I used it when it was left completely 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.409
 few resources 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.410
 here it is from the engine 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.660
 On such here it is not necessary such 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.870
 do better better somehow his top 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.260
 put the engine but it is necessary to pipe 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.250
 Gunkan start side or bottom 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.780
 Generally lie the engine immediately below 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.780
 put everything and not suffer 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.520
 oh how many draws went and that means he 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.990
 At first all the resources were a little wrong 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.080
 first all the resources are gathering 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.530
 the first column all swing absolutely 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.530
 then 2 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:17.889
 yes you captures my clothes from 1 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.539
 and he will go to the end bye here and 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.569
 resource will not turn it off when your 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:24.400
 left it with few resources, and while this chun 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:25.840
 so you can bet when you are there in peace 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.849
 vip the premium 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.849
 then you can and put such a regime too 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.630
 such 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:40.870
 Well, the diesel did become in principle 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:45.310
 it's for the same 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:49.330
 difficult everything is extremely simple to understand from 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:52.120
 studied science goes diamond pipe myself 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:58.590
 for pipes we are putting all the resources 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.590
 two lines go down 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.570
 chips and batteries this so 

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.130
 wrapped up to make genera come 

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.950
 there must be a solution there is already clear claim 

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:12.590
 just but that's basically all that in 

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:16.360
 remorse your automatic subscribe 

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.360
 put the Huskies while komentiruyte
