00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.890
 those who are there recently trying to squeeze 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.380
 the master in the position of tarka noticed that 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.910
 suddenly leave us his position 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.760
 gets slippery you start driving 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.530
 especially in a wet t-shirt on the side of the bench 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.080
 aside which prevents you from keeping tough 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.740
 position to prevent this from happening 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.689
 need to smear 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.000
 the store could land some 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.730
 enough shape 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.730
 any wide shock absorber and it can 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.410
 pull the tent and say it already 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.770
 will not interfere with performing the movements he 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.770
 will not be 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.070
 The question often arises as to whether 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.170
 reduced shoulder blades and breast feed 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.700
 forward on the bridge stretched enough 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.860
 infants are not sufficiently 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.950
 joins in the work actually yes 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.660
 because including small pectoral 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.070
 who work with the chest together they 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.290
 responsible for the movement of the shoulder girdle 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.240
 forward when you minimize as much as possible 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.520
 shoulder blades and exit the shoulder girdle back 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.840
 pectoral already in the original position 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.479
 strongly stretched down 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.790
 barbell to the starting position you get 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.380
 maximum stretching of large 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.210
 maximum available in secure 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.210
 with regards to shoulder amplitude 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.820
 joints the most frequently released moment 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.060
 strongly do not finish hey in the process 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.090
 a lot of people is correct 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.130
 paddle work is essentially the job itself 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.180
 Lopatkin during the press should not be 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.160
 but their correct position is adoption 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.570
 starting position takes a percent 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.000
 all places 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.960
 if you take all the importance of how should 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 be the starting position 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.660
 right thing to do 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.850
 before you remove the bar from the racks to reduce 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.670
 shoulder blades reduce blades 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.400
 you have to lift your chest up and after 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.370
 how did you take the neck off 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.260
 also let go of the shoulder blades pushing them down 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.900
 pelvic side 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.000
 thereby raising breasts higher by 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.009
 actually let go of the scapula without lifting 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 chest is impossible all these movements 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.600
 complement each other and the bridge is laid 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.650
 above only if you reduce blades 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.650
 and lower them down 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.420
 not 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.980
 pay attention to that on its own 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.200
 the bridge of the plane of the bench is not everything should 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.359
 be and transverse bend which 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.099
 created precisely by the movement of the shoulders 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.799
 weave from shoulder to the beginning of information 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.139
 blades which would create another brand 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.269
 perpendicular to the main orcs can not 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.540
 and this is very important because again 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.260
 this 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.639
 and fixes the position of the bench press itself 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.500
 shoulder joints maximally 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.510
 fixed hard position in 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.150
 where the injury risk of injury is reduced to 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.000
 minimum you can safely 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.340
 lift very large weights after 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.019
 how all your views are set right 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.150
 put up and on good bridges brought down 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.209
 blades lowered correctly put the neck 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.879
 and so on by watching the situation 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.239
 elbows in the process of doing the bench 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:23.030
 do it right so that elbows you 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.530
 were always under the fingerboard if in 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.870
 process of doing let me go to the mountain 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.939
 joy and reward you elbows go away 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.590
 forward ahead the neck it creates 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.659
 unnecessary burden on the statute and nautilus 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.209
 triceps and if I turn the other way around 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.889
 strong far back you carry 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.540
 excessive load on the shoulder 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.909
 joints 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.939
 both options are not optimal from the point 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.590
 view of application of force 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.470
 option traumatic so try 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.590
 let's make sure your elbows are always 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.450
 were under the fingerboard 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.890
 if you follow this you 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.810
 at the same time then let's try to find 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.920
 draft plan total find that point on 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.260
 which the neck should lower the bottom 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.849
 point to what place exactly because 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.099
 many ask where exactly to put it 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.230
 on the bottom of the chest on the middle of the chest below it 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.709
 depends on the relative position of the elbows 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.790
 neck width and a number of other nuances 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.790
 about which can tell
