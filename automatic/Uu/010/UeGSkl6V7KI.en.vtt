advanced<00:05:19.199> refine<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.940> um<00:05:21.650> for<00:05:22.650> for<00:05:22.889> refine

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
advanced refine so um for for refine

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.020 
advanced refine so um for for refine
it's<00:05:24.360> still<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.659> random<00:05:25.550> jumbling<00:05:26.550> off<00:05:26.789> your

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
stats but for advanced refined I should

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.050
