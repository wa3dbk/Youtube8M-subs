 external meniscus injury and it's almost 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.969
 sure it will not be for this game anymore

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 almost to a point of confirmation 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.000
 Colombia has 26 points in 13 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.750

 mario alberto yepes and cristian zapata 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.170

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.030

 celeste with a 3 to 2 and a 3 to 1 both 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.899
 they met with more goals than the average 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.570
 established the two previous games to 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.980
 these had ended ties to a goal in 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.050
 the seven eliminatory matches 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.030
 Uruguay home in the series 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.010
 local won four times had two 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.700
 ties and a single victory for Colombia 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.260
 in 1973 in the first clash between these 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.480
 two selections in this eliminator 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.550
 heading brazil to coconut never a crushing 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.680
 victory of colombia with a 4 for 0 in 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.510
 barranquilla with a double of teo 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.940
 gutiérrez where the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.920
 goal expectation the betting house 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.240
 live they have the quota of uruguay in 2.05 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.670
 105 the tie at 3.25 225 and the share of 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.980
 the Colombians in 3 points 60 or more 260 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.320
 nine American is very likely that both 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.970
 teams are in brazil-2014 with the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.770
 panorama that arise in the closing of 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.810
 this tie but at this moment 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.330
 Colombia looks with a little more harmony 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.430
 in their ranks the clash is undoubtedly between 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.840
 two squads that know each other very well and 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.360
 that have a lot of quality both in the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920
 defensive line as in the offensive 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.350
 he expects a very equal game but of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.670
 much intensity in this case our 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.200
 recommendation to the bet is at least 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.380
 of two and a half goals in the match with 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.880
 an account of 1.67 or less 150 since 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.220
 I think it will be a pretty closed game 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.660
 and few goals thanks for joining me 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.250
