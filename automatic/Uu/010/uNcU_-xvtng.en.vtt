what's best for me

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.650 
what's best for me
if<00:00:37.129> he<00:00:37.850> was<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.000> head<00:00:38.120> coach<00:00:38.149> recruited<00:00:38.600> me

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
if he was the head coach recruited me

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.639 
if he was the head coach recruited me
and<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:38.840> wasn't<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.079> right<00:00:39.170> spot<00:00:39.410> for<00:00:39.559> me

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
and that wasn't the right spot for me

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:40.869 
and that wasn't the right spot for me
then<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.070> wouldn't<00:00:40.280> really<00:00:40.399> mean<00:00:40.579> anything<00:00:40.820> to

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
then it wouldn't really mean anything to

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.970 
then it wouldn't really mean anything to
me<00:00:41.030> but<00:00:41.719> um<00:00:41.870> just<00:00:42.559> just<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.770> fact<00:00:42.920> that

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
me but um just just the fact that

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.500
