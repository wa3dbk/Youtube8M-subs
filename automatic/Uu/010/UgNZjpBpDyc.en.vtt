00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Ron Johnson and this was another requirement that I would have at the start of the summer 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.570
 when this season December 4 better than expected very precisely 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.380
 really a top performance from what I hear and everything around it 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.759
 2 the ambiance 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.060
 but fetching i don't like draka have a tree today 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.440
 now in the way we put that right 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.919
 the most important thing is 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.449
 I think we are now absolutely safe as high as possible 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.089
 end 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.839
 and therefore also the occasional soccer team that you think so 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:30.669
 is it alone 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.469
 he finds that in the final pass 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.289
 yes we still had that, I will be more we have to do because now you are still 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.280
 depending on them from a missed penalty kick and 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 that actually had that it was not possible to include the municipality 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.280
 the beginning was fields of the camps zwolle 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.660
 although that was only one there is the tier of I have shorten anyway 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.600
 more dangerous 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.480
 especially because I think crazy kamohelo mokotjo what to think if I can 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.130
 all went well and only after fifteen minutes was it going and after the 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.800
 competition well under control 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 building the first team is more dangerous, she came to Ukraine four times 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.590
 and and the left came through the chairman and antonio what happens 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.850
 and then the spokeswoman 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.950
 good moment the shares 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.550
 whoever engaged the ball previously agreed that the book would be about 45 minutes 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.710
 play 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.030
 had already walked off the last few days says it will not come 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.900
 to have a bait I can do it because of this we have no 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.920
 problem with it 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.240
 and it is done anyway for it but then press the stick of stick anyway 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.410
 a quality 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.330
 nbsp see through as long as it has been waiting for it has the net 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.280
 moment of it 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.830
 of eternal fame and otherwise being exaggerated 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.950
 then you can see the first one right away and he played a lot more freedom 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.230
 and a lot better than the last few weeks 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.010
 for whom two Belgians live 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.660
 everything is under control and there the player has the English pounds 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.810
 ball comes a penalty kick with the referee first 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.840
 indicates nothing wrong and then gives the hope of giving advice 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.880
 of the council if you are a referee on the sidelines 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.530
 and the asphalt but then on that makes decisions only when it comes to the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.190
 penalty while that there is a tonio and a beautiful clear makes me pass 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.329
 so give at the start 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.279
 I also got the shocked see with Kevin Blom at another game that back 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.880
 on the fourth man makes the decision 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.650
 Referees could walk that kind of decision that you just have to make yourself 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.750
 take or be someone one hundred percent sure in that is a biblical thing 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.839
 certainly not just like that 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:33.519
 and now a striking animal is going to let that pass here but there is nothing 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.229
 say 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.309
 this has missed for the third set but if you look back at the games 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.389
 penalty that also has something 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.409
 after that it starts quite a bit busier 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:43.849
 huge mortar 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.360
 there were 2 0 by the third time I have to play 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.650
 I thought for a moment that we both scored and cheer when the man scored for the score 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.629
 but it was rightly rejected for offside 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.730
 after they are at work I enjoy my position that it does not see 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.730
 but i did find that anp 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.840
 I don't say it so often but I think Rutte Rutte regrets it 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.510
 in Groningen
