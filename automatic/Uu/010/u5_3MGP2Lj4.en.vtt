make<00:02:18.430> sure<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> select<00:02:18.940> save<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.600> animation

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.170 

you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.570 

so<00:02:29.720> now<00:02:29.870> we're<00:02:29.989> giving<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.290> few<00:02:30.439> more<00:02:30.620> options

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
so now we're giving a few more options

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.060 
so now we're giving a few more options
to<00:02:32.180> play<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:33.290> only<00:02:33.500> thing<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.770> really

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
to play the only thing I really

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.210 
to play the only thing I really
recommend<00:02:34.490> changing<00:02:34.850> here<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.390> delay

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
recommend changing here is the delay

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.620 
recommend changing here is the delay
whether<00:02:37.220> or<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.730> want<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.910> slow<00:02:38.180> or<00:02:38.360> fast

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
whether or not you want to slow or fast

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.080 
whether or not you want to slow or fast
image<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.140> entirely<00:02:39.500> up<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:39.980> I'm<00:02:40.220> choosing

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
image is entirely up to you I'm choosing

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.000 
image is entirely up to you I'm choosing
the<00:02:41.180> delay<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.570> 40<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.260> plays<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.710> about

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
the delay of 40 and that plays it about

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.490 
the delay of 40 and that plays it about
the<00:02:43.250> same<00:02:43.490> speed<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.180> video

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.900 

so<00:02:47.500> now<00:02:47.680> all<00:02:47.710> we<00:02:47.950> have<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.490> just<00:02:48.670> save

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
so now all we have to do is just save

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
so now all we have to do is just save
our<00:02:49.060> image<00:02:49.240> open<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.960> in<00:02:50.050> Firefox<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.710> we<00:02:50.830> can

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
our image open it in Firefox and we can

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.360 
our image open it in Firefox and we can
see<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.250> everything<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.790> plain<00:02:52.120> fine

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
see that everything is plain fine

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.910 
see that everything is plain fine
although<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:54.580> do<00:02:54.820> have<00:02:54.970> one<00:02:55.240> problem<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:56.050> we

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
although we do have one problem if we

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.530 
although we do have one problem if we
open<00:02:57.220> our<00:02:57.310> image<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.730> another<00:02:58.000> web<00:02:58.240> browser

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
open our image in another web browser

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.330 
open our image in another web browser
such<00:02:58.960> as<00:02:59.020> Internet<00:02:59.590> Explorer<00:03:00.040> or<00:03:00.250> Google

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
such as Internet Explorer or Google

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.670 
such as Internet Explorer or Google
Chrome<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.540> will<00:03:01.720> see<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.230> plain<00:03:02.530> our

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
Chrome we will see that is plain our

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.610 
Chrome we will see that is plain our
image<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.190> slow<00:03:03.520> motion<00:03:03.840> why<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.900> happens<00:03:05.470> is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
image in slow motion why this happens is

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.770 
image in slow motion why this happens is
because<00:03:05.650> Firefox<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> faster<00:03:07.300> web<00:03:07.510> browser

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
because Firefox is a faster web browser

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.170 
because Firefox is a faster web browser
and<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.590> process<00:03:08.830> frames<00:03:09.340> faster<00:03:09.700> than

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
and it can process frames faster than

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.170 
and it can process frames faster than
Internet<00:03:10.540> Explorer<00:03:10.990> or<00:03:11.170> Chrome<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.030> make

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
Internet Explorer or Chrome so to make

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.820 
Internet Explorer or Chrome so to make
sure<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> place<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:13.960> everyone<00:03:14.260> we're<00:03:14.620> going<00:03:14.740> to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
sure a place for everyone we're going to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.410 
sure a place for everyone we're going to
have<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.190> some<00:03:15.400> additional<00:03:15.820> editing

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.080 

open<00:03:19.380> up<00:03:19.470> GIMP<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:19.980> reopen<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.580> image<00:03:20.910> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
open up GIMP and reopen the image that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.589 
open up GIMP and reopen the image that
you<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.420> made

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.440 

now<00:03:29.530> go<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.980> video<00:03:30.219> tab<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.790> select<00:03:31.269> split

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
now go to the video tab and select split

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:39.150 
now go to the video tab and select split
image<00:03:31.989> two<00:03:32.260> frames

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.870 

you

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.430 

after<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:44.940> gets<00:03:45.030> them<00:03:45.270> processing<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.989> new<00:03:46.170> page

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
after it gets them processing a new page

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.040 
after it gets them processing a new page
to<00:03:46.470> pop<00:03:46.830> up<00:03:47.040> just<00:03:47.250> ex<00:03:47.970> both<00:03:48.239> your<00:03:48.450> projects<00:03:48.870> out

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
to pop up just ex both your projects out

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.340 
to pop up just ex both your projects out
and<00:03:49.290> go<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.620> your<00:03:49.830> my<00:03:49.980> pictures<00:03:50.430> folder

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.510 

all<00:03:55.770> these<00:03:56.100> files<00:03:56.340> are<00:03:56.610> pretty

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
all these files are pretty

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.300 
all these files are pretty
split<00:03:57.880> up<00:03:57.910> frame<00:03:58.330> by<00:03:58.510> frame<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:59.080> because<00:03:59.860> I<00:03:59.890> in

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
split up frame by frame and because I in

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.950 
split up frame by frame and because I in
Chrome<00:04:00.670> can't<00:04:00.940> play<00:04:01.120> these<00:04:01.300> frames<00:04:01.630> fast

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
Chrome can't play these frames fast

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.300 
Chrome can't play these frames fast
enough<00:04:02.290> we're<00:04:02.620> going<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:02.800> have<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.010> delete

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
enough we're going to have to delete

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.790 
enough we're going to have to delete
some

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.820 

so<00:04:06.790> click<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.210> a<00:04:07.270> frame<00:04:07.570> press<00:04:08.230> Delete<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.740> your

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
so click on a frame press Delete on your

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.500 
so click on a frame press Delete on your
keyboard<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.520> then<00:04:09.820> press<00:04:09.850> Enter

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
keyboard and then press Enter

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.390 
keyboard and then press Enter
then<00:04:10.870> go<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.290> next<00:04:11.440> frame<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.010> do<00:04:12.280> it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
then go to the next frame and do it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400 
then go to the next frame and do it
again<00:04:12.640> what<00:04:13.300> we're<00:04:13.450> pretty<00:04:13.630> much<00:04:13.810> doing<00:04:14.260> is

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
again what we're pretty much doing is

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.490 
again what we're pretty much doing is
we're<00:04:14.590> deleting<00:04:14.860> every<00:04:15.370> other<00:04:15.460> frame<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.500> yes

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
we're deleting every other frame and yes

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.470 
we're deleting every other frame and yes
you<00:04:17.860> are<00:04:18.040> going<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.430> have<00:04:18.520> to<00:04:18.610> do<00:04:18.760> this<00:04:18.910> for<00:04:19.239> all

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
you are going to have to do this for all

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.230 
you are going to have to do this for all
of<00:04:19.690> your<00:04:19.810> frames<00:04:20.310> trust<00:04:21.310> me<00:04:21.520> it's<00:04:21.820> going<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.180> be

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
of your frames trust me it's going to be

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.909 
of your frames trust me it's going to be
very<00:04:22.540> tedious

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.470 

after<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:27.010> get<00:04:27.190> through<00:04:27.340> go<00:04:27.790> back<00:04:27.970> into<00:04:28.210> GIMP

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
after you get through go back into GIMP

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.750 
after you get through go back into GIMP
then<00:04:28.930> go<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.169> file<00:04:29.560> open<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.280> layers<00:04:30.490> and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
then go to file open the layers and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.180 
then go to file open the layers and
select<00:04:31.389> all<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.750> frames

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:52.540 

you

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.879 

once<00:04:53.479> it<00:04:53.629> imports<00:04:53.960> our<00:04:54.080> frames<00:04:54.349> just<00:04:54.650> go<00:04:54.830> to

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
once it imports our frames just go to

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.100 
once it imports our frames just go to
file<00:04:55.250> save<00:04:55.759> as<00:04:55.819> and<00:04:56.270> just<00:04:56.599> like<00:04:56.750> last<00:04:56.960> time

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
file save as and just like last time
