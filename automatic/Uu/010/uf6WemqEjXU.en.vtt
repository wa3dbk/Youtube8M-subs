00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi everyone this is android insider dot ru 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.040
 with you natasha and today in our hands 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.050
 pairs of iPhones new generation 6 and 6 plus 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.269
 we will continue to study them in the meantime let's 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 compare the dimensions of the new apple blades 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:27.960
 with the blades correct on the android so 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 take the iphone to start with just a six 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.149
 and add to it in a couple let's say 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.000
 nexus 5 as a reference while the gadget 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.430
 Up to the diagonal of the display in 4 7 and 5 inches 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 accordingly, there is a difference but not so 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 already significant as well as the framework above and below 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.480
 iphone display and some more so 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.879
 that could even be in these dimensions 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 display do more okay 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.160
 winners in this video we care 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.379
 we will not define at least ok iphone 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.449
 more interesting so what if we replace 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.940
 nexus for one and a half years now sony 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 xperia z elta it is clearly in size 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.280
 wins 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920
 despite so the skin is five inch 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 display like a nexus and yes it is somewhat 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 thicker than iphone 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.229
 but the general position is in his palm 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.570
 better case quality true in this 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.030
 sonic models pumped up this is not glass and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 metal which product is from cupertino but he 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.689
 compact with a larger diagonal 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.150
 sorry sony just doing such 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 devices have long been a z3 compact before us 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.270
 not yet got 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.299
 There was a lot of our android collection and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.579
 1 lumia 930 may stay with us 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.590
 will take part in the comparison of the length it is 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.049
 same as the younger iphone 6 but noticeably 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 thicker blame induction charging and 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.229
 wider 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.259
 but again 5 inches versus almost 5 and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.240
 perhaps only the thickness but thoroughly and 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.670
 conspicuous and spoils everything 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.450
 impression of the finnish vidos background and myself 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.640
 windows phone but as though she is very 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.890
 It looks like comrades became android with the same 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.290
 htc one screen diagonal 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.969
 yes he is quite old but in size and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.579
 screen diagonal it is practically 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.200
 identical to your iphone iphone yet 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.020
 thinner but by the remaining parameters 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.299
 looks like a player more than ours 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.039
 employees sometimes confuse the six and one 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.489
 when almost look Bruce smartphone with 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.430
 of the table 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.630
 and this also means something more 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.580
 compare with sixes 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.620
 nothing else flagships and I will 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.650
 android is slightly larger than this diagonal 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.720
 And in terms of size or not, now we take 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.760
 hands five and a half inches and a spatula 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.770
 from apple and compare it with several 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 other android devices 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.020
 first we take lg g3 screen 5 integers 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.100
 forty six inches are just asking for 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.740
 similar comparison 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.540
 and with success it wins the dimensions 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.450
 Korean flagship noticeably smaller 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.880
 than u from us and length and width 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.630
 noticeably less despite the original 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.390
 Screen size 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.580
 Yes, and the battery in the Koreans more but it 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 another topic leave until 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.280
 this moment since we are talking about 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.200
 dimensions 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.180
 Well, push and clubs in direct 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.410
 comparisons too plan watch for 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.200
 channel updates 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.300
 next we take a couple more mid-size 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.270
 flagships sony xperia z2 and 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.340
 htc one m8 despite the five diagonals 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.830
 with a little and just 5 inches these 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.030
 devices look somewhat 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.070
 exaggerated it is that they are only 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.900
 somewhat less than six plus it 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.540
 rather, it is the lack of devices on 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.150
 os base from google rather than lack 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.110
 blades of Cupertino and the thinner guests 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.270
 states it is yes 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.640
 Alas, some manufacturers for the sake of 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.980
 the thickness is smeared components by 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.590
 motherboard and this leads so 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.690
 here is the result but finally we take 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.390
 such a device as nutria from samsung 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.910
 until we got to the laptop age and 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.460
 or four but the troika will fit to 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.620
 act more honest we also cover it 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.870
 supplemented in fact the owner is not 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.520
 found the back cover from the kit for it 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.459
 kill punished all good 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.070
 wait for the fours and compare but suppose 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.400
 that he, too, will win and so drumming 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.040
 fraction 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.050
 alas and oh well cooper teens cue comrade 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.870
 exceeds the size of the noticeable 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.690
 samsung narrow shovels with screen as much as 5 7 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.030
 inches remove cover to see 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.340
 accurate width and length readings like this 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.890
 it looks what samsung is good not 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.020
 argue if often we ourselves were 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.150
 overly curious about all these dimensions 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.590
 compare nor was the camp of the apple 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.840
 such a massive change 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.799
 dimensions almost never if our 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.380
 love 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.810
 good good if an interesting company 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.760
 apple will reduce the scope to think about 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.970
 protrusive cameras which we are so tactful 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.550
 bypassed but could not mention from them 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.949
 we believe everything will turn out show shovel 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.650
 construction there is one leader okay 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.370
 23 in general there are a lot of leaders but they are all 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.650
 not on ios is our view as well on 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.780
 we all continue to study and 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.669
 new generation donuts will be shared 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.160
 impressions as they say along the way 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.720
 plays it was android n cider dot ru 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.950
 natasha follow us on social 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.950
 networks bye
