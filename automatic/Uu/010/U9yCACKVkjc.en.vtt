00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
one isn't gonna be as easy of a battle

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.840 
one isn't gonna be as easy of a battle
as<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.989> first<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.440> was<00:02:34.620> against<00:02:34.890> Sydney<00:02:35.130> but

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
as the first one was against Sydney but

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.069 
as the first one was against Sydney but
I<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:36.150> we'll<00:02:36.299> still<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.630> able<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.049> a

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
I think we'll still be able to do a

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.099 
I think we'll still be able to do a
little<00:02:37.260> something<00:02:37.500> Sableye<00:02:38.340> huh<00:02:39.269> no<00:02:39.780> I'm

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
little something Sableye huh no I'm

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.509 
little something Sableye huh no I'm
gonna<00:02:40.380> keep<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.709> out<00:02:40.829> I'm<00:02:41.010> gonna<00:02:41.160> keep<00:02:41.280> drag

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
gonna keep it out I'm gonna keep drag

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.430 
gonna keep it out I'm gonna keep drag
around<00:02:41.670> until<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.060> end<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.299> this<00:02:42.359> fight<00:02:42.630> just

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
around until the end of this fight just

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.319 
around until the end of this fight just
to<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.709> how<00:02:43.799> far<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.069> can<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.730> think<00:02:45.180> this

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
to see how far we can get I think this

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.300 
to see how far we can get I think this
is<00:02:45.450> probably<00:02:45.900> our<00:02:46.200> best<00:02:46.440> call<00:02:46.799> just<00:02:47.040> cuz<00:02:47.160> we

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
is probably our best call just cuz we

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.390 
is probably our best call just cuz we
have<00:02:47.430> bite<00:02:48.079> but<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.170> fact<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:49.829> do<00:02:50.280> have

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
have bite but the fact is we do have

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.340 
have bite but the fact is we do have
other<00:02:50.549> Pokemon<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:51.660> also<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.170> know

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
other Pokemon that can also you know

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.020 
other Pokemon that can also you know
pack<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> punch<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.190> do<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> lot<00:02:53.609> of<00:02:53.639> damage<00:02:53.850> I'm

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
pack a punch and do a lot of damage I'm

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.940 
pack a punch and do a lot of damage I'm
actually<00:02:54.150> surprised<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.810> dragger<00:02:55.739> didn't

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
actually surprised that dragger didn't

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.170 
actually surprised that dragger didn't
get<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.160> first<00:02:56.370> move<00:02:56.549> there<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.910> was<00:02:57.150> a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
get the first move there that was a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.770 
get the first move there that was a
little<00:02:57.420> weird

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
little weird

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.680 
little weird
wow<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.680> aren't<00:02:58.889> doing<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.340> much<00:02:59.609> I<00:02:59.940> expected

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
wow we aren't doing that much I expected

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.270 
wow we aren't doing that much I expected
us<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.840> do<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.079> little<00:03:01.290> more<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.709> these<00:03:01.799> Pokemon

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
us to do a little more to these Pokemon

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.640 
us to do a little more to these Pokemon
but<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.209> looks<00:03:03.359> like<00:03:03.480> our<00:03:03.630> bite<00:03:03.840> isn't<00:03:04.530> as

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
but it looks like our bite isn't as

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.770 
but it looks like our bite isn't as
effective<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.850> would<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.359> be<00:03:06.569> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
effective as I would like it to be and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.110 
effective as I would like it to be and
you<00:03:07.560> know<00:03:07.680> what<00:03:07.859> I<00:03:08.130> think<00:03:08.579> I'm<00:03:08.670> gonna<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.910> for<00:03:09.060> a

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
you know what I think I'm gonna go for a

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.990 
you know what I think I'm gonna go for a
thunder<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.660> don't<00:03:10.260> want<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:11.280> actually<00:03:11.760> get

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
Phoebe to use her her potion right now

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.800
