00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:13.410
 denis on a button but it's to avoid 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 the pew is really the kind lepers the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.350
 mob the simplest of the game what 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 normally it's really the thing 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.270
 more known then some our little 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.780
 pioule here and that we will avoid 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:32.450
 marie goes his case that in fact and the me it 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.140
 would be cool that you just not back who 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.220
 strikes at CAC 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.220
 because otherwise he'll go to you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.610
 it will fuck you mouth in fact if not 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.070
 he's going but that's otherwise he'll make you 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.570
 really very very very very very badly and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.540
 me too will hurt me very much in 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.100
 do we just need to prevent it from happening 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.660
 that he arrives at the package and as it is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.629
 me who have the initiative in addition so me 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.780
 I can go back there it 'll be beautiful 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.510
 tweeted people made people come on 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.410
 the live because that's going to be beautiful there 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.830
 it's going to be really very beautiful then 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:15.369
 we go back if I want to play that well 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:19.060
 would not it be ok no it's ok 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.660
 can play what would be cool 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.610
 so little five family roulette 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.740
 years of retirees adacore unnecessary what 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.440
 would be cool is that the cra will have this 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.450
 would be so good if we put the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.820
 little chance dko 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.830
 we have but like that next turn we get 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.440
 fact thrash like pigs the cra 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:48.130
 boosts the pew the cra boosts the pew the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.200
 iop me up and boost the quiou me quickly to 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:57.539
 pitcher 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.539
 gg tell him brock vita 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:07.410
 just that if he gets to do that this 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.410
 would be magic here you go 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.190
 and after that you would have to come to 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:18.360
 to flee in fact sir criticism is a pity 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:25.390
 damage yes no magical magic magic where 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:29.200

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:41.440
 to follow you to win and suddenly that 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.300
 it boosts the pew or not that boosts 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.920
 not there is that tastes that of cra in 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.930
 fact that boosts the enemies these two 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:58.450

 feet at level 1 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.250
 no no do not worry act say 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.500
 it's not that the goal is not that you're going 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.750
 see you go see you go see you go 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.529
 understand right away 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:58.250
 the goal is no goal and piou le 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:01.449
 goal it's going to be it was going I tanks but 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.449
 me mass of shields 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.220
 I have how many shields the 1918 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.479
 I will actually have in the end I would have less 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.149
 de vita that just now to 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.599
 sailing at 1600 559 it's not bad it's not 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:33.449
 bad at all the little go little tea 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:36.899
 coffee - a nice dumpling 5 epo but 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.189
 it's useless to small gap so what 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.139
 how much will it hit me but I believe 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:45.930
 that in fact we will not succeed in doing the 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:50.969
 first the first rocks at 12000 we do not 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:53.099
 will not arrive ok I said nothing 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:56.460
 still quite violent kill like 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:58.439
 quite violent but actually in the end it 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.240
 ask no we do not have a twitter 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:02.819
 increase since in fact in the end we 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.860
 decide to us we love 13000 we have thirteen 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:07.439
 mile to nahd to 13th damage and six 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.899
 month no in the end we did not increase 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:11.399
 the damage of the term in nine or because 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:15.349
 we are already at 12300 some we have 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:15.349
 increased by 700 so it's not bad
