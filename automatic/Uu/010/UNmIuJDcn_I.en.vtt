horseshoe crabs been swimming the oceans

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.260 
horseshoe crabs been swimming the oceans
for<00:00:03.810> 300<00:00:04.440> million<00:00:04.740> years<00:00:05.130> even<00:00:06.060> before

for 300 million years even before

for 300 million years even before
dinosaurs<00:00:06.839> evolved<00:00:07.910> more<00:00:08.910> closely<00:00:09.240> related

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
dinosaurs evolved more closely related

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.410 
dinosaurs evolved more closely related
to<00:00:09.929> spiders<00:00:10.530> than<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.950> true<00:00:11.190> crabs<00:00:11.580> they

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
to spiders than to true crabs they

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.530 
to spiders than to true crabs they
aren't<00:00:12.719> fished<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.200> food<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> West<00:00:14.540> but

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
aren't fished for food in the West but

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.960 
aren't fished for food in the West but
fishermen<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.320> use<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.800> crabs<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.400> bait<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
fishermen do use the crabs for bait and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.060 
fishermen do use the crabs for bait and
so<00:00:18.510> their<00:00:18.660> numbers<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.140> declined<00:00:19.619> steeply

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
so their numbers have declined steeply

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.730 
so their numbers have declined steeply
in<00:00:20.490> recent<00:00:20.939> years<00:00:21.000> especially<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.710> of

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
in recent years especially because of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.099 
in recent years especially because of
conch<00:00:23.100> fishing<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.449> eat<00:00:24.689> horseshoe

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
conch fishing do they eat horseshoe

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290

before<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.090> flipped<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.480> over

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
before if you just flipped them over

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.279 
before if you just flipped them over
they<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.590> back<00:00:55.949> into<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> water<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
they go back into the water and if you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
they go back into the water and if you
don't<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.399> predated<00:00:59.850> upon<00:01:00.120> by<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
don't then they get predated upon by the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
pincers that are not like boxing gloves

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.999 
pincers that are not like boxing gloves
and<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.600> can<00:01:20.719> also<00:01:20.869> see<00:01:21.020> by<00:01:21.289> how<00:01:21.409> she's<00:01:21.649> moving

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and you can also see by how she's moving

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.639 
and you can also see by how she's moving
that<00:01:22.189> she's<00:01:22.609> perfectly<00:01:23.000> healthy<00:01:23.350> but<00:01:24.350> she<00:01:24.530> was

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
stranded so she was going to sit there

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.910 
stranded so she was going to sit there
and<00:01:26.210> slowly<00:01:26.630> bake<00:01:26.929> in<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.170> Sun<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.530> die<00:01:27.710> today

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
and slowly bake in the Sun and die today

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.039 
and slowly bake in the Sun and die today
and<00:01:28.549> there's<00:01:29.329> nothing<00:01:29.569> wrong<00:01:29.719> with<00:01:29.780> her<00:01:30.340> so

and there's nothing wrong with her so
simple<00:01:33.049> matter<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.350> just<00:01:34.329> turning<00:01:35.329> her<00:01:35.509> upside

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
simple matter of just turning her upside

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.480 
simple matter of just turning her upside
down<00:01:36.459> she's<00:01:37.459> going<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.619> go<00:01:39.619> into<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.039> water<00:01:40.189> on

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
down she's going to go into the water on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.149 
down she's going to go into the water on
her<00:01:40.609> own<00:01:40.759> now<00:01:41.380> there's<00:01:42.380> two<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:42.799> came<00:01:42.950> in

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
her own now there's two that came in

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.499 
her own now there's two that came in
early<00:01:43.459> and<00:01:43.520> they're<00:01:43.670> spawning<00:01:44.000> right<00:01:44.329> now

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
early and they're spawning right now

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.749 
early and they're spawning right now
that's<00:01:45.409> a<00:01:45.560> female<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.189> that's<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.549> mail

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
that's a female and that's the mail

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.050 
that's a female and that's the mail
every<00:01:47.299> spring<00:01:48.140> female<00:01:48.770> horseshoe<00:01:49.250> crab<00:01:49.579> swim

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
every spring female horseshoe crab swim

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.539 
every spring female horseshoe crab swim
to<00:01:50.299> shore<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.869> lay<00:01:51.079> their<00:01:51.319> eggs<00:01:51.560> which<00:01:52.429> are

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
to shore to lay their eggs which are

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.149 
to shore to lay their eggs which are
then<00:01:52.729> fertilized<00:01:53.329> by<00:01:53.509> mail<00:01:53.869> crabs<00:01:54.259> who<00:01:54.950> ride

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
then fertilized by mail crabs who ride

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.999 
then fertilized by mail crabs who ride
on<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.489> back<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.060> females<00:01:56.479> shells<00:01:57.009> this

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
on the back of the females shells this

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.130 
on the back of the females shells this
is<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.159> perfect<00:01:58.670> day<00:01:58.849> for<00:01:58.879> spawning<00:01:59.599> because

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
is a perfect day for spawning because

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.160 
is a perfect day for spawning because
it's<00:02:00.619> very<00:02:01.069> low-energy<00:02:01.610> surf<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.629> likelihood

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's very low-energy surf the likelihood

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.109 
it's very low-energy surf the likelihood
of<00:02:03.200> getting<00:02:03.379> flipped<00:02:03.799> over<00:02:04.009> is<00:02:04.340> very<00:02:04.610> minimal

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
of getting flipped over is very minimal

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.760 
of getting flipped over is very minimal
they<00:02:05.509> can<00:02:05.629> come<00:02:05.810> up<00:02:05.989> on<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.259> beach<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:06.649> do

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
they can come up on the beach and do

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.339 
they can come up on the beach and do
their<00:02:06.950> thing<00:02:07.299> but<00:02:08.299> there<00:02:08.569> are<00:02:08.899> nights<00:02:09.229> when

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
their thing but there are nights when
