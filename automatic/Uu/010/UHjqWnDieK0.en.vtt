me<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.730> multicopter<00:00:18.660> training<00:00:22.070> but<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
me on this multicopter training but it

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.349 
me on this multicopter training but it
was<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> training<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.070> fun<00:00:26.310> fun<00:00:26.910> factor

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
was a training but the fun fun factor

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.609 
was a training but the fun fun factor
was<00:00:27.650> in<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:29.010> place<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.619> built

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
was in the first place so we just built

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.670 
was in the first place so we just built
a<00:00:31.769> few<00:00:31.980> gates<00:00:32.309> here<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:34.290> these

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
a few gates here and actually these

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.360 
a few gates here and actually these
those<00:00:35.070> gates<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:36.020> way<00:00:37.020> too<00:00:37.079> small<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
those gates are way too small for the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
those gates are way too small for the
aerial<00:00:38.969> Grand<00:00:39.360> Prix<00:00:40.129> we<00:00:41.129> had<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:42.559> one<00:00:43.559> or

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
aerial Grand Prix we had around one or

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.360 
aerial Grand Prix we had around one or
one<00:00:44.040> half<00:00:44.340> meter<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.420> span<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.590> real<00:00:46.950> arel

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
one half meter in span and the real arel

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.439 
one half meter in span and the real arel
GPU<00:00:47.850> gates<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.360> three<00:00:48.719> meters<00:00:49.730> but<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.300> was

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
GPU gates out three meters but it was

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.770 
GPU gates out three meters but it was
fun<00:00:51.660> anyways<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.820> took<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.300> branches

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
fun anyways we just took some branches

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.100 
fun anyways we just took some branches
and<00:00:55.340> made<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.550> flags<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.100 

usually<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.559> had<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> more<00:01:05.610> complex<00:01:06.030> course<00:01:06.450> but

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
usually I had a more complex course but

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.429 
usually I had a more complex course but
then<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.010> an<00:01:08.220> easier<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.960> just<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.110> oval

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
then it was an easier one just an oval

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
then it was an easier one just an oval
course<00:01:11.540> or<00:01:12.540> some<00:01:13.409> flags<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.890> cake<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.400> it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
course or some flags and cake and it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.280 
course or some flags and cake and it's
awesome<00:01:15.240> how<00:01:15.600> fast<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:17.420> errand<00:01:18.420> high

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
awesome how fast they look errand high

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.410 
awesome how fast they look errand high
grass<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.950> cool<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> crashing<00:01:20.909> it

we also had some normal ppl here some
non<00:01:29.520> mu<00:01:30.590> co-pilots<00:01:32.750> disturb<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.930> our<00:01:34.049> training

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
non mu co-pilots disturb to our training

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.490 
non mu co-pilots disturb to our training
RC<00:01:36.210> foxy<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.340> most<00:01:38.520> fun<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.200> when<00:01:40.200> we

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
RC foxy and the most fun was it when we

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
RC foxy and the most fun was it when we
managed<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.700> fly<00:01:42.350> all<00:01:43.350> together<00:01:44.090> but<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
managed to fly all together but it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.609 
managed to fly all together but it
wasn't<00:01:45.750> always<00:01:45.869> easy

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.340 

hahahaha<00:01:55.969> thing<00:01:56.969> about<00:01:57.119> me<00:01:57.359> whenever<00:01:57.899> yellow

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
hahahaha thing about me whenever yellow

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.990 

the<00:02:11.990> flying<00:02:12.440> time<00:02:12.680> where<00:02:12.950> all<00:02:13.100> four<00:02:13.370> were<00:02:13.790> in

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the flying time where all four were in

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.230 
the flying time where all four were in
the<00:02:14.120> year<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.690> very<00:02:14.840> short<00:02:15.410> because<00:02:15.940> every<00:02:16.940> now

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
the year is very short because every now

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:51.930 
the year is very short because every now
and<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:17.569> one<00:02:17.780> one<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.290> them<00:02:18.440> crashed

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.530 

and<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.230> crush<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:54.010> mine<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.640> really<00:02:55.060> thought

and this crush of mine I really thought
of<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:56.020> mobis<00:02:57.000> would<00:02:58.000> have<00:02:58.120> been<00:02:58.360> lost<00:02:58.570> and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
of the mobis would have been lost and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.350 
of the mobis would have been lost and
asked<00:02:59.560> my<00:02:59.860> friend<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.220> check<00:03:00.550> if<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.880> Mobius<00:03:01.240> is

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
asked my friend to check if a Mobius is

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:23.120 
asked my friend to check if a Mobius is
still<00:03:01.600> on<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.590> as<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:02.890> was<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:05.050> I<00:03:05.080> kept<00:03:05.860> flying

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.870 

this<00:03:24.130> was<00:03:24.400> maybe<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:25.150> closest<00:03:25.960> flyby<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.730> we

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
this was maybe the closest flyby and we

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.660 
this was maybe the closest flyby and we
lucky<00:03:28.060> had<00:03:28.390> no<00:03:28.630> air<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.050> air<00:03:29.110> crash
