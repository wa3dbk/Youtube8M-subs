 stromae talks about his favorites 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.039

 game show third time strong of 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.579
 the videogame year after e3 shows 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.290
 gamescom de los angeles and cologne 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.000
 the Japanese capital has thus welcomed 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.559
 number of publishers and builders 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.690
 for four days and seven editions 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.760
 2013 saw several trends 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.829
 very different and sometimes surprising 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.480
 after the united states and germany the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.309
 great duel between sony and microsoft 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.530
 moved to Japan since the two giants 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.300
 of video game on consoles have each put 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.190
 featuring their new machines the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.840
 playstation 4 and the xbox one by the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.610
 through massive booths offering to 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.890
 visitors number of positions on which 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.600
 try their flagship titles 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.920
 for the most part already known is planned 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 at the launch of both consoles 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.460
 among the most noticed games we 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.680
 note the unexpected presence of deep 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.570
 down at sony the capcom title 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.280
 announced at the same time as the playstation 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.110
 4 this is so unveiled for the whole 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 first time and made a sensation thanks 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.610
 to his impressive realization of his 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.590
 microsoft side came up with a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.810
 many games whose star was 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.729
 unquestionably tighten crazy title 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.560
 multiplayer opposing elite soldiers and 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.750
 giant robots during tumultuous 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.170
 battle of up to 64 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.390
 players 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 a big Western production among 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.930
 many others on a show but tends 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.060
 usually worth the novelties 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.470
 Japanese and this was clearly the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.119
 the most marked tendency of this 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.220
 edition since several rolls 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.659
 compressors from the west had the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.980
 dedicated booth honors like 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.700
 battlefield 4 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.660
 duthie ghost gta 5 or even fifa 14 a 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.460
 Western presence 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.050
 surprisingly visible but which testifies 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.030
 of untouched interest from major studios 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.160
 and publishers from the west for this show 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.480
 Yet they said in perdition 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.010
 sting making 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.420
 it is important for us to exchange 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.680
 share our knowledge with others 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.060
 cultures to learn how they 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.900
 design their game to understand their 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.460
 work methods 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.380
 it's like when you go into a 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.550
 music festival or listened to sounds 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.990
 different and see things 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.100
 different 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.300
 to share is the most 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.820
 important for a developer who comes 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.140
 here but we reassure the production 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.910
 did not leave 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.290
 his lands the games developed on 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.790
 the archipelago is presented on the show 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.530
 were numerous but for the most part 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.850
 more modest is essentially 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.920
 turned to the Japanese market 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.230
 we think in particular games derived from 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.540
 animated series like j star victory 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.280
 versus fighting game in arena gathering 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.320
 some of the most famous heroes of 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.930
 action manga like luffy sangoku 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.550
 ichigo or even naruto finally the palm 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.710
 of the most Japanese production 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.600
 amazing going to bremen who this game on 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.590
 table is accompanied by a captive captive 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.720
 our brain waves 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.910
 the goal to focus for example 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.770
 twist little spoons by the only 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.480
 strength of our fun mind but 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.890
 difficult to know if our brain that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.450
 is really for something 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.010
 we will also note once again 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.330
 the omnipresence of the game on smartphone and 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.980
 tablet with a number of titles 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.360
 ever more impressive year in 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.920
 same year of big publishers 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.930
 traditionally game-oriented 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.670
 on console like capcom or sega have 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.810
 mainly focused on this 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.880
 of their catalog 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.070
 in short the video game and the Japanese market 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.630
 have not finished evolving for the 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.959
 better or worse the future we 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.959
 will tell 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.500
 this week we met 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.180
 stromae musicians and singers at the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.489
 cross of electro and rap 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.810
 so what are you playing stromae the new 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.450
 gta that happens anyway i admit that 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.650
 I would like to play but shame on 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.790
 me because I'm not a real geek 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.799
 the real geeks who go to the end of the game 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.700
 me when I was at I do all the 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.110
 codes and I smash everything but hey game he 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.849
 there are games but it's old games 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.200
 also mirror's edge that I had a lot 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.849
 loved but i admit i'm a little bit hard 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.349
 me with the graphics I did my 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.700
 little brother introduces me the games and he 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.980
 must have graphics and where can I 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.269
 look at the hair yeah but I tell myself 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.709
 every time but yeah but I 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.150
 the impression that there is no huge 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.099
 revolution that's what they had 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.810
 still the mario but there was not 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.910
 badly where I was good or zelda too but 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.220
 there I followed it was on nintendo 8 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.209
 bits and I was following since we were in 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.289
 general it's like that in families 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.789
 had the big brother who was playing the 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.930
 two small ones that like I have 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.130
 do this you have to do that you have 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.360
 the impression of playing I am 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.979
 completely entuber by his big brother 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.979
 that monopolizes the joystick 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.910
 originally released on nintendo gamecube 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.470
 the legend of the zelda the wind waker party 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.840
 in this return the object of a reprint 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.670
 refreshed a redesign 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.650
 total graphic that does honor to this 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.300
 title decried at its release there is more than 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.280
 ten years for his pretty cartoon style 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.020
 confusing for a brighter zelda 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.610
 is definitely finer than at the time I 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.140
 you are nauseating hd is the fruit of a 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.660
 graphic restoration work 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.490
 particularly neat on the other hand 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.500
 can not say as much about content 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.760
 if we like the use of the game pad 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.470
 wii or and its touch screen 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.570
 now hosting the inventory 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.280
 cards and options one stays on his 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.050
 hungry question novelties the game being 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.830
 more or less unchanged from the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.330
 gamecube version 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.860
 Nevertheless, this is a question of 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.150
 welcome reissue for those 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.470
 who would not have had the opportunity to 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.300
 take the sea on gamecube 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.390
 it's not she who goes to sea 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.920
 sea ​​that takes left reaches after 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.510
 years to undergo the dominance of his 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.040
 direct competitor ps tries a 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.880
 rebirth by completely revising 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.320
 all its bases 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.270
 animated by a new graphic engine 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.340
 also used on the next metal 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.140
 gear ds 2014 is immediately apparent 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.090
 definitely more pleasant to watch but 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.040
 also to play players and stadiums 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.000
 have indeed gained in detail as well as in 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.470
 credibility 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.910
 the sound effects are more immersive and the 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.680
 rhythm of the parties is slower for 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.180
 promote collective play 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.980
 teammates are much more 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.020
 available than before what makes them 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.100
 more realistic parts then specifying 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.050
 that the fans of the series will be able 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.670
 manually control the pulling passes 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.150
 even moving each member of 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.560
 team 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.750
 it remains an experience 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.100
 complementary to fifa 14 failing the 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.020
 dethrone as we will see the 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.000
 next week with our review of 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.800
 these and that's closing this issue 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.180
 of video games on this toy 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.780
 well we give ourselves appointment the week 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.250
 next 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.720
 and by then do not forget that you 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.190
 can find all our tests of the games 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.930
 this week on our site 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.930
 downright video games could do 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.199
 he
