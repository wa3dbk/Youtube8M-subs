00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.330
 conversation 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.150
 now I'm going to do the blue nail I'll get it 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.700
 the green enamel and make as if it were 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.340
 a French girl passing a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.409
 green there at the tip of the nail is well and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 now I come with the conflicts we had 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.270
 with the tail right 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.340
 golden and I put a little extra 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.659
 shine on the back of the hand 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 I'll pick up my father, and I'll beat you. 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.729
 extra gloss and sticking to the nail 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.579
 I do not have much technique these things 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.850
 so I do it anyway and I put it like this 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.850
 between blue and green across the line 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.550
 also on the other finger that had 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.160
 painted blue and now I'm going to do the fingernail 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.310
 yellow flag of Brazil 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.830
 Like I did on the other hand so I get the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.400
 green glaze and then released from 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.400
 flag 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 I'm going to trace it just like green, right? 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.050
 leaving yellow lozenge 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.520
 My son was not very perfect, huh? 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.850
 and with the blue enamel I make the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.370
 ball in the middle of the flag passed 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.370
 extra gloss over to set everything 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:47.070
 that we did and that you stayed like this I hope 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.080
