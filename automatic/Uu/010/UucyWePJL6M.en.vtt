00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
all the edges are even by just going

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.740 
all the edges are even by just going
like<00:04:13.850> this<00:04:14.240> like<00:04:15.050> so<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:16.250> now<00:04:16.489> you're<00:04:16.910> going<00:04:17.209> to

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
shorten this front section like that is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.060 
shorten this front section like that is
it<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.670> going<00:04:31.910> off<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.360> side<00:04:32.390> because<00:04:33.320> if

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
it is going off to the side because if

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.560 
it is going off to the side because if
you<00:04:34.220> do<00:04:34.370> have<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:34.580> longer<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:35.150> going<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.450> do

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
that it's going to fold under the rest

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.170 
that it's going to fold under the rest
of<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.480> hair<00:04:38.690> so<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.650> want<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.450> make<00:04:41.450> sure

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
and this first layer does um can be a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.380 
and this first layer does um can be a
little<00:04:49.010> bit<00:04:49.160> shorter<00:04:49.520> than<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.880> other<00:04:50.090> layer

little bit shorter than the other layer
and<00:04:50.780> this<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.170> layer<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:52.010> is<00:04:52.430> for<00:04:53.150> just

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and this is the layer that is for just

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.080 
and this is the layer that is for just
in<00:04:53.690> case<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:54.050> mess<00:04:54.200> up<00:04:54.260> and<00:04:54.790> so<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.910> next

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
in case you mess up and so the next

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.520 
in case you mess up and so the next
layer<00:04:56.390> you're<00:04:56.630> going<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.840> bring<00:04:57.020> down<00:04:57.050> and

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
layer you're going to bring down and

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.140 
layer you're going to bring down and
this<00:04:57.620> layer<00:04:57.800> is<00:04:57.920> going<00:04:58.010> to<00:04:58.070> be<00:04:58.220> longer<00:04:58.580> than

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
this layer is going to be longer than

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.140 
this layer is going to be longer than
the<00:04:59.420> other<00:04:59.450> layer<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:01.370> you're<00:05:01.550> going<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.940> brush

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
the other layer so you're going to brush

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.810 
the other layer so you're going to brush
it<00:05:02.210> into<00:05:02.890> this<00:05:03.890> hair<00:05:04.790> right<00:05:05.060> here<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:07.490> you're

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
it into this hair right here and you're

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:20.679 
it into this hair right here and you're
going<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:10.450> angle<00:05:11.650> downwards

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.129 

and<00:05:20.919> that<00:05:21.919> is<00:05:22.249> basically<00:05:22.819> how<00:05:23.239> I<00:05:23.689> trim<00:05:23.989> my

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
and that is basically how I trim my

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.649 
and that is basically how I trim my
bangs<00:05:24.319> so<00:05:24.860> after<00:05:25.759> you're<00:05:25.909> done<00:05:25.939> what<00:05:26.629> I

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
bangs so after you're done what I

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.749 
bangs so after you're done what I
usually<00:05:26.929> do<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.289> I<00:05:27.349> get<00:05:27.409> them<00:05:27.679> wet<00:05:27.919> and<00:05:28.309> style

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
usually do is I get them wet and style

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.809 
usually do is I get them wet and style
them<00:05:28.939> after<00:05:29.539> I<00:05:29.569> am<00:05:29.989> done<00:05:30.259> cutting<00:05:30.739> them<00:05:31.039> but

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
them after I am done cutting them but

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.399 
them after I am done cutting them but
you<00:05:31.879> don't<00:05:32.089> want<00:05:32.269> to<00:05:32.449> cut<00:05:32.749> while<00:05:32.929> you're<00:05:33.079> while

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
you don't want to cut while you're while

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.049 
you don't want to cut while you're while
it's<00:05:33.649> wet<00:05:33.889> because<00:05:34.039> it's<00:05:34.339> going<00:05:34.519> to<00:05:34.639> turn<00:05:34.999> out

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:35.059 
it's wet because it's going to turn out

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.399 
it's wet because it's going to turn out
too<00:05:35.509> short

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
too short

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.889 
too short
most<00:05:36.649> likely<00:05:37.159> but<00:05:37.909> you<00:05:38.239> can<00:05:38.419> make<00:05:38.509> them<00:05:38.689> as

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:38.899 
most likely but you can make them as

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:41.289 
most likely but you can make them as
short<00:05:39.199> or<00:05:39.409> as<00:05:39.499> long<00:05:39.649> as<00:05:39.860> you<00:05:40.099> want<00:05:40.519> them<00:05:40.759> to<00:05:41.029> be

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:41.299 
short or as long as you want them to be

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.319 
short or as long as you want them to be
this<00:05:42.289> is<00:05:42.469> about<00:05:42.709> how<00:05:42.919> I<00:05:42.979> usually<00:05:43.219> do<00:05:43.519> mine<00:05:43.789> and

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:44.329 
this is about how I usually do mine and

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:48.039 
this is about how I usually do mine and
I<00:05:44.959> will<00:05:45.799> go<00:05:46.009> wash<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:46.999> style<00:05:47.299> them<00:05:47.509> and<00:05:47.749> I<00:05:47.839> will

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:48.049 
I will go wash and style them and I will

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:51.129 
I will go wash and style them and I will
come<00:05:48.259> back<00:05:48.289> into<00:05:48.679> case<00:05:49.009> I<00:05:49.249> fished<00:05:49.639> um<00:05:50.139> blow

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
come back into case I fished um blow

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.790 
come back into case I fished um blow

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:56.809 
kind of a little bit damp from the

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.799 
kind of a little bit damp from the
hairspray<00:05:57.619> but<00:05:58.279> it<00:05:59.089> should<00:05:59.360> look<00:05:59.419> really<00:05:59.599> good

00:05:59.799 --> 00:05:59.809 
hairspray but it should look really good

hairspray but it should look really good
after<00:06:00.139> it's<00:06:00.259> dry<00:06:00.469> but<00:06:00.769> this<00:06:01.339> is<00:06:01.519> what<00:06:01.669> it

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
after it's dry but this is what it

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.909 
after it's dry but this is what it
should<00:06:01.969> look<00:06:01.999> like<00:06:02.179> um<00:06:02.689> you<00:06:03.409> can<00:06:03.589> make<00:06:03.739> it
