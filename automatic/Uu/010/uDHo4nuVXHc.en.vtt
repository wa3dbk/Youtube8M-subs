00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
I just coat it with a little nonstick

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:32.280 
I just coat it with a little nonstick
spray<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.860> go<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.979 

is<00:02:32.829> it<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.189> bake<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.640> 350-degree<00:02:34.569> oven

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
is it going to bake in a 350-degree oven

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.319 
is it going to bake in a 350-degree oven
for<00:02:35.290> about<00:02:36.069> 15<00:02:36.609> minutes<00:02:36.819> until<00:02:37.209> they're

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
for about 15 minutes until they're

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.890 

I<00:03:00.060> guess<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> fuel<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.510> dough<00:03:01.660> has<00:03:01.780> been

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
I guess the fuel of dough has been

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.449 
I guess the fuel of dough has been
cooked<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.200> for<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.379> few<00:03:02.560> minutes<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:02.950> pulled<00:03:03.370> it

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
cooked in for a few minutes I pulled it

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.400 
cooked in for a few minutes I pulled it
out<00:03:03.610> everything's<00:03:04.090> golden<00:03:04.300> brown<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.900> now

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
out everything's golden brown and now

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.570 
out everything's golden brown and now
we're<00:03:05.590> going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.739> set<00:03:05.890> these<00:03:06.010> aside<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.489> let

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
we're going to set these aside and let

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.949 
we're going to set these aside and let
them<00:03:06.730> cool<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.180> while<00:03:07.540> they're<00:03:07.720> cooling

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
them cool and while they're cooling

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.570 
them cool and while they're cooling
we're<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.769> get<00:03:08.860> our<00:03:09.040> other<00:03:09.370> ingredients
