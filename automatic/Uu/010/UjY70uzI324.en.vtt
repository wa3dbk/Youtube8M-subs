video<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:05.819> brakes<00:00:06.859> but<00:00:07.859> first<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.220> want

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
video is about brakes but first I want

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.419 
video is about brakes but first I want
to<00:00:08.429> show<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> front<00:00:08.910> end<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:12.920> made<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
to show you the front end I made the the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.790 
to show you the front end I made the the
for<00:00:14.639> links<00:00:14.910> longer<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.080> now<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.260> they're<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
for links longer so now that they're the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.760 
for links longer so now that they're the
proper<00:00:17.160> length<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:18.869> line<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> new

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
proper length to line up with the new

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.120 
proper length to line up with the new
round<00:00:20.189> front<00:00:20.580> axle<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.289> also<00:00:22.289> use<00:00:22.650> two<00:00:22.859> larger

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
round front axle I also use two larger

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
round front axle I also use two larger
diameter<00:00:23.670> aluminum<00:00:24.150> rod<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.320> looks<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
diameter aluminum rod so it looks a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.779 
diameter aluminum rod so it looks a
little<00:00:25.800> beefier<00:00:26.330> looks<00:00:27.330> better<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.609> sway

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
little beefier looks better and the sway

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
little beefier looks better and the sway
bar<00:00:29.970> mounts<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.720> been<00:00:30.900> lengthened<00:00:31.850> haven't

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
bar mounts have been lengthened haven't

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.380 
bar mounts have been lengthened haven't
done<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> limiting<00:00:33.960> straps<00:00:34.320> yet<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.670> now

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
done the limiting straps yet and now

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.760 
done the limiting straps yet and now
I've<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> bigger<00:00:37.160> stronger<00:00:38.160> Cyril<00:00:39.770> that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
I've got a bigger stronger Cyril that's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.860 
I've got a bigger stronger Cyril that's
what<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> had<00:00:41.219> before

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
what I had before

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.610 
what I had before
and<00:00:43.010> now<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> new<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.059> GWS<00:00:46.430> 777<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:49.350> puts

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and now the new one is a GWS 777 it puts

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.279 
and now the new one is a GWS 777 it puts
out<00:00:51.079> 583<00:00:52.079> team<00:00:52.469> ounces<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.460> torque<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.289> point

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
out 583 team ounces of torque in point

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:07.340 
out 583 team ounces of torque in point
12<00:00:55.559> seconds<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.219> 60<00:00:56.699> degrees<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> should

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
12 seconds at 60 degrees so that should

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
12 seconds at 60 degrees so that should
take<00:01:07.500> care<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:07.950> steering<00:01:08.670> problems<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> now

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
take care of my steering problems so now

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.719 
take care of my steering problems so now
let's<00:01:12.060> look<00:01:12.119> at<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> brakes

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.230 

whoa<00:01:18.759> no<00:01:19.720> brakes<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.759> also<00:01:21.939> means<00:01:22.240> no<00:01:22.720> cables

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
whoa no brakes that also means no cables

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.539 
whoa no brakes that also means no cables
no<00:01:25.240> more<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.600> these<00:01:25.689> hokey<00:01:26.140> looking<00:01:26.549> brackets

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
no more of these hokey looking brackets

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.700 
no more of these hokey looking brackets
and<00:01:27.729> levers<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.479> instead<00:01:31.869> of<00:01:31.930> using<00:01:32.140> cable

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
and levers and so instead of using cable

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.480 
and levers and so instead of using cable
brakes<00:01:33.270> I'm<00:01:34.270> gonna<00:01:34.509> be<00:01:34.630> using<00:01:37.890> hydraulic<00:01:38.890> disc

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
brakes I'm gonna be using hydraulic disc

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.560 
brakes I'm gonna be using hydraulic disc
brakes<00:01:41.670> there's<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.789> disc<00:01:43.000> hopefully<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.450> can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
brakes there's the disc hopefully I can

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.529 
brakes there's the disc hopefully I can
use<00:01:43.720> these<00:01:44.820> incorporate<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:45.939> onto<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.329> hub

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
use these incorporate it onto the hub

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.719 
use these incorporate it onto the hub
inside<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.289> wheel<00:01:47.470> I'm<00:01:48.159> still<00:01:48.429> gonna<00:01:48.520> have

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
inside the wheel I'm still gonna have

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.240 
inside the wheel I'm still gonna have
two<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.000> them<00:01:49.149> one<00:01:49.959> on<00:01:49.990> each<00:01:50.200> wheel<00:01:50.500> instead<00:01:51.190> of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
two of them one on each wheel instead of

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.990 
two of them one on each wheel instead of
the<00:01:51.429> drive<00:01:51.610> shaft<00:01:53.520> having<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.580> brake<00:01:54.759> on<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
the drive shaft having the brake on the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.639 
the drive shaft having the brake on the
drive<00:01:55.179> shaft<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.659> gonna<00:01:55.780> put<00:01:56.020> too<00:01:56.140> much<00:01:56.289> stress

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
drive shaft is gonna put too much stress

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.219 
drive shaft is gonna put too much stress
on<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:58.000> custom<00:01:58.360> cut<00:01:58.569> gears<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.140> the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
on the custom cut gears and the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.539 
on the custom cut gears and the
differentials<00:01:59.799> so<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.009> want<00:02:00.280> them<00:02:00.369> on<00:02:00.429> the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
differentials so I want them on the

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.359 
differentials so I want them on the
wheels<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:02.020> if<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.229> look<00:02:02.380> at<00:02:02.470> this<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:03.250> is

and I found a whole different set dual
piston<00:02:44.220> calipers<00:02:45.780> instead<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.930> single

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
piston calipers instead of a single

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.750 
piston calipers instead of a single
piston<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.680> has<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.890> single<00:02:48.310> piston<00:02:48.610> on<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
piston this has a single piston on the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.810 
piston this has a single piston on the
side<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:50.050> they<00:02:50.170> have<00:02:50.290> another<00:02:50.560> kit<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:51.640> has
