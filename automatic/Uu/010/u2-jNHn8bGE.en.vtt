here<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.209> use<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> slightly<00:02:19.019> satiny<00:02:19.849> silk<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
here I use a slightly satiny silk and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.720 
here I use a slightly satiny silk and
it's<00:02:22.110> such<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> wonderful<00:02:22.590> rich<00:02:23.159> color<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.670> a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it's such a wonderful rich color it's a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.660 
it's such a wonderful rich color it's a
little<00:02:23.939> bit<00:02:24.030> thicker<00:02:25.019> in<00:02:25.379> quality<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.430> so

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
little bit thicker in quality and so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.250 
little bit thicker in quality and so
therefore<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.239> colors<00:02:27.659> are<00:02:27.900> much<00:02:28.019> more

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
therefore the colors are much more

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.000 
therefore the colors are much more
vibrant<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:29.030> actually<00:02:30.030> used<00:02:30.689> a<00:02:30.930> stencil<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.799> cut

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
vibrant I actually used a stencil I cut

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.910 
vibrant I actually used a stencil I cut
out<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.189> stencil<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.909> butterfly<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
out a stencil of a butterfly and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
out a stencil of a butterfly and
therefore<00:02:34.920> wax<00:02:35.400> through<00:02:35.819> there<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.269> then<00:02:36.780> I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
therefore wax through there and then I

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.160 
therefore wax through there and then I
graded<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.879> I'll<00:02:39.150> show<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.390> later<00:02:39.659> on<00:02:39.989> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
graded I and I'll show you later on it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.559 
graded I and I'll show you later on it
in<00:02:40.349> this<00:02:40.500> section<00:02:41.040> I'll<00:02:41.790> show<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.150> how<00:02:42.540> to

in this section I'll show you how to

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.530 
in this section I'll show you how to
blend<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.980> colors<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.640> get<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.819> nice<00:02:45.030> gradation

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
blend the colors to get a nice gradation

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.140 
blend the colors to get a nice gradation
of<00:02:46.049> color<00:02:48.319> this<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:49.530> heavier<00:02:50.220> quality<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.909> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
of color this is a heavier quality of of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.280 
of color this is a heavier quality of of
silk<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.780> I've<00:02:52.500> used<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.239> wax<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.959> brush

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
silk and I've used the wax and the brush

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.869 
silk and I've used the wax and the brush
this<00:02:55.920> very<00:02:56.190> fine

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
this very fine

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.920 
this very fine
Japanese<00:02:57.659> brush<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.620> fill<00:02:58.829> in<00:02:58.950> areas<00:02:59.629> this<00:03:00.629> is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
Japanese brush to fill in areas this is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.920 
Japanese brush to fill in areas this is
actually<00:03:01.290> Japanese<00:03:01.829> silk<00:03:02.299> sometimes<00:03:03.299> even

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
actually Japanese silk sometimes even

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.009 
actually Japanese silk sometimes even
slightly<00:03:04.200> thicker<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.799> use<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.250> their

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
slightly thicker they use it for their

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.680 
slightly thicker they use it for their
kimonos<00:03:07.019> but<00:03:07.859> it's<00:03:08.010> got<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> lovely<00:03:08.549> quality<00:03:09.209> to

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
kimonos but it's got a lovely quality to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.530 
kimonos but it's got a lovely quality to
it<00:03:09.840> doesn't<00:03:10.799> crush<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.549> sometimes<00:03:12.299> when

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
it doesn't crush and sometimes when

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.300 
it doesn't crush and sometimes when
you've<00:03:12.720> waxed<00:03:12.930> something<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.040> taking

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
you've waxed something and then taking

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.599 
you've waxed something and then taking
out<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.480> wax<00:03:15.659> it's<00:03:16.560> got<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.799> body<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.459> you

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
out the wax it's got a body that you

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.360 
out the wax it's got a body that you
wouldn't<00:03:17.940> get<00:03:18.120> normally<00:03:18.889> but<00:03:19.889> notice<00:03:20.220> how<00:03:20.340> I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
wouldn't get normally but notice how I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.520 
wouldn't get normally but notice how I
can<00:03:20.609> just<00:03:20.790> crumple<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.389> that<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:21.900> it

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
can just crumple it like that and it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.599 
can just crumple it like that and it
doesn't<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:22.949> any<00:03:23.099> folds<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.699> it<00:03:24.949> and<00:03:25.949> then

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
doesn't have any folds in it and then

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.259 
doesn't have any folds in it and then
when<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:26.849> was<00:03:27.060> writing<00:03:27.870> my<00:03:28.049> book<00:03:28.639> called<00:03:29.639> start

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
when I was writing my book called start

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.580 
when I was writing my book called start
to<00:03:30.449> batik<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.230> was<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:32.519> really<00:03:32.760> aimed<00:03:32.970> for

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
to batik I was it's really aimed for

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.860 
to batik I was it's really aimed for
younger<00:03:34.590> people<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.459> what<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> wanted<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.750> do

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
younger people and what I wanted to do

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.699 
younger people and what I wanted to do
is<00:03:37.019> try<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:38.090> ready-made<00:03:39.090> materials<00:03:40.049> that

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
is try and ready-made materials that

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.420 
is try and ready-made materials that
some<00:03:41.400> teenagers<00:03:42.120> or<00:03:42.629> young<00:03:43.500> adults<00:03:43.530> could<00:03:44.190> use

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
some teenagers or young adults could use

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.710 
some teenagers or young adults could use
and<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:45.629> bought<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.519> viscous<00:03:47.519> scarf<00:03:48.150> for

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
and so I bought this viscous scarf for

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.680 
and so I bought this viscous scarf for
hardly<00:03:49.650> anything<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.970> decided<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.540> I

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
hardly anything and I decided that I

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.460 
hardly anything and I decided that I
would<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:53.000> wax<00:03:54.000> very<00:03:54.510> simple<00:03:54.930> designs<00:03:55.260> on

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
would like to wax very simple designs on

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.740 
would like to wax very simple designs on
it<00:03:55.500> now<00:03:56.370> because<00:03:56.699> it's<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.940> very<00:03:57.150> loose<00:03:57.389> weave

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
it now because it's a very loose weave

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.649 
it now because it's a very loose weave
it's<00:03:58.139> very<00:03:58.379> difficult<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:59.430> get<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.639> nice<00:03:59.849> clean

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
it's very difficult to get a nice clean

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.849 
it's very difficult to get a nice clean
line<00:04:01.169> on<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.859> so<00:04:02.280> what<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.849> did<00:04:02.940> was<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.299> used<00:04:04.079> this

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
line on it so what I did was I used this

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:05.689 
line on it so what I did was I used this
paintbrush

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
paintbrush

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.970 
paintbrush
I<00:04:05.730> cut<00:04:06.239> out<00:04:06.269> little<00:04:06.900> sections<00:04:07.409> of<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.739> and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
I cut out little sections of it and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.159 
I cut out little sections of it and
dipped<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.940> into<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.299> wax<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.989> then<00:04:10.680> went

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
dipped it into the wax and then went

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.770 
dipped it into the wax and then went
like<00:04:13.169> that<00:04:13.639> dipped<00:04:14.639> into<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:14.909> wax<00:04:15.090> sometimes

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
like that dipped into the wax sometimes

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.870 
like that dipped into the wax sometimes
the<00:04:16.019> wax<00:04:16.349> didn't<00:04:16.739> go<00:04:16.829> through<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.250> fabric<00:04:17.639> but

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
the wax didn't go through the fabric but

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.550 
the wax didn't go through the fabric but
it<00:04:18.000> didn't<00:04:18.209> matter<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.479> was<00:04:18.659> just<00:04:18.810> trying<00:04:19.500> to

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
it didn't matter I was just trying to

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.700 
it didn't matter I was just trying to
create<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:20.250> sort<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:20.699> pattern<00:04:21.209> design<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:24.710> then

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
create a sort of pattern design and then

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.000 
create a sort of pattern design and then
I<00:04:26.010> used<00:04:26.550> some<00:04:26.729> Saturn<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:28.380> cover<00:04:28.680> this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
I used some Saturn to cover this

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.190 
I used some Saturn to cover this
homemade<00:04:31.010> picture<00:04:31.400> frame<00:04:31.670> really<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.210> did

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
homemade picture frame really I did

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.750 
homemade picture frame really I did
it'll<00:04:33.350> suit<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.620> few<00:04:33.890> little<00:04:34.010> squiggles<00:04:34.520> on<00:04:34.640> it

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
it'll suit a few little squiggles on it

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.430 
it'll suit a few little squiggles on it
but<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.240> wonderful<00:04:35.540> thing<00:04:35.780> is<00:04:36.050> that<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.260> can

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
but the wonderful thing is that you can

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.240 
but the wonderful thing is that you can

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
thin you can see through it what I did

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.200 
thin you can see through it what I did
was<00:04:59.390> like<00:04:59.540> I<00:05:00.310> colored<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.430> with<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.580> variety<00:05:01.790> of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
colors wax some areas and then I

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.100 
colors wax some areas and then I
actually<00:05:06.140> died<00:05:06.980> it<00:05:07.250> in<00:05:07.400> black<00:05:07.700> and<00:05:08.120> then<00:05:09.080> I

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
actually died it in black and then I

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.160 
actually died it in black and then I
discharged<00:05:09.950> I<00:05:10.100> used<00:05:10.940> some<00:05:11.240> diluted<00:05:11.750> bleach

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
discharged I used some diluted bleach

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.990 
discharged I used some diluted bleach
and<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:14.690> have<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.050> make<00:05:15.260> sure<00:05:15.470> when<00:05:15.650> you're

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
and you have to make sure when you're

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.240 
and you have to make sure when you're
bleaching<00:05:17.000> on<00:05:17.120> fabric<00:05:17.660> that<00:05:17.960> you<00:05:18.080> rinse<00:05:18.410> it

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
bleaching on fabric that you rinse it

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.910 
bleaching on fabric that you rinse it
out<00:05:19.520> completely<00:05:19.970> on<00:05:20.720> paper<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.770> doesn't

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
out completely on paper it doesn't

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.400 
out completely on paper it doesn't
matter<00:05:22.160> so<00:05:22.400> much<00:05:22.510> but<00:05:23.510> here<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.200> have<00:05:24.230> to

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
matter so much but here you have to

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.590 
matter so much but here you have to
rinse<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.700> think<00:05:26.030> you've<00:05:26.210> got<00:05:26.420> to<00:05:26.570> a

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
rinse and you think you've got to a

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.150 
rinse and you think you've got to a
certain<00:05:26.780> point<00:05:26.990> when<00:05:27.500> it's<00:05:27.650> bleaching<00:05:28.070> out

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
certain point when it's bleaching out

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.490 
certain point when it's bleaching out
and<00:05:28.490> you<00:05:28.850> think<00:05:29.030> I'll<00:05:29.150> stop<00:05:29.420> there<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:29.870> of

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
and you think I'll stop there and of

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.960 
and you think I'll stop there and of
course<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.830> carries<00:05:31.280> on<00:05:31.430> bleaching

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
course it carries on bleaching

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.850 
course it carries on bleaching
afterwards<00:05:32.420> but<00:05:32.900> anyway<00:05:33.200> it's<00:05:33.320> more<00:05:33.500> sort<00:05:33.740> of

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
afterwards but anyway it's more sort of

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.060 
afterwards but anyway it's more sort of
an<00:05:34.370> Aboriginal<00:05:34.700> design<00:05:35.450> here<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.920> this<00:05:39.920> one

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
an Aboriginal design here and this one

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.310 
an Aboriginal design here and this one
here<00:05:40.310> is<00:05:40.340> linen<00:05:40.670> I've<00:05:41.510> actually<00:05:41.720> got<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.050> wax

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
here is linen I've actually got the wax

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.530 
here is linen I've actually got the wax
still<00:05:42.890> in<00:05:43.010> there<00:05:43.190> I<00:05:43.220> haven't<00:05:43.640> finished<00:05:43.970> it<00:05:44.120> but

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
still in there I haven't finished it but

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.570 
still in there I haven't finished it but
I<00:05:44.600> just<00:05:44.690> thought<00:05:45.050> it'd<00:05:45.650> be<00:05:45.680> nice<00:05:45.920> to<00:05:45.980> show<00:05:46.220> you

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
I just thought it'd be nice to show you

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.520 
I just thought it'd be nice to show you
that<00:05:47.330> it's<00:05:47.540> got<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.720> different<00:05:48.230> it's<00:05:48.380> got<00:05:48.500> a

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
that it's got a different it's got a

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.850 
that it's got a different it's got a
slightly<00:05:48.800> rougher<00:05:49.340> quality<00:05:49.820> so<00:05:50.600> you<00:05:50.690> can<00:05:51.020> can

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
slightly rougher quality so you can can

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.370 
slightly rougher quality so you can can
do<00:05:52.250> some<00:05:52.610> really<00:05:53.150> detailed<00:05:53.780> work<00:05:54.020> but<00:05:54.260> you

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
do some really detailed work but you

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.340

have<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.590> be<00:05:54.710> careful<00:05:55.190> because<00:05:55.340> when<00:05:55.610> you're

chanting<00:05:57.350> comes<00:05:57.980> along<00:05:58.390> it<00:05:59.390> sometimes<00:06:00.260> hits
