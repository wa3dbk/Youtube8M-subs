from my grandpa so that was really nice

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.560 
from my grandpa so that was really nice
bandsaw<00:02:25.280> works<00:02:25.520> good<00:02:25.820> doesn't<00:02:26.180> always<00:02:26.300> cut

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
bandsaw works good doesn't always cut

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.240 
bandsaw works good doesn't always cut
straight<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.170> think<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.560> got<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.830> squared<00:02:28.070> up

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
straight but I think I got it squared up

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.880 
straight but I think I got it squared up
pretty<00:02:28.430> good<00:02:28.520> now<00:02:28.960> that's<00:02:29.960> my<00:02:30.200> motor<00:02:30.740> I'm

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
pretty good now that's my motor I'm

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.460 
pretty good now that's my motor I'm
gonna<00:02:31.070> use<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:32.620> 2003<00:02:33.620> GSXR<00:02:34.460> 600<00:02:35.210> motor

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
gonna use it's a 2003 GSXR 600 motor

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.330 
gonna use it's a 2003 GSXR 600 motor

so<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:14.060> don't<00:03:14.720> know<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.870> guess<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.200> works<00:03:15.640> already

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
so I don't know I guess it works already

-<00:03:29.239> bender<00:03:29.600> again<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:30.110> think<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.770> paid<00:03:30.950> three

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
- bender again I think I paid three

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.760 
- bender again I think I paid three
hundred<00:03:31.459> forty<00:03:31.760> dollars<00:03:32.120> for<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:33.590> was

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
hundred forty dollars for it it was

for shipping it doesn't quite bend to
ninety<00:03:40.190> degrees<00:03:40.550> I<00:03:41.200> think<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.440> fix<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.860> if

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
ninety degrees I think I can fix that if

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.180 
ninety degrees I think I can fix that if
I<00:03:43.190> screw<00:03:44.180> out<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.690> screw<00:03:45.560> on<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.739> top<00:03:45.800> of<00:03:46.100> the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
I screw out the screw on the top of the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.960 
I screw out the screw on the top of the
bottle<00:03:46.459> jack<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:47.690> make<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:48.670> have<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.730> little

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
bottle jack to make it have a little

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.560 
bottle jack to make it have a little
more<00:03:50.090> travel<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.590> it'll<00:03:51.770> go<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:52.040> 90<00:03:52.480> anyway<00:03:53.480> I'm

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
more travel so it'll go to 90 anyway I'm

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.080 
more travel so it'll go to 90 anyway I'm
just<00:03:53.600> kind<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:53.930> showing<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.260> guys<00:03:54.380> how<00:03:55.090> long

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
just kind of showing you guys how long

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.490 
just kind of showing you guys how long
it<00:03:56.209> takes<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.570> get<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.870> pumped<00:03:57.140> up<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.440> think

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
it takes to get it pumped up I think

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.790 
it takes to get it pumped up I think
that's<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:58.130> know<00:03:58.190> 45<00:03:58.640> degrees<00:03:59.000> right<00:03:59.030> there

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
that's you know 45 degrees right there

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.229 
that's you know 45 degrees right there
seems<00:04:00.800> like<00:04:00.920> it's<00:04:01.070> been<00:04:01.220> about<00:04:01.459> 1<00:04:01.850> degree<00:04:02.209> per

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
seems like it's been about 1 degree per

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.040 
seems like it's been about 1 degree per
pump<00:04:03.020> of<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.980> jack<00:04:04.340> on<00:04:05.300> average<00:04:05.750> I

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
pump of the of the jack on average I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.940 
pump of the of the jack on average I
guess

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
guess

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.540 
guess
I<00:04:08.540> got<00:04:09.540> some<00:04:09.780> more<00:04:09.930> footage<00:04:10.440> here<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.280> the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
I got some more footage here that of the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.380 
I got some more footage here that of the
chassis

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
chassis

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.170

a<00:04:12.540> couple<00:04:13.019> more<00:04:13.140> tubes<00:04:13.410> in<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.680> bottom<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.010> the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
a couple more tubes in the bottom of the

a couple more tubes in the bottom of the

on the bottom half of the chassis there

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.190 
on the bottom half of the chassis there
for<00:04:17.310> bracing<00:04:20.389> so<00:04:21.389> it's<00:04:21.510> taking<00:04:21.780> me<00:04:21.870> about<00:04:22.019> two

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
for bracing so it's taking me about two
