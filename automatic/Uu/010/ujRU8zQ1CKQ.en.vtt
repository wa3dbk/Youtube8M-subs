00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
meals but I don't prep my meals cutting

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.349 
meals but I don't prep my meals cutting
up<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.050> fruits<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> vegetables<00:00:29.369> before<00:00:30.119> you

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
up your fruits and vegetables before you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
up your fruits and vegetables before you
actually<00:00:30.810> cook<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.199> cutting<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.830> hours

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
actually cook them cutting them up hours

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.270 
actually cook them cutting them up hours
or<00:00:32.600> especially<00:00:33.600> days<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.989> advance<00:00:34.290> will<00:00:35.070> make

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
or especially days in advance will make

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670 
or especially days in advance will make
them<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> lot<00:00:35.910> less<00:00:36.180> healthy<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:37.260> you've<00:00:37.410> got

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
them a lot less healthy when you've got

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
them a lot less healthy when you've got
a<00:00:37.710> vegetable<00:00:37.980> it'll<00:00:38.610> start<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> oxidize<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
a vegetable it'll start to oxidize and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.420 
a vegetable it'll start to oxidize and
it<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.410> lose<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> lot<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> its<00:00:41.280> good

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it will lose a lot of its good

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
it will lose a lot of its good
properties<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> would<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.899> recommend

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
properties so I would really recommend

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.459 
properties so I would really recommend
you<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.820> only<00:00:45.059> wash<00:00:45.750> cut<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you to not do that and only wash cut and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
you to not do that and only wash cut and
prepare<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.920> vegetables<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.610> before<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
prepare your vegetables right before you

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.119 
prepare your vegetables right before you
eat<00:00:48.719> them<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> same<00:00:49.260> goes<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.469> fruits

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
eat them and the same goes for fruits

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
eat them and the same goes for fruits
it'll<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.910> keep<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.329> lot<00:00:51.510> longer<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it'll also just keep a lot longer that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
it'll also just keep a lot longer that
way<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> way<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> meal<00:00:53.640> plan<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.030> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
way so the way I like to meal plan is I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119

I always plan my meals in sets of two I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.480 
I always plan my meals in sets of two I
don't<00:01:05.309> try<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.580> figure<00:01:06.210> out<00:01:06.450> recipes<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.490> use

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
don't try to figure out recipes that use

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.310 
don't try to figure out recipes that use
similar<00:01:09.000> ingredients<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:09.840> even<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> same

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
similar ingredients or even the same

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.649 
similar ingredients or even the same
ingredients<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.909> only<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.270> able<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
ingredients so that I only be able to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
ingredients so that I only be able to
use<00:01:12.900> those<00:01:13.290> ingredients<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:14.040> two<00:01:14.280> days<00:01:14.490> out

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
use those ingredients for two days out

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.130 
use those ingredients for two days out
of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> week<00:01:14.909> gets<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.840> bit

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of the week gets a little bit

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.109 
of the week gets a little bit
complicated<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.909> same

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
complicated here but I will use the same

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.390 
complicated here but I will use the same
ingredients<00:01:18.439> for<00:01:19.439> two<00:01:19.590> days<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.280> will

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
ingredients for two days but I will

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
ingredients for two days but I will
stick<00:01:20.640> another<00:01:21.090> day<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> middle<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.869> then

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
stick another day in the middle and then

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.969 
stick another day in the middle and then
use<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:23.159> day's<00:01:23.400> ingredients<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.210> day<00:01:24.979> after

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
use that day's ingredients the day after

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
use that day's ingredients the day after
like<00:01:26.430> two<00:01:26.670> days<00:01:26.880> after<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> gotta<00:01:28.200> have

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
like two days after that so I gotta have

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
like two days after that so I gotta have
two<00:01:28.650> pairs<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.700> third<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
two pairs like that and then third one

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
two pairs like that and then third one
goes<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> makes<00:01:31.770> any<00:01:31.890> sense

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
goes like that if that makes any sense

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
goes like that if that makes any sense
this<00:01:33.180> way<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:33.479> avoiding<00:01:33.840> eating<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.530> same

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
this way I'm avoiding eating the same

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370 
this way I'm avoiding eating the same
thing<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.400> days<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.820> row<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.270> day<00:01:36.869> seven<00:01:37.259> I

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
combining ingredients or at least it is

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.240 
combining ingredients or at least it is
for<00:03:33.799> me<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.699> for<00:03:35.060> example<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.840> buy<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.769> can<00:03:37.220> of

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
for me so for example I can buy a can of

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.849 
for me so for example I can buy a can of

dip<00:03:45.229> in<00:03:45.379> the<00:03:45.500> hummus<00:03:45.829> and<00:03:45.979> then<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.519> other

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
dip in the hummus and then the other

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.399

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
stew and that way I have used those are

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.449 
stew and that way I have used those are
ingredients<00:03:55.609> in<00:03:56.150> completely<00:03:56.569> different
