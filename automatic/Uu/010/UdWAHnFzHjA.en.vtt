there's different um like links i should
say<00:02:21.239> tabs<00:02:23.060> there's<00:02:24.500> springtomize<00:02:25.500> iOS<00:02:26.280> four

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
say tabs there's springtomize iOS four

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.110 
say tabs there's springtomize iOS four
point<00:02:27.180> x<00:02:27.480> that's<00:02:28.319> what<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.500> am<00:02:29.120> they're

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
point x that's what I am they're

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.490 
point x that's what I am they're
springtomize<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.959> iOS<00:02:31.709> 5<00:02:32.010> plus<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.360> those<00:02:34.349> are

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
springtomize to iOS 5 plus so those are

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.089 
springtomize to iOS 5 plus so those are
stand<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.129> different<00:02:35.700> versions<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:38.010> I'm

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
stand for the different versions so I'm

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.150 
stand for the different versions so I'm
just<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.400> click<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.819> my<00:02:39.090> version<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:40.319> X

just going to click on my version for X

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.319 
just going to click on my version for X
and<00:02:42.890> then<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.069> will<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.700> thing<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.000> says

and then there will be a thing that says

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.600 
and then there will be a thing that says
install<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.560> top<00:02:46.799> right<00:02:47.579> corner<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:50.430> hit
