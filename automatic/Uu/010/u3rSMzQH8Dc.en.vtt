00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.129
 let's show a trick to accelerate 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.780
 the boot of the operating system 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:11.269
 microsoft windows 7 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.330
 it's quite simple if we have a 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.750
 computer with several processors or a 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.440
 processor and several cores 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.330
 click on the start button 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.400
 we will write more config 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.350
 and we will execute this utility of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.650
 system configuration 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.370
 in the start tab we will click on 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.860
 advanced options 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.010
 and here what we will do is establish the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.280
 all the processors or cores that 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.820
 let's have in the system for the start 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.739
 in our case 4 we will mark the number 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.470
 of processors and in the drop-down 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.089
 we will select the maximum and all the 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.250
 amount of memory boot have 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.519
 also the system we will mark quantity 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.640
 maximum memory by default will put us 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.950
 to the one who has the system we will leave it and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.460
 we will press accept 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.979
 since we are here we can take advantage 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.900
 to accelerate also the start in 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.290
 some options 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 some programs for example that you 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.760
 necessary that will start at startup 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 as we adobe acrobat of we can of 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.900
 mark it and some other programs that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.140
 they do not have to be active if the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.640
 we demarcate so that they do not start 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.820
 You can also accelerate a bit the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.979
 system boot 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.000
 once we have done this we will press 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.000
 in applying 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.570
 in accepting it will tell us that you have to 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.670
 restart the system we will close the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.670
 applications and we will start 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.550
 and with this simple trick we will see that the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.550
 equipment starts a few seconds before
