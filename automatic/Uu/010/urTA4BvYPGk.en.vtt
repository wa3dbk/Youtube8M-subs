ride and then I just took my concealer

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.160 
ride and then I just took my concealer
and<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.740> used<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.400> lot<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.060> concealer<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:58.900> but<00:01:59.140> I

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
and I used a lot of concealer here but I

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.100 
and I used a lot of concealer here but I
had<00:01:59.560> some<00:02:00.100> pretty<00:02:00.370> dark<00:02:00.820> circles<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.570> when

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
had some pretty dark circles and when

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.960 
had some pretty dark circles and when
you're<00:02:02.260> traveling<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.950> tend<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.340> get<00:02:03.580> darker

you're traveling you tend to get darker
circles<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.380> just<00:02:05.800> decided<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.970> apply<00:02:07.780> more

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
circles so I just decided to apply more

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.810 
circles so I just decided to apply more
concealer<00:02:08.649> than<00:02:08.860> normal<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.429> then<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.610> just

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
concealer than normal and then I just

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.670 
concealer than normal and then I just
blended<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.270> out<00:02:10.630> with<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.899> Beauty<00:02:11.410> Blender

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.350 

and<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.010> look<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.430> went<00:02:18.640> with<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:19.000> cream

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and for this look I went with a cream

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.990 
and for this look I went with a cream
blush<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.890> lasts<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.520> much<00:02:21.730> longer

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
blush because it lasts so much longer

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.120 
blush because it lasts so much longer

and if you're going to be on a plane or

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.190 
and if you're going to be on a plane or
in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.370> car<00:02:24.730> for<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.060> really<00:02:25.390> long<00:02:25.510> time<00:02:25.570> you're

in the car for a really long time you're
not<00:02:26.320> going<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.560> want<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.800> have<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.010> reapply

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
also looks a little bit more natural

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.200 
also looks a little bit more natural
than<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.320> regular<00:02:35.770> blush<00:02:36.070> would<00:02:36.310> accept<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
than a regular blush would accept the

it'll<00:06:06.970> actually<00:06:07.090> give<00:06:07.480> your<00:06:07.600> hair<00:06:07.780> so<00:06:08.170> much

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
it'll actually give your hair so much

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.920 
it'll actually give your hair so much
more<00:06:09.010> volume<00:06:09.490> and<00:06:09.880> I<00:06:09.910> actually<00:06:10.090> discovered

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
more volume and I actually discovered

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.250 
more volume and I actually discovered
this<00:06:11.230> on<00:06:11.470> my<00:06:11.890> own<00:06:12.190> so<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:12.790> I'm<00:06:13.360> pretty<00:06:13.870> surprised

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
this on my own so I I'm pretty surprised

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.140 
this on my own so I I'm pretty surprised
it<00:06:14.470> actually<00:06:14.860> turned<00:06:15.370> out<00:06:15.490> really<00:06:15.550> well<00:06:15.940> and

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
it actually turned out really well and

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.720 
it actually turned out really well and
then<00:06:16.330> I<00:06:16.480> had<00:06:16.690> a<00:06:16.720> bump<00:06:17.200> in<00:06:17.530> my<00:06:17.590> hair<00:06:18.160> so<00:06:18.400> I<00:06:18.430> just

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
then I had a bump in my hair so I just

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.880 
then I had a bump in my hair so I just
fixed<00:06:18.970> that<00:06:19.030> with<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.240> bobby<00:06:19.510> pin<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:20.170> then

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
fixed that with a bobby pin and then

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.190 
fixed that with a bobby pin and then
this<00:06:21.070> part<00:06:21.340> is<00:06:21.430> totally<00:06:21.730> optional<00:06:22.120> so<00:06:22.600> I<00:06:22.630> took

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
this part is totally optional so I took

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.320 
this part is totally optional so I took
a<00:06:23.230> piece<00:06:23.620> from<00:06:23.890> the<00:06:24.250> bottom<00:06:24.610> of<00:06:24.730> my<00:06:24.760> ponytail

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
a piece from the bottom of my ponytail

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.970 
a piece from the bottom of my ponytail
and<00:06:25.510> wrapped<00:06:25.810> that<00:06:26.080> around<00:06:26.140> the<00:06:26.770> actual

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
and wrapped that around the actual

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.210 
and wrapped that around the actual
ponytail<00:06:27.730> to<00:06:27.970> hide<00:06:28.390> the<00:06:28.870> rubber<00:06:29.200> band<00:06:29.500> and<00:06:29.710> I

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
ponytail to hide the rubber band and I

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.400 
ponytail to hide the rubber band and I
think<00:06:30.430> this<00:06:30.580> makes<00:06:30.820> it<00:06:30.970> look<00:06:31.120> so<00:06:31.360> much<00:06:31.900> cuter

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
think this makes it look so much cuter

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.220 
think this makes it look so much cuter
and<00:06:32.800> a<00:06:32.980> lot<00:06:33.220> more<00:06:33.250> presentable<00:06:34.000> that<00:06:34.660> way<00:06:34.840> when

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
and a lot more presentable that way when

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.230 
and a lot more presentable that way when
you<00:06:35.440> get<00:06:35.590> off<00:06:35.740> the<00:06:35.920> plane<00:06:35.950> if<00:06:36.400> you're<00:06:36.910> going<00:06:37.060> to

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
you get off the plane if you're going to

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.540 
you get off the plane if you're going to
go<00:06:37.390> meet<00:06:37.780> someone<00:06:38.110> or<00:06:38.290> go<00:06:38.800> into<00:06:38.950> meetings<00:06:39.220> or

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
go meet someone or go into meetings or

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.030 
go meet someone or go into meetings or
whatever<00:06:40.000> you<00:06:40.600> will<00:06:40.780> look<00:06:40.960> presentable<00:06:41.320> and

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
whatever you will look presentable and

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.700 
whatever you will look presentable and
