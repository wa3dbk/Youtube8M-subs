00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 nice all guys that are orgasmic 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.879
 here to bring you a scud builder me 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.189
 you have requested ugly ie one 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.599
 bronze team the best one of the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.820
 best bronze teams you can 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.099
 doing this game was difficult 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.690
 but in the end I managed to find the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.699
 bronze team maybe you are with 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.699
 best found with gods 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.170
 really great players who are 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.090
 great together and then we leave 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 immediately assumed that the team 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 It costs about 30 thousand credits on something 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.289
 of the kind that more than less I don't know 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.910
 however however it really makes it 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.630
 very much in three games I have 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.399
 made only one goal since the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.500
 strong defense and I really did 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.500
 a series of goals so let's start 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 immediately we put bronze quality and meanwhile 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 let's put where the camp nou goes nice 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 no lampson league matter you can 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 use as I always say any 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.039
 bronze goalkeeper of the US mls 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.930
 great good goalkeeper good speed 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.129
 tufa and physis and reflex values 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.989
 good night 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 so it's really great for me 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.589
 goalkeeper also very tall 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 then the two plants is a very team 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.890
 splitter to me does not make me crazy 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.380
 however anyway if you want the best 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.549
 of the best here it is win that is between 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.080
 the other saw that the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.979
 right-back version 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.270
 however win 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.060
 central defender the best of the game 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.649
 definitely with crazy speed work 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.030
 incredible statistics of physical defenses 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.520
 monstrous, by the way, I realize now 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.709
 which is 175 I never noticed before 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.719
 so it could be a problem for i 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.729
 head shots even if I don't have anyway 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.799
 taken no head goals then state 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.289
 do not worry then your departmental companion 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.890
 without doubt the mythical jean baptiste that 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.349
 it is really a phenomenon that makes recoveries 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.329
 defensive like a really amazing 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.189
 great player with these two 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.979
 central defenders rest assured that 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.280
 you almost never suffer actions you can say 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.599
 then we go to the right we find how 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.950
 quarterback 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:02.539
 I used if fan and lyon a good one 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.250
 fullback was a bit skeptical given his 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.719
 physical and little defense value a little 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.789
 bassino but I have to say it's a good one 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.200
 player and nothing but it is anyway 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.290
 a decent player who among other things me 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.780
 he also did an assist while like 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.340
 left back or used this here 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.920
 really fast Korean park 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.720
 with good defense statistics or a lot 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.359
 very good and physical by the way a 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.090
 warcraft normal high so don't go up 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:32.299
 much to attack does it do to 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.319
 who in who does it best here is how 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.359
 the outside 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.470
 and in any case he has an excellent physique and defends 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:41.720
 really very well then midfield cc 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.889
 of right used tallis to have a 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.560
 great player 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.669
 reminds me a lot of a bronze yaya touré 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.590
 because it's really statistics 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:52.910
 impressive pity that at a throw a 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.470
 po bassino and if he had at least 60 shots 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.660
 he would perhaps be the central midfielder 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.370
 stronger than the game obviously speaking 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.680
 always made me a bronze 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.510
 assists in three games while his 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.060
 department mate on the left is 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.340
 ie greasy and that is a player I have 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.709
 treated so much in the various years of 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.450
 fifa used also in hidden verses 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.160
 so this year you will know who I speak is 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.410
 really a terrific player if that 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.109
 would have a higher speed would be 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.970
 very strong because he has a shot that is 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.269
 something shocking a shot from 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.000
 powerful distance then external of 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.120
 right used play which is this 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.489
 player 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.230
 very good exterior with a shot 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.670
 really very high he made me a log 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.560
 very beautifull 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.180
 pity that it doesn't have a lot of speed 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.769
 however, whatever it is in my opinion is rende 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.950
 very well this player has a great one 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.950
 dribbling and so according to me yes there is 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.930
 then quietly left exterior 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.940
 I used one of his book 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.700
 when the up this guy here who got me 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.250
 made a goal really a good player 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.379
 I have to say high work at it if he had 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.879
 maybe average of defense killer whales would be 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.140
 better, however, is not heard 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.660
 not so much just fair speed 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.000
 but also a decent shot because I have 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.489
 found quite well it seems more than 51 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.950
 it's also a great step then too 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.239
 it is a very good player but 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.310
 let's focus more on the two 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.430
 strikers forming a pair 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:26.250
 perfect worthy of the doumbia type 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:29.550
 ibarbo to the right used furniture that is 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.370
 really good very high speed 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.300
 dribbling very high work at great 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.250
 truly incredible low shot cost 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.200
 great great finalization in three 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.270
 matches made me three goals and I don't know if 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.590
 on its own 5 assists since 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.500
 anyway I used it a lot 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.410
 long ago this player but makes a lot 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.570
 more sgama in attack a1 and a2 sorry 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.789
 maybe he had made me like 34 assis 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.349
 still a goal per game and even a 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.440
 assist in this game at this point veil 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.240
 always guarantees but the pearl of 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.270
 this team is without a doubt 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.430
 the left striker who is who is that 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.449
 canzo the boy and a player 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.460
 incredible three games 6 goals those 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.199
 other matches are due in November 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.820
 as you see the date of the first purchase 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.919
 which used it in attack 1 second 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.490
 me doesn't make one much more up front 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.440
 paired with for example mopè and me 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.720
 he really did some blatant damage 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.150
 there is a player who made type 2 goals a 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.780
 really scary game very fast 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.270
 very agile dribbling 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.490
 a mind-boggling I'm going to say killer 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.260
 I don't know why four-star skill 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.450
 jorge so low so it always attacks 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.820
 a good pass with a striker 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.990
 so he also does lots of assists 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.810
 this in my opinion is the attacker 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.419
 perfect the best bronze striker 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.310
 of the game mark it try it because 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.139
 it is really worth trying them in 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.270
 this team that doesn't cost much anymore 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.310
 from time to time it only guarantees you practically 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.760
 victory as I said before I took a 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.740
 only goals in 34 games I did and ne 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.660
 I really did at least three per game 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.280
 so to make you understand kids there 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.290
 team and try this because you don't 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.580
 you will regret it absolutely as always 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.210
 invites you to leave a nice like for 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.390
 this team 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.530
 I would like to receive 400 I like it there 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.450
