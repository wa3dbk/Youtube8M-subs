00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.539
 young fashion what's up for you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
 this summer will be damn hot 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.349
 and my first will be fitting for that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.329
 wash properly designed on t shirts 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.400
 Pullis kÃ¤ppis and what's more 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.320
 give will come naturally 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.720
 my new series is worth the designs 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 of course in different colors 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.769
 for girls' boys everything for you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 I'm not going to get really forward 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.190
 if I'm going to gamescom right now 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.660
 to put sheep online so if 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.370
 Of course, really fresh if you are 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.750
 there was something else and you could gamescom 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.399
 I do not know exactly how 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.320
 might only make it to black ops 3 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.879
 Of course I am currently working on beta 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.469
 nexus design still to the partner 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.090
 matching font and the right one 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.920
 but when we're done, stahel 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.960
 the hammer look awesome and then you can 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 Take a look around the shop and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.050
 so on might a bit rummage if 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 Of course what happens for you? 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.140
 is and if you then look something out there 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 But hopefully I'll send it to me 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.160
 of which a small photo on facebook to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.660
 how you have the things or wear 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.210
 So I'll let you know what 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.800
 things are yours and whether the star through 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.690
 like it and so on so I can 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.460
 get small feedback as the stuff 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.349
 Of course we like that too 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 very important but as said once the 

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:23.160
 I let you go things mobile online 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.300
 that via facebook or youtube erni too 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.220
 come and then you can go there 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.660
 look around a bit and come now 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.030
 Let's start with the black ops three 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.649
 Weapons improve every weapon for everyone 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.270
 of course you had one 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.410
 small weak spot and the try 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.660
 we herewith with the improvements 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.390
 or right to sit up 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.950
 improve with the assault rifle ak 7 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.690
 Let's start and see how you see yourself 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.940
 This storm rifle has a lot 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.190
 high rate of fire and the damage is too 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.020
 okay but that's the range and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.569
 the accuracy is not so the Bernese 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.550
 but we expose you with the right ones 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.929
 like the long run and very handy 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.080
 can mend well 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.970
 at the second assault rifle the hv k30 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.399
 again with a very high 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.619
 firing rate but look at it 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.369
 please the damage and the range 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.110
 the weapon 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.030
 if you do not have a lot of the weapon 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.009
 on board is as good as useless 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.050
 I'll say it better with the train , for example 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.390
 at least I do not equip it 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.580
 hurt something increase red dot sight 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.260
 I was able to tour and especially the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.390
 full moon in the floor at least that's me 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.530
 get some power in the weapon and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.299
 I need the bay, I think 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.129
 not to mention that I do as well 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.650
 them on every assault rifle on it the 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.150
 opinion 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.920
 on the other hand, it is quite a whole again 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.510
 other caliber because the points rather very 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.189
 I think it is balanced 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.739
 weapon playable for everyone and indeed 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.750
 with the quickfire on and the 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.519
 red dot is the right choice 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.019
 monster can do but I would 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.459
 In any case recommend the fast fire 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.180
 to the fire rate a bit too 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.890
 improve 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.930
 yes the next assault rifle, the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.579
 chihuahua where the firewheel of times like that 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.290
 clear from the killers bringing them fast 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.970
 I would say fire around the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.560
 I think we do not need any harm 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.659
 to make sure that in any case 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.299
 Order the fig with the red dot as you 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.040
 so equipped a lot so 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.540
 I would also wear it properly 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.970
 because then maybe the long 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.739
 Run for bigger march and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.720
 then the hare runs where I have to say 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.400
 for me who she was rather nothing so 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.230
 I just hate the trigger but I 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.700
 she'll test for you before beta 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.739
 and then we'll see if they are 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.720
 really how many say the potential 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.060
 has the best weapon to be where we are 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 already allowed to talk about the best weapons 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.290
 of course the xr two boers do not weapon 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.389
 by the way, they are still bad 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.739
 strong with the high fire rate and the 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.120
 high damage but maybe they will 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.290
 the whole thing in the weapon one more 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.819
 patch a bit until the beet 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.389
 Otherwise , she seems to come out sooner 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.430
 strongly 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.169
 if you then still with the red dot 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.329
 fast before long run and bay 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.099
 to equip for example would be faith 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.019
 I as good as unstoppable but that 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.639
 were now all first storm rifles 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.569
 the alpha version at the next video 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.680
 Maybe we could all then 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.540
 shotguns or machine guns 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 go through and of course to the small ones 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.260
 subtleties and go north 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.329
 to suggest a little bit of improvement 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.769
 and what you put up for it dead on 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.900
 In any case, we'll see each other next 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.629
 times when it is there now at the start for 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.430
 you definitely want to rate more 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.530
 comments writes in the comments 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.639
 what purely you equip the weapons 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.290
 I would definitely go 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.699
 So my friends are interesting tomorrow 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.680
 First comes the zombie reveal trailer 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:11.909
 See you in the next video 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.909
 see you soon
