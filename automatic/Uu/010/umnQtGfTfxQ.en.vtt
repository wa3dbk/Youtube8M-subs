00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:18.299
 matches and saint tropez mergoud 13 years old 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:24.400
 you need an ex machina good position for 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:31.300
 victory for france is very difficult 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:34.890
 because it turns form animatis yes one of 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:40.270
 prat that I like at check viewing 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:50.040

 european nicolas prost all the tests 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.910
 we know them now it's true that 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.110
 in general we like to see especially 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.390
 how they serve the saddle as soon as 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.040
 the warm up so it's true that we 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.420
 still waiting for a good twenty or so 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.310
 minutes to fill 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.560
 that said, the advantage now of 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.600
 the internet is that we put ourselves on 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.010
 youtube as you type the name of the 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.440
 player and we fall directly on these 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.940
 matches so me it happens to me 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.500
 pro tour to do it is there that's what 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.730

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.380

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.610
 gallas all know is not already 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.400

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.070
 I will watch 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.540
 here I am watching on youtube one of 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.850
 these matches is hired including 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.510
 and then to see how it serves to 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:17.110
 already tried to know how I'm going 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.100
 I serve on him where he looks embarrassed 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.840
 it's small details it's surely 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.070
 on the service delivered yeah that's 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.590
 always on service delivery of any 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.540
 way after in the game say that type 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.590
 which is 200 world or 10 world when 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.110
 there is an easy ball to play it is 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.280
 able to gain the point on end all 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.780
 the world is able to play hard on 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.400
 this one ball so it's really a 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.740
 service delivered what it plays and we know 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.240
 especially on Czech players who 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.950
 are reputed not very good service like 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.380
 he puts himself very good in the game that if we 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.520
 dominates this part there normally we have 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.420
 often had the initiative of the game is 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.420
 necessarily 7 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.379
