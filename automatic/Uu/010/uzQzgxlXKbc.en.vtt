00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
Flynn so you're like a bee why is this
on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> worst<00:01:26.400> list<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> enjoyed<00:01:27.240> reading

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
on the worst list if you enjoyed reading

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
on the worst list if you enjoyed reading
it<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:27.840> gonna<00:01:28.080> say<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.920> would

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it I'm gonna say it's because I would

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
it I'm gonna say it's because I would
never<00:01:29.490> read<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.180> book<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.840> this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
never read this book and I think this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.109 
never read this book and I think this
book<00:01:31.140> has<00:01:31.350> zero<00:01:31.770> reread<00:01:32.310> value<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
book has zero reread value and that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.609 
book has zero reread value and that
makes<00:01:33.270> me<00:01:33.420> annoyed<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.140> liked<00:01:34.409> reading

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
makes me annoyed because I liked reading

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.440 
makes me annoyed because I liked reading
it<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:34.829> much<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.369> time<00:01:35.640> also<00:01:36.060> about

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it so much the first time also about

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.580 
it so much the first time also about
this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.930> thought<00:01:37.079> there<00:01:37.229> was<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.470> good

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
this is I thought there was one good

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.899 
this is I thought there was one good
twist<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> after<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.790> nothing

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
twist and after that really nothing

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
twist and after that really nothing
exciting<00:01:39.420> happened<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.229> most<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
exciting happened and that was most of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
exciting happened and that was most of
the<00:01:40.829> book<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.450> felt<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the book so I kind of felt like this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.389 
the book so I kind of felt like this
book<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> waste<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> time<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.130> mean<00:01:44.369> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
book was a waste of time I mean I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
book was a waste of time I mean I
enjoyed<00:01:44.790> reading<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.450> thrilling<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
enjoyed reading it was thrilling and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
enjoyed reading it was thrilling and
exciting<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.950> ending<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
exciting but the ending was so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569 
exciting but the ending was so
disappointing<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.799> little<00:01:50.100> seemed<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
disappointing and so little seemed to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
disappointing and so little seemed to
happen<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.149> book<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> made<00:01:51.930> me<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.290> mad
