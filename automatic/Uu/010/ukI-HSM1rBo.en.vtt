00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.910
 especially welcome to such a small photo editing sociologist 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.290
 their quality Photoshop but inside 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.249
 Photoshop and Lightroom 3 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:10.809
 also for autumn pictures 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.730
 and lots of pictures, the colors are not always exactly like you 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.509
 maybe imagine or how he would like them 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.169
 by various things stop especially by percent by not that 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.869
 rudder 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.249
 wrong light 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.279
 just outside 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.710
 and pay attention to the fact that always extremely Bavarian also have a relatively pale 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.860
 Ruland percent but look so ugly 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.120
 You can see that in the picture here 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.200
 that the original I did 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.830
 the light was not so nice the colors are not that 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.990
 so strong 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.690
 and I want to show how in this picture 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.579
 around 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.310
 to bring to these 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.080
 by how many degrees in all colors rather have shades 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.950
 to have the same picture what Johannes input will buy it has 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.000
 need to do min for no longer know what else 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.010
 and percent 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.680
 Yes, through that may show sometimes 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.740
 jump that is what original 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.330
 went into development 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.460
 So Engine has developed her above 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.920
 and if the color temperature is the Michelle's not cold No the blue tones 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.780
 You can see that up here in the sky, too 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.259
 and I would suggest he take a slightly warmer driver 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.979
 Uru easy to enter in the 5000 around percent 5100 approximately 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.660
 up to a maximum of 5500 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.780
 yes that will be too much else 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.190
 Percent the tint can let the rock band the row 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.140
 but also to emphasize the green a bit more 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.259
 in their bit in the green area at -1 or - new since 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.689
 and the green to ten percent of the cases extreme I stay at minus 1 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.280
 for not so good the exposure 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 the tint 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.400
 and the next step is the exposure 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.350
 percent 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 I just play around a room a bit 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.520
 But as I said, I am not a project or other photo editing program 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.330
 Do not you try to get on well and I think so 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.099
 Results are not so bad now 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.430
 or we could say we could be small here 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.919
 go up with the glory newcomer 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.799
 a fifth easily 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.559
 then inflict the most striking on criminals 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.039
 That's what makes the whole education look a bit off of me in fact 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.130
 Percent the black levels let through because people too 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.989
 they are beautiful, of course 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.549
 around the contrast 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.549
 the majority have so far only on 32 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.349
 and then you would be working a presence here and that clarity 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.239
 stomp slightly up to about 30 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.539
 Jannik at the better so simply beautiful and better to recognize 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.389
 Dynamics by not so much then then change percent because that's just 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.669
 also generally too much w is the OXSEED 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.260
 "Maybe I just want to join 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.930
 Yes 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.979
 I know what every area is 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:09.829
 Percent saturation do not do much to get up right away or something 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.399
 the judgment too extreme 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.649
 yes i would definitely put the lights so out of the sky 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.699
 a little bit of Bremen 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.790
 so gets the old one so far could raced into the picture 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.970
 because some as good a year Nakowitz does not like him but better 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.289
 Dieter Egner 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.849
 Percent the brighter midrange 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.709
 he reinforces himself a bit 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.109
 that is from every shipment really nice percent full light on the 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:35.930
 Leaves fall 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.600
 in darker midrange darken a bit so is in the background 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.770
 Little Donkey and Diddy you can really focus more on what's in focus 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.459
 is focus 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.359
 and sees the deep ones 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.359
 I would say 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.839
 they just let 0 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:56.039
 that's quite reasonable from that 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.429
 so now we are here in those 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:02.909
 the color settings 2 hue saturation so approach from by Mixa 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.639
 appointed 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.129
 I do not want another story, which his country has a moral one 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.719
 do not turn up a bit higher 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.719
 of course you look at that settlements 2 of course 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:15.870
 + 2 30 approximately 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.049
 the possibility of caring 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.169
 to be honest in yellow clearly 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.749
 lecturers 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:24.430
 little 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.909
 Take out a bit 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.039
 - - 11 in the company in India percent 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.770
 the front weather is a bit too yellowish 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 I really like green and everything else quite well 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.819
 Percent then again at the Luminale twelve evenings should be brightness 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.169
 experience 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.569
 work a bit 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.059
 want the green 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:47.059
 who are still a bit darker 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.610
 that fits that fits already - 20 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.080
 that means you do not edit the next one 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.039
 but 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.280
 Percent I will 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.309
 Picture a bit more sleep in some places 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:01.960
 Leifeld military is not quite so 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.310
 Of course, the SUV sharper or that to the area jokes Essene Corner grains 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.310
 or so that such a big Cologne fair picture so to speak 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.499
 it does not always look nice to watch them 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.089
 extremely her Cher 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.089
 im of course, when photographing on the why pay attention 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.059
 in this case old with after 402 here so photographed 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.330
 what also Mario's 500 hp 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.029
 Stone churches of which is tiger warden 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.559
 not too much noise 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.559
 but in any case, which topic 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.490
 You can never avoid that as a team 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.759
 I would Anna Rauschreduzierung a bit to the 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.719
 No, the detailist working a bit that is mostly just about the players 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.919
 I do not really know 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.050
 but 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.319
 percent 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.129
 So I went out of it quite well 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.499
 Actually, I think that's pretty nice 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:57.169
 To have a vignette 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.519
 that is a bit present if percent of people space 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.650
 percent 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.289
 yes, I would interview you 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.289
 work it out a little bit more 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.909
 Blindness makes the focus and the mentors look a little better 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.189
 personally 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.629
 Of course, that was not too extreme - four five might say 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.159
 an extremely soft knee 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.759
 do not give a grade 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.400
 around the age of 56 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.969
 and 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.449
 I guess I like that quite well that it and he does not 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.249
 quite as extreme the picture I did before 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:35.249
 but a bit Mr long still 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.759
 yes that's it 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.759
 what already had what was done before 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.990
 now what i have ever done 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.669
 Top ten still on you could maybe get 4 percent a bit more 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.249
 Darken the darker midrange 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.639
 Come on, the thing is pretty close 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.560
 around 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.889
 yes that comes very close to him 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.230
 Su um, yes, I'll probably have a few more to so Reetz for Algeria 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.710
 for Hofstetter they were sorry 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.710
 and now the video is celebrated the valet conjured up mosquitoes thumbs up 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.720
 He commented on whether you make such a safe haven more and thus that 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.680
 you revised it 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.850
 and the BA are also uploaded to Bonds on Flickr to find the 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.850
 Link in the cradle Description of Sam Fleck Austrian 

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:25.300
 Dalan he 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.300
 or at the moment I'll get my balls up 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.559
 yes, there did not work outward 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:34.169
 Turn and around 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.139
 Vattenfall says the tree is high but would not be bad if you go to 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:38.899
 to clean up 

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:39.989
 until the next stop smarter
