poor damage per shot I would use

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
poor damage per shot I would use
definitely<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> damage<00:02:00.960> mod<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> would<00:02:01.560> also

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
definitely a damage mod and I would also

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.770 
definitely a damage mod and I would also
probably<00:02:02.070> use<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> scope<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.030> weapon<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
probably use a scope with this weapon it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
probably use a scope with this weapon it
really<00:02:03.990> doesn't<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.409> significant<00:02:05.100> recoil

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
really doesn't have significant recoil

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.749 
really doesn't have significant recoil
that<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> would<00:02:05.909> feel<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.930> use<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that I would feel the need to use a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.300 
that I would feel the need to use a
a<00:02:08.819> stability<00:02:09.629> damper<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.379> mean<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
a stability damper I mean if you have a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.429 
a stability damper I mean if you have a
lot<00:02:11.519> of<00:02:11.549> trouble<00:02:11.879> handling<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.599> recoil<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
lot of trouble handling the recoil and

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.940 
lot of trouble handling the recoil and
the<00:02:13.560> kick<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:14.489> for<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.390> myself<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:16.170> prefer

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the kick go for it but myself I prefer

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.710 
the kick go for it but myself I prefer
to<00:02:17.189> use<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.430> weapon<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.849> longer<00:02:18.120> ranges<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
to use this weapon and longer ranges and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.740 
to use this weapon and longer ranges and
would<00:02:18.930> prefer<00:02:19.079> going<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.790> scope<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.299> have

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
would prefer going with the scope I have

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.470 
would prefer going with the scope I have
tested<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.640> piercing<00:02:23.640> mods<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
tested out the piercing mods and the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.699 
tested out the piercing mods and the
piercing<00:02:24.780> mods<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.230> only<00:02:25.349> seem<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> be

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
piercing mods really only seem to be

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.440 
piercing mods really only seem to be
worthwhile<00:02:25.920> at<00:02:26.459> least<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.760> insanity<00:02:27.000> if<00:02:27.329> you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
worthwhile at least on insanity if you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.020 
worthwhile at least on insanity if you
really<00:02:27.720> like<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:28.799> through<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.760> shooting

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
really like going through and shooting

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.280 
really like going through and shooting
through<00:02:30.209> cover<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:30.930> shooting<00:02:31.140> through

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
through cover you like shooting through

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.869 
through cover you like shooting through
cover<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.769> for<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.129> I<00:02:32.220> personally<00:02:32.730> feel<00:02:32.819> that

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
cover go for it I personally feel that

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.250 
cover go for it I personally feel that
that's<00:02:33.060> more<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> gimmick<00:02:33.750> than<00:02:33.900> anything

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's more of a gimmick than anything

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.869 
that's more of a gimmick than anything
if<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:34.950> love<00:02:35.129> shooting<00:02:35.280> through<00:02:35.489> cover<00:02:35.670> go

if you love shooting through cover go

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.240 
if you love shooting through cover go
for<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.239> as<00:02:36.329> far<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.109> ignores<00:02:37.470> defenses<00:02:38.040> it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
for it as far as the ignores defenses it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.220 
for it as far as the ignores defenses it
has<00:02:38.700> its<00:02:38.879> uses<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.239> personally<00:02:40.019> I'd<00:02:40.200> rather

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
has its uses but personally I'd rather

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.300 
has its uses but personally I'd rather
just<00:02:40.829> go<00:02:41.099> with<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.970> damaged<00:02:42.390> body<00:02:43.310> increase

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
just go with a damaged body increase

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.589 
just go with a damaged body increase
rounds<00:02:44.549> per<00:02:44.640> magazine<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.209> thing<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.540> believe

rounds per magazine this thing I believe

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.599 
rounds per magazine this thing I believe
has<00:02:45.989> 30<00:02:46.260> rounds<00:02:46.530> per<00:02:46.620> magazine<00:02:46.739> generally

has 30 rounds per magazine generally
speaking<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.970> does<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.510> job<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.019> it

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
speaking that does the job and it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.899 
speaking that does the job and it
reloads<00:02:49.530> extremely<00:02:50.099> quickly<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.519> don't<00:02:50.819> really

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
reloads extremely quickly I don't really

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.849 
reloads extremely quickly I don't really
feel<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.180> that's<00:02:51.389> necessary<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.470> again<00:02:52.709> I

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
feel that that's necessary so again I

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.920 
feel that that's necessary so again I
would<00:02:53.129> go<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.280> damage<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.239> scope<00:02:54.480> but

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
would go with damage and a scope but

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.300 
would go with damage and a scope but
your<00:02:55.079> mileage<00:02:55.260> may<00:02:55.470> vary<00:02:57.950> let<00:02:58.950> us<00:02:59.069> actually

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
your mileage may vary let us actually

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.149 
your mileage may vary let us actually
keep<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.599> let<00:03:01.019> us<00:03:01.139> randomly<00:03:01.530> shoot<00:03:01.859> I<00:03:02.010> need

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
keep it and let us randomly shoot I need

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.839 
keep it and let us randomly shoot I need
to<00:03:02.280> configure<00:03:02.549> my<00:03:03.090> keyboard<00:03:03.680> alright<00:03:04.849> so

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
to configure my keyboard alright so

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.680 
to configure my keyboard alright so
again<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.359> is<00:03:06.510> insanity<00:03:08.420> alright<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.510> let's

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
again this is insanity alright so let's

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.720 
again this is insanity alright so let's
try<00:03:09.780> out<00:03:09.840> some<00:03:09.989> live<00:03:10.139> combat<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:11.609> know<00:03:11.670> I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
try out some live combat you know I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.360 
try out some live combat you know I
mentioned<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.480> my<00:03:12.859> target<00:03:13.859> practice<00:03:14.129> series

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
mentioned in my target practice series

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.589 
mentioned in my target practice series
that<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.669> really<00:03:14.910> wouldn't<00:03:15.060> recommend<00:03:15.120> using

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
that I really wouldn't recommend using

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.170 
that I really wouldn't recommend using
this<00:03:15.810> weapon<00:03:16.019> after<00:03:16.889> finding<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.549> face<00:03:17.910> then

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
this weapon after finding the face then

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.970 
this weapon after finding the face then
after<00:03:18.750> finding<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.049> guest<00:03:19.290> pulse<00:03:19.530> rifle<00:03:19.889> and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
after finding the guest pulse rifle and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.470 
after finding the guest pulse rifle and
I<00:03:20.010> still<00:03:20.250> do<00:03:20.400> stand<00:03:20.760> by<00:03:20.819> that<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.180> an<00:03:21.239> extent

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
I still do stand by that to an extent

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.839 
I still do stand by that to an extent
but<00:03:22.199> you<00:03:22.799> know<00:03:22.919> it<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.129> a<00:03:23.459> great<00:03:23.699> all-around

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
but you know it is a great all-around

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.699 
but you know it is a great all-around
weapon<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.449> reloads<00:03:24.720> quickly<00:03:25.139> does<00:03:25.349> solid

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
on my engineer it might seem that way

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.009 
on my engineer it might seem that way
from<00:03:38.430> these<00:03:38.609> videos<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.239> if<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.870> actually

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.289 

mere<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:05.799> so<00:04:06.799> as<00:04:06.889> you<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.129> see<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.370> mean<00:04:07.549> it

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
mere you so as you can see I mean it

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.849 
mere you so as you can see I mean it
doesn't<00:04:08.540> do<00:04:08.599> great<00:04:08.930> damage<00:04:09.109> especially<00:04:09.439> you

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
doesn't do great damage especially you

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.990

know unmod at level one no ammo power
but<00:04:14.480> then<00:04:14.900> again<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.469> doesn't<00:04:15.739> weigh<00:04:15.920> very

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
but then again it doesn't weigh very

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.999 
but then again it doesn't weigh very
much<00:04:16.190> for<00:04:16.789> an<00:04:16.850> assault<00:04:17.060> rifle<00:04:20.349> and<00:04:21.349> it's<00:04:21.769> just

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
much for an assault rifle and it's just

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.370 
much for an assault rifle and it's just
I<00:04:22.070> mean<00:04:22.099> it's<00:04:22.340> effective<00:04:22.729> at<00:04:22.849> any<00:04:22.970> range<00:04:23.380> for

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
I mean it's effective at any range for

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.700 
I mean it's effective at any range for
the<00:04:24.470> most<00:04:24.620> part<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:25.449> hate<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.630> stupid<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:27.349> don't

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.990 
the most part I hate the stupid I don't
know<00:04:27.770> if<00:04:27.889> it's<00:04:28.009> a<00:04:28.070> bug<00:04:28.280> where<00:04:28.669> they<00:04:28.820> just

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
know if it's a bug where they just

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.790 
know if it's a bug where they just
randomly<00:04:29.330> have<00:04:30.520> armor<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.639> front<00:04:31.849> of<00:04:31.940> them<00:04:32.090> or

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
randomly have armor in front of them or

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.040 
randomly have armor in front of them or
what<00:04:33.800> but<00:04:33.949> it's<00:04:34.070> really<00:04:34.190> annoying<00:04:34.520> oh<00:04:38.050> that's

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
what but it's really annoying oh that's

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:48.820 
what but it's really annoying oh that's
closer<00:04:39.650> than<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.949> expected

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:05:01.350 

this<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.979> getting<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.250> little<00:04:50.280> annoying<00:04:50.669> no

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.729 

this<00:05:02.360> want<00:05:02.569> to<00:05:02.629> clear<00:05:02.839> a<00:05:02.869> few<00:05:03.139> of<00:05:03.259> them<00:05:03.379> out<00:05:03.469> so

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:03.739 
this want to clear a few of them out so

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:06.009 
this want to clear a few of them out so
I<00:05:03.769> can<00:05:03.889> hopefully<00:05:04.249> hit<00:05:05.089> to<00:05:05.179> the<00:05:05.269> Centurion<00:05:05.899> at

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:06.019 
I can hopefully hit to the Centurion at

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:12.059 
I can hopefully hit to the Centurion at
the<00:05:06.139> end<00:05:06.259> but<00:05:07.129> that's<00:05:07.309> proving<00:05:07.579> difficult<00:05:07.849> I

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.699 

don't<00:05:13.069> think<00:05:13.099> it's<00:05:13.279> going<00:05:13.369> to<00:05:13.429> happen

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:14.709 
don't think it's going to happen

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
somebody would just drop some mo I think

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.810 
somebody would just drop some mo I think
I<00:05:35.330> might<00:05:35.510> see<00:05:35.780> some<00:05:36.160> less<00:05:37.160> that's<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.460> grenade

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:50.530
