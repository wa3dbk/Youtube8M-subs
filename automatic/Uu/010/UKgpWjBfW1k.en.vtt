00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.760 

so<00:02:40.340> as<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.550> can<00:02:40.700> see<00:02:40.910> here

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
so as you can see here

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.950 
so as you can see here
I've<00:02:43.250> been<00:02:43.550> shooting<00:02:43.940> people<00:02:44.450> at<00:02:44.540> medium<00:02:44.840> to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
I've been shooting people at medium to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.650 
I've been shooting people at medium to
long<00:02:45.140> range<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.770> ran<00:02:45.950> out<00:02:46.070> mo<00:02:46.400> and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
long range and I just ran out mo and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.580 
long range and I just ran out mo and
there's<00:02:47.660> no<00:02:47.870> mo<00:02:48.320> refill<00:02:48.740> station<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.610> that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
there's no mo refill station so that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.990 
there's no mo refill station so that
made<00:02:51.590> me<00:02:51.740> pretty<00:02:51.980> much<00:02:52.160> decide<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.790> just

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
made me pretty much decide that I just

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.990 
made me pretty much decide that I just
needed<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.390> go<00:02:53.830> make<00:02:54.830> myself<00:02:55.010> die<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:55.790> get

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
needed to go make myself die and get

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.420 
needed to go make myself die and get
aggressive<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.410> went<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:57.980> knocked<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.280> guy

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
aggressive so I went and knocked a guy

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.610 
aggressive so I went and knocked a guy
in<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.670> face<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.510> face<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.960> his<00:03:00.320> buddy

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
in a face in the face and his buddy

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.450 
in a face in the face and his buddy
killed<00:03:00.860> me<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:02.300> now<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.780> got<00:03:03.110> more<00:03:03.320> ammo<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:04.130> I

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
killed me so now I got more ammo and I

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.210 
killed me so now I got more ammo and I
fulfilled<00:03:04.910> my<00:03:05.030> goal

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
fulfilled my goal

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.770 
fulfilled my goal
so<00:03:08.220> what<00:03:08.370> does<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.549> mean<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.790> means<00:03:09.060> more

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
so what does that mean that means more

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.440 
so what does that mean that means more
medium<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.500> long<00:03:10.680> range<00:03:10.709> engagements<00:03:11.450> which

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
medium to long range engagements which

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.070 
medium to long range engagements which
is<00:03:12.599> what<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.810> Excel<00:03:13.230> it

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.750 

so<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.740> can<00:03:18.830> see<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.160> i'm<00:03:19.280> using<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
so you can see here i'm using the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.050 
so you can see here i'm using the
technicians<00:03:20.450> radar<00:03:21.110> i<00:03:21.670> think<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:22.760> called<00:03:22.850> a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
technicians radar i think it's called a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.000 
technicians radar i think it's called a
recon<00:03:23.570> ability

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
recon ability

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.979 
recon ability
and<00:03:26.220> I've<00:03:26.790> already<00:03:26.939> I've<00:03:27.299> already<00:03:27.569> pretty

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
and I've already I've already pretty

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.330 
and I've already I've already pretty
much<00:03:28.170> explained<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.799> previous<00:03:28.950> videos

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
much explained that in previous videos

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.690 
much explained that in previous videos
so<00:03:29.730> watch<00:03:29.970> this<00:03:30.120> by<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.390> way<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:31.519> thought<00:03:32.519> on

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
so watch this by the way I thought on

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.039 
so watch this by the way I thought on
the<00:03:32.819> stairs<00:03:33.030> first<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.450> all<00:03:33.569> trying<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.840> kill

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
the stairs first of all trying to kill

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.300 
the stairs first of all trying to kill
that<00:03:34.170> guy<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.590> then<00:03:35.540> after<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.599> engage<00:03:37.290> him<00:03:37.709> he

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
that guy and then after I engage him he

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.819 
that guy and then after I engage him he
leaves<00:03:38.640> for<00:03:38.879> some<00:03:39.239> reason<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.780> don't<00:03:40.319> know<00:03:40.560> if

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
leaves for some reason I don't know if

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.170 
leaves for some reason I don't know if
he<00:03:41.040> left<00:03:41.939> because<00:03:42.150> he<00:03:42.360> didn't<00:03:42.690> want<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.930> die<00:03:43.140> or

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
he left because he didn't want to die or

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.940 
he left because he didn't want to die or
maybe<00:03:45.180> he<00:03:45.360> was<00:03:45.390> getting<00:03:45.720> frustrated<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:46.560> he

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
maybe he was getting frustrated but he

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.390 
maybe he was getting frustrated but he
just<00:03:47.190> he<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:48.750> confused<00:03:49.290> me<00:03:49.379> in<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> game<00:03:49.860> at

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
just he it confused me in the game at

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.009 
just he it confused me in the game at
first<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:51.030> was<00:03:51.150> like<00:03:51.209> where<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.659> heck<00:03:51.840> did<00:03:51.870> he

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
first I was like where the heck did he

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.059 
first I was like where the heck did he
go<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:53.750> then<00:03:54.750> after<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.349> realized<00:03:55.680> that

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
go but then after that I realized that

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.660 
go but then after that I realized that
he<00:03:56.159> left<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.519> game<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:59.069> know<00:03:59.190> that's

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
he left the game so you know that's

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:08.650 
he left the game so you know that's
interesting

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.770 

so<00:04:09.230> basically<00:04:09.740> i'm<00:04:09.920> using<00:04:10.430> i<00:04:10.670> really<00:04:11.270> like<00:04:11.450> the

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
so basically i'm using i really like the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.700 
so basically i'm using i really like the
technicians<00:04:12.560> recon<00:04:13.340> ability

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
technicians recon ability

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.250 
technicians recon ability
and<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.370> use<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.580> to<00:04:16.000> help<00:04:16.120> me<00:04:16.300> find<00:04:16.600> targets

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
and I use that to help me find targets

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.099 
and I use that to help me find targets
and<00:04:17.500> then<00:04:17.910> I

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
and then I

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.150 
and then I
take<00:04:19.769> him<00:04:19.889> up

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
take him up

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.450 
take him up
preferably<00:04:22.030> at<00:04:22.210> medium<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.720> long<00:04:22.870> range

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
preferably at medium to long range

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.530 
preferably at medium to long range
another<00:04:24.460> good<00:04:24.670> thing<00:04:24.730> about<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.180> recount

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
another good thing about the recount

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.690 
another good thing about the recount
abilities<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.170> alert<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.650> alerts<00:04:27.010> me<00:04:27.160> on<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
abilities that alert it alerts me on the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.570 
abilities that alert it alerts me on the
mini-map<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:29.110> let<00:04:29.380> me<00:04:29.530> know<00:04:29.740> if<00:04:29.980> enemies<00:04:30.430> are

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
mini-map to let me know if enemies are

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.660 
mini-map to let me know if enemies are
close<00:04:30.610> by<00:04:31.150> which<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.290> can<00:04:32.320> see<00:04:32.470> there<00:04:32.920> they're

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
close by which you can see there they're

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.170
