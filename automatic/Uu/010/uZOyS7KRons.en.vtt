00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.889
 we know that motivation plays a 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.690
 crucial role in the commitment and 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.330
 students' academic success 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.189
 many factors come from 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.500
 the school environment of 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.200
 interventions by teachers and 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.989
 quality of the relationship between this and 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.899
 their students who contribute and act 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.090
 about student motivation when 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.820
 this study of teachers had to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.460
 indicate their perception of their own 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.280
 ability to motivate two types of students 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.530
 those who love school and those who do not 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.720
 do not like it if all the teachers get 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.460
 declare rather perfectly capable of 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.220
 motivate students who love school 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 a relatively large proportion 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.470
 of these acknowledges being more or less 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.950
 able to motivate those who do not like 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.950
 school 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.170
 according to teachers the use of 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.260
 some strategies like punishment 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.420
 and the positive emulation given in 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.909
 example a student who is doing well by 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.670
 example has little effect on motivation 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.130
 students who like school but are 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.740
 harmful to that of students who do not 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.500
 do not like this finding suggests that these 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.450
 students are posieux teachers more 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.580
 vulnerable and motivated 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.070
 more fragile than others 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.500
 here are among the eight categories of 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.390
 strategies used by teachers 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.150
 to keep students interested 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.970
 which according to the pupils and 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.220
 teachers are the most winning the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.520
 valorization of efforts 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.930
 reward use promotion 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.280
 autonomy and stimulation 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.140
 cognitive the positive emulation the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.360
 mastery of learning and the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.460
 cooperation 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.430
 use of punishment the use 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.280
 of congratulations the negative emulation 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.409
 students in addition to identifying the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.810
 most motivational strategies 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.759
 promising were to respond to a 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.830
 questionnaire on their profile 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.349
 motivational in French and in 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.540
 mathematics and share their 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.000
 perception of the support received from their 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.819
 teachers their appreciations of 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.540
 the school and how easy it is to evolve 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.980
 it appears from the motivation profile 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.680
 she that sense of efficiency 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.900
 student personal value 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.569
 granted to matter and buses 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.090
 are lower in 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.390
 older than in older students 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.629
 youth 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.269
 for the support received 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.970
 students who say they like school feel 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.400
 receive more support from 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.450
 of their teachers than those who say 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.909
 do not like him 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.829
 it also seems that more students 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.680
 advance in their school career 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.409
 - they say they have the facility to 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.930
 the school and the less he is ready if this one 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.209
 all this can help to make 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.639
 actually the task of supporting 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.919
 the pupil more difficult to perceive by 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.900
 students and exercised by the 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.120
 teachers in the classrooms 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.239
 old finally it appears that those 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.579
 who count even more than judgment 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.620
 of the student on the usefulness of strategies 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.220
 that the teacher use hello 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.439
 maxim is the student's perception of 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.980
 the quality of the relationship with his 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.980
 teacher
