00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
that right now oh and finally Sam does

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.959 
that right now oh and finally Sam does
ask<00:06:08.719> how<00:06:08.990> much<00:06:09.110> would<00:06:09.349> it<00:06:09.379> be<00:06:09.589> I<00:06:09.860> think<00:06:10.819> they

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
ask how much would it be I think they

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.490 
ask how much would it be I think they
would<00:06:11.120> keep<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.479> same<00:06:11.689> price<00:06:11.930> or<00:06:12.229> either

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
would keep the same price or either

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.189 
would keep the same price or either
raise<00:06:12.860> it<00:06:13.039> to<00:06:13.219> maybe<00:06:13.370> 350<00:06:14.029> but<00:06:14.900> I<00:06:14.930> don't<00:06:15.139> think

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
raise it to maybe 350 but I don't think

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.719 
raise it to maybe 350 but I don't think
they<00:06:15.349> really<00:06:15.469> can<00:06:15.800> afford<00:06:16.099> to<00:06:16.250> raise<00:06:16.550> the

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
they really can afford to raise the

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.909 
they really can afford to raise the
price<00:06:16.939> because<00:06:17.150> it's<00:06:17.300> ready<00:06:17.509> 329<00:06:18.139> and<00:06:18.439> i

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
price because it's ready 329 and i

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.119 
price because it's ready 329 and i
believe<00:06:18.979> the<00:06:19.310> new<00:06:19.430> Nexus<00:06:19.610> 7<00:06:20.089> is<00:06:20.210> 229<00:06:20.839> so<00:06:21.620> it's

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
believe the new Nexus 7 is 229 so it's

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.189 
believe the new Nexus 7 is 229 so it's
now<00:06:22.339> exactly<00:06:22.789> a<00:06:23.029> 100-dollar<00:06:23.750> difference

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
now exactly a 100-dollar difference

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.829 
now exactly a 100-dollar difference
which<00:06:25.039> isn't<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.610> huge<00:06:26.060> deal<00:06:26.240> to<00:06:26.479> most

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:26.839 
which isn't a huge deal to most

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.209 
which isn't a huge deal to most
consumers<00:06:27.319> so<00:06:27.409> many<00:06:27.529> people<00:06:27.800> are<00:06:27.889> willing<00:06:28.069> to

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
consumers so many people are willing to

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:29.740 
consumers so many people are willing to
pay<00:06:28.339> that<00:06:28.460> extra<00:06:28.669> one<00:06:29.089> hundred<00:06:29.300> dollars<00:06:29.569> for
