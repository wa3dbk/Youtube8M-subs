00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.140
 and we started the top 5 garages with the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.750
 pacote c6 garage that will show us 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.430
 a few very cool cars the truth 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.910
 Here we have the first East 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.970
 off-road with that green color 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.309
 gaudy this intense green that looks 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.080
 two kilometers away a 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.840
 so good there you can see 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.210
 the wheels that have them for 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.640
 roads and others not for land here 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.650

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.080
 high class already with that color 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.030
 let's say purple wine that fits 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.580
 very cool the truth a cow that does not 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.010
 has a law that is very 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.930
 some off-road wheels is something that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.780
 You have subtracted quite a few tips 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.260

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.420
 orange and two white cars that 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.400
 Well, they're pretty good, so 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.400

 race is tourism an SUV that 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.180
 It is not usually see once you have 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.189
 everybody worked that a little bit 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.380

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.939
 fat not here is where the car comes 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.280

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.180
 the exhaust pipes outside the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.680
 air collector in very cool the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 true that he the only thing that could 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.090
 put to the best would be another type of 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.709
 color there we have a karim revel then 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.890

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.500
 infinite money in me we have a car 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.060

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.049
 king that is always to be thanked in 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.360
 a garage with a green tone in order 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.680
 this garage have good variety of 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.030
 cars good variety of colors and then 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.709
 this third place has been taken thanks 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.560
 that's not thanks to that variety of 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.360
 cars of colors and other things not 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.910
 we also see there is one of was although you 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.470
 two spaces are missing but hey he has 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.489
 really liked your garage the truth 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.489
 that takes you the third 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.440
 and in the second place it arrives 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.709
 When it arrives it arrives because it reaches my 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.659
 garage ticos would not know did not know who 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.930
 give him second place forgive me the 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.690
 life but I did not decide for any one 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.940
 I did not decide on any of them, so as 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.099
 I had a space and emptiness I said 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.370
 I'm going to record mine just like that, I'll tell you 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.349
 I teach although it will not score jon vale 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.629
 I did not score on my own mole serve 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.239
 this simply let 's say it 's filling 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.129
 Okay, you can see the cars I have 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.829
 and then afterwards you in the 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.500
 comments and I will judge and you will say and if 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.950
 they are good or if they are bad but let's say 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.910
 that in the top they are not going to score, it is worth 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.880
 say the third would be the second and so 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.680
 not just as I tell you guys it's from 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.139
 stuffed and well then well take advantage and if 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.510
 you see my garage the truth is I did not know 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.729
 who to give the number two because it is 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.669

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.380

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.300
