to do more though and just give me a
minute<00:01:59.390> here<00:01:59.680> blueberries<00:02:00.680> there<00:02:00.920> we<00:02:00.979> go

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
minute here blueberries there we go

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.110 
minute here blueberries there we go
those<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:03.460> don't<00:02:04.460> think<00:02:04.640> there's<00:02:04.820> any<00:02:04.940> other

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
those I don't think there's any other

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.940 
those I don't think there's any other
usage<00:02:05.600> for<00:02:05.810> most<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.080> these<00:02:06.200> die<00:02:06.440> materials

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
usage for most of these die materials

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.130 
usage for most of these die materials
also<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.490> them<00:02:07.910> just<00:02:08.210> turning<00:02:08.570> them<00:02:08.690> into<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
also of them just turning them into the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.810 
also of them just turning them into the
dyes<00:02:09.670> least<00:02:10.670> I'm<00:02:10.820> assuming<00:02:11.300> as<00:02:11.420> much<00:02:12.820> seems

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
dyes least I'm assuming as much seems

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.730 
dyes least I'm assuming as much seems
unlikely<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.600> they<00:02:14.840> would<00:02:14.990> have<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.500> do

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
unlikely that they would have it do

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.010 
unlikely that they would have it do
other<00:02:15.950> stuff<00:02:16.250> oh<00:02:18.910> yeah<00:02:19.910> that's<00:02:20.150> why<00:02:20.630> we<00:02:20.840> gonna

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
other stuff oh yeah that's why we gonna

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.750 
other stuff oh yeah that's why we gonna
love<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.290> teal<00:02:21.890> mushroom<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.459> know<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.610> had<00:02:22.730> a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
love it teal mushroom I know I had a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.940 
love it teal mushroom I know I had a
green<00:02:23.120> mushroom<00:02:23.330> we're<00:02:23.630> on<00:02:23.720> here<00:02:23.930> somewhere

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.310 

more<00:02:27.950> blue<00:02:28.100> eyed<00:02:28.370> well<00:02:28.640> yeah<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.450> taking

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
more blue eyed well yeah this is taking

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.530 
more blue eyed well yeah this is taking
bit<00:02:30.470> too<00:02:30.560> long<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.830> I'm<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.070> gonna<00:02:31.540> start

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
bit too long so I'm just gonna start

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.449 
bit too long so I'm just gonna start
making<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.440> dyes<00:02:33.620> look<00:02:34.340> a

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
making one of that so the dyes look a

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.220 
making one of that so the dyes look a
bit<00:02:34.910> more<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.209> least<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> black<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.110> it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
bit more at least for the black that it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.430 
bit more at least for the black that it
looks<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.500> little<00:02:36.739> bit<00:02:36.950> different<00:02:37.250> from<00:02:37.489> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
looks a little bit different from the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.009 
looks a little bit different from the
from<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.470> other<00:02:39.680> from<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.790> lacking<00:02:41.420> but<00:02:41.630> most

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
from the other from the lacking but most

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:42.970 
from the other from the lacking but most
of<00:02:42.110> them<00:02:42.170> are<00:02:42.260> gonna<00:02:42.410> look<00:02:42.530> considerably

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
of them are gonna look considerably

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.800 
of them are gonna look considerably
different<00:02:43.160> cuz<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.610> goes<00:02:43.760> from<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.239> plan

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
different cuz it goes from like a plan

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.110 
different cuz it goes from like a plan
or<00:02:44.989> something<00:02:45.400> let's<00:02:46.400> see<00:02:46.519> just<00:02:46.760> put<00:02:46.940> them<00:02:47.030> on

or something let's see just put them on

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
guessing you probably combine a lamb

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.520 
guessing you probably combine a lamb
platter<00:04:13.340> with<00:04:13.730> with<00:04:14.540> white<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.990> probably<00:04:15.320> the

the<00:04:16.340> monotone<00:04:17.320> dye<00:04:18.320> colours<00:04:18.709> are<00:04:18.859> going<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.040> be

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
the monotone dye colours are going to be

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.810 
the monotone dye colours are going to be
the<00:04:19.280> main<00:04:19.760> ones<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.330> can<00:04:21.550> now<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.670> can

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
the main ones that you can now you can

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.980 
the main ones that you can now you can
combine<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.330> dads<00:04:23.480> with<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.750> should<00:04:23.870> have

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
combine of the dads with I should have

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.690 
combine of the dads with I should have
actually<00:04:24.110> bought<00:04:24.410> some<00:04:24.680> silver<00:04:25.160> dying<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.550> go

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
actually bought some silver dying to go

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.500 
actually bought some silver dying to go
and<00:04:25.820> do<00:04:26.060> that<00:04:26.090> real<00:04:26.420> quick<00:04:27.910> because<00:04:28.910> again<00:04:29.390> I'm

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
and do that real quick because again I'm

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.320 
and do that real quick because again I'm
pretty<00:04:29.780> sure<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.610> only<00:04:31.850> place<00:04:32.180> you

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
pretty sure this is the only place you

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.510 
pretty sure this is the only place you
can<00:04:32.450> get<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.980> he's<00:04:33.980> already<00:04:34.100> hurt<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.340> just

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
can get it he's already hurt you just

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.750 
can get it he's already hurt you just
there<00:04:34.910> we<00:04:34.970> go<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:36.500> he<00:04:36.860> also<00:04:37.010> sells<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.460> in<00:04:37.610> the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
there we go and he also sells it in the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.190 
there we go and he also sells it in the
actual<00:04:38.000> die<00:04:38.240> form<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.780> don't<00:04:38.930> even<00:04:39.020> have

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
actual die form so you don't even have

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.720 
actual die form so you don't even have
to<00:04:39.260> mess<00:04:39.560> around<00:04:39.680> with<00:04:41.770> with<00:04:42.770> turning<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.610> into

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
to mess around with with turning it into

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.020 
to mess around with with turning it into
the<00:04:44.860> tourney<00:04:45.860> Aidan<00:04:46.100> Oh<00:04:46.310> am<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.640> trying<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.880> say

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
the tourney Aidan Oh am I trying to say

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.730 
the tourney Aidan Oh am I trying to say
turning<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.420> into<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.870> die<00:04:48.020> with<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.560> dive

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
turning it into the die with the dive

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.550 
turning it into the die with the dive
out<00:04:48.920> so<00:04:49.130> theoretically<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:49.910> could<00:04:50.120> just<00:04:50.560> buy

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
out so theoretically you could just buy

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.350 
out so theoretically you could just buy
the<00:04:51.620> silver<00:04:52.010> die<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.520> then<00:04:52.820> actually<00:04:53.000> have

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
the silver die and then actually have

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.120 
the silver die and then actually have
access<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.780> dies<00:04:53.930> before<00:04:54.230> you<00:04:54.650> even<00:04:54.800> get<00:04:55.010> the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
access to dies before you even get the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.980 
access to dies before you even get the
dive<00:04:55.310> out<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.610> don't<00:04:55.790> think<00:04:56.090> only<00:04:56.690> our<00:04:56.840> his

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
dive out I don't think only our his

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.530 
dive out I don't think only our his
prerequisite<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:58.220> have<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.580> have<00:04:58.970> either

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
prerequisite is you have to have either

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.230 
prerequisite is you have to have either
a<00:05:00.050> die<00:05:00.470> or<00:05:01.130> an<00:05:01.400> item<00:05:01.520> used<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.880> make<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.210> I

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
a die or an item used to make that I

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.640 
a die or an item used to make that I
don't<00:05:02.510> know<00:05:02.600> how<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.810> would<00:05:03.140> get<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.380> die

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
don't know how you would get a die

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.860 
don't know how you would get a die
without<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:06.400> without<00:05:07.400> having<00:05:08.210> him<00:05:08.390> there

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
without the without having him there

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.890 
without the without having him there
like<00:05:10.650> I'm<00:05:11.100> I<00:05:11.640> far<00:05:12.180> as<00:05:12.270> I'm<00:05:12.390> aware<00:05:12.420> you<00:05:12.690> can't

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
like I'm I far as I'm aware you can't

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.200 
like I'm I far as I'm aware you can't
get<00:05:13.050> have<00:05:13.290> access<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.740> dies<00:05:13.890> on<00:05:14.340> outside<00:05:15.090> of

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
get have access to dies on outside of

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.870 
get have access to dies on outside of
this<00:05:15.330> fat<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:15.960> don't<00:05:16.110> know<00:05:16.170> so<00:05:17.070> yeah<00:05:17.610> just

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
this fat but I don't know so yeah just

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.910 
this fat but I don't know so yeah just
like<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.090> thought<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.360> can<00:05:18.510> combine<00:05:18.920> silver

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
like I thought you can combine silver

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.680 
like I thought you can combine silver
dad's<00:05:20.130> with<00:05:20.520> other<00:05:20.670> ones<00:05:20.880> oops<00:05:21.120> that's<00:05:21.390> also

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
dad's with other ones oops that's also

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.710 
dad's with other ones oops that's also
rather<00:05:22.170> monotone<00:05:22.830> color<00:05:23.100> it's<00:05:24.000> all<00:05:24.240> cool<00:05:24.570> you

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
rather monotone color it's all cool you

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.960 
rather monotone color it's all cool you
can<00:05:24.990> also<00:05:25.110> combine<00:05:25.500> certain<00:05:26.460> colors<00:05:26.730> to

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
can also combine certain colors to

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.420 
can also combine certain colors to
create<00:05:27.290> entirely<00:05:28.290> new<00:05:28.470> colors<00:05:28.890> as<00:05:29.010> opposed<00:05:29.310> to

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
create entirely new colors as opposed to

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.060 
create entirely new colors as opposed to
just<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:31.050> two<00:05:31.230> separate<00:05:31.620> colors<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:31.980> can

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
just to the two separate colors you can

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.070 
just to the two separate colors you can
make<00:05:32.220> bright<00:05:32.580> versions<00:05:33.000> of<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.210> silver<00:05:33.930> one

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
make bright versions of the silver one

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.490 
make bright versions of the silver one
so<00:05:34.610> silver<00:05:35.610> tie<00:05:35.730> is<00:05:35.790> definitely<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.300> very<00:05:36.500> very

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
so silver tie is definitely a very very

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.960 
so silver tie is definitely a very very
useful<00:05:37.710> one<00:05:38.040> doesn't<00:05:38.490> seem<00:05:38.610> like<00:05:38.730> you<00:05:38.850> can

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
useful one doesn't seem like you can

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.730 
useful one doesn't seem like you can
combine<00:05:39.360> silver<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:39.900> black<00:05:40.020> those<00:05:40.230> skin<00:05:40.560> this

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
combine silver and black those skin this

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.260 
combine silver and black those skin this
point<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:41.130> was<00:05:41.340> kind<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.580> something<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.150> was

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
point I was kind of something I was

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.610 
point I was kind of something I was
hoping<00:05:42.480> to<00:05:42.570> be<00:05:42.630> able<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.840> do<00:05:42.990> that's<00:05:43.830> very<00:05:43.980> blue

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
hoping to be able to do that's very blue

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.970 
hoping to be able to do that's very blue
now<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.860> looks<00:05:46.890> kind<00:05:47.250> of<00:05:47.340> sweeping<00:05:48.650> at<00:05:49.650> all

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
now that looks kind of sweeping at all

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.800 
now that looks kind of sweeping at all
mostly<00:05:50.250> I<00:05:50.340> considering<00:05:50.850> how<00:05:50.940> dark<00:05:51.420> the<00:05:51.630> blue

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
mostly I considering how dark the blue

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.100 
mostly I considering how dark the blue
is<00:05:51.960> it<00:05:52.080> almost<00:05:52.200> feels<00:05:52.650> like<00:05:53.840> almost<00:05:54.840> feels

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
is it almost feels like almost feels

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.700 
is it almost feels like almost feels
like<00:05:55.200> a<00:05:55.290> black<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.710> white<00:05:56.870> yeah<00:05:57.870> this<00:05:58.050> is<00:05:58.230> this

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
like a black and white yeah this is this

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.820 
like a black and white yeah this is this
is<00:05:58.920> pretty<00:05:59.100> awesome<00:05:59.840> the<00:06:00.840> skull<00:06:01.260> silver<00:06:01.560> I

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
is pretty awesome the skull silver I

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.900 
is pretty awesome the skull silver I
don't<00:06:02.010> know<00:06:02.100> how<00:06:02.250> much<00:06:02.400> that<00:06:02.430> would<00:06:02.700> really

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
don't know how much that would really

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.000 
don't know how much that would really
change<00:06:03.180> it<00:06:03.420> that<00:06:03.690> makes<00:06:04.050> it<00:06:04.170> very<00:06:04.440> bright

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
change it that makes it very bright

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.650 
change it that makes it very bright
that's<00:06:05.220> for<00:06:05.370> sure<00:06:05.490> it's<00:06:06.060> like<00:06:06.150> an<00:06:06.240> ivory

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
that's for sure it's like an ivory

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.910 
that's for sure it's like an ivory
almost<00:06:06.810> now<00:06:07.170> I<00:06:08.660> like<00:06:09.660> this<00:06:09.780> edition<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.770> lot

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
one let's stick around for more in the

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.810 
one let's stick around for more in the
future<00:06:27.630> especially<00:06:28.380> once<00:06:28.860> I<00:06:28.980> finally<00:06:29.340> get<00:06:29.760> to

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
future especially once I finally get to

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.370 
future especially once I finally get to
hard<00:06:30.120> mode<00:06:30.330> it's<00:06:30.630> going<00:06:30.990> there's<00:06:31.140> going<00:06:31.290> to<00:06:31.350> be

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
hard mode it's going there's going to be

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.230 
hard mode it's going there's going to be
a<00:06:31.650> lot<00:06:31.920> more<00:06:31.950> NPCs<00:06:32.490> that<00:06:32.670> are<00:06:32.730> unlocked<00:06:33.000> after

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
a lot more NPCs that are unlocked after

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.130 
a lot more NPCs that are unlocked after
that<00:06:33.800> so<00:06:35.330> stick<00:06:36.330> around<00:06:36.360> for<00:06:36.690> that<00:06:36.720> I'm<00:06:36.930> trying

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
that so stick around for that I'm trying

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.650 
that so stick around for that I'm trying
to<00:06:37.290> think<00:06:37.350> of<00:06:37.680> how<00:06:38.070> many<00:06:38.130> new<00:06:38.670> NPCs<00:06:39.360> I<00:06:39.480> think

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
to think of how many new NPCs I think

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.370 
to think of how many new NPCs I think
there's<00:06:39.810> still<00:06:40.820> probably<00:06:41.820> still<00:06:42.180> three<00:06:43.170> or

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
there's still probably still three or

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.640 
there's still probably still three or
four<00:06:43.710> but<00:06:43.980> I<00:06:44.040> have<00:06:44.370> left<00:06:44.700> to<00:06:44.820> do<00:06:45.030> I<00:06:45.380> think<00:06:46.380> it

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
four but I have left to do I think it

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.360 
four but I have left to do I think it
might<00:06:46.830> be<00:06:46.860> more<00:06:47.160> actually<00:06:48.650> walk<00:06:49.650> anyway<00:06:50.010> yeah

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
might be more actually walk anyway yeah

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.530 
might be more actually walk anyway yeah
so<00:06:50.940> and<00:06:52.070> if<00:06:53.070> you<00:06:53.310> enjoyed<00:06:53.820> this<00:06:53.970> video<00:06:54.120> please
