00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
this team you know win a hockey game I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.390 
this team you know win a hockey game I
think<00:01:07.140> that'll<00:01:07.380> goes<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> long<00:01:07.799> ways<00:01:08.010> towards

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
think that'll goes a long ways towards

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
think that'll goes a long ways towards
them<00:01:08.549> making<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.030> playoffs<00:01:09.210> number<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.869> but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
them making the playoffs number one but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
them making the playoffs number one but
getting<00:01:10.799> his<00:01:11.040> game<00:01:11.250> back<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.670> track<00:01:11.909> where<00:01:12.119> he

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
getting his game back on track where he

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.730 
getting his game back on track where he
needs<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
needs to be so that they can make a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950 
needs to be so that they can make a
playoff<00:01:14.010> spot<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:15.000> start<00:01:15.360> early<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
playoff spot so a good start early on is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.570

embracing he's the gosh golly gee kid
this<00:03:11.849> year<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.360> James<00:03:12.630> Reimer<00:03:12.870> was<00:03:13.140> last

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
this year like James Reimer was last

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.340 
this year like James Reimer was last
year<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.890> he<00:03:14.579> seems<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.030> where<00:03:15.690> all<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
year and he seems to be where all the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.199 
year and he seems to be where all the
pressure<00:03:16.620> around<00:03:17.010> him<00:03:17.340> seems<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.120> be

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
pressure around him seems to just be

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.720 
pressure around him seems to just be
well<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.540> water<00:03:18.810> off<00:03:19.019> his<00:03:19.230> back<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:20.579> me

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
well like water off his back and to me

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.729 
well like water off his back and to me
he<00:03:21.180> doesn't<00:03:21.299> he<00:03:21.780> looks<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.079> pressure<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
he doesn't he looks the pressure in the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.170 
he doesn't he looks the pressure in the
eye<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.160> he<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.609> goes<00:03:23.760> out<00:03:23.940> there<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
eye and he just goes out there and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.120 
eye and he just goes out there and
performs<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.260> think<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.769> more<00:03:25.950> he's

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
performs and I think the more he's

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.160 
performs and I think the more he's
getting<00:03:26.819> more<00:03:27.000> ice<00:03:27.209> time<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.780> battery's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
getting more ice time the battery's

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.530 
getting more ice time the battery's
