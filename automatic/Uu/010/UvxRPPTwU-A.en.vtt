it I took that even a step further and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.249 
it I took that even a step further and
labeled<00:01:45.899> my<00:01:46.619> worms<00:01:46.979> by<00:01:47.579> colors<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
labeled my worms by colors just so I can

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
labeled my worms by colors just so I can
make<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> little<00:01:49.649> quick<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.250> more<00:01:50.430> than<00:01:50.700> eyes

on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> water<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:52.340> like<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.579> they<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
on the water I like how they have a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.920 
on the water I like how they have a
piece<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> red<00:01:56.340> cloth<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.750> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.859 
piece of like a red cloth in here I
really<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.920> it'll<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.670> support<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
really think it'll you know support and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.069 
really think it'll you know support and
make<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.290> plastic<00:02:02.280> stronger<00:02:02.820> these<00:02:03.810> things

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
make the plastic stronger these things

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.179
