waste money on amendments or I could put

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.590 
waste money on amendments or I could put
my<00:00:20.200> garden<00:00:20.560> at<00:00:20.650> risk<00:00:20.920> to<00:00:21.700> avoid<00:00:22.000> that<00:00:22.240> I'm

away for testing when the results come
back<00:00:27.280> I'll<00:00:27.789> know<00:00:28.030> if<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.300> need<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.570> add<00:00:28.690> some

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
back I'll know if I need to add some

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.109 
back I'll know if I need to add some
nitrogen<00:00:29.260> for<00:00:29.710> vegetative<00:00:30.369> growth<00:00:30.400> or

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
nitrogen for vegetative growth or

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.939 
nitrogen for vegetative growth or
perhaps<00:00:31.300> some<00:00:31.690> phosphorus<00:00:32.290> for<00:00:32.559> fruiting

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
perhaps some phosphorus for fruiting

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.280 
perhaps some phosphorus for fruiting

cell walls and pH adjustments or maybe
I'll<00:00:40.870> find<00:00:41.170> out<00:00:41.290> that<00:00:41.470> my<00:00:41.620> soil<00:00:41.860> is<00:00:42.010> healthy

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
I'll find out that my soil is healthy

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.149 
I'll find out that my soil is healthy
just<00:00:42.699> as<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.440> take<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:44.589> from<00:00:44.769> me<00:00:44.890> it's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
just as it is take it from me it's

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.130 
just as it is take it from me it's
really<00:00:45.670> important<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:46.330> take<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.540> good<00:00:46.870> soil

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
really important to take a good soil

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.740 
really important to take a good soil
sample<00:00:47.769> and<00:00:47.920> that<00:00:48.010> starts<00:00:48.940> with<00:00:49.030> using<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.510> good

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
sample and that starts with using a good

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.560 
sample and that starts with using a good
tool<00:00:50.019> I'm<00:00:50.979> going<00:00:51.040> to<00:00:51.309> use<00:00:51.370> this<00:00:51.640> clean<00:00:52.030> cast

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
tool I'm going to use this clean cast

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.590 
tool I'm going to use this clean cast
aluminum<00:00:53.290> trowel<00:00:53.800> with<00:00:54.519> measurements<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.239> it

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
aluminum trowel with measurements on it

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.289 
aluminum trowel with measurements on it
don't<00:00:56.049> use<00:00:56.229> brass<00:00:56.589> soft<00:00:57.100> steel<00:00:57.460> or<00:00:57.760> your<00:00:58.030> hands

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
don't use brass soft steel or your hands

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.200 
don't use brass soft steel or your hands
to<00:00:58.600> take<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.809> sample<00:00:59.110> I<00:00:59.620> also<00:01:00.400> have<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.790> clean

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
to take a sample I also have a clean

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.479 
to take a sample I also have a clean
plastic<00:01:01.960> bucket<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.440> put<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.710> soil<00:01:02.949> samples

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
plastic bucket to put the soil samples

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.250 
plastic bucket to put the soil samples
you<00:01:04.030> don't<00:01:04.210> want<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.390> use<00:01:04.479> galvanized<00:01:05.019> steel

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
you don't want to use galvanized steel

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.420 
you don't want to use galvanized steel
or<00:01:05.530> rubber<00:01:05.740> because<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.130> could<00:01:06.280> also

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
or rubber because that could also

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.649 
or rubber because that could also
contaminate<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.270> soil

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
contaminate the soil

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.590 
contaminate the soil
I<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:09.010> several<00:01:09.369> raised<00:01:09.670> beds<00:01:10.030> so<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.330> want<00:01:10.540> to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
I have several raised beds so I want to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.300 
I have several raised beds so I want to
take<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.780> different<00:01:11.020> sample<00:01:11.650> for<00:01:11.830> each<00:01:11.979> bed

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
take a different sample for each bed

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.520 
take a different sample for each bed
last<00:01:13.270> season<00:01:13.750> there<00:01:13.900> were<00:01:13.990> different<00:01:14.320> crops

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
last season there were different crops

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.430 
last season there were different crops
growing<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.130> each<00:01:15.250> bed<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.790> so<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.120> soil

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
growing in each bed and so the soil

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.360 
growing in each bed and so the soil
nutrients<00:01:17.440> were<00:01:17.530> depleted<00:01:17.980> a<00:01:18.070> little<00:01:18.250> bit

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
nutrients were depleted a little bit

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.580 
nutrients were depleted a little bit
differently<00:01:18.760> I'm<00:01:19.600> going<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.840> take<00:01:19.990> about<00:01:20.140> 12

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
differently I'm going to take about 12

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.680 
differently I'm going to take about 12
sub<00:01:20.980> samples<00:01:21.520> from<00:01:21.700> each<00:01:21.880> bed<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.480> way<00:01:22.660> I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
sub samples from each bed that way I

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.150 
sub samples from each bed that way I
have<00:01:22.870> a<00:01:22.900> good<00:01:23.140> composite<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.770> what<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.010> soil

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
have a good composite of what the soil

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.120 
have a good composite of what the soil
is<00:01:24.340> like<00:01:24.690> be<00:01:25.690> sure<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.990> clear<00:01:26.230> away<00:01:26.500> any<00:01:26.830> debris

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130
