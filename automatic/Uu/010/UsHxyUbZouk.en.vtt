00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.150 

so<00:00:05.220> let's<00:00:05.399> start<00:00:05.609> first<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> ipod<00:00:06.419> nano

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
so let's start first with the ipod nano

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.279 
so let's start first with the ipod nano
so<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.280> Nano<00:00:08.519> from<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.910> very<00:00:09.240> beginning<00:00:09.809> was

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:10.289 
so the Nano from the very beginning was

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.320 
so the Nano from the very beginning was
about<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.740> best<00:00:11.129> ultra<00:00:11.760> portable<00:00:11.969> music

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
about the best ultra portable music

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.439 
about the best ultra portable music
experience<00:00:13.109> and<00:00:13.379> we've<00:00:14.160> had<00:00:14.400> six<00:00:14.820> amazing

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449 
experience and we've had six amazing

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.250 
experience and we've had six amazing
generations<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.980> ipod<00:00:17.310> nano<00:00:17.960> but<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.080> look

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
generations of the ipod nano but we look

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.019 
generations of the ipod nano but we look
to<00:00:19.380> create<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> new<00:00:19.920> ipod<00:00:20.310> nano<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.759> really

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to create a new ipod nano we really

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.220 
to create a new ipod nano we really
wanted<00:00:21.269> to<00:00:21.359> take<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> opportunity<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
wanted to take the opportunity to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.159 
wanted to take the opportunity to
reinvent<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.400> nano<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.480> we're<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
reinvent the nano and we're going to

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.839 
reinvent the nano and we're going to
reinvent<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.829> and<00:00:25.949> make<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.099> an<00:00:26.310> even<00:00:26.460> better

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
reinvent it and make it an even better

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.149 
reinvent it and make it an even better
music<00:00:27.300> player<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:27.659> what<00:00:27.810> elements<00:00:28.409> would<00:00:28.980> we

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:29.159 
music player well what elements would we

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.550 
music player well what elements would we
want<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> create<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.150> give<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.749> the<00:00:30.900> Nano<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
want to create and give to the Nano to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.100 
want to create and give to the Nano to
do<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.220> well<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.510> we'd<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:34.020> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
best nano we've ever created and here it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
best nano we've ever created and here it
is<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.990> incredibly<00:01:10.890> ultra<00:01:11.580> portable<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
is it is incredibly ultra portable and

and it is only five millimeters then

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.550 
and it is only five millimeters then
almost<00:01:28.350> 40%<00:01:28.890> thinner<00:01:29.750> than<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> ipod<00:01:31.229> nano

display you're going to love it because

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.050 
display you're going to love it because
it's<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> biggest<00:01:55.860> display<00:01:56.159> we've<00:01:56.610> ever<00:01:56.790> put

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's the biggest display we've ever put

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.480 
it's the biggest display we've ever put
in<00:01:57.180> an<00:01:57.270> ipod<00:01:57.630> nano<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.010> a<00:01:59.070> half<00:01:59.280> inches

in an ipod nano at two and a half inches

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.730 
in an ipod nano at two and a half inches
and<00:02:01.400> it's<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.549> multi-touch<00:02:03.090> display<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.900> we

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and it's a multi-touch display and we

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.280 
and it's a multi-touch display and we
redesign<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.640> home<00:02:05.880> screen<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.630> give<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
redesign the home screen and give it a
