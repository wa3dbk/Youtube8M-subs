00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
it will filter up to 20 gallons of water

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.620 
it will filter up to 20 gallons of water
obviously<00:01:25.400> depending<00:01:25.790> on<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:25.970> toxins<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.540> the

obviously depending on the toxins in the
water<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.960> you're<00:01:27.439> filtering<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.850> 20

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
water that you're filtering but 20

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.160 
water that you're filtering but 20
gallons<00:01:29.780> or<00:01:29.990> 80<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.340> these<00:01:31.490> big<00:01:31.790> Nalgene

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
gallons or 80 and these big Nalgene

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.289 
gallons or 80 and these big Nalgene
quart<00:01:33.170> bottles<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:33.920> that's<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.939> lot<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.149> water

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
quart bottles so that's a lot of water

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.539 
quart bottles so that's a lot of water
filtration<00:01:35.689> from<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:36.770> one<00:01:36.979> little<00:01:37.009> guy<00:01:37.280> here

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
filtration from this one little guy here

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.300 
filtration from this one little guy here
and<00:01:37.790> definitely<00:01:38.090> going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.329> last<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:39.710> good

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
and definitely going to last you a good

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.210 
and definitely going to last you a good
long<00:01:40.670> time<00:01:40.880> if<00:01:41.180> you're<00:01:41.270> out<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.220> it

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
long time if you're out there and it

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.590 
long time if you're out there and it
does<00:01:43.460> remove<00:01:43.790> ninety-nine<00:01:44.329> point<00:01:44.479> nine

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
does remove ninety-nine point nine

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.950 
does remove ninety-nine point nine
percent<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.320> giardia<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.159> cryptosporidium

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
percent of giardia and cryptosporidium

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.899 
percent of giardia and cryptosporidium
so<00:01:47.960> it's<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.500> good<00:01:48.680> filter<00:01:48.890> good<00:01:49.250> quality<00:01:49.700> and

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
so it's a good filter good quality and

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.910 
so it's a good filter good quality and
they're<00:01:50.600> pretty<00:01:50.750> inexpensive<00:01:50.930> from<00:01:51.619> aqua

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
they're pretty inexpensive from aqua

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.639 
they're pretty inexpensive from aqua
mirror<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.310> get<00:01:52.490> these<00:01:52.610> for<00:01:52.670> about<00:01:53.649> ten

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
mirror you can get these for about ten
