or ipad and so on these are not the most

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
or ipad and so on these are not the most
powerful<00:02:34.459> processing<00:02:35.459> units<00:02:35.880> but<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.660> can

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
powerful processing units but you can

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.770 
powerful processing units but you can
still<00:02:37.049> do<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.860> see<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.849> now<00:02:39.599> it's

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
still do it as you can see and now it's

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.360 
still do it as you can see and now it's
done<00:02:39.989> they<00:02:40.140> played<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> sound<00:02:40.769> tells<00:02:41.220> you
