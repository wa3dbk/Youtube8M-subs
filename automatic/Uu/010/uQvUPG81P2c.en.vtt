00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:34.480
 for different dolls and animals and so on 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:42.230
 for this you need a box of scissors 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:44.770

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.769
 take the box 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:07.610
 4 things and glue them together like this 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.660

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:45.100
 while it dries up we are doing now 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:51.069

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:57.930

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:01.920
