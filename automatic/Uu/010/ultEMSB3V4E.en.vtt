00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 even with such severe deviations in the hand and chest 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.579
 the producers believed 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.589
 work in the collection at the Olympic stadium has come a time that does not 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.419
 he endured more that he had no one else that I especially 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.970
 on account of the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.529
 after the dam I concluded that 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.950
 cold degradation of the inea environment in one of the ways 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.060
 only the hustlers move 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.260
 in improving the situation was to see total credit 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.410
 that credit provoked 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.740
 in fact a 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.309
 the biggest shit said 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.110
 exploitation because he worked as a speaker human being 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.580
 as in the mainly spicy world but we knew that 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.650
 people are developing experiences that can be 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.250
 used to be 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.250
 finally is 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 in the distance find and knowledge of two workers together with the knowledge 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.870
 two technicians 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.580
 with a view to reversing 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.770
 have an intervention on production that allows 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.420
 improves the income of workers 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.950
 but also to preserve the environment 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.420
 for training and embarrassment because it is a discussion that I had 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.850
 conceptualize and actually work agroecology 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.990
 with the courses are carried out and also in the community is a team of technicians 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050
 the crew and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.750
 this time of the roriz 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.010
 already a laborious process and direct tunnels to the community being two 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.340
 of appeal in the last plus the theoretical discussion 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.810
 and an infant tooth are from the experimental aviation experiment that will be 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.780
 done 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.440
 then the technical team to medical farmers can evaluate using their 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.619
 difficulties its productions that will be implemented delayed to leave yes 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.060
 but it was not handled 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.090
 one of them was good the Indian agency proves 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.219
 and even the fish 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.019
 he can give training 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.609
 we passed 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.039
 to do 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.129
 the handling 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 and also work with nature all according to 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.000
 that of the pack 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.870
 only 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.949
 the corpse 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.609
 the second moment is 18 points less and work 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.359
 already with the multiplier agents that are identified hendrix of the group 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.799
 even by the community itself 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.329
 and then they go to Europe 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.379
 act as a multiplier of knowledge within your community 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.559
 of what I learned in these 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.970
 of sexy an average of eight months 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.159
 I have 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.989
 led to other communities 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.719
 teach a little 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.699
 agricultural practices which were also introduced in the 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.929
 organization of knowledge in this 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:09.649
 so I have the way out silas the fish farm that is worked the fans 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:10.819
 in captivity 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.059
 I did not work 20 recover and take advantage of the rich in the square produce the ration 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:19.129
 beekeeping also that is a cute a process works this well 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.169
 organic 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.209
 the recovery practices of degraded areas, I only know that people are very 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.469
 very focused 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.749
 and he explained that it was running away - 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.749
 the manager was attended by one thousand five hundred families 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.139
 only in this area of ​​production 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.749
 because we work with multipliers in preventive health 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.670
 we also have 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.000
 invested in the systematization of experience is to laugh 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.319
 publications as soon as they arrive 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.919
 to other people 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.569
 and out 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.020
 This work we did 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.649
 today we are well articulated by the national network that people 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:57.119
 articulation of agroecology 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.119
 and the multipliers are very light mounted 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:02.509
 so today 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:03.730
 the farmers 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.339
 tendency is that the folder 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.859
 it's a landing 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.529
 Of Quality 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.169
 but almost half do not use warmer 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.449
 we do what I do 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.139
 organic babi with fertility leukemia 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.389
 He's closer to nature.
