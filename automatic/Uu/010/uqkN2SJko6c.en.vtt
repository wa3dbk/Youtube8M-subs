 What if it is not 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.229
 twenty 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.599
 ain many we have proposed 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.709
 There are 20 letters 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.969

 eight cartageneras 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.679
 the bike put in order 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.869
 given the posture they always did then you have 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.159
 said all cumaná 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.209
 markarián more or less in theory 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.209
 so much fervor what is assumed forecast 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:49.089
 vicens 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.189
 eight cartageneras

 of clover 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.580
 I hope this guy did not have to convert 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.560
 we are not going france among them the lie 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.099
 I'll show you how they do it's not a trick science decision 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.249
 the experts the letters 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:21.010
 preparation of a school in haiti is required 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.529
 but good what are we going to give 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.400
 stern very easy 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.439
 you have to put it suxed I chose 20 tell me they want to make the letters 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.220
 kiara were face down 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.650
 trusted they were going to choose the amount they want recommended bentegodi almost the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.749
 half 2 6 so have 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:42.889
 yes I suppose there will be 20 cards and paragliding cards but disaster indicates 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.149
 challenges I select 8 puche gonzález in how many letters do they want to be koch 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:48.490
 migration and case 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.569
 cough a year 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.629
 two 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.059
 3 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.359
 4 5 6 7% eight letters in the matter 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.529
 and highest letter 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.150
 rich cul 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.520
 eight letters will take me 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.029
 20 - 8 12 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.489
 uu 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:17.639
 Tuesday 10 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.479
 11 12 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.759
 then we have 8 megabytes and the seven mouths 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.529
 if we are going to mix or 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.159
 monoblock pact on the world 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.589
 medieval with the tricks but good 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:41.109
 and then what we're going to do is send him to face this race 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:46.460
 moconá an amount per ain if we send pilots socas 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.210
 the otri ready we are 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.210
 I say again that it is not ordered to be able to show 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.520
 and we have to do so 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.159
 pisa carlos ocaña here we have an advance we get 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.529
 I denounced him another then when we took out this and sarcastic 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:02.870
 we live 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.080

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.229
 stylist 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.449
 so then what we have to do is simply that claw 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.520
 of statin the common mallet 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.229
 we turn 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.610
 i mix with this act 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.410
 nothing else we will give any side any amount but which is sowed 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.289
 avoid them count the letters you can get it out because otherwise it did not reach 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:28.849
 work the trick 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.349
 we will be like this 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.590
 all the holy day mixing I do not hide letters 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.129

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.490
 mouth upside down more you like 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.410

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.250
 March 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.250
 my case of irak 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:03.860
 lie after lie that upside down 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.240
