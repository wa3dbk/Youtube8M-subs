help<00:02:59.840> seeing<00:03:00.799> it<00:03:00.980> here<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:02.200> we<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.380> see

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
help seeing it here is we can see

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.699 
help seeing it here is we can see
exactly<00:03:04.130> where<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:04.970> muscles<00:03:05.690> connect<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
exactly where the muscles connect to the

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.729 
exactly where the muscles connect to the
bones<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.430> exactly<00:03:08.000> where<00:03:08.239> they<00:03:08.870> overlap<00:03:09.380> and

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
bones and exactly where they overlap and

bones and exactly where they overlap and
in<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.160> book<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.880> can't<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.540> them<00:03:11.720> together

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
in the book you can't see them together

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.800 
in the book you can't see them together
they<00:03:12.829> show<00:03:13.040> separate<00:03:13.549> pictures<00:03:13.730> whereas<00:03:14.390> here

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
they show separate pictures whereas here

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.690 
they show separate pictures whereas here
you<00:03:14.959> know<00:03:15.079> we<00:03:15.680> could<00:03:15.829> pick<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.250> muscle<00:03:16.609> and

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
you know we could pick up a muscle and

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.030 
you know we could pick up a muscle and
look<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.209> see<00:03:17.510> another<00:03:18.410> one<00:03:18.709> that's<00:03:18.829> running

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
look and see another one that's running

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.240 
look and see another one that's running
underneath<00:03:19.579> it

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
underneath it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.240 
underneath it
sometimes<00:03:22.299> by<00:03:23.299> pulling<00:03:23.989> that<00:03:24.200> tendon<00:03:24.739> you

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
sometimes by pulling that tendon you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.150 
sometimes by pulling that tendon you
actually<00:03:25.730> can<00:03:25.970> recreate<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:27.139> some<00:03:27.410> degree<00:03:27.769> of

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
actually can recreate in some degree of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.930 
actually can recreate in some degree of
movement<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:29.389> is<00:03:29.720> all

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
movement that is all

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.480 
movement that is all
but<00:03:31.840> it's<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:33.040> gives<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.490> total<00:03:35.220> image<00:03:36.220> of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
but it's it gives you total image of

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.950 
but it's it gives you total image of
this<00:03:37.360> greasy<00:03:38.130> start<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.730> also<00:03:40.120> build<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.720> more

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
this greasy start you also build a more

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.810 
this greasy start you also build a more
