got<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> lot<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.120> equipment<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.200> is

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
got a lot of equipment in here this is

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530 
got a lot of equipment in here this is
where<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.740> make<00:00:13.980> things<00:00:14.250> happen<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.299> what<00:00:15.420> we

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
where we make things happen so what we

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.450 
where we make things happen so what we
didn't<00:00:15.750> look<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:15.990> today<00:00:16.320> today<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.279> an

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
didn't look at today today we have an

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.910 
didn't look at today today we have an
indoor<00:00:18.000> part<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> wine<00:00:18.690> cellar<00:00:19.020> system<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
indoor part of a wine cellar system and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.370 
indoor part of a wine cellar system and
here's<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> evaporator<00:00:21.480> coil<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.170> some

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
here's the evaporator coil we have some

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.300 
here's the evaporator coil we have some
components<00:00:23.900> we<00:00:24.900> put<00:00:25.140> these<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.500> together<00:00:25.740> to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
components we put these all together to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.240 
components we put these all together to
make<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.519> work<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> evaporator

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
make it work and this is the evaporator

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
make it work and this is the evaporator
coil<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.330> make<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.750> your<00:00:30.900> own

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
coil here so you make up your own

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.500 
coil here so you make up your own
systems<00:00:31.619> right<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.820> build<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.390> our

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
systems right we do we build all of our

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.080 
systems right we do we build all of our
own<00:00:33.630> systems<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.530> scratch<00:00:35.070> using<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.880> very

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
own systems from scratch using the very

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
own systems from scratch using the very
finest<00:00:36.660> components<00:00:37.559> available

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
finest components available

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.299 
finest components available
we<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.969> search<00:00:39.300> China<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.860> weakest

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
we don't search China for the weakest

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
we don't search China for the weakest
parts<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> cheapest<00:00:42.360> parts<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
parts of the cheapest parts we go and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
parts of the cheapest parts we go and
get<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> very<00:00:43.710> best<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> buy<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
get the very best that we can buy and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
get the very best that we can buy and
there's<00:00:46.230> why<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.620> why<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.010> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
there's why is that why is that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
there's why is that why is that
important<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.719> don't

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
important to you that because we don't

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.600 
important to you that because we don't
might<00:00:49.050> call<00:00:49.260> back<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.920> put<00:00:50.129> assistant

might call back so we put assistant

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
might call back so we put assistant
together<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.570> work<00:00:51.600> first<00:00:52.020> time

occur we're here for you to see what's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
occur we're here for you to see what's
in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> box<00:01:15.570> okay

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:52.170 

wait<00:01:36.970> does<00:01:37.119> not<00:01:37.299> go<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.110> typical<00:01:38.530> one<00:01:51.180> so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
wait does not go in a typical one so

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.420 
wait does not go in a typical one so
it's<00:01:52.330> very<00:01:52.390> versatile<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:53.380> its<00:01:53.619> prison<00:01:54.070> and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
it's very versatile in its prison and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's very versatile in its prison and
how<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:57.520> goes<00:01:57.789> that's<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.390> part

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
how it actually goes that's the part

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.340 
how it actually goes that's the part
that<00:01:58.750> goes<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.200> cellar<00:01:59.440> correct

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.749 

so<00:02:02.590> would<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.740> not<00:02:02.979> would<00:02:03.159> it<00:02:03.310> normally<00:02:03.610> be<00:02:03.729> on

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
so would it not would it normally be on

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.410 
so would it not would it normally be on
show<00:02:04.770> I'm<00:02:05.770> sure<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.429> see<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.729> yeah<00:02:07.030> no

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
show I'm sure you can see it yeah no

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.570 
show I'm sure you can see it yeah no
this<00:02:07.990> would<00:02:08.229> be<00:02:08.259> concealed<00:02:08.769> in<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.069> rocky<00:02:09.280> or

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
this would be concealed in the rocky or

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.940 
this would be concealed in the rocky or
would<00:02:09.759> have<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:09.970> wooden<00:02:10.450> cover<00:02:10.690> designed<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.800> go

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
would have a wooden cover designed to go

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.920 
would have a wooden cover designed to go
over<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.459> right<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.209> people<00:02:13.450> aren't<00:02:13.569> gonna<00:02:13.690> see

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
over it right so people aren't gonna see

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.420 
over it right so people aren't gonna see
some<00:02:14.140> because<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.380> does<00:02:14.769> look<00:02:14.800> at<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.040> mean<00:02:15.130> it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
some because it does look at I mean it's

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.640 
some because it does look at I mean it's
um<00:02:15.670> it's<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.360> piece<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.080> machinery<00:02:17.350> it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
um it's a piece of machinery it's

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.559 
um it's a piece of machinery it's
probably<00:02:18.190> pretty<00:02:18.340> corporate<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.060> probably

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
probably pretty corporate it's probably

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.509 
probably pretty corporate it's probably
not<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> separate<00:02:20.590> there's<00:02:20.890> at<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.190> story

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
not have a separate there's at the story

everyday this is the stuff that makes it

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.670 
everyday this is the stuff that makes it
happen<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.359> usually<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:44.109> put<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.410> type<00:02:44.650> of

different refrigeration application

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.660 
different refrigeration application
we<00:02:49.930> built<00:02:50.170> walk-in<00:02:50.590> freezers<00:02:51.040> big<00:02:51.310> enough<00:02:51.490> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
we built walk-in freezers big enough to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.270 
we built walk-in freezers big enough to
dry<00:02:51.820> forklifts<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.720> out<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.960> so

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
dry forklifts in and out of so

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.160

refrigeration<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.460> our<00:02:54.640> Forte<00:02:55.120> right<00:02:55.600> so

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
refrigeration is our Forte right so

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.420 
refrigeration is our Forte right so
we're<00:02:56.410> very<00:02:56.620> good<00:02:56.860> at<00:02:56.920> what<00:02:57.070> we<00:02:57.100> do<00:02:57.310> with

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
we're very good at what we do with

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.070 
we're very good at what we do with
refrigeration<00:02:57.940> we've<00:02:58.210> gotten<00:02:58.540> really<00:02:58.810> good

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
refrigeration we've gotten really good

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.180 
refrigeration we've gotten really good
over<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.380> years<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.620> wine<00:02:59.920> cellar

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
over the years a wine cellar

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.030 
over the years a wine cellar
refrigeration<00:03:00.540> became<00:03:01.650> really<00:03:02.650> good<00:03:02.740> at

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
refrigeration became really good at

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.140 
refrigeration became really good at
leading<00:03:03.250> we've<00:03:03.520> gone<00:03:03.640> through<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.940> lot<00:03:04.120> of

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
leading we've gone through a lot of

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.870 
leading we've gone through a lot of
process<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.870> elimination<00:03:05.820> finding<00:03:06.820> the

process and elimination finding the
clothes<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.480> are<00:03:07.750> quiet<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:09.300> can<00:03:10.300> be<00:03:10.390> placed

easily<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.470> hidden<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.400> one's<00:03:12.640> work

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
easily and hidden and this one's work

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.670 
easily and hidden and this one's work
the<00:03:13.210> best<00:03:13.390> for<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.840> far<00:03:14.020> nobody<00:03:14.320> have<00:03:14.470> many

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the best for so far nobody have many

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.500 
the best for so far nobody have many
other<00:03:14.860> coils<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.400> we<00:03:15.550> do<00:03:15.700> use<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.300> just

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
other coils that we do use this is just

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.390 
other coils that we do use this is just
a<00:03:16.600> lot<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.810> them<00:03:17.100> sometimes<00:03:18.100> they'll<00:03:18.310> be

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
a lot of them sometimes they'll be

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.220 
a lot of them sometimes they'll be
applications<00:03:18.820> where<00:03:19.150> we<00:03:19.270> need<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.450> use<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.600> skin

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
applications where we need to use a skin

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.810 
applications where we need to use a skin
oil<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.770> we<00:03:20.860> have<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.100> go<00:03:21.220> tight<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.550> against

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
oil that we have to go tight up against

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.730 
oil that we have to go tight up against
the<00:03:21.880> ceiling<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.050> what<00:03:23.200> would<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:23.470> one<00:03:23.709> be

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
the ceiling so so what would this one be

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.550 
the ceiling so so what would this one be
appropriate<00:03:24.370> for<00:03:24.400> then<00:03:25.050> 90%<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.080> all<00:03:26.230> sellers

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
appropriate for then 90% of all sellers

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.420 
appropriate for then 90% of all sellers
you<00:03:26.830> could<00:03:26.980> use<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:27.370> coil<00:03:27.670> anything<00:03:28.600> that's

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
you could use this coil anything that's

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.110 
you could use this coil anything that's
10<00:03:30.430> by<00:03:31.030> 10<00:03:31.330> or<00:03:31.690> smaller<00:03:32.170> right<00:03:32.860> okay<00:03:33.700> if<00:03:34.000> you

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
10 by 10 or smaller right okay if you

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.370 
10 by 10 or smaller right okay if you
got<00:03:34.240> bigger<00:03:34.510> then<00:03:34.810> we're<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.080> have<00:03:35.230> to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
got bigger then we're going to have to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.680 
got bigger then we're going to have to
go<00:03:35.560> with<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.740> bigger<00:03:36.310> system<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.000> probably<00:03:37.660> a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
go with a bigger system and probably a

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.170 
go with a bigger system and probably a
forced<00:03:38.080> air<00:03:38.290> type<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.770> vase<00:03:38.950> caddy

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
forced air type of vase caddy

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.660 
forced air type of vase caddy
so<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> typical<00:03:40.920> relatively<00:03:41.920> small<00:03:42.220> room<00:03:42.459> wine

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
so a typical relatively small room wine

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.670 
so a typical relatively small room wine
cellar<00:03:42.940> then<00:03:43.150> correct<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.110> from<00:03:44.290> quarter

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
cellar then correct this is from quarter

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.550 
cellar then correct this is from quarter

to smaller and this is the wireless of
the<00:03:50.530> three<00:03:50.770> coils<00:03:50.980> like<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.580> video<00:03:51.910> they

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
the three coils like this video they

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.360 
the three coils like this video they
make<00:03:52.270> one<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.990> 150<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.650> meet<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.860> 120

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
make one this is a 150 to meet the 120

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.680 
make one this is a 150 to meet the 120
and<00:03:54.519> then<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.730> whole<00:03:54.880> nine<00:03:55.120> which<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.390> even

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
and then the whole nine which is even

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.759 
and then the whole nine which is even
smaller<00:03:55.930> than<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.110> for<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.410> real<00:03:56.560> small

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
smaller than that for a real small

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.310 
smaller than that for a real small
summer<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> big<00:03:58.150> one<00:03:58.300> here<00:03:58.630> notice

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
summer so this is a big one here notice

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.630 
summer so this is a big one here notice
these<00:03:59.470> pipes<00:03:59.769> we've<00:04:00.040> got<00:04:00.160> coming<00:04:00.430> out<00:04:00.519> the

at<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:25.950> coil<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.940> transfers<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.140> freon<00:04:28.410> from

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
at this coil it transfers the freon from

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.710 
at this coil it transfers the freon from
a<00:04:28.830> high<00:04:28.950> pressure<00:04:29.250> liquid<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> vapor<00:04:30.120> which

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
a high pressure liquid to a vapor which

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.470 
a high pressure liquid to a vapor which

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
is where it gets cold vehicle so it's

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.870 
is where it gets cold vehicle so it's
the<00:04:33.600> process<00:04:33.840> sorry<00:04:34.470> I'm<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.620> bit<00:04:34.740> slow<00:04:34.980> so<00:04:35.310> it's

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
the process sorry I'm a bit slow so it's

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.820 
the process sorry I'm a bit slow so it's
the<00:04:36.090> process<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.810> going<00:04:36.990> from<00:04:37.380> liquid<00:04:37.560> to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
the process of going from liquid to

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.540 
the process of going from liquid to
vapor

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
vapor

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.150

a fan inside blowing across that and we
can't<00:05:00.720> say<00:05:00.840> if<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.080> don't<00:05:01.230> want<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.410> say<00:05:01.560> that

it's it's blowing cold air through them

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.909 
it's it's blowing cold air through them
I<00:05:03.480> wanted<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.780> say<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.140> removing<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.770> heat
