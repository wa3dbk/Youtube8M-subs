other movie I've ever seen Super Mario
3d<00:00:44.999> Land<00:00:45.089> really<00:00:45.479> uses<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> 3d<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> its

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
3d Land really uses the 3d to its

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.049 
3d Land really uses the 3d to its
advantage<00:00:47.069> there<00:00:47.339> are<00:00:47.429> a<00:00:47.460> few<00:00:47.609> levels<00:00:47.969> where

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
advantage there are a few levels where

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.040 
advantage there are a few levels where
I'm<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.420> don't<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.809> could<00:00:48.960> have

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I'm like I don't know if I could have

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
I'm like I don't know if I could have
played<00:00:49.229> that<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.679> was<00:00:49.859> not<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.339> 3d<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
played that if it was not in 3d so the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
played that if it was not in 3d so the
game<00:00:51.300> actually<00:00:51.510> uses<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.260> 3d<00:00:52.589> as<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.769> necessary

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
game actually uses the 3d as a necessary

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.279 
game actually uses the 3d as a necessary
part<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.729> the<00:00:53.879> game<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.510> oh<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.079> pretty

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
part of the game not just oh it's pretty

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.899 
part of the game not just oh it's pretty
because<00:00:55.499> it's<00:00:55.679> in<00:00:55.800> 3d<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> gameplay<00:00:56.639> plays

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
because it's in 3d the gameplay plays

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.700 
because it's in 3d the gameplay plays
like<00:00:57.149> classic<00:00:57.629> Super<00:00:57.899> Mario<00:00:58.079> structure<00:00:58.559> but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
like classic Super Mario structure but

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529 
like classic Super Mario structure but
in<00:00:58.920> 3d<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.519> know<00:00:59.549> it's<00:00:59.850> like<00:00:59.969> New<00:01:00.179> Super<00:01:00.389> Mario

or anything like that it has more of a

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.150 
or anything like that it has more of a
path<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.230> like<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.620> a<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> point<00:01:11.040> B

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
path to it like a point a and point B

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.890 
path to it like a point a and point B
it's<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> locked-in<00:01:12.360> path<00:01:12.660> like

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.040 
that's stupid so at a point when I was
like<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.250> game<00:02:38.460> is<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.880> absurdly<00:02:39.330> easy<00:02:39.630> it's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
like this game is so absurdly easy it's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.630 
like this game is so absurdly easy it's
losing<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.500> couple<00:02:40.800> points<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.100> my<00:02:41.220> rating<00:02:41.520> I'm

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
losing a couple points on my rating I'm

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.250 
losing a couple points on my rating I'm
just<00:02:41.820> saying<00:02:41.970> then<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.510> happened<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.140> then

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
just saying then this happened and then

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.810 
just saying then this happened and then
it<00:02:43.410> got<00:02:43.560> awesome<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.370> might<00:02:44.520> be<00:02:44.550> seen<00:02:44.790> as

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
it got awesome and this might be seen as

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.370 
it got awesome and this might be seen as
a<00:02:44.940> spoiler<00:02:45.240> but<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.600> think<00:02:45.840> it'll<00:02:45.990> just<00:02:46.200> be<00:02:46.350> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
a spoiler but I think it'll just be a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.630 
a spoiler but I think it'll just be a
thing<00:02:46.650> that'll<00:02:46.890> keep<00:02:46.920> people<00:02:47.370> from<00:02:47.520> returning

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
thing that'll keep people from returning

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
thing that'll keep people from returning
