00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
certain it's kind of hard to find I mean

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.830 
certain it's kind of hard to find I mean
once<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> find<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> you'll<00:00:33.329> find<00:00:33.540> every

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
once you find it you'll find every

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.030 
once you find it you'll find every
single<00:00:34.110> time<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.680> find<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.920> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
single time you just got to find it this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
single time you just got to find it this
once<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> market<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.450> once<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> find<00:00:36.899> at

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
once and market but once you find at

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.330 
once and market but once you find at
that<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> should<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:37.829> easier<00:00:38.190> from

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
that one time it should be easier from

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.819 
that one time it should be easier from
then<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.960> once<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> find<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.680> one

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
then on and so once you find it that one

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.020 
then on and so once you find it that one
time<00:00:40.860> you're<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> fall<00:00:41.790> through

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
time you're just going to fall through

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
time you're just going to fall through
it<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.329> once<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> fall<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.590> character

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it and once you fall it your character

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
it and once you fall it your character
will<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.219> slit<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.480> weird

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
will like slit and do this weird

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000 
will like slit and do this weird
animation<00:00:46.110> where<00:00:46.230> he<00:00:46.289> falls<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:46.890> when

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
animation where he falls and then when

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.709 
animation where he falls and then when
you<00:00:47.070> gets<00:00:47.219> back<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.550> he'll<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.940> back<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.360> under

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you gets back up he'll be back up under

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
you gets back up he'll be back up under
the<00:00:48.840> map<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.039> that's<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the map and so that's how you do it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
the map and so that's how you do it
which<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.090> super<00:00:51.270> easy<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.930> gotta<00:00:52.289> follow

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
which is super easy just gotta follow

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.529 
which is super easy just gotta follow
those<00:00:52.770> simple<00:00:53.039> steps<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.610> glitch<00:00:53.879> done<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
those simple steps and glitch done you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.630 
those simple steps and glitch done you
can<00:00:54.809> shoot<00:00:55.170> outside<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> glitch<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.489> like

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
can shoot outside of the glitch to like

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.459 
can shoot outside of the glitch to like
you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> shoot<00:00:57.059> outside<00:00:57.239> people<00:00:58.140> can't<00:00:58.320> shoot

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you can shoot outside people can't shoot

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.510 
you can shoot outside people can't shoot
you<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:58.739> obviously<00:00:59.010> you're<00:00:59.309> under<00:00:59.489> the
