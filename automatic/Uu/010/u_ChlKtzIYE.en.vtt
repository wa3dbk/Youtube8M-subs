00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
so the weeping angels themselves have a

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.609 
so the weeping angels themselves have a
2%<00:00:57.489> spawn<00:00:58.150> rate<00:00:58.449> which<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.720> incredibly<00:00:59.199> rare

2% spawn rate which is incredibly rare

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.049 
2% spawn rate which is incredibly rare
which<00:00:59.830> is<00:00:59.979> why<00:01:00.159> for<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.489> benefit<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:00.879> this

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
which is why for the benefit of this

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.450 
which is why for the benefit of this
short<00:01:01.360> case<00:01:01.540> I've<00:01:01.809> got<00:01:01.839> some<00:01:02.259> hairs<00:01:02.530> bonus<00:01:03.189> so

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
but if I slowly start to buckle where

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.070 
but if I slowly start to buckle where
and<00:01:36.220> then<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.430> turn<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.960> second<00:01:38.530> oh<00:01:40.080> it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
moved closer and chin position so it's

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.920 
moved closer and chin position so it's
hands<00:01:44.920> no<00:01:45.190> longer<00:01:45.220> covering<00:01:45.820> its<00:01:45.970> eyes<00:01:46.240> that's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
hands no longer covering its eyes that's

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.670

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.529 
imagine if this if you're actually doing
like<00:04:14.139> a<00:04:14.170> proper<00:04:14.439> let's<00:04:14.709> play<00:04:14.980> world<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.609> that

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
like a proper let's play world and that

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.939 
like a proper let's play world and that
happened<00:04:16.959> then<00:04:17.199> I<00:04:17.320> could<00:04:17.500> be<00:04:17.620> pretty

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
happened then I could be pretty

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.560 
happened then I could be pretty
catastrophic<00:04:18.190> especially<00:04:19.180> if<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.329> didn't

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
have a pickaxe because in that case you

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.689 
have a pickaxe because in that case you
would<00:04:22.840> have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.050> hard<00:04:23.440> time<00:04:23.560> digging<00:04:24.370> up<00:04:24.490> and
