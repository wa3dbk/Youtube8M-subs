00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.450
 this new gameplay ras 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 experimental today I bring you the news 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.309
 that this week brings the update of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.860
 flush version because I think that 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 They are interesting and maybe well, well, 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.859
 you can dead 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.890
 just died well, we respond from 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.830
 new wake up 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.619
 and as you can see we are in a quite area 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 desert that does not interest us now 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 the area itself 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.230
 I'm interested in teaching you various things I do not know 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.280
 if there will be a foundation here 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.020
 johnson foundation this is a fundation 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.899
 and we are going to take advantage of it and I am going to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.309
 teach several things well I told you the 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.280
 last time they had already put new 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.070
 new new foundation and so on 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.989
 etc. I am going to teach you several things 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.379
 the first is this kind of thing that is 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.710
 true that in the previous one we are going to 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.799
 build it as you see now has as 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.350
 several steps before was a coup and it 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.240
 was building now has several six is 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.190
 they put two crossbeams another crossbeam 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.960
 etcetera etcetera when to follow 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.020
 building 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.369
 let's continue to be worth 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.720
 let's build one more because 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.229
 I want to make it a little bigger so that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.520
 see some things before anything is worth 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.520
 we are still there building 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:42.590
 If I hear someone ai ai ai ai ai 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.540
 well is it going to be worth it already we have 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.880
 our foundation now let's open 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.960
 here and how do you see me implement bar 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.180
 they have implemented several things 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.310
 many have actually implemented 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.890
 implemented a menu where you exit a 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.500
 Lots of options as you can see 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.330
 build several things we give you here and 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.729
 he is only building is possible 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.220
 that you do not see the full screen and it's 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.340
 because you flush with the program that I 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.810
 I use does not record one hundred percent and 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.450
 so then I have to make do 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.709
 least a bit let's say to try 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.930
 bring the game on the other hand have 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.140
 implemented I am also here and it is 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.890
 to put several clothes on top of that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.170
 we can put several to see if it leaves me not 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.340
 I know if he leaves me he will not leave me and he will not 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.959
 leave bad 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.959
 good you can include several 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.760
 you can include several here as you see 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.010
 we have included new things between 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.220
 them this is called metals explain 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.320
 if we put this what we get 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.370
 is that if they just give us there some kind 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.459
 No bullet 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.750
 We do not die or as it is said if they give us in 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.790
 the head or any other side 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.640
 We obviously bleed 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.920
 happened before these are the things that have 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.340
 included as to that here we have 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.940
 the serious thing was the issues of houses 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.550
 fire furnaces furnish or whatever you want 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.190
 say you see here is pinball 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.180
 and more things that I wanted to teach you here 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.930
 they fuse arrow what the arrows are for 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.990
 I do not know if there is to see if I wanted to show you 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.030
 I do not know if this appears here as you see 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.460
 now it looks like a cursor that is like a 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.330
 arrow when we can catch something is 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.010
 pretty good because if we have several 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.480
 let's say several options 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.620
 I'm going to put there for example the can fire 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.110
 and we put here the can fire you see now 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.820
 a point comes out when we only have one 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.860
 option that is to open it we can not do 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.700
 another thing then for example here if 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.900
 let's get in 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.900
 of split know 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.230
 another split there and we put this here 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.049
 and for example we have several options 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.269
 which is for example now is turn it on or 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.980
 open it because it does not come out is iconic that is 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.400
 with a kind of menu we would give 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.620
 we would keep 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.030
 pressed the keyboard button and we could 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.009
 open or start the fire you see really 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.079
 The truth is that they are getting a 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.169
 impressive effect if you look at the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.139
 sky is very hard with the moon and the background 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.330
 the stars is very very currado very 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.240
 curred 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.490
 more than I was going to teach you the topic this 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.819
 the blogs that is a crazy then 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.479
 basically it 's a key now the 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.939
 doors can you say block is a 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.830
 system different from what the others had 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.210
 doors because what is intended is 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.860
 good that all the doors are not 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.889
 same is to say that for example the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.210
 Street door can be blocked 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.439
 from inside, they do not have to 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.180
 block can simply be 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:00.439
 doors to keep the cold or to 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.080
 save other types of topics 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.360
 decorative and then we can do 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.919
 for example as the rooms of the 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.770
 panic and so on etcetera in which 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.389
 we can block the more things too 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.840
 what can we do for a moment a little more 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.840
 we can do 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.550
 As you can see, they have also included another type 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:22.349
 of things like beltrÃ¡n that is a 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.240
 kind of bear trap and also 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.449
 immobilizes people good to hunt 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.520
 bears is pretty good and little else this 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.310
 It's basically the ones I wanted to teach you 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.199
 for the server change because you 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.840
 I wanted to basically teach some things 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.249
 and now that I have here built this 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.919
 Well, I can teach it because the 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.499
 true that does not let me build a 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.689
 sponge that I do not know how to get and 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.909
 well basically it's the goal of 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.250
 these teach a little that can be done 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.360
 now not from this new 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.389
 update what is good to do are 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.490
 walls as you see these half walls and 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.189
 apart you can build some walls 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.569
 on top of others there is no problem 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:03.490
 have had in the previous update 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.169
 that you could only build a wall and 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.479
 you had to put ceiling you could not 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.009
 build higher if you did not put that 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.409
 a roof from now on can be 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.449
 make huge ships that is a roof 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.360
 huge five- story and then the roof 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.029
 on the fifth floor that is not necessary 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.680
 let's say put intermediate plants that in 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.630
 Regarding the subject d 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.900
 let's say a little construction in 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.889
 how many commands have added a new 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.630
 command called elevator munitis 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.970
 moody's sensor and if we put in the 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.639
 censor console moody ti one 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.830
 what we do is censor then good 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.720
 that the man goes like that a little naked 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.150
 that you can see the neck there and those 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.420
 things 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.340
 and well basically it's good for that 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.740
 the people like that a little more purist then 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.840
 can put is the command the same as 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.360
 fat pnv to which you have it in another video 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.700
 that I uploaded you on the 5 most commands 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.730
 important of web trail joins that 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.740
 list and little else up here was a 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.450
 little news from russell las 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.570
 news of this latest update 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.150
 by the way now with this last 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.150
 update the field has been expanded 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.760
 let's say charging the game is true that 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.590
 developers have commented that it is 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.280
 a problem for them with those who 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:22.950
 they do not have a computer with many with 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.750
 a lot of performance, well, good 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:28.760
 lagazÃ³s but they say they are going to 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.650
 value a bit let's say that in the background 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.350
 I think there is one and in the background they are going to 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.800
 value a bit let's say 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:40.430
 the balance between good then have it 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.800
 let's say it charges pretty far let's say 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.960
 all the trees and so on etcetera with 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.420
 the performance and how good they are 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.130
 touching and they are watching what 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.990
 they are the best options and so far 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.820
 the novelties of russell occur 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.490
 development to give the jce you liked

 bringing news when you see that there 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:05.080
 something important we are in the next

 greetings and see you soon
