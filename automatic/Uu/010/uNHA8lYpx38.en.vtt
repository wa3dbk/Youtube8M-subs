get places with your friends and do
things<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> still<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.880> need<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
things but I still think that we need to
remember<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.470> you're<00:01:53.130> going

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
remember that just because you're going

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
remember that just because you're going
and<00:01:53.820> doing<00:01:54.030> things<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.750> doesn't<00:01:55.020> mean<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and doing things it doesn't mean that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
and doing things it doesn't mean that
you<00:01:55.680> should<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.009> disregard<00:01:56.610> God<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.270> His<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you should just disregard God and His of

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.410
