mirrors broke off kind of unfortunate
but<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.660> used<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.380> I'm<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.580> going<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> use

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
but it is used so I'm just going to use

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.810 
but it is used so I'm just going to use
it<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.510> display<00:02:48.870> anyway<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.590> get<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.550> dirty

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820

compartment the whole back end off to
get<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.220> pin<00:03:02.520> here<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:03.480> was<00:03:03.959> broken<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
get to this pin here that was broken the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.990 
get to this pin here that was broken the
broken<00:03:06.630> pin<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.380> right<00:03:08.340> here<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.530> see

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
so I'm going to make my own pin for that

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.449 
so I'm going to make my own pin for that
as<00:03:17.760> well<00:03:17.790> put<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.799> beefier<00:03:19.799> pin<00:03:20.070> there's<00:03:20.250> quite

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
as well put a beefier pin there's quite

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.610 
as well put a beefier pin there's quite
a<00:03:20.489> bit<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.730> metal<00:03:20.970> here<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.019> easily<00:03:22.170> drill

this out and drill out these tabs and
put<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> bigger<00:03:26.130> pin<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> anyway<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.110> upright

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
put a bigger pin in it anyway so upright

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.590 
put a bigger pin in it anyway so upright
just<00:03:28.350> go<00:03:28.530> ahead<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.739> do<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.390> really<00:03:30.390> excited
