00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
because your team of teachers if they

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
because your team of teachers if they
have<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> system<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.290> note-taking<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.009> they

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
have a system of note-taking that they

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
have a system of note-taking that they
teach<00:01:38.369> their<00:01:38.610> kids<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> reinforce<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.630> all

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
teach their kids and reinforce in all

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
teach their kids and reinforce in all
team<00:01:39.990> classes<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.340> make<00:01:41.759> kids

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
team classes they can actually make kids

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
team classes they can actually make kids
learn<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.720> become<00:01:42.930> note<00:01:43.290> takers<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
learn how to become note takers and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.340 
learn how to become note takers and
that's<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.070> important<00:01:44.990> educational<00:01:45.990> skill

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that's an important educational skill

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
that's an important educational skill
now<00:01:47.070> Cornell<00:01:47.460> note-taking<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.270> something

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
now Cornell note-taking is not something

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
now Cornell note-taking is not something
we<00:01:48.750> made<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> google<00:01:49.829> type<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> in

we made up go to google type it in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.440 
we made up go to google type it in
you'll<00:01:50.520> find<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:50.939> sorts<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.299> great

the right were about Hitler then the

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.000 
the right were about Hitler then the
students<00:02:20.659> might<00:02:20.780> go<00:02:20.900> back<00:02:21.079> on<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.349> left<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
students might go back on the left and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.410 
students might go back on the left and
write<00:02:22.459> any<00:02:22.610> questions<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.090> where<00:02:23.329> was

that<00:02:26.540> sort<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.870> thing<00:02:27.400> now

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
that sort of thing now

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.039 
that sort of thing now
in<00:02:28.819> order<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.120> do<00:02:29.299> that<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.689> students<00:02:29.959> have

in order to do that the students have
had<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.290> think<00:02:30.579> about<00:02:31.579> what<00:02:31.819> they<00:02:32.120> wrote

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
had to think about what they wrote

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.839 
had to think about what they wrote
think<00:02:33.319> about<00:02:33.620> what<00:02:33.799> they<00:02:33.920> heard<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.579> order<00:02:34.760> to

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
think about what they heard in order to

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.850 
think about what they heard in order to
come<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.180> questions<00:02:35.629> this<00:02:36.409> can<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.680> done

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
come to the questions this can be done

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.530 
come to the questions this can be done
as<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> homework<00:02:37.250> assignment<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:38.269> could<00:02:38.450> be

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
as a homework assignment it could be

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.300 
as a homework assignment it could be
done<00:02:38.720> at<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.870> end<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.110> class<00:02:39.290> or<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.129> could<00:02:40.250> be

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
done at the end of class or it could be

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.530

done as you go through the notes you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.059 
done as you go through the notes you
could<00:02:41.659> stop<00:02:41.930> periodically<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:42.799> kids

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
could stop periodically and have kids

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.890 
could stop periodically and have kids
stop<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:43.909> about<00:02:44.060> what<00:02:44.150> they<00:02:44.239> learned<00:02:44.450> what

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
stop think about what they learned what

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.210 
stop think about what they learned what
they're<00:02:45.049> writing<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.680> come<00:02:45.859> up<00:02:45.950> with<00:02:46.069> their

they're writing and come up with their
own<00:02:46.250> questions<00:02:46.700> then<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.540> draw<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.930> reflection

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
own questions then you draw a reflection

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.910 
own questions then you draw a reflection
