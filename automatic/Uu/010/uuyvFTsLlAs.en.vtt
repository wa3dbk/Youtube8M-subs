anatomical ass the midsole is also a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.210 
anatomical ass the midsole is also a
dual<00:01:09.150> density<00:01:09.390> material<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
dual density material so that it's a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850 
dual density material so that it's a
little<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.549> firmer<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> medial<00:01:12.720> side<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
little bit firmer on the medial side the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
little bit firmer on the medial side the
shoe<00:01:14.100> weighs<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.850> nine<00:01:15.090> point<00:01:15.450> five<00:01:15.659> ounces

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
shoe weighs in at nine point five ounces

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.380 
shoe weighs in at nine point five ounces
which<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.369> bit<00:01:17.520> heavier<00:01:17.909> than<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
which is a little bit heavier than the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.480 
which is a little bit heavier than the
pure<00:01:18.659> flow<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
pure flow and as you can see that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.730 
pure flow and as you can see that
anatomical<00:01:21.299> last<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:22.350> bit<00:01:22.530> wider

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
anatomical last is a little bit wider

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
anatomical last is a little bit wider
than<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> pure<00:01:23.700> connect<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.140> keep<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
than the pure connect this will keep you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.770 
than the pure connect this will keep you
from<00:01:25.710> over<00:01:26.100> pronating<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.820> you're<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> slide

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
from over pronating if you're a slide

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
from over pronating if you're a slide
over<00:01:28.080> pronator<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.100> overall<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> nice

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
over pronator so overall it's a nice

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.429 
over pronator so overall it's a nice
smooth<00:01:30.509> ride

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
smooth ride

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950 
smooth ride
it's<00:01:31.770> real<00:01:32.009> lightweight<00:01:32.250> real<00:01:32.790> flexible<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it's real lightweight real flexible you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's real lightweight real flexible you
could<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.259> feel<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.770> ground<00:01:35.009> where

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
could really feel the ground where

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
could really feel the ground where
you're<00:01:35.400> running<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.750> still<00:01:36.990> gives<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you're running and it still gives you a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990 
you're running and it still gives you a
little<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> support<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
little bit of support so if you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.330 
little bit of support so if you
overpronate<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:40.049> you're<00:01:40.290> used<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.070> shoe

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
overpronate if you're used to a shoe

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
overpronate if you're used to a shoe
like<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> Brooks<00:01:41.970> Adrenaline<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> Brooks

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
like the Brooks Adrenaline or the Brooks

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
like the Brooks Adrenaline or the Brooks
ravenna<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.610> would<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> good<00:01:45.119> shoe<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
ravenna this would be a good shoe to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
ravenna this would be a good shoe to
transition<00:01:46.200> into<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> can

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
transition into and you know you can

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.819 
transition into and you know you can
take<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> trails<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.049> either

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
take it out on the trails and either

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.190 
take it out on the trails and either
challenge<00:01:50.430> yourself<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:52.079> you'll

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
challenge yourself and I think you'll

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.780 
challenge yourself and I think you'll
feel<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.409> you're<00:01:53.040> running<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> more

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
feel that you're running with a more

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.890 
feel that you're running with a more
efficient<00:01:54.270> stride<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:55.409> naturally
