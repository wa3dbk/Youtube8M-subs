Velasquez in Las Meninas here is a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.930 
Velasquez in Las Meninas here is a
pretty<00:00:15.450> obvious<00:00:15.680> example<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.550> were<00:00:17.730> only

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
pretty obvious example if we were only

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.500 
pretty obvious example if we were only
looking<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.690> much<00:00:19.550> we<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.270> we

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
looking at that much we know that we

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.970 
looking at that much we know that we
were<00:00:21.630> looking<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> back<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.710> canvas

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
were looking at the back of the canvas

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460 
were looking at the back of the canvas
that<00:00:23.400> he<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:23.699> painting<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.170> he<00:00:25.289> was

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that he was painting on and that he was

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.939 
that he was painting on and that he was
looking<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.920> himself<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> mirror<00:00:27.949> Las

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
looking at himself in the mirror Las

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.500 
looking at himself in the mirror Las
Meninas<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:30.179> tenth<00:00:30.599> would<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.510> it's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
Meninas is tenth would I and so it's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.110 
Meninas is tenth would I and so it's
pretty<00:00:33.780> obvious<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.100> back<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.820> Las

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
pretty obvious that's the back of Las

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.910 
pretty obvious that's the back of Las
Meninas<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:37.380> fact<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.530> if<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.739> look

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Meninas in fact that can be if we look

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.819 
Meninas in fact that can be if we look
at<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> very<00:00:41.489> good<00:00:41.879> reproduction<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.530> feel

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
at a very good reproduction you can feel

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.250 
at a very good reproduction you can feel
where<00:00:44.789> his<00:00:45.469> paintbrush<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:46.829> actually

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
where his paintbrush was actually

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.439 
where his paintbrush was actually
deposited<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.379> bit<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:49.860> paint<00:00:50.190> through<00:00:51.059> here

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
deposited a bit more paint through here

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
deposited a bit more paint through here
because<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.350> hits<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:54.120> stretcher<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:56.640> there

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
because it hits this stretcher but there

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.950 
because it hits this stretcher but there
are<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.270> fact<00:00:57.530> six<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.710> seven<00:00:59.239> other<00:01:00.239> reasons

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
are in fact six or seven other reasons

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
are in fact six or seven other reasons
why<00:01:01.430> he<00:01:02.430> used<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:04.040> mirror<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:06.560> one<00:01:07.610> x-rays<00:01:08.610> show

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
why he used a mirror a one x-rays show

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.600 
why he used a mirror a one x-rays show
that<00:01:09.060> he<00:01:09.390> first<00:01:09.689> painted<00:01:10.229> himself

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
that he first painted himself

left-handed<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:12.450> he<00:01:12.600> changed<00:01:13.049> his<00:01:13.200> mind

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
left-handed and then he changed his mind

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.170 
left-handed and then he changed his mind
because<00:01:14.790> he<00:01:15.090> wanted<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> appear<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.470> history

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
because he wanted to appear in history

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.240

it's<00:01:40.020> been<00:01:40.320> reversed<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> mirror<00:01:41.579> image

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
it's been reversed by the mirror image

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's been reversed by the mirror image
when<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.500> come<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.979> consider<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.090> light<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
when we come to consider the light in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
when we come to consider the light in
this<00:01:45.810> picture<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.070> light<00:01:47.280> obviously<00:01:47.549> comes

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
this picture the light obviously comes

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.499 
this picture the light obviously comes
from<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.899> window<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:51.240> hits

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
from the window through here and it hits

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.639 
from the window through here and it hits
these<00:01:51.869> three<00:01:53.210> very<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.500> would

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
these three very much as you would

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.300 
these three very much as you would
expect<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.509> very<00:01:57.509> directly<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.130> when

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
expect it to very directly but then when

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.350 
expect it to very directly but then when
you<00:01:59.430> come<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:02.280> see<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.850> there's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you come to here you see that there's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.109 
you come to here you see that there's
actually<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.930> feel<00:02:04.290> light<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.520> light<00:02:05.729> gets

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
actually a feel light the light gets

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.400 
actually a feel light the light gets
behind<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.990> canvas<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.680> instance<00:02:08.599> so<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
behind the canvas for instance so the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.430 
behind the canvas for instance so the
light

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
light

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.490 
light
comes<00:02:11.740> through<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.280> window<00:02:12.700> here<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.500> hits

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
comes through the window here and hits

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
comes through the window here and hits
this<00:02:14.770> group<00:02:15.570> exactly<00:02:16.570> as<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.840> would<00:02:16.960> expect

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
this group exactly as you would expect

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.810 
this group exactly as you would expect
but<00:02:18.520> then<00:02:18.820> when<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.750> come<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.430> look<00:02:21.430> at<00:02:21.610> this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
but then when you come to look at this

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.140 
but then when you come to look at this
part<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.720> picture<00:02:23.140> there's<00:02:23.770> what

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
part of the picture there's what

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.330 
part of the picture there's what
photographers<00:02:25.150> would<00:02:25.840> call<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.410> fill<00:02:26.950> light

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
photographers would call a fill light

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.330 
photographers would call a fill light
and<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:28.270> fact<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.720> light<00:02:28.930> hits<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.130> mirror

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
and in fact the light hits the mirror

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.930 
and in fact the light hits the mirror
and<00:02:30.720> comes<00:02:31.720> back<00:02:32.080> into<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.590> group<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.730> that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
and comes back into this group so that

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.100 
and comes back into this group so that
it's<00:02:34.120> coming<00:02:34.390> from<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.690> different<00:02:34.870> direction

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
it's coming from a different direction

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.390 
it's coming from a different direction
it<00:02:35.950> even<00:02:36.340> gets<00:02:36.550> behind<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.150> canvas<00:02:37.390> here

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
it even gets behind the canvas here

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.740 
it even gets behind the canvas here
which<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:40.240> considerable<00:02:41.170> light<00:02:41.530> there

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
which is in considerable light there

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.260 
which is in considerable light there
another<00:02:43.860> interesting<00:02:44.860> thing<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
another interesting thing is that in the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.210 
another interesting thing is that in the
composition<00:02:46.960> we<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.100> menina<00:02:49.200> kneeling

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
composition we have this menina kneeling

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.940 
composition we have this menina kneeling
say<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.570> Velasquez<00:02:52.570> conceived<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.770> hill

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
say that Velasquez conceived the hill

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.550 
say that Velasquez conceived the hill
reflection<00:02:54.670> over<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.630> top<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.110> her<00:02:56.320> head

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
reflection over the top of her head

reflection over the top of her head
perhaps<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.830> most<00:03:01.650> interesting<00:03:02.650> thing<00:03:03.280> about

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
perhaps the most interesting thing about

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.230 
perhaps the most interesting thing about
this<00:03:04.360> whole<00:03:04.690> thing<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.580> it's<00:03:06.790> perfectly

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
this whole thing is that it's perfectly

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.840 
this whole thing is that it's perfectly
possible<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:08.370> Velasquez<00:03:09.370> actually<00:03:10.710> traced

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
possible that Velasquez actually traced

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.090 
possible that Velasquez actually traced
these<00:03:12.850> silhouettes<00:03:13.420> on<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.320> mirror<00:03:14.530> surface

that to his canvas at the mirror and the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.290 
that to his canvas at the mirror and the
canvas<00:03:24.459> are<00:03:24.790> probably<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:26.020> same<00:03:26.230> size

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
canvas are probably the same size

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.380 
canvas are probably the same size
interestingly<00:03:28.560> Velasquez<00:03:29.560> was<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:31.150> the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
interestingly Velasquez was in the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.050 
interestingly Velasquez was in the
process<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:32.070> redecorating<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.880> Hall<00:03:34.030> of

scintillator<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.970> we<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.150> imagine<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:41.019> he

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440

there the big mirror into this room and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.670 
there the big mirror into this room and
then<00:03:51.840> conceived<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.410> painting<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.930> the

the frame already you move your
individuals<00:04:11.620> around<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.580> so<00:04:13.390> you've<00:04:13.570> got

masterpiece and he did it at the age of
56<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:52.570> it's<00:04:53.430> completely<00:04:54.660> unlike<00:04:55.660> most<00:04:56.080> of

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
56 a and it's completely unlike most of

56 a and it's completely unlike most of
his<00:04:56.470> painting<00:04:56.950> most<00:04:57.220> of<00:04:57.370> his<00:04:57.490> painting<00:04:58.000> is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
his painting most of his painting is

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.190 
his painting most of his painting is
very<00:04:59.470> slow<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.580> deliberate<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.540> painted

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
very slow and deliberate and painted

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.910 
very slow and deliberate and painted
over<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.950> over<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:04.560> seems<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.770> be

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
over and over and this seems to be

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.380 
over and over and this seems to be
dashed<00:05:06.520> off<00:05:07.110> his<00:05:08.110> filthy<00:05:08.560> painted<00:05:09.430> but<00:05:10.060> very

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
dashed off his filthy painted but very

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.870 
dashed off his filthy painted but very
broadly<00:05:10.840> painted<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:11.710> he<00:05:11.890> painted<00:05:12.310> very

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
broadly painted that he painted very

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.230 
broadly painted that he painted very
quickly<00:05:13.240> and<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:16.180> actual<00:05:16.660> chances<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.620> him

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
quickly and so the actual chances of him

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.830 
quickly and so the actual chances of him
having<00:05:19.240> used<00:05:19.840> some<00:05:20.520> aided<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:22.360> mirror<00:05:22.600> is<00:05:22.810> a
