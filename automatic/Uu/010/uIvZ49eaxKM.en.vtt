00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
realizing that it is a semi-final and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.789 
realizing that it is a semi-final and
you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.080> get<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> rewards<00:01:31.710> at

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you know if they will get the rewards at

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.260 
you know if they will get the rewards at
the<00:01:31.860> end<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:36.289> I<00:01:37.850> don't<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the end of it I don't think you have to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.020 
the end of it I don't think you have to
build<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.780> any<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.170> than<00:01:40.409> yeah<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.819> what

build it up any more than yeah then what

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760 
build it up any more than yeah then what
it<00:01:42.149> already<00:01:42.330> does<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.990> itself<00:01:43.289> it'll<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it already does for itself it'll be a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.370 
it already does for itself it'll be a
big<00:01:44.009> crowd<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.429> big<00:01:44.700> atmosphere<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.319> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
big crowd a big atmosphere and it's a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.100 
big crowd a big atmosphere and it's a
great<00:01:46.560> Stadium<00:01:47.069> two<00:01:47.190> player<00:01:47.750> two<00:01:48.750> very<00:01:49.020> good

teams<00:01:49.460> everybody<00:01:50.460> knows<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.690> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
teams everybody knows and what the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.290 
teams everybody knows and what the

so it's the teams that can handle that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789 
so it's the teams that can handle that
