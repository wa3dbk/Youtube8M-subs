00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the way he has all this implied motion

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
the way he has all this implied motion
and<00:00:24.510> intent<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.529> cool<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:25.949> I'll

and intent it's really cool so I'll

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
and intent it's really cool so I'll
start<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.460> backstory<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.930> reason<00:00:28.230> it's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
start with the backstory the reason it's

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.870 
start with the backstory the reason it's
called<00:00:28.410> seven<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.699> number

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
called seven is because this is number

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209 
called seven is because this is number
seven<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.539> ten<00:00:31.040> experimental<00:00:32.040> class

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
operated by five people so the creator

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
operated by five people so the creator
has<00:00:39.600> made<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.500> huge<00:00:40.710> backstory<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> he's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
listed like its killcount and all that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.549 
listed like its killcount and all that
he<00:00:44.460> says<00:00:44.670> how<00:00:44.879> its<00:00:45.210> maintained<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> operated

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559

build this whole backstory and when you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.049 
build this whole backstory and when you
go<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> map<00:00:52.949> itself<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.820> all

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
go to the map itself you can see all

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
go to the map itself you can see all
this<00:00:54.270> stuff<00:00:54.570> happening<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.770> example

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
this stuff happening so here for example

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.970 
this stuff happening so here for example
you<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.910> convoy<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.079> ammunition<00:00:58.469> rounds

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you see this convoy of ammunition rounds

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.119 
you see this convoy of ammunition rounds
the<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.270> thermonuclear<00:01:01.020> rounds<00:01:01.770> obviously

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the the thermonuclear rounds obviously

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.229 
the the thermonuclear rounds obviously
they're<00:01:02.250> making<00:01:02.309> their<00:01:02.640> way<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.059> they're

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
they're making their way in here they're

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.759 
they're making their way in here they're
in<00:01:03.270> their<00:01:03.449> cartridges<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.589> see

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
in their cartridges and you can see

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.050 
in their cartridges and you can see
different<00:01:04.949> things<00:01:05.309> moving<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.760> around<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
different things moving them around and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.640 
different things moving them around and
you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.360> tell<00:01:06.659> what's<00:01:07.320> supposed<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you can really tell what's supposed to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.170 
you can really tell what's supposed to
happen<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> crane<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.939> picks

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
happen so the crane there you know picks

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.899 
happen so the crane there you know picks
them<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.420> off<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.340> train<00:01:11.670> system

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
them up off the the the train system

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
them up off the the the train system
that's<00:01:12.299> come<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.810> all<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> rounds<00:01:13.500> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that's come in with all the rounds it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.649 
that's come in with all the rounds it
puts<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> onto<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.939> he<00:01:15.270> makes<00:01:15.479> good

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
puts it onto this here and he makes good

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.039 
puts it onto this here and he makes good
use<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> walk<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.799> race<00:01:17.369> pieces<00:01:17.759> they're

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
use of the walk the race pieces they're

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
use of the walk the race pieces they're
over<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.680> slide<00:01:19.979> over<00:01:20.460> they're

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
over here as they slide over they're

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.960 
over here as they slide over they're
basically<00:01:21.840> broken<00:01:22.350> off<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.799> their<00:01:23.040> moving

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
basically broken off of their moving

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.990 
basically broken off of their moving
cartridges<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.979> they're<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.670> picked

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
cartridges so here they're then picked

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.999 
cartridges so here they're then picked
up<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.390> moved<00:01:27.780> further<00:01:28.170> along<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.829> not

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
up and moved further along the it's not

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.170 
up and moved further along the it's not
the<00:01:29.130> assembly<00:01:29.490> line<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> guess<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> would<00:01:30.090> be

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the assembly line I guess it would be

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.030 
the assembly line I guess it would be
called<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> disassembly<00:01:30.960> line<00:01:31.290> where<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
called the disassembly line where it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
called the disassembly line where it
takes<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> hard<00:01:32.790> shell<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.780> know

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
takes off the hard shell I'm you know

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.569 
takes off the hard shell I'm you know
protecting<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.590> cases<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.340> moves

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
protecting these cases and then it moves

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.429 
protecting these cases and then it moves
them<00:01:35.729> around<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.990> once<00:01:37.259> they're

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
them around here and then once they're

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.160 
them around here and then once they're
lined<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.979> over<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.479> you'll<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.960> is

towards<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.869> gun<00:01:49.110> itself<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.430> see
