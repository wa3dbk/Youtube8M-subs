00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.929
 wh 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:18.550
 Linear pcm recorder dr 07 mark ii what play is + today? 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.770
 Here's part 2 of this review This is just this alone recording audio 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.730
 It's so easy 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.570
 There is no difference with the previously made dr 0 child 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.930
 How is this disappearing sound 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.990
 Hey, do you remember properly until 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.990
 Yup 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.249
 Actually this review video is a video camera 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.399
 Voice in has been stuck in the edit it by taking dr 0 later 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:47.329
 If it's one shot, it's all right though 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:52.320
 Toka is a little awkward premiere pro when it comes to cut editing 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:57.180
 Fully link video and audio with advanced editing software and then cup 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.170
 The exercises are quite easy, but the imob that I use can do it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.809
 There is no 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:09.300
 So I want to use this as an external microphone for a video camera 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.340
 If Tteyuu really want to use as a digital single-lens reflex this external microphone at it is the kind of story 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.500
 Because I think that is basically the same 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.240
 One I would like to be attached to the video camera in the I hope yes, but here I am If there 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.420
 I made a mistake 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 I want to attach it to the accessory shoe here 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.630
 The thing that this means picture pre-dated the screw collection 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.350
 In it I bought but I was this much of 1000 yen dr 07 mark ii 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.750
 There is a screw hole here and so this 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.020
 Install 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.170
 Yes 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:47.979
 I 'm trying to attach the main part to the accessories here 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.420
 Not match the size I'm not enter even doing this Nedo 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:58.240
 Though it was found after accessory shoe of the video camera of this Canon 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.450
 It's two unique and it doesn't have general generic people 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.159
 Well then, if you think you should buy one for today 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.700
 It's expensive, it costs around 2000 yen. 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.180
 If you think that it seems to be stupid indeed 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:17.480
 x I'm wondering if I will buy a grip 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.989
 For now , I would like to fix it on another tripod and use it side by side with the video camera like this 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.410
 I will 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.180
 but it was also discussed when br 0 was introduced 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.980
 When it is not possible to have a video camera or digital one eye 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.280
 I told you to always select a cable with resistance 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.280
 I was certainly say 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:42.540
 Although the type of the police department is different, even when used as an external microphone for winter video camera 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:47.569
 Please be sure to select without resistance when it comes to resistance 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.660
 I bought about 800 yen, but I'm out of various manufacturers, but with resistance 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:57.300
 It is cable of stereo mini from stereo right 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 This was a failure of the video and the microphone has adjusted the cause of each 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:07.860
 I tried to adjust the low cut and tried again and again with various patterns 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.430
 If I try to earn a decent volume, I get a large white noise. 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.680
 Ne 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.849
 Editing notebook at a level that is not very useful 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.849
 Even if the West was useless 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.349
 This dr 07 7 well ordinary person is also here auto now state of auto auto 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.380
 is not it 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:35.180
 But I know this very volume guess I'd have seen small 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:41.780
 Set the microphone of the video camera to microphone input sensitivity max 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:46.580
 It is in the state that people of dr 07 are also in auto level now 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:50.370
 And the microphone of the video camera to the microphone input sensitivity max 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.580
 In the well dr 0 people also 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:00.330
 It is in the state that I am in the auto level now 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:03.420
 Was quite a dent and wonder if this was two major mistake who bought this guy thought Innovation Ah char 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.740
 It's not a source of resistance 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:12.870
 I was wondering whether Once connected by cable to order one more time just below 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.569
 This is a simple cable stereo mini from to see are the ne is about 600 yen 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.160
 Although I 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.510
 The 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.750
 Hey this is 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:25.970
 It was a great answer and I could use it 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:29.990
 It is an excuse, but let's choose resistance-containing as far as we checked variously in the net 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:35.900
 I think that is not wrong in the general question 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:40.740
 Better without apparently resistance was the correct answer is just my combination of this time 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.590
 As a result, shabu-shabu in the wrong contents in the review videos of earlier dr 05 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:50.750
 I 'm sorry I apologize and correct it 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.440
 I would like to see the video that was actually taken at this point in part 3 next time 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.250
 think 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.280
 It is completely different from the built-in microphone of the video camera 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:02.240
 Atone Dono please look forward to it 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.610
 Also something the difference of when and how and when spread the true IF 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.199
 I hope I can review it. Please look forward to it. 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.199
 West then 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:22.330
 As there is a line out here for 07 mark ii , insert it there 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:25.050
 If you have a video camera, there is a microphone input terminal here for this model. 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.050
 Connect
