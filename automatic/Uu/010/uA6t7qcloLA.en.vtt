00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 unlike what it should 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.080
 commonly happen in a climate of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.140
 absolute extensions sometimes hunting 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 arouses in the passionate hunter 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.040
 italy emotions that translate into 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.129
 shooting errors or at worst 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 hypothesis in not very clean felling that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.360
 must be concluded with the use of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.570
 dogs specialized in the recovery of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.570
 game 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.950
 the need to recover the appraisers 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.570
 is pursued with the help of dogs from 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.760
 track 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.040
 these are dogs with the finest smell 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.590
 which have the innate capacity for 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.110
 selection and acquired for training 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.190
 to follow precisely the trace of 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.570
 wounded boss 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.570
 leaving out all the others 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.510
 much of the research comes 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.610
 carried out with the dog connected to 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.010
 conductor from a very long eyelash 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.650
 about ten bikes after a more or route 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.810
 less long the handler frees the dog 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.470
 that reaches the wounded animal thus a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.470
 give light 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.810
 no 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.069
 within the modern conception 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.959
 the dog also hunts ungulates 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.720
 how the conductor must specialize 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:10.150
 in order to be engaged as dogs by 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.150
 trace for the recovery of injured leaders 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.950
 common denominator of all these 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.170
 specialists must be without verve 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.050
 the basic education that transforms i 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.629
 auxiliary dogs equipped with large but 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.640
 generic potential qualities in a subject 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.030
 able to contribute to the achievement 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.250
 for common management purposes educate a 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.019
 dog therefore has a purpose that goes beyond 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.730
 beyond its use in a specification 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.629
 hunting form 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.610
 just like hunting in general 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.799
 the track dog looks like 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.470
 the most important auxiliary in the new 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.450
 hunting scenario determined by the fort 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:04:03.650
 increase in ungulate hunting 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:04:03.650
 wild crisis 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.510
 the hunting of the ungulates is 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.070
 in fact the rational instrument of a 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.160
 renewable resource that is heritage 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.500
 of the community is therefore 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.590
 indispensable for reasons both of 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.480
 ethical character that economic recover 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.880
 as many animals as possible 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.450
 possibly injured in the actions of 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.700
 pick up the recovery of injured cables is 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.740
 therefore a fundamental element ed 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.590
 essential to a serious and correct 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.470
 hunting management while development 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.510
 of the use of trace dogs 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.300
 qualified and terrifying constitutes 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.560
 an index of maturity and seriousness 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.970
 type of hunting venice 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.640
 motor to be able to perform 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.250
 promptly and correctly 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.620
 recovery is necessary in every area 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.600
 management system be prepared one 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.810
 recovery station with a number 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.700
 sufficient number of research units 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.860
 consisting of qualified names i 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.680
 which must always be ready to

 answer hunter calls 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.000
 which in turn must necessarily 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.290
 s but motivated and of a season a 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.290
