00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello gamers welcome to a new 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.540
 departure of valÃ¨ncia and 4 I hope that all 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 are very good and good these patrols 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.610
 We at dawn we will see how 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.309
 We are going to tell you that in the end I can 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.400
 play a part of his staff and a bug 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.520
 speak seriously is completely and a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.939
 playable parce a latino shoots him crazy 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.090
 does not die to the other civilian to one kill him 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.699
 brainer part is turned shit 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.539
 game so I do not know if I'm going out 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.309
 some game 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.309
 so I do not know let's give it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 dale with shoot if message if it comes out 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.180
 something good maybe 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.610
 it may be because not who knows 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 so like gently 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 this for patrolling rather markito not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.290
 it's so easy to say 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.730
 to 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.340
 but it was 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.740
 I open here 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 very good very good well finally 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.359
 some game so he climbed well 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.359
 I have been giving him and they are not going 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.119
 too much and playable web fucking 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.920
 and I did not get to kill him dad but hey 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.530
 As I was telling you, try today's treaty 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.970
 it's no use being a player is because 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.610
 what it deserves is that sometimes not only 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.770
 because I get all that far but anger 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.020
 try to get the games and laws 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.479
 for man and laws for and it comes back and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.789
 hits and gives it and then does not die and the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.720
 moment in a shot and it falls like an arepa 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.210
 one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.970
 evil is bad a comparison then to 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.990
 Sometimes I prefer to avoid both foreigners 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.990
 there is no other 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.010
 with the other 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.959
 very good they will subtract me 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.959
 because I do not think so 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.790
 if they arrive but do not do much 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.620
 but hey it paints a little better 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.770
 keep bar home and that is not delayed 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.770
 plus 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.450
 For this 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.380
 wheat I will fight for this other program 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.160
 today I just obviously 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.790
 complicated to kill with a rifle from 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.790
 Foreign 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.710
 well, little bitch 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.849
 fruit fruits mates 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.610
 Bhutan because of problems that I do not have 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.610
 It's too bad, good, not so bad 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.480
 but over here so they will support me 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.660
 but then follow what I mean 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.910
 parce and more I with a rifle who comes out 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.540
 with this one 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:51.310
 and come out with that I do not kill it go to 23 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.800
 shots of falling 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.260
 and already happen to load can not be 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.120
 too fast and not matter 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.500
 the quantum to fall 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.710
 where no no he does not make a shit it seems 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.610
 to 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.660
 two 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.660
 do not stop 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.690
 and everything it takes to get out of here 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.260
 someone not even revived 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.260
 but never 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.190
 then 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.430
 as well 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.700
 or that I kill myself killed me that's what it says 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.370
 load 5 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.110
 I lost bus 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.090

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.669
 not be gamers and upload this example and 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.430
 I think it was too curt but it's 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.440
 something a decent means that I can take out and 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.930
 patience and we bring you well save or the 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.699

 I usually do the gameplays in the 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.400
 morning and in the morning sometimes it's very 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.169
 difficult to find servers with good 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.940
 people are usually very empty 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.199
 then sometimes I do for this 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.000
 I 'm doing it at night 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.680
