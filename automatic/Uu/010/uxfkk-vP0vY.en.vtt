00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
freshness there's still a little bit

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.219 
freshness there's still a little bit
stiff<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.720> loosen<00:00:52.409> it<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.769> little<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:53.129> I

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
stiff so to loosen it up a little bit I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.259 
stiff so to loosen it up a little bit I
decided<00:00:55.229> to<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.620> ahead<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.100> sit<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> over<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
decided to go ahead and sit it over a

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.799 
decided to go ahead and sit it over a
bowl<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.660> warm<00:00:57.899> water<00:00:59.059> before<00:01:00.059> adding<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
bowl of warm water before adding the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.850 
bowl of warm water before adding the
glycerin

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.970 

and<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.730> only<00:01:10.910> after<00:01:11.300> about<00:01:11.830> let's<00:01:12.830> say

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
and this is only after about let's say

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:34.060 
and this is only after about let's say
about<00:01:13.130> five<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.880> seven<00:01:14.180> seconds<00:01:32.740> okay<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:33.800> at

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
about five to seven seconds okay so at

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.980 
about five to seven seconds okay so at
this<00:01:34.250> point<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.820> decided<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.360> go<00:01:35.480> ahead<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.870> add

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
this point I decided to go ahead and add

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.510 
this point I decided to go ahead and add
glycerin<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:36.950> decided<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.340> go<00:01:37.490> with

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
glycerin and I decided to go with

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.730 
glycerin and I decided to go with
vegetable<00:01:38.090> glycerin<00:01:38.480> and<00:01:39.940> I<00:01:40.940> added<00:01:41.180> two

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
vegetable glycerin and I added two

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.740 
vegetable glycerin and I added two
teaspoons<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:43.970> mix

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.960 

listen<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.960> humectant<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:49.220> therefore<00:01:49.729> it's

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
listen is a humectant so therefore it's

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.650 
listen is a humectant so therefore it's
good<00:01:50.210> for<00:01:50.420> moisturizing<00:01:51.080> your<00:01:51.200> hair<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.660> it

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
good for moisturizing your hair and it

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.780 
good for moisturizing your hair and it
reduces<00:01:54.290> breakage<00:01:54.560> when<00:01:55.070> you're<00:01:55.670> you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
reduces breakage when you're you

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.230 
reduces breakage when you're you
hear

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.840 

if<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:59.020> read<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.650> ingredients<00:02:00.010> on<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
if you read the ingredients on the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.120 
if you read the ingredients on the
Alessa<00:02:01.270> QP<00:02:01.630> you'll<00:02:02.440> see<00:02:02.650> that<00:02:02.799> one<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
Alessa QP you'll see that one of the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.160 
Alessa QP you'll see that one of the
ingredients<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.909> petroleum<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.930> think

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
ingredients is petroleum and I think

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.359 
ingredients is petroleum and I think
that's<00:02:05.320> one<00:02:05.470> of<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> one<00:02:05.830> one<00:02:06.190> of<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
that's one of the one one of the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.710 
that's one of the one one of the
ingredients<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:06.909> they<00:02:07.090> use<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.510> make<00:02:07.540> it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
ingredients that they use to make it

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.249 
ingredients that they use to make it
creamy

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
creamy

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.040 
creamy
and<00:02:08.950> petroleum<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.030> not<00:02:10.209> good<00:02:10.450> for<00:02:10.479> year<00:02:10.869> it

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
and petroleum is not good for year it

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.690 
and petroleum is not good for year it
suffocates<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.709> here<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.190> there's<00:02:12.520> something

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
suffocates you here so there's something

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.949 
suffocates you here so there's something
you<00:02:12.940> want<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.150> try<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.510> stay<00:02:13.660> away<00:02:13.930> from

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
you want to try and stay away from

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.160 
you want to try and stay away from
products<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.310> contain<00:02:16.300> petroleum<00:02:19.170> so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
products they can contain petroleum so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.729 
products they can contain petroleum so
here<00:02:20.410> I'm<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.860> using<00:02:21.430> my<00:02:21.730> mixer<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:23.380> mix<00:02:23.500> all
