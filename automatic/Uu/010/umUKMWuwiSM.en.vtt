00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.760
 so friends hello and welcome 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.310
 to my first official penspinning 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.009
 tutorial so in my very first 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.699
 penspinning tool should be around the 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.949
 trick the hamburger and go that way 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.360
 simply translated before and out means completely 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.850
 clear around the thumb so you see 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.400
 I want to tell you a short story 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.050
 what you have to consider when you have the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 funsport wants to do like him 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.410
 works while being careful 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 must and so on and so forth 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.260
 So just how does it work 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.370
 again selected one more 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.300
 a bit slower than that maybe 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 looks a little bit better 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.160
 OK so 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.309
 First of all for the first time 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.530
 Simplification of five fingers needs 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.590
 just three so the three fingers are so 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.079
 now the pen 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.210
 festwirt about that means that 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.670
 longer end should be clear down here 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.670
 so be the middle finger 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.899
 with which he then gives the anschub 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.119
 middle finger is about in the middle of 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.459
 pen the index finger forefinger on 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.920
 far from the end, therefore, not quite here 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.079
 but so to the end 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.979
 The thumb is very happy of the two 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.229
 is not that important so in the three 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.689
 finger to which finger you move 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.459
 Actually, moving only does that here 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.950
 to push to life 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.549
 cuddle as always and this one to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.739
 catch 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.500
 that means the thumb moves like that 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:53.780
 good as not minimal 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.060
 So you push with that and start with that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.930
 back on push with the middle finger like that 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.150
 turns over the bridge of the dome 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.220
 in the novel he catches him again with the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.540
 forefinger up 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.590
 this is how a ban works 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.590
 is not no less 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.860
 OK so 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.420
 Fine motor skills are in demand here so you 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.730
 push with the finger but not so 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.640
 high altitude as strong as anything else is 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.640
 your neighbor garden land or so next door 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.440
 push as normal with the aim of such a 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.150
 bit over the thumb over it 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.400
 that does not mean that much 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.560
 that he then if I somehow front 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.380
 stay and here then the round 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.570
 Rolls is you see at the front again 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.630
 get down or so with the goal 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.030
 about the thumb about it if he 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.860
 then it 's just a run 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.410
 if then back here then you have to 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.360
 we just catch that way 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.240
 works easy and is actually 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.890
 a relatively simple trick is not 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.730
 hard most fans just received 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.440
 with this trick 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.170
 there is certainly another two 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.370
 easier tricks but because many with the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.980
 I also do the trick first 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.510
 gate over it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.590
 So without it also a very important one 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.510
 trick because most want to be on 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.670
 Always end up here for this 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.360
 cool and so you just need the van 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.530
 lead bobble as prior knowledge 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.890
 my van buuren on monday was that 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:24.280
 So just middle finger push over the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.630
 manages to turn the thumb 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.630
 forefinger field 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.640
 yes, it should not be too hard 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.160
 there is still reasonably still to come 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.350
 Much more difficult tricks but that should 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.570
 possible 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.030
 and what else is important what should the 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.640
 hand not rotate so that the pin on 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.460
 it is because then works itself 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.410
 with me only with effort and hard but 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.770
 actually the hand should be straight 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.650
 means slightly sloping so that the hand too 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.200
 So right now is not pen straight 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.160
 but not the pen again 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.160
 straight but just the hand straight 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.460
 but also can perform nicely 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.590
 a small summary longer 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.410
 the end of the shorter end is clear here 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.410
 push middle finger up 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.680
 turns on the thumb over the thumb 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.730
 around the dome with your fingers again 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.600
 Build that is the whole art is 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.660
 rambo out 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.520
 so I wish you much success and much 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.080
 enjoy practicing 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.820
 that should make it bad for the first penspinning 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.310
 so friends have been so yet 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.180
 a little special help for hire 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.230
 campus 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.820
 the whole is probably thinking that looked 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.620
 but that works pretty well and 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.540
 you can get it from brown as well 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.180
 learning pretty well so finds 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.960
 badminton racket yes it looks right 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.819
 either by racket 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.080
 and now you may like or so and 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.060
 right now because it does not work 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.520
 the pen is too light or so pin 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.919
 always just flies away and so could 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.259
 timmer that with a badminton racket 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:18.879
 Try it here because the shuttlecock 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:20.800
 racket is pretty heavy and therefore four 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.080
 beats very hard and he swings 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.250
 triggered by 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.770
 It makes it much easier to swing 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.719
 so that's a lot easier it vibrates 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.629
 by simply a lot slower and it is 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:37.360
 easy to capture that would be 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.969
 So I say the end of the 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.229
 badminton rackets back down 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:47.020
 hold as well as the middle finger approximately in 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.509
 create the center once now hold 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.120
 must keep pushing with the middle finger again 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.210
 constantly on 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.250
 push and try to drive that has 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.180
 The advantage is that it really vibrates extremely 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.330
 slowly and you can see if he does 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.470
 he can go around the user around it 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.690
 you control it nicely and then 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.190
 drive well so that's about 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.490
 a little easier if my figures 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.479
 just can not get it right here again 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.560
 Just swinging much slower you 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.990
 can control better 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.180
 for the beginning so for the beginners 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.220
 not yet set for the beginning 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.729
 I could do that in many ways 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.919
 and that 's maybe the time to do it 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.910
 then it gets more than low 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.169
 better feeling for it 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.990
 maybe you can do it sooner 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.919
 do a pen yes that was yes 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.970
 actually the spectral help training 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.280
 however , I actually sound like that 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.229
 I took a look but I stopped 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.639
 gives it learned and so the 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.550
 explained and it also pretty much 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.250
 helped actually I find then ok 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.419
 I wish a lot of success in practice 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.800
 You can enter a maximum of eleven on board 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.780
 Write how long it took for it 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.430
 Of course, I would not wish you 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.160
 Much success in practice is always because 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.160
 that and next tories to
