00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 It is the power Ise-shi for the first time, but today I've been in color for a long time again 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.510
 I thought about the reason why the suddenness is not easy to keep updating 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 I think 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:24.300
 One there about two major factors that say to take its own while holding a mobile phone 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.020
 Ya' off it is else taking off took so not good and it is not so much this love 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.220
 Within and 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:35.810
 There then we will not be able to update is another one of the reasons why 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:40.670
 What are you thinking too much ? What are you talking about today? 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.750
 If you say something strange, what should I do if the story does not continue? 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.160
 after 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.790
 That's right 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.900
 I have to make makeup and it's hair Bosabosa 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.860
 While you have Toka say come Ajima 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.780
 that 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.490
 But quite If you think I do not have spare time is a look I I do not I have to practice 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.660
 I can not update 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:08.790
 A little way from say this because it can not be Nan'nimo be standing forever that it is 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:15.870
 I feel too loose and I 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:19.590
 Even a little one by Toka when you want Toka play when you want to talk also be a long time is shorter Iikudara 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.159
 I hope we When you go to update any absence 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.360
 So first of the concert 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 I will announce you 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.110
 is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:41.640
 Thursday of you is I of the stomach and July 11 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:48.720
 This is the first concert in Kyoto. Opening will be at 7:00 pm at the Kyoto Museum of Culture Museum annex hall . 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.320
 A member of the Kyoto Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra and a piano quartet of three subjects called Luke 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.909
 Let me play 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.480
 I am really looking forward to it 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.300
 I'm not good at chamber music 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:10.570
 I am, but after I debuted that 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:12.810
 While we piled the Welsh guys and Shanghai quartet of everyone and in-room music of the quartet 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:19.380
 Very 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:25.260
 I really loved chamber music because I enjoyed the pleasure of being there 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.730
 Unlike at that time, I will put in my wings freely again and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.950
 Ummm 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:41.489
 Really it is comfortable it is possible to overlap sound and those of other musicians 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 This song is also because you can pull clothes to the place you thought you want to do quickly 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.810
 that 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:52.950
 Than I think that there is not much chance that you or sink or hear so much in concert 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.450
 I think that there are also those distant people, but by all means at this opportunity 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.620
 that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.569
 I think that I'm glad if it can it to other of that force that 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.590
 this 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:12.569
 It's the 42nd chamber music series, but it's a theme called an unknown song 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.960
 There are songs of Yue Aikuishi who is also out of the house 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.020
 Or a is a cantata of that Bach 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:25.620
 That very 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:32.370
 Please come to listen by all means because there is something in the program that is said to be unknown masterpiece 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:35.680
 It is 7 pm on July 11th . For details , look at the Twitter, homepage, etc. 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.300
 I hope you can 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.760
 That over the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.530
 Finally 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.840
 What if the flight or Naa and 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:51.970
 I think, but it's a bonus 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.970
 Then thank you for trying to update again soon 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.040
