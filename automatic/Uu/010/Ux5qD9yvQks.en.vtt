00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
spike plucks up yeah Mike wants to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.790 
spike plucks up yeah Mike wants to
go<00:02:39.810> home<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.050> he<00:02:40.080> can't<00:02:40.290> go<00:02:40.410> home<00:02:40.590> comes

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
go home but he can't go home comes

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.899 
go home but he can't go home comes
already<00:02:40.980> home<00:02:41.220> yeah

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.500 

yes<00:02:49.909> there<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.780> go

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
yes there you go

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.869 
yes there you go
yeah<00:02:53.510> now<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> can<00:02:53.930> tell<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.200> role<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
yeah now I can tell the role to the

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.690 
yeah now I can tell the role to the
plastic<00:02:55.879> is<00:02:56.000> discolored<00:02:56.599> from<00:02:56.750> age<00:02:57.019> oh<00:02:57.670> yeah

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
plastic is discolored from age oh yeah

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.339 
plastic is discolored from age oh yeah
he<00:02:58.879> took<00:02:59.030> 500<00:02:59.540> bucks<00:02:59.720> off<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.900> price<00:03:00.019> he

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
he took 500 bucks off the price he

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.929 
he took 500 bucks off the price he
quoted<00:03:00.650> me<00:03:00.680> eighteen<00:03:00.980> hundred<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:01.579> thirteen

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
quoted me eighteen hundred and thirteen

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.429 
quoted me eighteen hundred and thirteen
and<00:03:02.000> said<00:03:02.120> oh<00:03:02.239> sure<00:03:02.480> no<00:03:02.689> problem

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
and said oh sure no problem

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.319 
and said oh sure no problem
just<00:03:04.010> pave<00:03:04.220> your<00:03:04.340> driveway<00:03:04.730> with<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.909> quarter

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
just pave your driveway with a quarter

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.390 
just pave your driveway with a quarter
inch<00:03:05.359> of<00:03:05.599> tarmac<00:03:05.930> instead<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.349> four<00:03:06.560> inches

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:23.259 

yeah<00:03:19.900> that's<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.470> conversion<00:03:21.889> loss<00:03:22.150> that's<00:03:23.150> a

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
yeah that's the conversion loss that's a

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.750 
yeah that's the conversion loss that's a
pulse-width<00:03:23.959> modulation<00:03:24.409> you<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.549> rule

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
pulse-width modulation you can rule

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.330 
pulse-width modulation you can rule
because<00:03:26.239> it's<00:03:26.359> not<00:03:26.480> either<00:03:27.019> directly<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.159> or

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
because it's not either directly on or

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.009 
because it's not either directly on or
off<00:03:28.489> its<00:03:28.819> pulse<00:03:29.150> width<00:03:29.269> modulation<00:03:29.720> so

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
off its pulse width modulation so

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:30.940 
off its pulse width modulation so
there's<00:03:30.200> no<00:03:30.290> problem

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
there's no problem

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.250 
there's no problem
lock<00:03:31.129> up<00:03:31.159> slowly<00:03:31.489> not<00:03:31.849> abrupt<00:03:32.180> little<00:03:33.049> bit

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
lock up slowly not abrupt little bit

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.690 
lock up slowly not abrupt little bit
like<00:03:33.379> the<00:03:33.500> escorts<00:03:33.889> used<00:03:34.069> to<00:03:34.159> do<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.459> early

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
like the escorts used to do in the early

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.349 
like the escorts used to do in the early
80s

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
80s

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.080 
80s
one<00:03:35.870> two<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:37.280> that's<00:03:37.400> all<00:03:37.670> control<00:03:37.970> its

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
one two and that's all control its

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.140 
one two and that's all control its
pressure<00:03:38.359> regulation<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> transmission

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
pressure regulation and the transmission

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.960 
pressure regulation and the transmission
cool<00:03:41.379> zero<00:03:42.379> to<00:03:42.470> 100<00:03:42.590> percent<00:03:43.040> duty<00:03:43.159> cycle<00:03:43.310> zero

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
cool zero to 100 percent duty cycle zero

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.780 
cool zero to 100 percent duty cycle zero
percent<00:03:44.359> gives<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.659> a<00:03:44.689> maximum<00:03:44.959> pressure<00:03:45.790> so

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
percent gives you a maximum pressure so

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.159 
percent gives you a maximum pressure so
if<00:03:46.879> you<00:03:46.970> ever<00:03:47.090> lose<00:03:47.209> all<00:03:47.389> your<00:03:47.480> electricity<00:03:47.840> it

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
if you ever lose all your electricity it

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.050 
if you ever lose all your electricity it
goes<00:03:48.349> to<00:03:48.680> another<00:03:49.069> percent<00:03:49.549> and<00:03:49.940> you've

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
goes to another percent and you've

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.849 
goes to another percent and you've
essentially<00:03:50.329> got<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.599> dollop<00:03:51.049> of<00:03:51.139> a<00:03:51.260> shift<00:03:51.560> it's

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
essentially got a dollop of a shift it's

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.680 
essentially got a dollop of a shift it's
like<00:03:51.980> air<00:03:52.129> brakes<00:03:52.370> they're<00:03:52.940> always<00:03:53.150> on<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.629> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
like air brakes they're always on in the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.509 
like air brakes they're always on in the
air<00:03:53.900> turns<00:03:54.290> neck<00:03:54.530> off<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.040> if<00:03:55.129> you<00:03:55.190> use<00:03:55.310> air

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
air turns neck off so if you use air

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.280 
air turns neck off so if you use air
pressure<00:03:55.669> your<00:03:56.000> brakes<00:03:56.180> engage<00:03:56.389> that's<00:03:57.049> right

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
pressure your brakes engage that's right

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.110 
pressure your brakes engage that's right
and<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:57.859> can't<00:03:58.069> move<00:03:58.220> at<00:03:58.579> least<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.849> don't<00:03:58.940> go

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
and you can't move at least you don't go

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.819 
and you can't move at least you don't go
flying<00:03:59.269> down<00:03:59.569> a<00:03:59.599> hill<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.440> we<00:04:00.560> are<00:04:00.680> basically
