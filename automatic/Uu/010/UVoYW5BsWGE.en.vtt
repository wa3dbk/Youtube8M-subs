00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.010

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.660
 You can forget that much coal 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.380
 In the last two years she has only 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380
 learned 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 i need a lot of nice girl that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.989
 Of course it has to wait for me 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.989
 be right 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.210
 it was a stage-ready show at 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.670
 Dinner 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.199
 you're not good enough for her I have 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.829
 Great respect for your daughter's cause 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.760
 she is just incredible 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.449
 I want you since the tenth 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.449
 class cash registers 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.310
 she would never have been like that before 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.230
 Behave that you never asked why 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.240
 you prefer to crawl than experience 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.060
 together 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.210
 is perfect i have never had such 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.079
 had feelings 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.430
 I have the feeling to hide them 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.369
 something or am I wrong? 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.250
 that's always faster 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.080
 past 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.270
 baby is there you should read that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.150
 Do you live this girl then you had to and 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.520
 they fight my family could you 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.020
 I'm not kidding you 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 I waited for him but I love him 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 I know I'm not good enough for that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.630
 but I can not live my life 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.630
 Wasting something else to prove 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.710
 ok i know many say so now 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.270
 love story drama but I think 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.560
 The trailer looks like the movie could 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.729
 maybe a little bit more over 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.329
 maybe it's just too damn good 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.530
 sliced 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.420
 I'm not sure what that is 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.259
 I love to keep endless love from us 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.289
 By the way, universal pictures 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.610
 expected from 27 march 2014 in 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.619
 German cinemas will bring here 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.239
 The story is told by James 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.619
 is a young girl at the right place 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.580
 strict parents grow up at the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.260
 actually already clear what I later 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.209
 spice up medicine is supposed to study many 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.160
 internships in the meantime 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.840
 School holidays and a girl do that 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.099
 very ambitious on it top marks too 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.530
 Write and have a good career 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.030
 it would not be the love and build 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.069
 the passion in the form of a boy 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.110
 Mannes named david get in the way 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.030
 would initially is indeed the first 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.769
 affection the very big love and 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.630
 passion and that looks james 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 father does not like at all and wants 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.150
 be sure to try these types 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.769
 get rid of his sniffing 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.870
 The past assumes evil things for him 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.370
 and machinations and the whole poses 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.170
 of course this great love on the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.390
 Test and I hope that this trailer 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.250
 not only this movie not only this one 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.630
 Love all alone at the center but 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.160
 tried maybe a little beck 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.360
 stories about individual characters too 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.130
 then maybe we could talk 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.870
 I will not even be so bad 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.920
 have to say that for many even if 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.269
 I not the really big genre 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.069
 company even with three question marks 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.780
 open if the film maybe something 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.310
 can and my expectations but so 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.260
 I'm a little mediocre 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.549
 every case from 27 march on around you 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.410
 say if the stripes maybe 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.760
 but worth it and I'm curious because 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.100
 I also like the chosen music and stuff 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.420
 everything is not so bad and that's why 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.680
 I am a bit neutral and I am 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.030
 curious what you in the comments too 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.350
 saying he believes that the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.850
 the trend will be that most say 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.170
 because not at all my thing 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.060
 but I liked to leave your comments 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.400
 through and then I'm by one 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.109
 short fast trainer jack to endless 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.639
 love that may take as we liked this 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.870
 let it stay if I otherwise give 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.780
 it still cinema reviews twitter facebook 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.819

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.480
