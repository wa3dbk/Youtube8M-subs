out
so<00:00:15.690> here<00:00:15.900> I'll<00:00:16.020> first<00:00:16.260> I'll<00:00:16.380> show<00:00:16.439> up<00:00:16.560> before

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
so here I'll first I'll show up before

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.810 
so here I'll first I'll show up before
you<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:16.980> turn<00:00:17.040> it<00:00:17.189> off<00:00:17.279> these<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.490> really

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
you can turn it off these are really

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.100 
you can turn it off these are really
bright<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> know<00:00:18.450> one<00:00:18.570> point<00:00:18.689> camera<00:00:18.990> right

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
bright so I know one point camera right

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.780 
bright so I know one point camera right
at<00:00:19.200> it<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.920> should<00:00:19.950> have<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.220> cut<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> hole<00:00:20.460> back

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
at it you should have to cut a hole back

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.290 
at it you should have to cut a hole back
here<00:00:21.380> to<00:00:22.380> mount<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.790> but<00:00:23.790> that<00:00:23.910> switch<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
here to mount that but that switch is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.609 
here to mount that but that switch is
like<00:00:24.419> in<00:00:24.540> the<00:00:24.630> perfect<00:00:24.930> place<00:00:25.110> that's<00:00:25.349> kind<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
like in the perfect place that's kind of

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.589 
like in the perfect place that's kind of
hidden<00:00:25.770> away<00:00:25.950> and<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.910> models<00:00:27.210> actually<00:00:27.300> down

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
hidden away and the models actually down

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.150 
hidden away and the models actually down
you<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:27.869> even<00:00:27.989> notice<00:00:28.169> it's<00:00:28.410> there<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.070> all

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you don't even notice it's there and all

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.589 
you don't even notice it's there and all
the<00:00:29.250> wiring<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.730> purposefully<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.480> had

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the wiring I purposefully actually had

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.150 
the wiring I purposefully actually had
the<00:00:30.689> wiring<00:00:31.050> exposed<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the wiring exposed on this because it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.729 
the wiring exposed on this because it
really<00:00:32.489> really<00:00:32.759> works<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> work<00:00:33.360> stuff

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
really really works with the work stuff

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.759 
really really works with the work stuff
but<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.610> second<00:00:36.030> that's<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.239> lit<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.769> the

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
but the second that's all lit up the

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.770 
but the second that's all lit up the
actual<00:00:38.160> components<00:00:39.079> told<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.199> to<00:00:40.289> break

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
actual components told you to break

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.270 
actual components told you to break
blindingly<00:00:42.780> bright<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.410> yeah<00:00:43.620> that's<00:00:43.859> that's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
blindingly bright but yeah that's that's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
blindingly bright but yeah that's that's
good<00:00:44.429> cuz<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.969> inside<00:00:45.390> yeah<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.230> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
good cuz you can see inside yeah all of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.139 
good cuz you can see inside yeah all of
the<00:00:46.620> craziness<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> battery<00:00:48.000> in

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the craziness going on the battery in

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
the craziness going on the battery in
there<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.780> there's<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.140> things<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.469> great

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
there and there's these things are great

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
there and there's these things are great
for<00:00:50.039> doing<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> LED<00:00:50.579> stuff<00:00:50.789> cuz<00:00:50.940> there's<00:00:51.089> so

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
for doing the LED stuff cuz there's so

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.450 
for doing the LED stuff cuz there's so
much<00:00:51.449> room<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.350> only<00:00:52.649> problem<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.309> when

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
much room the only problem is is when

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
much room the only problem is is when
you're<00:00:53.609> doing<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.179> have<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.859> assemble<00:00:55.859> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
you're doing it you have to assemble it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.739 
you're doing it you have to assemble it
and<00:00:56.100> wire<00:00:56.339> it<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> same<00:00:57.179> time<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
and wire it all at the same time so you

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.329 
and wire it all at the same time so you
can't<00:00:58.019> like<00:00:58.230> build<00:00:58.499> it<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:58.920> wire<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
can't like build it and then wire it

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.489 
can't like build it and then wire it
afterwards<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.839> it<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.170> go

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
afterwards you have to do it as you go

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.850 
afterwards you have to do it as you go
oh<00:01:02.839> yeah<00:01:03.839> check<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> guns<00:01:04.440> actually

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760 
light up in there too yeah I left it
swivels<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.810> didn't<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.050> if<00:01:07.110> Sean<00:01:07.260> want<00:01:07.590> these

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
swivels I didn't know if Sean want these

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
swivels I didn't know if Sean want these
moveable<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.370> all<00:01:08.960> probably<00:01:09.960> glue<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
behind the head because I wanted the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.730 
behind the head because I wanted the
wires<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.260> light<00:01:16.410> up<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> little
