00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.250
 hello youtube people today I bring you a 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.680
 new tutorial on how to hack the 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.309
 whites 2 is a new way with more 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.230
 modes and more options to configure 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:16.369
 I will also make comparisons between 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.020
 the previous one and the new pack first 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.650
 what we have to do is download the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.690
 update 1.04 of targets 2 of 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.390
 our corresponding bless that what 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.810
 we will do in it 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.340
 ps3 free 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.420
 and I'll leave you the tutorial of how 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 download it in the description is worth a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.540
 Once we have downloaded it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.770
 well we passed it to our usb to the root 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.470
 from our usb 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.930
 here we will not go into it 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.930
 in the pendrive we copy it 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.210
 OK 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.100
 as well 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.100
 we are going to download the new pack 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.030
 we download it and when we 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.210
 we would have downloaded, we will have this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.460
 file we will give right click and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.060
 extract in white in white pack 2 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.060
 zone itself 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.120
 our era 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.130
 and see that it is not like the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:40.000
 previous because it has 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:42.850
 2 the 1 and 16 mp low ps3 efe the then 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 the vote is for the campaign for 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.720
 he hacks the campaign and he 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.840
 t 6 m ps3 f is for zombie mods 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.369
 and online multiplayer we recommend that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.890
 do it online because it 's mania 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.890
 then we start the monitor 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.320
 and we see that there are many more options 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.410
 good we load the him 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.880
 in this case I'm going to load the one that is 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.880
 for zombies and multiplayer multiplayer 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.370
 we go to where we have the d 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.530
 of multiplayer and zombies 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.530
 I remind you that it is this 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.600
 and we give to open 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.209
 we see that it has already been loaded 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.310
 select options 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.770
 I'm going to select all of them so that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.770
 You see it's worth now when it happens 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.360
 you already know that there is no fog nor 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.270
 wash 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.970
 and no recoil and superior advantages these 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.700
 they are super advantages of those that are 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.860
 drinks that must be 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.710
 are for double shot and stable aim 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.930
 the stable aim is worth I have the 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.120
 whites in English 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.260
 then I would select this but for 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.960
 those who have it in Spanish 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.240
 would select this voucher for those who 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.860
 they have nothing else in other languages 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.220
 have to do is look at the face tada 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.010
 of the game and the bless will come out 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.790
 corresponding to your game I have 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.380
 the custom fireware roggero 24 point 20 o 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.650
 be that select the 4.20 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.430
 4.30 I have forgiveness 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.610
 in case of having it of 4.20 we would put in 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.820
 355 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:44.860
 in 355 high break that I do any 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:47.830
 thing is worth in Houston tex is the test the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.280
 text that will appear on the screen above 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.220
 the right I'm going to put level yes ok 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.110
 for example the 1 is red in the greens 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.370
 the 3 is yellow 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.770
 I will leave it also in the description 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.280
 the codes and you put it often when 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.850
 you put it for example hd 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.230
 I'm going to put my secondary channel and it's worth and 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.230
 we give to self build 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.810
 we take we're going to 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.810
 to the els 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.729
 and we copy the name of the file 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.360
 and what we do and we point the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.449
 very important point that he does 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.139
 we keep it look like it does not respond 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.139
 but answer 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.020
 now said that it has been built 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.069
 and we will have it here 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.639
 the directory where we would have jealousy 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.490
 if you see it 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.749
 Now what we have to do is go 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.749
 to edit the campaign 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.460
 we load the campaign one 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.540
 we see that he has already loaded it and I here 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.200
 I'm going to put the same thing here 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.090
 in the cache of and everything else so that 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.850
 see her 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.800
 there are still float bodies corpses 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:23.220
 ruffles this is that the knife reaches 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.650
 the leaves and you kill him from a distance but 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.840
 mode is that you see the weapon farther away than 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.540
 from the foc 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.490
 and it is desirable to collect already recoil 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.690
 I said before I selected the one of the guiri 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.210
 the game of the guiri and I'll put the same 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.339
 before 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.339
 [Music] 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.610
 h 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.610
 and here goes to 12 I think he put a 2 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:54.770
 it's a 3 that is yellow red and yellow 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.810
 we give to 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.540
 to build and right now we copy the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.410
 bot 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.410
 with sweet 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:15.380
 we come here and we hit it and now 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.380
 we put ping point in capital letters 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:26.009
 ok we have the files that 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:28.199
 we want that are this and this I do not know 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:33.809
 why do I have it anchored to a program 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:36.360
 but if we would come out here self and it's here 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:39.839
 bin without any incognito like the others 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.889
 now what we would do would be in our 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:44.169
 usb 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:47.750
 good if we want to go through files and 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:50.180
 we had it and if not our usb 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.050
 we created a folder called me that I know 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.050
 self 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.360
 hacked 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.430
 they are not self because each other but 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.290
 good from orchard 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.290
 we will copy the bot 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.930
 and we will copy the cel 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:21.400
 for let's say 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.470
 and here are the two 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.180
 we already have the game update 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.180
 last we passed it before 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.020
 yes here it is and the two creators like 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.880
 we saw ready now what we would have to 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.880
 to do is to leave the play 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.630
 once in the play we insert the usb
