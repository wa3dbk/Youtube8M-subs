00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.379 
this one goes on the top and the step
number<00:03:08.419> goes<00:03:09.109> right<00:03:09.290> here<00:03:09.879> anyway<00:03:10.879> back<00:03:11.359> to

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
number goes right here anyway back to

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.240 
number goes right here anyway back to
this<00:03:11.599> side<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.379> can<00:03:12.500> open<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:12.829> part<00:03:13.069> up

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
this side you can open this part up

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.740 
this side you can open this part up
although<00:03:13.669> sometimes<00:03:13.939> when<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.419> do<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.659> it

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
although sometimes when you do it it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.420 
although sometimes when you do it it
will<00:03:14.840> take<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.139> front<00:03:15.319> roof<00:03:15.500> off<00:03:15.680> with<00:03:15.829> it<00:03:15.950> and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
will take the front roof off with it and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.979 
will take the front roof off with it and
that's<00:03:16.730> because<00:03:16.939> sometimes<00:03:17.359> this<00:03:17.569> piece<00:03:17.780> can

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
that's because sometimes this piece can

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.750 
that's because sometimes this piece can
be<00:03:18.200> out<00:03:18.379> just<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.739> little<00:03:18.769> bit<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.370> that's<00:03:19.549> what

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
be out just a little bit and that's what

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.390 
be out just a little bit and that's what
does<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.569> trick<00:03:20.690> really<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:21.889> I<00:03:22.010> do<00:03:22.099> recommend

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
does the trick really but I do recommend

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.430 
does the trick really but I do recommend
that<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.669> just<00:03:22.940> push<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.239> this<00:03:23.359> way<00:03:23.419> and<00:03:23.870> then

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
that you just push it this way and then

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.199 
that you just push it this way and then
lift<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.739> up<00:03:24.859> and<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.129> should<00:03:25.459> do<00:03:25.579> just<00:03:25.609> fine

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
lift it up and you should do just fine

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.729 
lift it up and you should do just fine
just<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.290> show<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.970> see<00:03:28.970> muscle<00:03:29.569> bad<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.169> this

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
just to show you see muscle bad and this

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.670 
just to show you see muscle bad and this
is<00:03:30.859> where<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.069> can<00:03:31.189> slide<00:03:31.400> our<00:03:31.579> dogs<00:03:31.790> inside

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
is where you can slide our dogs inside

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.960 
is where you can slide our dogs inside
now<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.769> weird<00:03:33.979> thing<00:03:34.129> about<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.579> part<00:03:34.849> is

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
now the weird thing about this part is

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.110 
now the weird thing about this part is
that<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.510> can't<00:03:35.750> really<00:03:35.840> crack<00:03:36.169> window<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.120> if

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
that you can't really crack window so if

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.119 
that you can't really crack window so if
nature<00:03:38.479> calls<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.169> the<00:03:39.260> dogs<00:03:39.500> happen<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:39.889> poop

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
nature calls and the dogs happen to poop

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.129 
nature calls and the dogs happen to poop
or<00:03:40.280> pee<00:03:40.459> inside<00:03:40.790> is<00:03:41.060> going<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.269> get<00:03:41.419> nasty<00:03:41.689> and

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
or pee inside is going to get nasty and

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.679 
or pee inside is going to get nasty and
stinky<00:03:42.680> real<00:03:42.859> fast<00:03:43.159> and<00:03:43.629> given<00:03:44.629> the

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
stinky real fast and given the

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.210 
stinky real fast and given the
temperature<00:03:44.989> nowadays<00:03:45.530> I'm<00:03:45.859> pretty<00:03:46.099> sure

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
temperature nowadays I'm pretty sure

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.429 
temperature nowadays I'm pretty sure
that<00:03:46.340> have<00:03:46.459> heat<00:03:46.609> exhaustion<00:03:46.970> too<00:03:47.290> here's<00:03:48.290> a

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
that have heat exhaustion too here's a

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.530 
that have heat exhaustion too here's a
view<00:03:48.590> from<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.859> back<00:03:49.099> and<00:03:49.759> you<00:03:50.239> can<00:03:50.269> throw<00:03:50.449> a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
view from the back and you can throw a

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.149 
view from the back and you can throw a
robber<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.900> there<00:03:51.139> and<00:03:51.500> haul<00:03:51.739> them<00:03:51.829> back<00:03:52.009> to

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
robber in there and haul them back to

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.599 
robber in there and haul them back to
jail<00:03:52.780> pretty<00:03:53.780> nice<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.139> easy<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.609> there's

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
jail pretty nice and easy and there's

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.899 
jail pretty nice and easy and there's
the<00:03:55.729> other<00:03:55.819> side<00:03:56.090> which<00:03:56.989> is<00:03:57.229> pretty<00:03:57.560> smooth

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
the other side which is pretty smooth

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.699 
the other side which is pretty smooth
there's<00:03:58.909> the<00:03:59.209> front<00:03:59.419> I'm<00:03:59.870> not<00:04:00.079> really<00:04:00.259> fond<00:04:00.590> of

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
there's the front I'm not really fond of

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.039 
there's the front I'm not really fond of
the<00:04:00.919> grill<00:04:01.129> but<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:02.299> open<00:04:02.659> that<00:04:02.780> up<00:04:02.900> if

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
the grill but you can open that up if

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.129 
the grill but you can open that up if
you<00:04:03.139> like<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.530> close<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.949> and<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:05.810> do<00:04:05.870> like<00:04:06.049> the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
you like and close it and I do like the

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.210 
you like and close it and I do like the
fact<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:06.379> we<00:04:06.500> get<00:04:06.620> some<00:04:06.739> doors<00:04:06.979> this<00:04:07.159> time

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
fact that we get some doors this time

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.069 
fact that we get some doors this time
around<00:04:07.609> and<00:04:07.879> now<00:04:08.359> I'm<00:04:08.419> going<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.629> slide<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.810> our

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
around and now I'm going to slide it our

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.640 
around and now I'm going to slide it our
forest<00:04:09.530> policeman<00:04:09.949> through<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.879> top<00:04:11.090> here

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
forest policeman through the top here

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.360 
forest policeman through the top here
which<00:04:12.650> is<00:04:12.829> pretty<00:04:13.009> easy<00:04:13.159> and<00:04:13.790> there<00:04:14.389> we<00:04:14.479> go

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
which is pretty easy and there we go

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.899 
which is pretty easy and there we go
and<00:04:16.840> overall<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.049> pretty<00:04:18.079> cool<00:04:18.380> design

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
and overall it's a pretty cool design

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.740 
and overall it's a pretty cool design
except<00:04:19.909> for<00:04:20.060> that<00:04:20.120> little<00:04:20.299> problem<00:04:20.630> right

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
except for that little problem right

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.589 
except for that little problem right
there<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.789> that<00:04:22.789> just<00:04:23.000> about<00:04:23.060> covers<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.509> and

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
there and that just about covers it and

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:24.940 
there and that just about covers it and
now<00:04:24.200> we<00:04:24.260> can<00:04:24.440> move<00:04:24.529> on<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.830> the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
now we can move on to the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.220 
now we can move on to the
recommendations

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.660 

overall<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.560> pretty<00:04:29.830> good<00:04:30.010> set<00:04:30.250> when

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
overall this is a pretty good set when

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.340 
overall this is a pretty good set when
it<00:04:30.730> comes<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.090> value<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.570> honestly<00:04:32.200> don't

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
it comes to the value I honestly don't

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.380 
it comes to the value I honestly don't
think<00:04:32.560> this<00:04:32.680> is<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:32.830> $35<00:04:33.490> set<00:04:33.760> but<00:04:34.120> when<00:04:34.270> you

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
think this is a $35 set but when you

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.180 
think this is a $35 set but when you
look<00:04:34.510> at<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.690> price<00:04:34.900> per<00:04:35.080> piece<00:04:35.230> ratio<00:04:35.650> it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
look at the price per piece ratio it

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.620 
look at the price per piece ratio it
actually<00:04:36.460> comes<00:04:36.640> up<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.910> 11<00:04:37.270> cents<00:04:37.480> apiece

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
actually comes up to 11 cents apiece

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.790 
actually comes up to 11 cents apiece
which<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:38.170> actually<00:04:38.470> pretty<00:04:38.560> good

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
which is actually pretty good

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.470 
which is actually pretty good
and<00:04:38.980> according<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.790> bring<00:04:40.000> Klink<00:04:40.240> you're

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
and according to bring Klink you're

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.300 
and according to bring Klink you're
actually<00:04:40.750> getting<00:04:40.840> about<00:04:41.200> 40<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.860> 50<00:04:42.070> dollars

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
actually getting about 40 to 50 dollars

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.890 
actually getting about 40 to 50 dollars
worth<00:04:42.550> of<00:04:42.640> parts<00:04:42.910> here<00:04:43.120> depending<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.750> you're

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
worth of parts here depending if you're

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.930 
worth of parts here depending if you're
selling<00:04:44.140> as<00:04:44.260> used<00:04:44.500> or<00:04:44.650> new<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.640> doesn't

robbers hide I was actually a better

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.680 
robbers hide I was actually a better
deal<00:05:09.130> because<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.640> do<00:05:09.760> get<00:05:09.940> some<00:05:10.150> nice<00:05:10.360> eagles

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
in that one too and you get a bigger

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.580 
in that one too and you get a bigger
playing<00:05:12.520> area<00:05:12.700> with<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.180> hideout<00:05:13.480> but<00:05:14.320> in<00:05:14.470> the
