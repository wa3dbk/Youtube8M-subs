behind them well there's two things
really<00:00:58.780> one<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.410> that<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.890> streetcar<00:01:00.219> is<00:01:00.280> a

do you say to those naysayers who wonder

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:34.169 
do you say to those naysayers who wonder
whether<00:01:32.889> it's<00:01:33.069> worth<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.490> well<00:01:34.029> there's

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
whether it's worth it well there's

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.309 
whether it's worth it well there's
always<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.450> crowd<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.840> says<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.169> should

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
always the crowd that says we should

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.289 
always the crowd that says we should
have<00:01:35.439> buses<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.889> stat<00:01:36.069> is<00:01:36.219> it's<00:01:36.789> it's<00:01:37.209> a

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
have buses and stat is it's it's a

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.089 
have buses and stat is it's it's a
pretty<00:01:37.509> intense<00:01:38.259> argument<00:01:38.649> with<00:01:38.740> even<00:01:38.979> within

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
pretty intense argument with even within

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.409 
pretty intense argument with even within
the<00:01:39.249> transit<00:01:39.549> community<00:01:39.819> of<00:01:39.909> street<00:01:40.119> cars<00:01:40.209> or

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:40.419 
the transit community of street cars or

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:41.969 
the transit community of street cars or
buses<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.959> the<00:01:41.289> third<00:01:41.469> ground<00:01:41.709> that<00:01:41.829> says

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
buses and the third ground that says

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.309 
buses and the third ground that says
they<00:01:42.279> both<00:01:42.369> have<00:01:42.579> their<00:01:42.759> place<00:01:43.319> certainly

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
they both have their place certainly

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.659 
they both have their place certainly
when<00:01:44.469> you<00:01:44.529> talk<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.739> the<00:01:44.799> TTC<00:01:45.099> they'll<00:01:45.459> point

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:45.669 
when you talk to the TTC they'll point

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.580 
when you talk to the TTC they'll point
out<00:01:45.819> that<00:01:46.179> you<00:01:46.539> put<00:01:46.719> you<00:01:47.049> know<00:01:47.079> buses<00:01:47.499> for

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
out that you put you know buses for

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.809 
out that you put you know buses for
every<00:01:47.770> streetcar<00:01:48.159> that'd<00:01:48.310> be<00:01:48.369> three<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.669> one

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
every streetcar that'd be three to one

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.059 
every streetcar that'd be three to one
so<00:01:49.299> you<00:01:49.389> have<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.539> lot<00:01:49.749> of<00:01:49.869> buses<00:01:49.989> in<00:01:50.349> traffic

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
so you have a lot of buses in traffic

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.529 
so you have a lot of buses in traffic
they'd<00:01:51.340> be<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.459> lot<00:01:51.549> more<00:01:51.700> pollution<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.359> video

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
they'd be a lot more pollution the video

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.699 
they'd be a lot more pollution the video
operator<00:01:52.840> cost<00:01:53.079> to<00:01:53.200> be<00:01:53.289> higher<00:01:53.409> because<00:01:53.590> you

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
operator cost to be higher because you

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.319 
operator cost to be higher because you
have<00:01:53.829> three<00:01:54.009> drivers<00:01:54.249> that<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.579> one<00:01:54.789> driver<00:01:55.060> and

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
have three drivers that a one driver and

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.519 
have three drivers that a one driver and
if<00:01:55.749> you<00:01:55.810> look<00:01:55.929> at<00:01:56.020> something<00:01:56.229> like<00:01:56.259> Queen

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:56.529 
if you look at something like Queen

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.529 
if you look at something like Queen
Street<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:57.309> be<00:01:57.429> a<00:01:57.459> bus<00:01:57.639> turning<00:01:57.999> up<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.479> know

Street to be a bus turning up you know

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.809 
Street to be a bus turning up you know

every 45 seconds every minute maybe not

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.099

if you're a passenger perhaps but you

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.069 
if you're a passenger perhaps but you
know<00:02:03.909> there<00:02:04.209> are<00:02:04.270> definitely<00:02:04.539> downsides<00:02:04.929> to

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
know there are definitely downsides to

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.019 
know there are definitely downsides to
buses<00:02:05.380> as<00:02:05.499> well<00:02:05.649> okay<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:06.429> when<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.819> comes<00:02:06.939> to

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:07.029 
buses as well okay so when it comes to

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:08.609 
buses as well okay so when it comes to
streetcar<00:02:07.389> is<00:02:07.509> what<00:02:07.659> people<00:02:07.779> say<00:02:08.020> is<00:02:08.259> they're

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
streetcar is what people say is they're

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.190 
streetcar is what people say is they're
slow<00:02:08.979> they're<00:02:09.250> overcrowded

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
slow they're overcrowded

they're infrequent you know in terms of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.170 
they're infrequent you know in terms of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
using streetcars to their full effect

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.150 
using streetcars to their full effect
you<00:02:15.270> know<00:02:15.360> how<00:02:15.540> well<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.900> Toronto<00:02:16.140> doing<00:02:16.560> this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you know how well is Toronto doing this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.040 
you know how well is Toronto doing this
40%<00:02:17.730> more<00:02:17.790> capacity<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.239> these<00:02:18.360> streetcars<00:02:18.569> so

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
40% more capacity on these streetcars so

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.000 
40% more capacity on these streetcars so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
have to wait a bit longer because

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.550 
have to wait a bit longer because
there's<00:02:21.060> fewer<00:02:21.239> streetcars<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.410> much

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
there's fewer streetcars but you're much

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.500 
there's fewer streetcars but you're much
more<00:02:22.770> likely<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.190> find<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.430> space<00:02:23.640> probably<00:02:24.270> the

more likely to find a space probably the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.630 
more likely to find a space probably the
next<00:02:24.660> big<00:02:25.200> big<00:02:25.620> improvement<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.459> big

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
change which may be too politically

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.770 
change which may be too politically
difficult<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.520> dedicated<00:02:30.300> lanes<00:02:30.480> you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
difficult to do is dedicated lanes you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.210 
difficult to do is dedicated lanes you
don't<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> contest<00:02:31.739> with<00:02:31.890> traffic

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
don't have to contest with traffic

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.040 
don't have to contest with traffic
you'll<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.550> going<00:02:32.730> more<00:02:32.819> quickly<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> can

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
you'll be going more quickly and you can

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.390 
you'll be going more quickly and you can
make<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> argument<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> know<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.310> is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
make the argument that I know this is

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.250 
make the argument that I know this is
controversial<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.120> Toronto<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.140> can

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
controversial in Toronto but you can

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.420 
controversial in Toronto but you can
just<00:02:37.410> make<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> equity<00:02:37.920> argument<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.370> say

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
just make the equity argument and say

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.400
