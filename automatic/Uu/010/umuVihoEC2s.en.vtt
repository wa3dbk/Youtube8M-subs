00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
supposed to be waterproof too so let's

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.190 
supposed to be waterproof too so let's
see

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
see

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.500 
see
it's<00:02:13.800> good<00:02:14.010> size<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.550> definitely<00:02:15.060> full<00:02:15.270> size

that's<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.140> sure<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.190> kind<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:17.879> not

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
that's for sure so it's kind of it's not

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.970 
that's for sure so it's kind of it's not
one<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.410> twist<00:02:19.709> up<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.930> also<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.680> hole

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
one it's a twist up but it also a hole

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.170

how<00:02:23.610> cool<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:27.090> sharpener<00:02:28.069> might<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
how cool this sharpener might be the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.500 
how cool this sharpener might be the
