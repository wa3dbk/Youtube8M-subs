00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.950 
going in to the gym and moving weight
this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> huge<00:02:05.700> mistake<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.899> is

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
this is a huge mistake and if this is

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.940 
this is a huge mistake and if this is
you<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:08.039> need<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.700> make<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> plan<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.660> attack<00:02:09.950> me

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you you need to make a plan of attack me

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.790 
you you need to make a plan of attack me
personally<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.959> beginners<00:02:12.959> too<00:02:13.170> early<00:02:13.470> in

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
personally for beginners too early in

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.490 
personally for beginners too early in
I<00:02:14.340> recommend<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:15.870> focus<00:02:16.320> on

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I recommend that they focus on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.390 
I recommend that they focus on
maximizing<00:02:17.060> every<00:02:18.060> set<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.770> simple<00:02:20.220> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
maximizing every set this is simple this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.510 
maximizing every set this is simple this
is<00:02:20.460> basic<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:22.170> almost<00:02:22.440> impossible<00:02:22.980> to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
is basic and it's almost impossible to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
is basic and it's almost impossible to
forget<00:02:23.730> when<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> go<00:02:24.510> into<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.900> gym<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.230> goes

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
forget when you go into the gym it goes

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.280 
forget when you go into the gym it goes
like<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.040> whatever<00:02:26.910> exercise<00:02:27.390> you're<00:02:27.930> doing
