00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 today I want to do a tutorial on 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 how to have a good wallpaper 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.760
 quality when I mean good 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 quality that is not all pixelated and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.320
 hd on some so we're all going there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.199
 start you're going to open your 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 Web browser 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:41.370
 I use firefox so on firefox 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:45.180
 you go on google so here is so 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 you lower the page and you go on 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.360
 your office 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.289
 the guy is a short time in December 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.559
 you will forgive me you do right click 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:02.010
 and screen resolution from this 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.420
 moment that's what will we 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.159
 to interest 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:13.799
 so your resolution and so me in 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:17.990
 the occurrence and 1600 x 900 but that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.549
 will depend on your screen actually and so 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.820
 saw me these 1600 I wrote a background 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820
 screen 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:47.790
 after I write 1600 x 900 but imagine 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:51.000
 you had example 1280 by 720 you 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.659
 write like that it really depends on 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.299
 your hockey resolution and ben me 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:03.450
 I like being so simple 29 cents 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:07.680
 after that, you see there by 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.020
 example I have several choices that are for 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.390
 most in 1600x900 you 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:22.830

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.510
