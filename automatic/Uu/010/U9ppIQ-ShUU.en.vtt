00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.600
 Halli hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.450
 new fifa 15 old with the video on 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.840
 new player review and yes we play 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 today with a new player and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.949
 Although the topic on this short 1 meter 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 80 big on medium labor law to three 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.230
 Starry battery lasts one 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.320
 special movement in the new game 17 goals 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.060
 two templates paid 6500 for me 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.369
 currently the border is where the video 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.190
 out there on 135 high on the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.399
 ps3 and pc 496 tempo 80 shot 75 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.890
 75 physicists are natural 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.719
 a few beautiful values â€‹â€‹for such a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.110
 Striker 94 is in for more 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.230
 agility 88 balance also good 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.640
 strength 84 graduation 75 noise protection 7 and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.530
 73 power and a few more wool 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.589
 values â€‹â€‹and yes 1 meter 80 tall I had 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.250
 those already said so these are the ones 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.010
 basic data that we hold here 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 want and can 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.080
 important of course under 1 73 strength the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.080
 to its incredible to its high 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.590
 value and good balance 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.000
 so there are no caps I was 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.530
 glad that you are in the meantime on the market 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.330
 There and it went on for a long time 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.990
 Not 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.880
 Meanwhile there are also the bba'ler 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.270
 in the market and I bet to see 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.799
 that it may be 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.659
 yes I can not promise if 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.420
 i get the art together i am 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.950
 have become a little scar meanwhile however 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.719
 I will try a debugger 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.469
 to get and then look what else 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.450
 but the bba'ler would be natural 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.399
 one of the very front ones i like 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.990
 still region will be but today we are at 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.579
 not cold but in these four three 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.500
 two one zero played with name and with 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.539
 the other with antonio i wanted first 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.399
 also his team on this or were too 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.500
 expensive I have to admit considering 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:10.030
 what the numbers were significantly antonio 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.769
 too expensive and so yes I am 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 I can strain the normal antonio 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.630
 i build this team and yahoo firstly 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.220
 a really big strength really 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.299
 really is a conclusion so 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.950
 maybe we can do a bit 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.560
 Surprising but for me is a whole 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.360
 very big strength be the conclusion of the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.549
 is phenomenally good so I am 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.560
 Hardly any chances are left and I am 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.629
 yes yes there are really many opportunities 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.989
 leaves on all these statements high in 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.930
 the corners generally easy with power and 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.000
 Even fitness shot so within the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.980
 sixteen and this clip of leg 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.109
 not your video or that was this 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.299
 play so bad ninetieth minute 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.920
 Can I still sit and break through ? 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.190
 then again the finesse in the long 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.150
 corner 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.069
 So his pace was really fanatic 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.420
 graduation was phenomenal good that wanted 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.319
 So I say I really do not have much 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.670
 Leave chances if then were 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.590
 not one hundred percent though 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.930
 One hundred percent makes the holsten almost 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.519
 always in my eyes yes as 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.880
 Next, one must of course be 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.609
 tempo talk is 96,000 59 690 's 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.560
 of course an announcement for me 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.599
 personally, he's damn fast 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.669
 many are seen in most clips 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.200
 here yes most of them but it runs 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.680
 has not really in my eyes 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.130
 felt like it was 96 or something 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.139
 he is something of a high 80s range 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.700
 88 89 and then you realize then already 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.349
 somehow NEN difference so nema 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.239
 she feels as fast as she does 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.280
 you want and that should be yes 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.200
 not to be but overall is natural 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.259
 very fast but there I was 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.110
 something more hopes for his pace well 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:45.880
 then next 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.680
 not dribble strongest and right one 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.350
 a job makes it a reality 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.030
 Nevertheless, it is relatively easy for him most of the time 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.780
 his pace past our opponents 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.180
 to go which is relatively nice and also 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.720
 allows a lot of freedom with 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.810
 wilson then his strength too 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.400
 very neat is as I said 73 at 1 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.130
 meter 80 can definitely be with you 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.110
 live and last but not least that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.270
 Also important to me is one 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.739
 because he always stood where 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.239
 I wished he was in the 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.549
 middle at flanks, even if it is not 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.260
 Kopfunge Monster is good at 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.990
 Steep passes always deliver in the right way 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.730
 most of the time in any case and 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.930
 so on and so on I am a very very 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.700
 You will find good positional play over 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.580
 striker that can not be said otherwise 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.530
 here a few signs but felt 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.180
 if that is always the conclusion 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.200
 very big plus 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.350
 yes I can sit so after 1 gb am 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.060
 Test only recommend is also relative 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.889
 easy to install as english 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.600
 of course and there is also good left in 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.800
 she also gives the second league england 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.220
 Again an example for his class 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.440
 graduation 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.180
 and yes recommendation from me is on everyone 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.220
 case because if liked rate 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.630
 Do not forget how I said 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.580
 Try to make the ballers promise 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.470
 I can not and then I have 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.850
 next video again until then people 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.850
 and bye
