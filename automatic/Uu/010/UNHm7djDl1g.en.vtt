00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
published online only so fast forward to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.219 
published online only so fast forward to
now<00:01:21.399> there's<00:01:22.399> actually<00:01:22.640> only<00:01:23.360> two<00:01:23.750> places<00:01:24.020> in

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
now there's actually only two places in

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.380 
now there's actually only two places in
the<00:01:24.380> world<00:01:24.619> where<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:24.890> can<00:01:25.099> now<00:01:25.250> get<00:01:25.640> both

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
the world where you can now get both

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.449 
the world where you can now get both
produced<00:01:26.869> creatine<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:27.590> all<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.009> companies

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
produced creatine so all the companies

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.240 
produced creatine so all the companies
you<00:01:28.550> see<00:01:28.580> with<00:01:28.910> labels<00:01:29.649> with<00:01:30.649> creatine<00:01:31.009> are

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
you see with labels with creatine are

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.529 
you see with labels with creatine are
not<00:01:31.369> making<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.880> creatine<00:01:32.179> and<00:01:32.420> that

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
not making that creatine and that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.350 
not making that creatine and that
doesn't<00:01:32.869> make<00:01:32.959> it<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.349> bad<00:01:33.860> or<00:01:34.130> inferior<00:01:34.940> per<00:01:35.179> se

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
doesn't make it a bad or inferior per se

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.809 
doesn't make it a bad or inferior per se
but<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:36.200> really<00:01:36.440> have<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.679> understand<00:01:37.160> what's

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
but you really have to understand what's

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.820 
but you really have to understand what's
going<00:01:38.090> on<00:01:38.239> here<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:38.750> there's<00:01:39.259> really<00:01:39.440> only<00:01:39.530> two

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
going on here so there's really only two

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.219 
going on here so there's really only two
locations<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.670> can<00:01:40.700> get<00:01:41.060> Balta<00:01:41.390> creatine<00:01:42.080> and

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
locations you can get Balta creatine and

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.040 
locations you can get Balta creatine and
that<00:01:42.349> is<00:01:42.530> China<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.160> Germany<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.690> Chinese

also tend to use two different
manufacturing<00:02:53.430> methods<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.060> one<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.510> them<00:02:54.630> is

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
manufacturing methods and one of them is

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.370 
manufacturing methods and one of them is
really<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:56.180> clean<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.660> has<00:02:57.840> potential

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
really not very clean it has potential

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.440 
really not very clean it has potential
like<00:02:58.800> hide<00:02:58.980> our<00:02:59.100> potential<00:02:59.580> for<00:02:59.820> unreacted

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
like hide our potential for unreacted

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.870 
like hide our potential for unreacted
products<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.959> be<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.350> such<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.070> it's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
products to be in it and such and it's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.610 
products to be in it and such and it's
not<00:03:03.030> something<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.660> would<00:03:04.050> recommend<00:03:04.080> that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
not something I would recommend that

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.810 
not something I would recommend that
again<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.010> don't<00:03:05.130> know<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.790> two

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
again you don't know which of the two

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.690 
again you don't know which of the two

but<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:15.209> me<00:03:15.360> at<00:03:15.510> least<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:16.110> truth<00:03:16.680> still

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
but for me at least the truth still

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.880 
but for me at least the truth still
stands<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:18.000> although<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.110> Chinese<00:03:19.380> are

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
stands that although the Chinese are

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.250 
stands that although the Chinese are
