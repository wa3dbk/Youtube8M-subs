 window penza 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:16.040
 all of it will hold a new asset 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.289
 which actually as I understood by the first 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.189
 letters to the manufacturer 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.189
 developers brazenly green 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.240
 Now on the road August 9th all the element 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.190
 salon mod like that 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:01:17.020
 decided to try to be safe 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:01:19.360
 samples stripe tree banner 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.580
 toy called and more time 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.910
 who came up with seda we all 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:32.070
 what kind of pull they basically shows 22 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.070
 here we have run 23 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 can 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:25.630
 45 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:34.020
 41 45 to 45 common business with the main 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:34.020
 the accent of which well are you now 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:58.380
 nice side i mean once again that we 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.780
 now we do we try to spend the whole 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.800
 process with a new activator which is like 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.810
 just recently joined us 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.360
 half an hour ago what other advantages 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.040
 here is this new activator 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.780
 gives us here besides probably the fact that 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 can reduce the heating temperature and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.420
 thereby also to us and savings 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.720
 respectively for 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:31.940
 for where the head should be despite the fact that 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.590
 we have such a hood that 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.010
 has bandwidth from order 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:43.739
 12 cubes per minute anyway for 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.230
 what then god first keeps 2 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:51.019
 minus like ours and was transferring immediately with 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.019
 hand intact she will dance 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.450
 now we have no god 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.990
 I'll hide I went to go 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.990
 proceeds 

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:47.769
 definitely 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:04.509
 we have a little light while we hate 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.509
 ok for centuries 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:23.460
 the main task itself for us is occupation 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:36.180
 not to leave no doubt it can be 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:38.279
 straight will play on no holds once 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.120
 see shall communicate with said film 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:44.430
 because experience and from formats of films 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:56.629
 until the end of dissolved it went like

 melenkimi handle in principle all work 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:06.680
 Well, that is, 23 degrees will work proven 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:09.949
