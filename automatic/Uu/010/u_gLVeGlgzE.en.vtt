00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
what I'm gonna do the easiest way I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.669 
what I'm gonna do the easiest way I
think<00:02:06.440> is<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.100> slice<00:02:07.369> long<00:02:08.270> big<00:02:08.720> long<00:02:09.170> thick

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
think is to slice long big long thick

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:19.060 
think is to slice long big long thick
slices<00:02:10.340> from<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.239> top<00:02:11.600> down<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:17.800> little<00:02:18.800> extra

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
slices from the top down a little extra

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.900 
slices from the top down a little extra
seeds<00:02:19.310> here<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:19.790> chop<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.090> off<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.670> like

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
seeds here just chop that off so I like

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.780 
seeds here just chop that off so I like
nice<00:02:23.330> thick<00:02:23.810> slices<00:02:24.110> about<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.860> but

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
nice thick slices about like this but

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
nice thick slices about like this but
you<00:02:25.880> can<00:02:26.000> cut<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.209> vide<00:02:26.420> what<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.660> want

getting rid of the extra seeds so again
starting<00:02:37.900> from<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.170> top<00:02:38.349> using<00:02:38.709> my<00:02:38.799> nice<00:02:39.010> flat

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
starting from the top using my nice flat

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.899 
starting from the top using my nice flat
surface<00:02:39.549> I<00:02:39.970> can<00:02:40.659> go<00:02:40.840> either<00:02:41.019> way<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:42.519> this<00:02:42.730> site

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
surface I can go either way if this site

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.280 
surface I can go either way if this site
seems<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.239> little<00:02:43.450> bigger<00:02:43.659> a<00:02:43.870> little<00:02:43.930> more

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
seems a little bigger a little more

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.839 
seems a little bigger a little more
stable<00:02:44.500> that's<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.159> side<00:02:45.340> I'm<00:02:45.459> going<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.670> cut

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
stable that's the side I'm going to cut

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:53.399 
stable that's the side I'm going to cut
them<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:52.000> these<00:02:52.209> makes<00:02:52.480> really<00:02:52.720> good<00:02:53.079> thick

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
them and these makes really good thick

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.280 
them and these makes really good thick
pieces<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:54.340> other<00:02:54.370> option<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.540> quarter<00:02:56.140> so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
pieces the other option is to quarter so

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.099 
pieces the other option is to quarter so
I'd<00:02:56.379> have<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.790> squash<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.239> other<00:02:58.390> option<00:02:59.019> is

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
I'd have to squash the other option is

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.680 
I'd have to squash the other option is
to<00:02:59.140> quarter<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.739> squash<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.879> wanted<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.599> do

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
to quarter the squash so I wanted to do

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.729 
to quarter the squash so I wanted to do
it<00:03:02.459> easy<00:03:03.459> actually<00:03:03.609> did<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:03.939> on<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:04.209> one<00:03:04.739> I've

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
it easy actually did it on this one I've

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.080 
it easy actually did it on this one I've
quartered<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> squash<00:03:06.640> now<00:03:06.909> it's<00:03:07.299> up<00:03:07.420> got

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
quartered the squash now it's up got

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.520 
quartered the squash now it's up got
lots<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.180> good<00:03:10.329> choices<00:03:10.510> for<00:03:10.930> sites<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.349> cut

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
lots of good choices for sites to cut

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.259 
lots of good choices for sites to cut
off<00:03:11.620> up<00:03:11.829> so<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.459> can<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:13.120> hold<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:16.090> like

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
off up so I can just hold it it's like

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.240 
off up so I can just hold it it's like
sometimes<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:17.260> almost<00:03:17.440> easier<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.010> do<00:03:18.129> with

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
sometimes it's almost easier to do with

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.729 
sometimes it's almost easier to do with
little<00:03:18.430> smaller<00:03:19.060> sections<00:03:19.599> and<00:03:20.560> I'm<00:03:20.650> just

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
little smaller sections and I'm just

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.210 
little smaller sections and I'm just
going<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:20.920> keep<00:03:21.069> going<00:03:21.220> through<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.670> until<00:03:22.120> I

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
going to keep going through that until I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.610 
going to keep going through that until I
am<00:03:24.220> done<00:03:24.639> you<00:03:25.420> can<00:03:26.019> see<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.290> start<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.500> get

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
am done you can see it start to get

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.649 
am done you can see it start to get
thinner<00:03:26.889> why<00:03:27.639> don't<00:03:27.790> be<00:03:27.879> careful<00:03:28.120> watch<00:03:28.420> those

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
thinner why don't be careful watch those

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:36.199 
thinner why don't be careful watch those
fingers<00:03:29.609> don't<00:03:30.609> want<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.790> lose<00:03:30.879> a<00:03:30.909> digit

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.740 

get<00:03:36.750> down<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.049> very<00:03:37.290> end<00:03:41.329> there<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.390> go

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
get down to the very end there you go

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.210 
get down to the very end there you go
so<00:03:42.930> now<00:03:43.079> I've<00:03:43.200> got<00:03:43.349> some<00:03:43.530> big<00:03:43.709> thick<00:03:43.950> pieces

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
so now I've got some big thick pieces

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.089 
so now I've got some big thick pieces
some<00:03:44.819> small<00:03:45.030> thin<00:03:45.269> pieces<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.829> can<00:03:46.950> just

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
some small thin pieces and you can just

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.470 
some small thin pieces and you can just
go<00:03:47.189> from<00:03:47.310> there<00:03:47.459> kind<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.760> make<00:03:47.879> it<00:03:47.909> as<00:03:48.239> thick

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
go from there kind of make it as thick

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.050 
go from there kind of make it as thick
or<00:03:48.510> as<00:03:48.659> thin<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.049> want<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.310> that's<00:03:50.819> the
