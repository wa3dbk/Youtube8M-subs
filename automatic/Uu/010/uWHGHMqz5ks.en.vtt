00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
ball through the court was very easy but

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680 
ball through the court was very easy but
also<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.940> ripped<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.570> as

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
also if you really ripped up on it as

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.690 
also if you really ripped up on it as
long<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:39.930> you're<00:00:40.079> making<00:00:40.200> decent<00:00:40.710> contact<00:00:41.309> you

can<00:00:41.820> hit<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.360> spin<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:42.930> well

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
can hit a lot of spin with it as well

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
can hit a lot of spin with it as well
serving<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:45.059> easy<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
serving with it was very easy you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
serving with it was very easy you
definitely<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.920> exactly<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> put

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
definitely got out exactly what you put

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.549 
definitely got out exactly what you put
it<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.480> you're<00:00:48.600> nice<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> relaxed<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it and if you're nice and relaxed and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.720 
it and if you're nice and relaxed and
smooth<00:00:49.860> through<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> swing<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> racket

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
smooth through the swing the racket

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.130 
smooth through the swing the racket
would<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> ball<00:00:52.079> through

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
would really really get the ball through

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
beginning it doesn't play as though it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270

an<00:01:17.640> 89<00:01:18.000> when<00:01:18.360> what<00:01:18.659> they've<00:01:18.780> done<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.280> shorter

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
an 89 when what they've done is shorter

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.999 
width so with most or mid rackets what
they'll<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.229> they'll<00:01:25.439> shrink<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> overall

size whereas with this they've kept

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.560 
size whereas with this they've kept
somewhat<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.860> wider<00:01:29.100> string<00:01:29.759> bed<00:01:29.970> or

somewhat a lot of wider string bed or
shortened<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.470> throat<00:01:31.710> may<00:01:31.860> look<00:01:32.009> a

shortened it so the throat may look a
little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.310> longer<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> allows<00:01:33.780> the

little bit longer but it allows the
