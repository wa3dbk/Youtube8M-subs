right<00:02:22.900> here<00:02:22.960> so<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.800> was<00:02:23.950> actually<00:02:24.130> really

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
right here so I was actually really

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.100 
right here so I was actually really
surprised<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.790> he<00:02:25.000> could<00:02:25.150> hold<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.900> amount

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
surprised that he could hold the amount

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.050 
surprised that he could hold the amount
of<00:02:26.170> speed<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.560> angle<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.890> he's<00:02:27.100> doing<00:02:27.460> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
of speed and angle that he's doing the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.490 
of speed and angle that he's doing the
reason<00:02:28.390> why<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> didn't<00:02:28.780> really<00:02:28.930> pick<00:02:29.080> this<00:02:29.260> for

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
reason why I didn't really pick this for

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.440 
reason why I didn't really pick this for
first<00:02:29.770> place<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.280> week<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:31.000> felt<00:02:31.270> that
