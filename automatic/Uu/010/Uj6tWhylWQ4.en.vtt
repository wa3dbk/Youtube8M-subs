little things at the top here come loose

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.350 
little things at the top here come loose
a<00:00:54.690> lot<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> time<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:56.940> can't

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
a lot of the time and you really can't

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.529 
a lot of the time and you really can't
do<00:00:57.449> anything<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.820> over<00:00:59.820> time<00:01:00.030> they'd

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
do anything about it so over time they'd

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.039 
do anything about it so over time they'd
just<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> become<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.789> know

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
just be kind of kind of become you know

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.460 
just be kind of kind of become you know
just<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.199> loose<00:01:05.010> knife<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:07.170> doesn't

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
just a loose knife and just doesn't

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.399 
just a loose knife and just doesn't
function<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.979> well<00:01:08.040> after<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> while<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
function very well after a while and you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.230 
function very well after a while and you
know<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.439> fast<00:01:14.509> spring<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:16.080> here

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
know it's a really fast spring in here

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.810 
know it's a really fast spring in here
but<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.130> pretty<00:01:20.130> flawed<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.640> know

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
but it is pretty flawed and I don't know

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
but it is pretty flawed and I don't know
if<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.259> particular<00:01:25.560> knife

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
if it's just this one particular knife

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.289 
if it's just this one particular knife
or<00:01:26.869> if<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
or if all of them are like this I know I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
or if all of them are like this I know I
have<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> black<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.350> has<00:01:31.530> no<00:01:31.920> problems

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
have a black one that has no problems

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
have a black one that has no problems
whatsoever<00:01:33.320> but<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.380> don't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
whatsoever but this one if you you don't

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
whatsoever but this one if you you don't
even<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> hit<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> button<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.329> just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
even have to hit the button you can just

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.510 
even have to hit the button you can just
press<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.170> right<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.600> it'll<00:01:42.960> open

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
press it right up here and it'll open

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.670 
press it right up here and it'll open
it's<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:45.060> screwed<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.320> can't

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it's really screwed up and I can't

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.139 
it's really screwed up and I can't
exactly<00:01:47.640> figure<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:49.670> why<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.850> doing<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
exactly figure out why it's doing that

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.270 
exactly figure out why it's doing that
and<00:01:51.540> I've<00:01:51.840> looked<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.590> by<00:01:53.009> pressing

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and I've looked in there and by pressing

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
and I've looked in there and by pressing
that<00:01:53.610> spot<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.119> doesn't<00:01:54.390> seem<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> be

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that spot it doesn't seem to be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.160 
that spot it doesn't seem to be
triggering<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> release<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:57.119> I'm<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:58.020> really

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
triggering the release so I'm not really

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.039 
triggering the release so I'm not really
sure<00:01:58.409> what's<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.750> it's<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
sure what's going on but it's not a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.959 
sure what's going on but it's not a
reliable<00:02:01.439> knife<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:02.040> all<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.759> it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
reliable knife at all and it's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.399 
reliable knife at all and it's
definitely<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.869> carrying<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.380> your

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
definitely not for carrying in your

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.469 
definitely not for carrying in your
pocket<00:02:05.479> places<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> go<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:07.110> utilities<00:02:08.479> first

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
pocket places you go or utilities first

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.210 
pocket places you go or utilities first
of<00:02:09.629> all<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> blade<00:02:10.080> does<00:02:10.259> not<00:02:10.410> need<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.190> be

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
of all the blade does not need to be

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.220 
of all the blade does not need to be
used<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> utility<00:02:12.030> knife

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
used as a utility knife

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.210 
used as a utility knife
so<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.849> it's<00:02:15.209> just<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.900> show<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.560> no

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so that it's just for show really no

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.030 
so that it's just for show really no
that's<00:02:17.430> all<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> use<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:20.000> but<00:02:22.010> although<00:02:23.010> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that's all I use it for but although I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.130 
that's all I use it for but although I
don't<00:02:23.190> recommend<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.690> still<00:02:24.959> buy<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
don't recommend it you can still buy it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.339 
don't recommend it you can still buy it
and<00:02:26.360> hopefully<00:02:27.360> it'll<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.660> better<00:02:27.989> one<00:02:28.230> than

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and hopefully it'll be a better one than

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.589 
and hopefully it'll be a better one than
this<00:02:28.560> without<00:02:29.099> all<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.550> porks<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.150> problems
