00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.740
 Well 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.659
 the country Berlin 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.369
 This time this study tiger bone and other body 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.649
 and that's when the viewers started their new edition of their regional magazine 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.630
 who can be at any time "Today is Monday and we want to join the new week 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.840
 Of course, we welcome fresh ideas that will become the end of the world 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.280
 because the city 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.949
 the stamp card the reports about a Bremen company's work assignments 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.300
 they say setter theater our despite his age are the address of 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.899
 let the 67-year-old should be on the road on the road 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.899
 Health Week in Bremerhaven 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.190
 he was put in the second half of the 18th 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.650
 It was also invented in the century of industrialization 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.409
 Germany is an important component in many operated 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.729
 It not only informs the employer how long his 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:17.920
 Employees work 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.340
 but also how often they are sick if she is late he says PP so 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.220
 It can also record longer periods of data the theft tracks 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.560
 need in this day and age 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.149
 no longer at the entrance of a company impose a Bremen company has one 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.619
 Program developed for mobile phones and computers 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.170
 that the good old time clock as we know it replaced with the code of the tour 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.420
 EPT is the name of pop or worker can via No Beer phone 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.329
 log in to the employer no matter where in the world they are ours 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.329
 Colleague Julia Eder at all mobile work planning 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.430
 Here all cables come together 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.540
 in the technical room of the Neustadt company about two and a half years ago, the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.540
 Bremen software developer to work on a new project 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.429
 the name is a tip for 1 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.060
 what is behind it explains Volker Bloch 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.360
 at the protest movement Einsatzplanung 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.819
 the list flavors 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.919
 show that 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.829
 a service company 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.829
 Can capture times 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.769
 This means that individual employees are required 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.839
 his times directly over the mobile phone 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.829
 Obviously otherwise Chris means he needs to place himself directly 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.099
 Orders in 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.529
 and put into operation immediately 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.799
 before that I confess and in the evening to immediately all times too 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.409
 by the new software his previously used magnetic boards and the 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.470
 Zettelwirtschaft 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.200
 redundant in the operational planning for employees and the whole 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.280
 Process designed to be more clearly emphasized flat 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.499
 would be needed 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.339
 a calculator for planning 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.449
 with internet access and a mobile phone 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.169
 that's basically everything 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.560
 the construction company stands for Staudt is one of the users of hiding back 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.840
 Managing Director Thomas StÃ¤hlker Steinbach a small review of the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.129
 History of mission planning in his company 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.370
 that has with its whimsical Washington 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.419
 Cap 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.040
 so that all those ranked 4 times with fewer employees and one 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.739
 Inexcusable we were 15 years ago 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.529
 and that could make it very easy for us to do that on a four sheet 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.379
 written down 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.909
 Then it became one of the nine counters 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.449
 to get a few more employees where employees allow construction supervisors 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.680
 and then you have to vote very intensively 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.889
 MW year employees report when and where planned 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.099
 then his advisors came together and are now site managers 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.279
 and we do not care about that 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.549
 a percent off or down and just because of these many small ones 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.829
 Today, employees can place a jobsite 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.139
 Completing timesheets simply by mobile phone to meet at the construction site 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.559
 given a tanker 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:57.299
 the start of work is transmitted to the operations center 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.090
 At the same time the court is expected at the location in the system 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.129
 saved 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.820
 and access the data from the office 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.030
 because always an internet connection is needed because the actual software 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.409
 is located on the server near Neustadt 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.379
 The system is completely at the Easter-sized poster for nonsense the advantage 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.900
 that we do not have to worry about whether the data backup now in love 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.509
 this works for us as a quasi a current Wilhelm exactly like 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.849
 Once a banking session with a password client comes used up 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.849
 and I can do it from any point on earth that can not 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.590
 The sun can lie on organic and look it up 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.189
 if everything works 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:37.590
 on construction sites change during working hours can be reported by mobile phone 

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:42.180
 so that the project manager always knows who is working on a book 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.420
 on the screen is a part of this information to other virtual 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.400
 Magnetic board readable 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.490
 colored markings and various symbols give an overview of the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.330
 current status in collaboration with the users of Project Clockwork 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
 worked continuously on improving the software 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.100
 during the adjustment rate union 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.070
 pretend that the 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.360
 can be used for the masses that is 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.749
 there will be no 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:14.020
 Change a frozen to fit only for a single solution 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.789
 but if it is always an advantage for all users and it works too 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.800
 not on 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.050
 By electronically capturing the data, there will be plenty of time for the exam 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.620
 earn the hour 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.650
 and their transmission saved in the system so put when the 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.130
 Employees at the end of the day also within a few seconds by mobile phone 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.130
 out again 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.310
 he asked his mobile time clock flute 2 degrees is a versatile 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.970
 program 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.020
 with several applications where the advantages lie 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.190
 I'll talk about that here in the studio with the manager of the 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.349
 Rebuilding Rainer Weith after my friend
