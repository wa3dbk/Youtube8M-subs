 application that is called one tab was 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.609

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.490
 that cleans your cache ie the cache 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.560

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.579
 and we search and right now I do not have 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.170
 and well this we can what we can 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:31.070
 do with this application is to erase 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.100
 the applications cache the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.430
