00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.719 
pastels the only little recommendation I
have<00:02:01.969> is<00:02:02.179> that<00:02:02.359> maybe<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:03.139> should<00:02:03.560> add<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.009> bit

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
have is that maybe you should add a bit

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.209 
have is that maybe you should add a bit
more<00:02:04.759> texture<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.749> bottom<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.409> shade<00:02:07.069> it

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
more texture to the bottom and shade it

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.279 
more texture to the bottom and shade it
a<00:02:07.369> bit<00:02:07.549> more<00:02:07.729> with<00:02:07.969> pastels<00:02:08.630> because<00:02:09.140> it

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
a bit more with pastels because it

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.590 
a bit more with pastels because it
doesn't<00:02:09.680> look<00:02:09.860> as<00:02:10.010> shaded<00:02:10.520> i<00:02:10.700> think<00:02:11.480> it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
doesn't look as shaded i think it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.600 
doesn't look as shaded i think it
probably<00:02:11.630> was<00:02:12.320> shaded<00:02:13.040> but<00:02:13.280> then<00:02:13.430> when<00:02:13.580> you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
probably was shaded but then when you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.770 
probably was shaded but then when you
bake<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:13.940> 10

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
bake it 10

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.559 
bake it 10
like<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.110> tends<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.790> shading<00:02:17.150> tons<00:02:17.360> of

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
like it tends to the shading tons of

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.690 
like it tends to the shading tons of
fate<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.410> maybe<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.709> should<00:02:18.980> use<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> bit

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
fate of it so maybe you should use a bit

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.449 
fate of it so maybe you should use a bit
darker<00:02:20.090> shading<00:02:20.709> but<00:02:21.709> other<00:02:21.890> than<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.160> this

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
darker shading but other than that this

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.960 
darker shading but other than that this
is<00:02:22.670> wonderful<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:24.130> then<00:02:25.130> she<00:02:25.520> sent<00:02:25.760> me<00:02:25.940> this

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
is wonderful and then she sent me this

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.500 
is wonderful and then she sent me this

it's<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.269> cute<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.810> think<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:01.130> could<00:03:01.580> actually

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
it's so cute I think you could actually

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.330 
it's so cute I think you could actually
make<00:03:02.600> bigger<00:03:03.290> ones<00:03:03.590> because<00:03:03.860> look<00:03:03.980> how<00:03:04.010> tiny

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
make bigger ones because look how tiny

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.790 
make bigger ones because look how tiny
this<00:03:04.580> is<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.450> could<00:03:05.600> sell<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:06.019> one<00:03:06.260> as<00:03:06.530> a

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
this is and you could sell this one as a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.430 
this is and you could sell this one as a
charm<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.940> bigger<00:03:08.209> one<00:03:08.450> as<00:03:08.660> like<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> pendant

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
charm and a bigger one as like a pendant

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.090 
charm and a bigger one as like a pendant
or<00:03:09.590> key<00:03:10.100> chain<00:03:10.340> sized<00:03:10.580> for<00:03:11.420> more<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.530> think

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
or key chain sized for more and I think

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.580 
or key chain sized for more and I think
a<00:03:13.400> lot<00:03:13.430> more<00:03:13.819> people<00:03:14.150> would<00:03:14.330> buy<00:03:14.540> both<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.260> them

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
a lot more people would buy both of them

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.900 
a lot more people would buy both of them
so<00:03:15.800> they<00:03:15.890> could<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.160> matching<00:03:16.610> ones<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
so they could have matching ones so the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.910 
so they could have matching ones so the
last<00:03:20.090> thing<00:03:20.329> she<00:03:20.750> sent<00:03:21.230> me<00:03:21.380> with<00:03:21.530> in<00:03:21.769> this

anytime<00:03:47.420> soon<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.440> only<00:03:48.620> suggestion<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.370> have

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
anytime soon the only suggestion I have

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.360 
anytime soon the only suggestion I have
is<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:49.970> maybe<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.810> should<00:03:51.230> more<00:03:51.950> evenly

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
is that maybe you should more evenly

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.520 
is that maybe you should more evenly
distribute<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.420> red<00:03:53.600> glitter<00:03:53.900> on<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.320> Rose

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
distribute the red glitter on the Rose

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.500 
distribute the red glitter on the Rose
because<00:03:54.799> towards<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.400> middle<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:56.030> doesn't

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
because towards the middle it doesn't

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.360 
because towards the middle it doesn't
look<00:03:56.540> like<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.870> has<00:03:57.049> much<00:03:57.410> glitter<00:03:57.739> as<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
look like it has much glitter as the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.229 
look like it has much glitter as the
center<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.329> outsides<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:01.160> that's<00:04:01.760> all<00:04:02.209> I
