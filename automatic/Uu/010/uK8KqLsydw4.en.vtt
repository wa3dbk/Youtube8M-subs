00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
and as long as you do that you're gonna

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.180 
and as long as you do that you're gonna
be<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> success<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.780> don't<00:03:01.440> start<00:03:01.680> doing<00:03:02.070> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
be a success just don't start doing it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.680 
be a success just don't start doing it
and<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:02.850> again<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.510> quit

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
and then think again that you can quit

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.480 
and then think again that you can quit
doing<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:03.990> later<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.560> keep<00:03:04.860> your<00:03:05.040> results

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
doing it later and keep your results

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.270 
doing it later and keep your results
again<00:03:05.730> guys<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.300> does<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.720> work<00:03:07.020> like<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.290> in

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
again guys it does not work like that in

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.620 
again guys it does not work like that in
