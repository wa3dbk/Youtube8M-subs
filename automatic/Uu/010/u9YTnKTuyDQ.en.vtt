spike hasn't been anywhere near this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.540 
spike hasn't been anywhere near this
because<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:40.230> started<00:00:40.800> breaking<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> first

because it started breaking on the first
day<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> didn't<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.780> 15<00:00:43.290> month<00:00:43.500> old<00:00:43.649> would

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.529 
day so I didn't think 15 month old would
treat<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.879> nicely<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:47.270> pops<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
treat it that nicely this pops in and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
out with like that sort of attachment
but<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.760> flick<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329

light<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:34.280> bludgeon<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.390> would<00:01:36.479> be

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
light up a bludgeon so there would be

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350 
light up a bludgeon so there would be
the<00:01:36.689> ladder<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.610> that's<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.850> far<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.119> we're

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
going it doesn't go any further in

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.170 
going it doesn't go any further in
without<00:01:42.689> pushing<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.100> buckles<00:01:45.000> on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.050 
without pushing it which then buckles on
the<00:01:45.689> roof<00:01:46.110> ball<00:01:46.530> makes<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> ladder<00:01:47.579> sit<00:01:47.880> or

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the roof ball makes the ladder sit or

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.539 
the roof ball makes the ladder sit or
not<00:01:48.270> angry<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.829> then<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.310> a

had it on an ikea toddler table so a

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.110 
had it on an ikea toddler table so a
couple<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.350> feet<00:03:38.530> off<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.769> ground<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.340> he<00:03:40.000> was

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
couple of feet off the ground and he was

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.949 
couple of feet off the ground and he was
trying<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.690> put<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.110> ladder<00:03:41.260> back<00:03:41.500> up<00:03:41.680> because

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
trying to put the ladder back up because

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.020 
trying to put the ladder back up because
again<00:03:43.959> it's<00:03:44.260> this<00:03:44.410> fitting<00:03:44.920> which<00:03:45.549> was<00:03:45.790> quite

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
again it's this fitting which was quite

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.600 
again it's this fitting which was quite
secure<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.780> first<00:03:47.049> day<00:03:47.350> but<00:03:48.040> since<00:03:48.370> then

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
secure on the first day but since then

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.460 
secure on the first day but since then
it's<00:03:48.790> just<00:03:48.850> become<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.510> loosely<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:50.019> falls<00:03:50.260> off

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
it's just become so loosely it falls off

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.580 
it's just become so loosely it falls off
really<00:03:50.739> easily<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:52.150> fire<00:03:52.600> engine<00:03:52.810> rolled<00:03:53.350> off

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
really easily the fire engine rolled off

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.770 
really easily the fire engine rolled off
the<00:03:53.830> table<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:55.600> as<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.110> can<00:03:56.290> see<00:03:56.400> we've<00:03:57.400> lost

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the table and as you can see we've lost

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.039 
the table and as you can see we've lost
that<00:03:58.780> bit<00:03:59.049> again<00:03:59.769> and<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:01.209> siren<00:04:01.750> which<00:04:01.900> is

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
that bit again and the siren which is

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.360 
that bit again and the siren which is
screwed<00:04:02.470> on<00:04:02.820> snapped<00:04:03.820> in<00:04:04.030> two<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:05.370> we've

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
screwed on snapped in two and we've

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.110 
screwed on snapped in two and we've
still<00:04:06.670> got<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> little<00:04:07.180> bit<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:08.610> splintering<00:04:09.610> on

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
still got a little bit of splintering on

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.839 
still got a little bit of splintering on
the<00:04:10.569> join<00:04:10.870> there

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
the join there

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.180 
the join there
and<00:04:12.849> also<00:04:13.150> on<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:15.060> ladder<00:04:16.060> now<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.350> agree<00:04:17.979> that

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
and also on the ladder now I agree that

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.729 
and also on the ladder now I agree that
toys<00:04:18.430> shouldn't<00:04:18.970> be<00:04:19.120> dropped<00:04:19.660> from<00:04:19.930> two<00:04:20.470> foot

however<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.910> disagree<00:04:22.539> that<00:04:22.780> when<00:04:23.050> you're

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
shouldn't have some sort of durability

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.730 
shouldn't have some sort of durability
or<00:04:27.880> resistance<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.810> bounce<00:04:29.169> because<00:04:29.530> I

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
maybe they need to increase the age

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.279 
maybe they need to increase the age
limit<00:04:53.710> or<00:04:53.830> something<00:04:54.310> but<00:04:56.009> that<00:04:57.009> just<00:04:58.289> for
