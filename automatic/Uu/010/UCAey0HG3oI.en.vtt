hi<00:00:02.060> I'm<00:00:03.060> John<00:00:03.389> Perillo<00:00:04.400> in<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.700> video<00:00:06.120> we're

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
hi I'm John Perillo in this video we're

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.049 
hi I'm John Perillo in this video we're
going<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.230> do<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> little<00:00:07.740> primer<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.519> calves

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
going to do a little primer on calves

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.890 
going to do a little primer on calves
and<00:00:09.389> show<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.660> how<00:00:09.870> isolate<00:00:10.590> your<00:00:10.830> soleus<00:00:11.900> so

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
and show you how isolate your soleus so

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.959 
and show you how isolate your soleus so
you<00:00:12.960> get<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.500> big<00:00:13.769> diamond-shaped<00:00:14.610> calves

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
you get that big diamond-shaped calves

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.390 
you get that big diamond-shaped calves
now<00:00:15.360> most<00:00:15.780> people<00:00:16.020> think<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.770> calves<00:00:17.100> are

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
now most people think that calves are

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.269 
now most people think that calves are
really<00:00:17.430> hard<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.300> make<00:00:18.510> grow<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.770> actually

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
really hard to make grow it's actually

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.050 
really hard to make grow it's actually
easy<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.970> make<00:00:21.150> your<00:00:21.390> calves<00:00:21.720> grow<00:00:22.730> but<00:00:23.730> it's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
easy to make your calves grow but it's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.200 
easy to make your calves grow but it's
not<00:00:24.420> easy<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.260> because<00:00:25.590> calf's<00:00:26.279> your

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
not easy to do because calf's your

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.390 
not easy to do because calf's your
calves<00:00:27.510> are<00:00:27.750> basically<00:00:28.320> your<00:00:28.529> gastrin<00:00:29.070> amias

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
calves are basically your gastrin amias

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.049 
calves are basically your gastrin amias
and<00:00:29.640> soleus<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.859> slow<00:00:31.859> twitch<00:00:32.160> muscle<00:00:32.610> fibers

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and soleus are slow twitch muscle fibers

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.760 
and soleus are slow twitch muscle fibers
and<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.329> real<00:00:33.510> hard<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.930> fatigue<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.590> if

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and it's real hard to fatigue them if

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520 
and it's real hard to fatigue them if
you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.670> fatigue<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.170> make<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you can fatigue them you can make the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
you can fatigue them you can make the
calf's<00:00:37.800> grow<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.610> you've<00:00:38.790> got<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> lot

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
calf's grow but you've got to do a lot

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.229 
calf's grow but you've got to do a lot
of<00:00:39.480> reps<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:40.200> real<00:00:41.100> quick<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.550> calves<00:00:42.000> your

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
of reps now real quick on calves your

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.740 
of reps now real quick on calves your
your<00:00:42.989> gastrin<00:00:43.680> amias<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.640> shelf<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.480> see

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
your gastrin amias is the shelf you see

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
your gastrin amias is the shelf you see
on<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.050> calf<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.649> Nate<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.129> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> show

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
on your calf if Nate you want to show

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.049 
on your calf if Nate you want to show
you<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.390> gastrin<00:00:48.870> amias<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:50.059> that's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
you the gastrin amias right here that's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.720 
you the gastrin amias right here that's
the<00:00:51.390> shelf<00:00:51.690> okay<00:00:52.129> under<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.309> lies<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:55.020> soleus

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the shelf okay under it lies the soleus

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
the shelf okay under it lies the soleus
now<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> soleus<00:00:57.570> ties<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.379> tie<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.859> together

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
now the soleus ties a tie in together

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.970 
now the soleus ties a tie in together
and<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.910> move<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.449> heel<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.500> soleus

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and and move your heel up the soleus

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.130 
and and move your heel up the soleus
ties<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.879> lower<00:01:03.180> leg<00:01:03.510> bone<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
ties in to your lower leg bone the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
ties in to your lower leg bone the
gastrin<00:01:04.619> emia<00:01:04.890> sties<00:01:05.220> into<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.760> upper<00:01:06.090> leg

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
gastrin emia sties into your upper leg

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.070 
gastrin emia sties into your upper leg
your<00:01:06.570> femur<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.840> legs

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
your femur so it can get if your legs

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
your femur so it can get if your legs
are<00:01:10.290> straight<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
are straight you can get a lot of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.300 
are straight you can get a lot of
leverage<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> soleus<00:01:12.900> okay<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:14.070> can

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
leverage on the soleus okay if you can

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.179 
leverage on the soleus okay if you can
move<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.210> down<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.170> bend<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.590> knee<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
move that down and bend your knee and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.510 
move that down and bend your knee and
bend<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.270> back<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.500> soleus<00:01:20.159> really

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
bend it way back this soleus really

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
bend it way back this soleus really
can't<00:01:20.850> leg<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.240> sore<00:01:21.509> knee<00:01:21.659> meais<00:01:21.900> can't<00:01:22.229> get

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
can't leg a sore knee meais can't get

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.630 
can't leg a sore knee meais can't get
any<00:01:22.650> leverage<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
any leverage on it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
any leverage on it
so<00:01:24.060> you're<00:01:24.240> basically<00:01:24.390> isolating<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> soleus

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so you're basically isolating the soleus

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.340 
so you're basically isolating the soleus
it's<00:01:26.220> doing<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> work<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> gastrin

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
it's doing all the work now the gastrin

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.319 
it's doing all the work now the gastrin
amias<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:29.040> shelf<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.670> makes<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:30.060> calf

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
amias is your shelf that makes your calf

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.710 
amias is your shelf that makes your calf
stick<00:01:30.659> out<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.650> soleus<00:01:32.280> lies<00:01:32.880> underneath<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
stick out the soleus lies underneath it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
stick out the soleus lies underneath it
pushes<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.320> farther<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> build

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
pushes it out farther and when you build

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
pushes it out farther and when you build
it<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.240> gives<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.600> calf<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.079> big<00:01:37.259> diamond

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it up it gives a calf the big diamond

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
it up it gives a calf the big diamond
shape<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> fatigue<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.790> soleus<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
shape now to fatigue the soleus and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.370 
shape now to fatigue the soleus and
that's<00:01:42.479> probably<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> hardest

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that's probably one of the hardest

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.830 
that's probably one of the hardest
muscles<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:43.920> body<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.430> fatigue<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.600> have

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
muscles in your body to fatigue you have

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.910 
muscles in your body to fatigue you have
to<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.649> real<00:01:47.399> high<00:01:47.700> reps<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.930> Nate<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.770> is

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
to do real high reps so Nate here is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.760 
to do real high reps so Nate here is
going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> show<00:01:50.250> us<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> killer<00:01:51.780> calf

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
going to show us how to do a killer calf

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.060 
going to show us how to do a killer calf
workout<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:53.909> you'll<00:01:54.600> find<00:01:55.020> you'll<00:01:55.530> find<00:01:55.799> it's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
workout but you'll find you'll find it's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.609 
workout but you'll find you'll find it's
very<00:01:56.460> easy<00:01:56.909> although<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.869> easy<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.409> do

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
very easy although it's not easy to do

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.100 
very easy although it's not easy to do
but<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.009> easy<00:01:59.340> to<00:02:00.060> build<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.479> calves<00:02:00.810> if

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
but it's easy to build your calves if

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.539 
but it's easy to build your calves if
