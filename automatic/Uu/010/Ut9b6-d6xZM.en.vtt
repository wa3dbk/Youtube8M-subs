00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
constant is a in that we're doing a

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.970 
constant is a in that we're doing a
concert<00:02:54.329> in<00:02:54.450> Hawaii<00:02:54.689> but<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.349> mean<00:02:55.590> our<00:02:55.799> main

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
concert in Hawaii but I mean our main

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.240 
concert in Hawaii but I mean our main
focus<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.609> is<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:58.319> do<00:02:58.439> concert<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.129> know

focus really is it to do concert to know

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.459 
focus really is it to do concert to know
it's<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.639> it's<00:02:59.939> a<00:03:00.030> little<00:03:00.180> different<00:03:00.439> what<00:03:01.439> we

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
it's so it's a little different what we

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.410 
it's so it's a little different what we
wanted<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:01.889> do<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.219> just<00:03:02.459> spread<00:03:03.239> messages

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
wanted to do is just spread messages

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.710 
wanted to do is just spread messages
around<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.530> world<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.920> our<00:03:05.010> message<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.579> that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
around the world and our message is that

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.970 
around the world and our message is that
basically<00:03:06.720> all<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:07.019> us<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.470> same<00:03:07.500> belief

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
basically all of us have the same belief

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.949 
basically all of us have the same belief
or<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.430> really<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:08.939> believe<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.389> they<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.870> be

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959
