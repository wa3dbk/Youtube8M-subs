00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.309 
around but as you can see over time I
stayed<00:01:41.639> in<00:01:41.729> anaerobic<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.929> I<00:01:42.990> had<00:01:43.109> a<00:01:43.139> 2

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
stayed in anaerobic and then I had a 2

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.599 
stayed in anaerobic and then I had a 2
minute<00:01:43.530> cooldown<00:01:43.560> which<00:01:44.069> actually<00:01:44.369> stretched

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
minute cooldown which actually stretched

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.460 
minute cooldown which actually stretched
around<00:01:44.759> 4<00:01:45.149> minutes

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
around 4 minutes

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.280 
around 4 minutes
and<00:01:47.390> there's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.450> recovery<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:49.020> yeah<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> can

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and there's a recovery so yeah you can

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.860 
and there's a recovery so yeah you can
see<00:01:49.410> my<00:01:49.530> pace<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.010> petered<00:01:50.370> out<00:01:50.460> around<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.210> don't

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
see my pace I petered out around I don't

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.320 
see my pace I petered out around I don't
know<00:01:52.070> 12<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.250> 13<00:01:53.550> minutes<00:01:53.700> miles

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
know 12 to 13 minutes miles

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.940 
know 12 to 13 minutes miles
if<00:01:54.810> you've<00:01:54.990> ever<00:01:55.110> ran<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.650> side<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
if you've ever ran on the side of the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.070 
if you've ever ran on the side of the
Hudson<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.370> very<00:01:56.550> flat<00:01:57.000> place<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:57.990> that's

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
Hudson it's a very flat place so that's

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.530 
Hudson it's a very flat place so that's
why<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.320> rate<00:01:58.800> was<00:01:58.890> slow<00:01:59.270> anyway<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.450> see

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
why the rate was slow anyway you can see

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.110 
why the rate was slow anyway you can see
elevation<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:02.250> there's<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> actual<00:02:02.850> route

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
elevation and there's the actual route

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.250 
elevation and there's the actual route
to<00:02:03.330> where<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.540> went<00:02:03.660> all<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:03.930> down<00:02:04.110> from

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
to where I went all the way down from

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.389 
to where I went all the way down from
11th<00:02:04.680> Street<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.790> way<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.360> about

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
11th Street all the way up to about

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.889 
11th Street all the way up to about
basically<00:02:08.399> Central<00:02:08.670> Park<00:02:08.880> what<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.479> did<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> I

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
basically Central Park what I did is I

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.080 
basically Central Park what I did is I
basically<00:02:09.990> pulled<00:02:10.530> my<00:02:10.649> kids<00:02:10.890> along<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.460> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
basically pulled my kids along in the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.630 
basically pulled my kids along in the
park<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.510> burn<00:02:12.720> 100<00:02:13.350> calories<00:02:13.560> doing<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.370> I

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
park I burn 100 calories doing that I

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.660 
park I burn 100 calories doing that I
only<00:02:15.120> changed<00:02:15.510> elevation<00:02:16.020> two<00:02:16.230> feet<00:02:16.470> um<00:02:16.710> as

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
only changed elevation two feet um as

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.220 
only changed elevation two feet um as
you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.060> wasn't<00:02:18.240> very<00:02:18.450> hard<00:02:19.020> for<00:02:19.140> me

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
you can see it wasn't very hard for me

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.160 
you can see it wasn't very hard for me
to<00:02:19.260> do<00:02:19.970> my<00:02:20.970> paces<00:02:21.360> over<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.660> map<00:02:21.810> because<00:02:22.050> my

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
to do my paces over the map because my

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.450 
to do my paces over the map because my
kids<00:02:22.350> had<00:02:22.500> followed<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.690> wagon<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:26.280> here's

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
kids had followed the wagon and here's

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.860 
kids had followed the wagon and here's
where<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.640> went<00:02:26.820> all<00:02:27.000> over<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.210> park<00:02:27.480> back<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
where I went all over the park back to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.390 
where I went all over the park back to
my<00:02:28.260> apartment<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.740> West<00:02:28.800> Village<00:02:28.980> all

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
my apartment in the West Village all

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.560 
my apartment in the West Village all
right<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:29.670> that's<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> elevations<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.450> can

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
right so that's the elevations you can

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.840 
right so that's the elevations you can
actually<00:02:30.690> see<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.230> laps<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:32.490> zero<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
actually see the laps and then zero to

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.700 
actually see the laps and then zero to
one<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.240> didn't<00:02:34.080> really<00:02:34.260> actually<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> whole

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
one I didn't really actually do a whole

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.440 
one I didn't really actually do a whole
mile<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.250> it'll<00:02:35.400> actually<00:02:35.520> count<00:02:35.910> where<00:02:36.210> you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
mile but it'll actually count where you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.330 
mile but it'll actually count where you
actually<00:02:36.720> did<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> mile<00:02:37.080> or<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> lap<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.250> you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
actually did a mile or a lap so if you

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.630 
actually did a mile or a lap so if you
have<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> very<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.330> know<00:02:39.420> changing<00:02:40.520> place<00:02:41.520> you

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
have a very you know changing place you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.490 
have a very you know changing place you
go<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.780> about<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.990> notes<00:02:43.260> is

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
go what I like about the notes is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.930 
go what I like about the notes is
actually<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:43.920> say<00:02:44.100> what<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.490> workout<00:02:44.820> was

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
actually can say what the workout was

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.690 
actually can say what the workout was
called<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:46.380> actual<00:02:46.950> rating<00:02:47.280> whether<00:02:47.520> it's

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
called the actual rating whether it's

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.520 
called the actual rating whether it's
you<00:02:47.880> know<00:02:47.970> really<00:02:48.600> good<00:02:48.900> I'm<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.380> put<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you know really good I'm going to put a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.340 
you know really good I'm going to put a
five<00:02:49.680> star<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.760> was<00:02:50.910> easy<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:51.750> pie<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.200> when<00:02:52.320> I

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
five star it was easy as pie so when I

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.770 
five star it was easy as pie so when I
marked<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.620> easy<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.459> I'm<00:02:54.209> say<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.390> was<00:02:54.570> feeling

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
marked it easy and I'm say I was feeling

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.220 
marked it easy and I'm say I was feeling
great<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:56.390> party<00:02:57.420> mostly<00:02:57.959> cloudy

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230

everything on the cloud so my iPhone

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.640 
everything on the cloud so my iPhone
gets<00:03:13.350> dropped<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> pool<00:03:13.950> again<00:03:14.989> then<00:03:15.989> I'll

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
gets dropped in the pool again then I'll

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.470 
gets dropped in the pool again then I'll
have<00:03:16.800> all<00:03:16.920> my<00:03:17.040> data<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.489> don't<00:03:17.550> lose<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.269> can

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
have all my data I don't lose it I can

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.729 
have all my data I don't lose it I can
also<00:03:18.570> use<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.930> iPad<00:03:19.080> I've<00:03:19.530> done<00:03:19.650> that

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.410 
also use it on the iPad I've done that
before<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.730> thing<00:03:20.940> will<00:03:21.030> actually<00:03:21.060> work<00:03:21.360> on

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
before this thing will actually work on
