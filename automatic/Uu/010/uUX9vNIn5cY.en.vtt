coupler<00:01:06.900> from<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> bottom<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:10.020> pop<00:01:10.229> your

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
coupler from the bottom you pop your

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620

clips off your well you lay it on the
back<00:01:12.810> side<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.200> careful<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:14.360> these

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
back side be careful because these

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.810 
back side be careful because these
plastic<00:01:15.930> things<00:01:16.220> either<00:01:17.220> tendency<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> break

need<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.820> moving<00:01:24.150> parts<00:01:25.040> these<00:01:26.040> springs<00:01:26.490> here

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
need of moving parts these springs here

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.490 
need of moving parts these springs here
see<00:01:28.590> depending<00:01:29.250> upon<00:01:29.369> who's<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> shift

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
see depending upon who's on the shift

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
see depending upon who's on the shift
some<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> these<00:01:31.680> things<00:01:31.920> may<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.189> may<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.549> have

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
some of these things may or may not have

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.340 
some of these things may or may not have
gotten<00:01:33.270> lubed<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
gotten lubed so I was little bit and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
gotten lubed so I was little bit and
this<00:01:37.470> one<00:01:37.710> particularly<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.930> always<00:01:39.930> put

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this one particularly I always put

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.910 
this one particularly I always put
because<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.189> wears<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.939> fastest

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
because that one wears out the fastest

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
because that one wears out the fastest
so<00:01:44.490> basically<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.060> order<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.300> put<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.600> drive

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so basically in order to put your drive

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.980 
so basically in order to put your drive
