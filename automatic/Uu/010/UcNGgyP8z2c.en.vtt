00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.670
 this new video tutorial series on 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.410
 an apple keynote application 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.599
 this application exactly like 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.030
 microsoft power point allows us to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.450
 create animated presentations 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.980
 multimedia 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.980
 let's see how it looks 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.160
 the home screen is similar to that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.030
 that we have already found on pages and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 numbers 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.300
 we have an area that collects all the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.270
 documents created is an upper bar 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.129
 with useful buttons we can then 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.989
 create a new presentation 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.040
 choosing from the proposed themes 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.110
 or starting from scratch we could 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.590
 copy a presentation file already 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.620
 ready from itunes or from a hard disk the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 web where we can access the help 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.550
 edit documents when there 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.280
 we have someone I will show you now 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.670
 if he created a document we do that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.690
 he created a white one and a black one as 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 template 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.820
 ok with the edit button we can 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 select 12 to duplicate or delete them e 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 then we can still drag one 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.960
 on the other our documents to create 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.950
 a folder to also be able to rename 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.730
 obviously even documents can 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.620
 be renamed as we have already seen 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.680
 with other pages and tutorials 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.730
 numbers the other button that activates 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.920
 when we have documents a 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.470
 arrangement is that of sharing 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.530
 that we're going to deal with a bet on 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.050
 hoc while a new button that not 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.770
 we have ever found on pages numbers and 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.530
 this is the keynote remote control 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.310
 we can use an ipad or a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 other iphone mac etc to be able to 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.910
 check a presentation up to 8 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.930
 on another compatible device 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.430
 so in this case we could 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.060
 use our ipad as the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.390
 TV remote 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.340
 but if we use keynotes on ours 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.599
 iphone we can choose our ipad 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.379
 to check a presentation 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:23.220
 directly from there when we open one 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.110
 presentation the screen is different 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.610
 from the classic processing screen 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.840
 of the text of a spreadsheet that 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.340
 we have already seen 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.989
 we will always have a very toolbar 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.560
 interesting here and we're going to analyze 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.590
 better then two screens the screen 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.349
 main that is that of the sheet of the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.819
 of the slide we are editing 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.099
 and the other is that of the slides 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.780
 from the list of slides 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.099
 available for each slide then 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.170
 we could go to change 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.349
 practically every aspect starts from 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.209
 background to get to all the components 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.269
 on the slide then check boxes 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.680
 text images multimedia content 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.620
 graphic forms video music effects 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.690
 many sound options from here we can 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.489
 create new slides instead 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.560
 following these models 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.299
 so that is to say the simple slide 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
 with a subtitle is the one with a 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.190
 photograph the photo to the side one 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.110
 list a list without a title one 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.970
 quote we will have available too 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.040
 an entire photograph a slide 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.730
 resigned in photographs or one 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.230
 completely clean and empty slide 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.120
 from this button we can go to 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.190
 always change every aspect from here 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.349
 we can give insert the contents 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.640
 we're going to see it in another episode from 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.640
 here we will have some available 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.319
 settings that I will now show you 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.660
 from here we can always share the 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.850
 our document and from here we can 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.400
 view our presentation 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.500
 we will see this in an episode in itself 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.970
 there is always available to us 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.340
 help with our document 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.440
 then the settings are slightly 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.569
 different from those of the other two 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.220
 suite applications in york except 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.160
 for the tax print help command 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.549
 password we have already seen 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.160
 we have available in the command 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.049
 spelling check numbers settings 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.540
 glia positive to be able to view down 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.639
 the number of the slide lines 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.009
 guide to understand the edges and 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.620
 when we have the when we arrived 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.479
 in the center or when the beautiful objects 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.999
 we position the same distance 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.199
 on the other hand, as a guideline 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.460
 enable comments the author name for 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.659
 the sharing 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.819
 then we have tools for the 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.400
 then present the interactive links 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.990
 a soundtrack you can insert a 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.360
 kind of presentations so if we want 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.779
 that the presentation is repeated if yes 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.789
 reboots when it doesn't come in short, there isn't 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:46.830
 no one who interacts and we can 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.689
 choose normal only link reproduction 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.120
 automatic always on the presentation 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.800
 We could also enable remote controls or 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.930
 disable them on a document in 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.789
 particular we will have the 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.509
 note so we can insert notes 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.389
 on presentation useful when we go 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.800
 in short, to present a slide 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.259
 carry out the classic command of 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.270
 search and then activate transactions and 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:17.550
 the animations we're going to see 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:20.430
 episode dedicated of course when 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.589
 let's create more than one slide now 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.589
 we take demonstrative devices well 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.389
 we will still be able to move into ours 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.000
 slides in the order that 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.860
 we will decide from time to time and in any case 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.779
 we can go and cut copy 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.639
 delete ignore or activate one 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:42.240
 transition found to positive the other 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.660
 this we will see better to be able to 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.509
 best manage a presentation 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.400
 we will be able to change my appearance as you are 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.740
 I've already told everyone of all the 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.360
 slides so for example I do here 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.430
 here is an example of a photograph 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.349
 by clicking we will have the 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.449
 same settings we have seen 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.919
 always on the photographs of course 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.470
 we will have a command of one more than that 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.509
 soul that we will see better in the episode 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.660
 dedicated to transitions and 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.449
 animations with which we could give 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.250
 give life to our presentation 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.960
 text commands can also be 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.819
 modified always following the same 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.380
 lines in the next episode 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.889
 we will definitely go to analyze 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.169
 some of these objects we will see of 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.210
 say everything possible even if you are in 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.759
 video we can however limit ourselves to 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.699
 fairly general descriptions 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.500
 well guys this was the first episode 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.750
 I have already told you in the next episode 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.310
 we will analyze some object from 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.210
 to be able to insert in ours 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.280
 presentations 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.780
 I thank you for following me 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.690

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.050
 always propose a new one on the iPhone
