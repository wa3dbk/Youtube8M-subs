me to be able to we're going back to the
side<00:00:59.710> um<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.879> kind<00:01:01.180> of<00:01:01.269> messed<00:01:01.510> up<00:01:01.780> my<00:01:02.100> closure

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
side um I kind of messed up my closure

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.340

with<00:01:03.789> trying<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.360> bleach<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.809> nos<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.019> make

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
with trying to bleach the nos and make

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.930 
with trying to bleach the nos and make
it<00:01:05.470> look<00:01:05.560> more<00:01:05.740> realistic<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.490> was<00:01:06.580> just<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:06.789> big

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
it look more realistic it was just a big

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.130 
it look more realistic it was just a big
mess<00:01:07.300> good<00:01:08.259> so<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.740> just<00:01:08.920> decided<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.940> do<00:01:10.840> bangs

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
mess good so I just decided to do bangs

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.680 
mess good so I just decided to do bangs
with<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.830> closure<00:01:12.070> with<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.910> hair<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:13.660> I

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
with the closure with the hair so I

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.180 
with the closure with the hair so I
figured<00:01:14.110> i'll<00:01:14.229> just<00:01:14.410> do<00:01:14.500> something<00:01:14.710> different

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
figured i'll just do something different

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.800 
figured i'll just do something different
anyway<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:15.610> it<00:01:16.360> wasn't<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:16.869> big<00:01:17.110> of<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:18.810> thing

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
anyway so it wasn't that big of a thing
