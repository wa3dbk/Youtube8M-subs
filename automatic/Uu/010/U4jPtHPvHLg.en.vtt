a<00:00:00.560> stack<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.770> used<00:00:02.270> coasters<00:00:04.640> the<00:00:05.640> goal<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.150> to

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
a stack of used coasters the goal is to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.370 
a stack of used coasters the goal is to
take<00:00:06.870> something<00:00:07.170> useless<00:00:08.660> and<00:00:09.660> transform<00:00:10.260> it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
take something useless and transform it

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.220 
take something useless and transform it
into<00:00:10.440> something<00:00:10.769> functional<00:00:11.870> like<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> glass

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
into something functional like a glass

into something functional like a glass
the<00:00:14.190> question<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:15.320> where<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.440> begin<00:00:16.619> with

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the question is where do you begin with

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:26.570 
the question is where do you begin with
this<00:00:23.840> no<00:00:24.840> trouble<00:00:25.199> with<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> width<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:26.070> at<00:00:26.279> 4

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
this no trouble with the width I'm at 4

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
this no trouble with the width I'm at 4
inches<00:00:27.529> with<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> height<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.900> just<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.050> little

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
inches with the height I'm just a little

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.430 
inches with the height I'm just a little
over<00:00:31.619> 2<00:00:31.859> inches<00:00:31.890> high<00:00:32.690> which<00:00:33.690> means<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.230> need

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
over 2 inches high which means I need

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.340 
over 2 inches high which means I need
just<00:00:35.040> shy<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.579> 4<00:00:35.969> inches<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> material

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
just shy of 4 inches more of material

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.130 
just shy of 4 inches more of material
and<00:00:37.530> since<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> recycled<00:00:39.690> project<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and since this is a recycled project I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.389 
and since this is a recycled project I
don't<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> go<00:00:40.559> out<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.739> buy<00:00:40.920> new<00:00:40.950> wood

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
don't want to go out and buy new wood

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.779 
don't want to go out and buy new wood
for<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.760> sort<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.480> defeat<00:00:42.809> purpose<00:00:43.579> but<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
for this sort of defeat purpose but I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.330 
for this sort of defeat purpose but I
have<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.239> scrap<00:00:46.170> piece<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.500> cherry<00:00:46.980> from

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
have this scrap piece of cherry from

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310 
have this scrap piece of cherry from
another<00:00:47.579> project<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> glue

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
another project that you want the glue

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.430 
another project that you want the glue
to<00:00:49.559> soak<00:00:49.950> into<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.969> coasters<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to soak into the coasters and the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.400 
to soak into the coasters and the
easiest<00:00:52.829> way<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> get<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.370> soak<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
easiest way to get it to soak in is to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
easiest way to get it to soak in is to
thin<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.010> give<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> good<00:00:56.940> coat

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
thin it out I give them all a good coat

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.590 
thin it out I give them all a good coat
and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.920> stack<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.309> together

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
and then you just stack them together

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
and then you just stack them together
I'm<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.930> nasty<00:01:01.079> glue<00:01:01.500> sandwich<00:01:02.010> give

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
I'm a little nasty glue sandwich give

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.219 
I'm a little nasty glue sandwich give
them<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> few<00:01:03.210> minutes<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.539> dry<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.199> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
them a few minutes to dry and then I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
them a few minutes to dry and then I
will<00:01:04.729> glue<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> cherry<00:01:06.390> it's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
will glue them to the cherry it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.789 
will glue them to the cherry it's
getting<00:01:07.350> slippery<00:01:07.729> glue<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.799> interesting

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
getting slippery glue is interesting

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.969 
getting slippery glue is interesting
because<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.240> extremely<00:01:13.229> hard<00:01:13.500> once<00:01:13.799> it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
because it is extremely hard once it's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.230 
because it is extremely hard once it's
all<00:01:14.130> dry<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.500> while<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.070> drying<00:01:17.460> it's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
all dry but while it's drying it's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.859 
all dry but while it's drying it's
actually<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> lubricant<00:01:19.880> I've<00:01:20.880> got<00:01:21.240> 5<00:01:21.540> minutes

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
actually a lubricant I've got 5 minutes

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
actually a lubricant I've got 5 minutes
between<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> time<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> first<00:01:22.979> start

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
between the time that I first start

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160 
between the time that I first start
putting<00:01:23.490> glue<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:24.960> where

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
putting glue on here and the time where

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.100 
putting glue on here and the time where
it's<00:01:25.320> tacky<00:01:26.189> enough<00:01:29.329> that<00:01:30.329> it'll<00:01:30.600> set<00:01:30.930> where

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it's tacky enough that it'll set where

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.999 
it's tacky enough that it'll set where
it<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:35.900> there<00:01:36.900> doesn't<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.650> look<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it is there doesn't that look like a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.969 
it is there doesn't that look like a
pint<00:01:38.280> glass

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.219 

oh<00:01:42.420> what<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.450> mess<00:01:45.719> alright<00:01:46.719> so<00:01:46.899> I'm<00:01:47.020> just<00:01:47.110> going

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
oh what a mess alright so I'm just going

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.340 
oh what a mess alright so I'm just going
to<00:01:47.320> mark<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:50.770> think<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.429> center<00:01:52.350> by

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
to mark what I think is the center by

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.609 
to mark what I think is the center by
drawing<00:01:53.679> a<00:01:53.829> line<00:01:53.950> between<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.460> two<00:01:54.579> corners

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
drawing a line between the two corners

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.760 
drawing a line between the two corners
so<00:01:56.619> what<00:01:56.799> we<00:01:56.890> want<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.130> do<00:01:58.289> is<00:01:59.289> we<00:01:59.560> want<00:01:59.710> to

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
so what we want to do is we want to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.609 
so what we want to do is we want to
tighten<00:02:00.159> this<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.970> point<00:02:04.210> where<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:05.500> not

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
tighten this to the point where it's not

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.080 
tighten this to the point where it's not
going<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.860> fly<00:02:06.009> off<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.460> whacking<00:02:06.909> in<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
going to fly off and whacking in the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:37.750 
going to fly off and whacking in the
face

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.229 

not<00:02:38.760> everything<00:02:39.150> always<00:02:39.269> works<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:41.250> while<00:02:42.209> I

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
not everything always works so while I

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.470 
not everything always works so while I
was<00:02:42.480> trying<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> remove<00:02:43.909> wood<00:02:44.909> from<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.299> end

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
was trying to remove wood from the end

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.449 
was trying to remove wood from the end
here<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.180> very<00:02:48.420> weak<00:02:48.780> it's<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:50.250> not

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
here this is very weak it's it's not

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.119 
here this is very weak it's it's not
terribly<00:02:50.939> strong<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.420> flexed<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.590> broke<00:02:52.799> I

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
terribly strong it flexed and it broke I

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.690 
terribly strong it flexed and it broke I
took<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> opportunity<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:55.099> hollow<00:02:56.099> this<00:02:56.370> part

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
took the opportunity to hollow this part

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.819 
took the opportunity to hollow this part
out<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.269> can<00:02:57.420> see<00:02:57.629> this<00:02:57.750> very<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.590> very

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
out and you can see this very it's very

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.220 
out and you can see this very it's very
rough<00:02:59.220> surface<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.970> there<00:03:00.120> I've<00:03:00.689> never<00:03:00.959> turned

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
rough surface in there I've never turned

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.300 
rough surface in there I've never turned
cardboard<00:03:01.829> before<00:03:02.569> but<00:03:03.569> it's<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.840> little<00:03:04.310> hard

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
cardboard before but it's a little hard

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
this one looks thin loverly so when

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.360 
this one looks thin loverly so when
doing<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.849> sort<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.200> racket<00:03:42.200> prototyping<00:03:43.129> I

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
doing the sort of racket prototyping I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.220 
doing the sort of racket prototyping I
like<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.909> call<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.450> find<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.129> have<00:03:46.340> to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.899 
like to call it I find that you have to
just<00:03:48.230> be<00:03:48.440> okay<00:03:48.769> with<00:03:48.799> what<00:03:49.129> happens<00:03:49.579> this<00:03:49.849> is

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
just be okay with what happens this is

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.759 
just be okay with what happens this is
not<00:03:50.239> traditional<00:03:50.450> woodworking<00:03:51.049> I'm<00:03:51.560> not

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
not traditional woodworking I'm not

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
doing a traditional project so the steps

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.149 
doing a traditional project so the steps
are<00:03:54.440> predefined<00:03:56.620> which<00:03:57.620> means<00:03:57.859> that<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.040> have

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
are predefined which means that you have

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.589 
are predefined which means that you have
to<00:03:58.220> spend<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.459> lot<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.609> time<00:03:58.849> thinking<00:03:59.329> outside

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
this point I'm not even sure where the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.899 
this point I'm not even sure where the
box<00:04:05.180> is

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
box is

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.559 
box is
okay<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.060> glue<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:08.420> still<00:04:08.510> drying<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:10.310> I've

okay the glue is still drying and I've
still<00:04:11.569> got<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.720> clamped<00:04:12.079> but<00:04:13.069> that<00:04:13.159> doesn't

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
still got it clamped but that doesn't

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.559 
still got it clamped but that doesn't
mean<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.489> can't<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.909> a<00:04:13.940> little<00:04:14.120> wood<00:04:14.299> turning

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
mean I can't do a little wood turning
