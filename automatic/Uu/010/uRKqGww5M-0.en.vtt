of course by then the gtx 670 had come
up<00:01:10.650> which<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.909> you've<00:01:12.479> looked<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.810> the

up which if you've looked at the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.840 
up which if you've looked at the
benchmarks<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> done<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.189> comparison

benchmarks and done some comparison

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.840 
benchmarks and done some comparison
they're<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:15.720> similar<00:01:16.049> once<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> 670<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
they're pretty similar once the 670 is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
they're pretty similar once the 670 is
overclocked<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> there's<00:01:19.259> still<00:01:19.470> plenty<00:01:19.920> for

difference so I'm going to go and take
that<00:03:30.170> extra<00:03:30.380> frame<00:03:30.680> rate<00:03:31.090> because<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.269> like

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
that extra frame rate in terms of frame

looking at about 60 to 65 Celsius which
is<00:04:13.069> pretty<00:04:13.459> much

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
is pretty much

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
sixty-two percent which really just goes

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.820 
to show this card is not being pushed
too<00:04:27.430> terribly<00:04:27.940> hard<00:04:28.380> which<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.530> just<00:04:29.650> quite

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
too terribly hard which is just quite

orchestra<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.310> which<00:04:33.550> obviously<00:04:34.300> got<00:04:34.570> its

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
orchestra to which obviously got its

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.600 
orchestra to which obviously got its
update<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.620> increase<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.040> performance<00:04:36.190> and

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
update that increase the performance and

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.580 
update that increase the performance and
everything<00:04:37.000> but<00:04:37.180> playing<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.290> game<00:04:38.440> the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
everything but playing that game the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.470 
everything but playing that game the
other<00:04:38.680> nights<00:04:39.010> with<00:04:39.310> this<00:04:39.460> card<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:40.060> actually

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
other nights with this card I actually

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.200 
other nights with this card I actually
noticed<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.140> card<00:04:41.410> was<00:04:41.590> basically<00:04:42.190> not<00:04:42.940> even

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
noticed the card was basically not even

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.720 
noticed the card was basically not even
running<00:04:43.390> at<00:04:43.690> its<00:04:43.720> actual<00:04:44.470> clock<00:04:44.890> speeds<00:04:45.340> that

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
running at its actual clock speeds that

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.390 
running at its actual clock speeds that
it's<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:47.380> know<00:04:47.410> basically<00:04:47.830> one<00:04:48.040> percent

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
it's you know basically one percent

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.400 
it's you know basically one percent
power<00:04:48.520> is<00:04:48.730> baykal<00:04:49.030> basically<00:04:49.600> down<00:04:49.840> clocking

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
power is baykal basically down clocking

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.110 
power is baykal basically down clocking
and<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.680> was<00:04:50.770> playing<00:04:50.919> on<00:04:51.130> ultra<00:04:51.580> including<00:04:52.030> the

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
and I was playing on ultra including the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.409 
and I was playing on ultra including the
ultra<00:04:53.340> anti-aliasing<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.400> as<00:04:54.760> still

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
ultra anti-aliasing and as still

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.210 
ultra anti-aliasing and as still
trucking<00:04:55.870> along<00:04:55.960> gets<00:04:56.320> how<00:04:56.620> many<00:04:56.830> frames<00:04:57.010> per

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
trucking along gets how many frames per

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.340 
trucking along gets how many frames per
sec<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:57.460> was<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:57.700> dude<00:04:58.540> this<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:59.200> amazing<00:04:59.370> I

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
sec I was like dude this is amazing I

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.159 
sec I was like dude this is amazing I
mean<00:05:02.350> it's<00:05:03.220> just<00:05:03.370> what<00:05:03.810> can<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:04.870> say<00:05:05.020> it's

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
mean it's just what can I say it's

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.590 
mean it's just what can I say it's
basically<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.500> beast<00:05:05.800> now<00:05:06.610> going<00:05:07.060> back<00:05:07.180> to<00:05:07.419> the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
basically a beast now going back to the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.470 
basically a beast now going back to the
670<00:05:08.350> comparison<00:05:09.310> between<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.730> two<00:05:10.000> cards<00:05:10.360> I

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
670 comparison between the two cards I

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.830 
670 comparison between the two cards I
was<00:05:10.570> looking<00:05:10.810> at<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:12.700> EVGA<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:13.660> wind

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
was looking at the EVGA for the wind

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.990 
was looking at the EVGA for the wind
card<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.470> guess<00:05:14.860> where<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.610> want<00:05:15.760> to<00:05:15.820> call<00:05:15.970> it

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
card I guess where you want to call it

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.240 
card I guess where you want to call it
the<00:05:16.120> up<00:05:16.419> t<00:05:16.600> dub<00:05:16.810> it's<00:05:17.560> basically<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.950> bigger

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
the up t dub it's basically a bigger

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.120 
the up t dub it's basically a bigger
circuit<00:05:18.700> board<00:05:18.910> versus<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.840> regular<00:05:20.169> 670<00:05:20.890> and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
circuit board versus the regular 670 and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.100 
circuit board versus the regular 670 and
most<00:05:21.700> of<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.880> other<00:05:22.000> six<00:05:22.240> 70s<00:05:22.600> on<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.720> market

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
most of the other six 70s on the market

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
most of the other six 70s on the market
I<00:05:23.260> believe<00:05:23.560> it's<00:05:23.710> basically<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.190> 6<00:05:24.729> 80's

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
I believe it's basically the 6 80's

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.760 
I believe it's basically the 6 80's
board<00:05:27.130> which<00:05:27.760> is<00:05:28.060> bigger<00:05:28.419> obviously<00:05:29.229> gives<00:05:29.650> it

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
board which is bigger obviously gives it

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.920 
board which is bigger obviously gives it
more<00:05:29.860> room<00:05:30.130> it's<00:05:30.640> a<00:05:30.729> much<00:05:31.240> bigger<00:05:31.419> card<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.780> did

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
more room it's a much bigger card I did

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.360 
more room it's a much bigger card I did
run<00:05:32.080> into<00:05:32.260> some<00:05:32.440> issues<00:05:32.530> with<00:05:32.740> that<00:05:33.100> but

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
run into some issues with that but

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.920 
run into some issues with that but
that's<00:05:33.520> just<00:05:33.640> because<00:05:33.820> of<00:05:34.120> getting<00:05:34.510> my<00:05:34.600> cable

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
that's just because of getting my cable

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.750 
that's just because of getting my cable
management<00:05:35.140> as<00:05:35.530> well<00:05:35.560> as<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.919> fact<00:05:36.040> that<00:05:36.190> I'm

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
management as well as the fact that I'm

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.210 
management as well as the fact that I'm
my<00:05:37.060> hard<00:05:37.360> drive<00:05:37.570> in<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:38.110> bad<00:05:38.229> slot<00:05:38.590> that<00:05:39.190> I

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
my hard drive in a bad slot that I

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.920 
my hard drive in a bad slot that I
didn't<00:05:39.580> think<00:05:39.669> of<00:05:39.850> which<00:05:40.030> wasn't<00:05:40.240> an<00:05:40.419> issue<00:05:40.570> in

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
didn't think of which wasn't an issue in

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.050 
didn't think of which wasn't an issue in
terms<00:05:41.350> of<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.710> card<00:05:41.919> is<00:05:42.130> just<00:05:42.160> me<00:05:42.880> not

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
terms of the card is just me not

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.460 
terms of the card is just me not
thinking<00:05:43.419> ahead<00:05:43.510> because<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:44.020> worked<00:05:44.229> just

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
thinking ahead because it worked just

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.620 
thinking ahead because it worked just
fine<00:05:44.710> with<00:05:44.950> 6850<00:05:45.729> it<00:05:46.180> would<00:05:46.300> have<00:05:46.390> worked<00:05:46.450> with

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
fine with 6850 it would have worked with

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.520 
fine with 6850 it would have worked with
ray<00:05:46.810> you're<00:05:47.020> playing<00:05:47.850> 670<00:05:48.850> but<00:05:49.350> with<00:05:50.350> this

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
ray you're playing 670 but with this

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.500 
ray you're playing 670 but with this
card<00:05:50.740> then<00:05:50.979> as<00:05:51.610> well<00:05:51.850> as<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.060> fact<00:05:52.270> that<00:05:52.330> the

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
card then as well as the fact that the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.620 
card then as well as the fact that the
fan<00:05:52.810> is<00:05:53.490> basically<00:05:54.490> straight<00:05:54.729> off<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:54.910> a<00:05:55.210> 680

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
fan is basically straight off of a 680

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.719 
fan is basically straight off of a 680
which<00:05:56.229> doesn't<00:05:56.650> sound<00:05:57.010> like<00:05:57.310> an<00:05:57.400> improvement

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
which doesn't sound like an improvement

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.969 
which doesn't sound like an improvement
however<00:05:58.210> when<00:05:58.390> you<00:05:58.450> think<00:05:58.660> about<00:05:58.720> it<00:05:58.990> 680<00:05:59.890> is

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
however when you think about it 680 is

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.409 
however when you think about it 680 is
going<00:06:00.100> to<00:06:00.160> give<00:06:00.280> off<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.550> little<00:06:00.850> bit<00:06:01.030> more<00:06:01.150> heat

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
going to give off a little bit more heat

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.469 
going to give off a little bit more heat
the<00:06:01.570> fans<00:06:01.780> going<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:01.960> be<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.080> more<00:06:02.260> efficient

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
the fans going to be a more efficient

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.630 
the fans going to be a more efficient
you<00:06:04.479> know<00:06:04.600> and<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:05.410> works<00:06:05.710> like<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.310> said<00:06:06.520> the

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
you know and it works like I said the

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.730 
you know and it works like I said the
temperatures<00:06:07.030> haven't<00:06:07.450> really<00:06:08.080> gone<00:06:08.229> up<00:06:08.470> I

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
temperatures haven't really gone up I

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.710 
temperatures haven't really gone up I
mean<00:06:08.919> I'm<00:06:09.669> sure<00:06:09.729> if<00:06:10.330> you're<00:06:10.450> going<00:06:10.600> into

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
mean I'm sure if you're going into

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.270 
mean I'm sure if you're going into
overclocking<00:06:11.320> and<00:06:11.440> everything<00:06:11.770> but<00:06:11.979> if

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
overclocking and everything but if

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.400 
overclocking and everything but if
you're<00:06:12.430> going<00:06:12.580> into<00:06:12.729> overclocking<00:06:13.360> I<00:06:13.690> mean

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
you're going into overclocking I mean

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.790 
you're going into overclocking I mean
then<00:06:15.130> it<00:06:15.790> really<00:06:16.380> kind<00:06:17.380> doesn't<00:06:17.620> really

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
then it really kind doesn't really

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.839 
then it really kind doesn't really
matter<00:06:17.950> because<00:06:18.130> you're<00:06:18.400> probably<00:06:18.550> beginning

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
matter because you're probably beginning

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.339 
matter because you're probably beginning
you<00:06:20.849> probably<00:06:20.999> got<00:06:21.119> a<00:06:21.209> case<00:06:21.689> with<00:06:21.869> some<00:06:22.050> beast

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
you probably got a case with some beast

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.350 
you probably got a case with some beast
airflow<00:06:22.830> through<00:06:22.860> it<00:06:23.189> which<00:06:23.369> you<00:06:24.149> know<00:06:24.239> really

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
airflow through it which you know really

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.850 
airflow through it which you know really
is<00:06:24.539> going<00:06:24.659> to<00:06:24.749> help<00:06:24.899> any<00:06:25.050> family<00:06:25.409> more<00:06:25.529> so<00:06:25.709> than

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
is going to help any family more so than

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.790 
is going to help any family more so than
you<00:06:26.219> know<00:06:26.309> just<00:06:26.339> a<00:06:26.759> better<00:06:27.239> fan<00:06:27.679> for<00:06:28.679> like<00:06:28.769> a

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
you know just a better fan for like a

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.899 
you know just a better fan for like a
better<00:06:29.159> term<00:06:31.009> but<00:06:32.009> this<00:06:32.159> thing<00:06:32.429> is<00:06:32.459> whisper

give me a fan in my card because it's

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.100 
give me a fan in my card because it's
