00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.460 
with it and the more that you can parry
the<00:04:51.340> better<00:04:51.490> points<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:51.940> get<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:53.320> other

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
thing that they did was they gave each

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.960 
thing that they did was they gave each
character<00:04:55.840> their<00:04:56.050> own<00:04:56.260> unique<00:04:57.070> backstory<00:04:57.789> and

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
stuff if you play through the game

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.519 
stuff if you play through the game
rather<00:04:59.470> than<00:04:59.590> just<00:04:59.979> having

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:00.529 
rather than just having

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.739 
rather than just having
I<00:05:00.589> think<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.249> ending<00:05:01.729> in<00:05:01.909> free<00:05:02.299> was<00:05:02.479> pretty

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:02.749 
I think the ending in free was pretty

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.869 
I think the ending in free was pretty
much<00:05:02.899> generic<00:05:03.439> and<00:05:04.039> I'd<00:05:04.159> normally<00:05:04.579> play<00:05:04.819> it

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
much generic and I'd normally play it

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.549 
much generic and I'd normally play it
through<00:05:05.089> the<00:05:05.239> MS<00:05:05.569> escape<00:05:05.929> each<00:05:06.079> game<00:05:06.319> like

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:06.559 
through the MS escape each game like

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:09.759 
through the MS escape each game like
about<00:05:06.769> you<00:05:07.009> know<00:05:07.039> 2530<00:05:07.879> minutes<00:05:08.089> to<00:05:08.329> play<00:05:08.769> just

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:09.769

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:09.019 
does this works out a little better if

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:10.959
