entries<00:03:01.440> into<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.859> series<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.489> while<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:02.909> do

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
entries into the series so while they do

that and then reference a side game
which<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.799> basically<00:03:05.099> dlc<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.000> assassin's

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
creed unity I don't know that they would

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
creed unity I don't know that they would
is<00:03:09.930> possible<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.859> referencing<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
is possible that it is referencing that

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.309 
is possible that it is referencing that
but<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.790> don't<00:03:12.239> find<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.569> likely<00:03:12.930> given<00:03:13.140> that

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
but I don't find it likely given that

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.259 
but I don't find it likely given that
they've<00:03:13.440> also<00:03:13.620> only<00:03:14.040> reference<00:03:14.430> 1<00:03:14.609> 2<00:03:14.790> 3<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.239> 4

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
they've also only reference 1 2 3 and 4

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.220 
they've also only reference 1 2 3 and 4
and<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.579> seems<00:03:17.819> random<00:03:18.389> side<00:03:18.690> game<00:03:18.989> you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
and so it seems random side game you

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.750 
and so it seems random side game you
know<00:03:19.319> they<00:03:19.440> haven't<00:03:19.590> referenced<00:03:20.190> say<00:03:20.370> for

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
know they haven't referenced say for

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.020 
know they haven't referenced say for
example<00:03:20.849> assassin's<00:03:21.810> creed<00:03:21.989> liberation<00:03:23.030> so

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
example assassin's creed liberation so

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.640 
example assassin's creed liberation so
yeah<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:26.870> really<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:28.169> hope<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.620> true

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
