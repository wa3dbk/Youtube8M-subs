00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.010
 even though today will be during the landing 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.220
 because 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.540
 veenendaal a lot of money 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.329
 this is what determines 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.569
 the assembly 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.539
 put it on the dropshots 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.949
 the corn box 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.439
 the people problems button 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.769
 during my form of a child has yet to come for my customers 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.249
 before that the bridge is a heel 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.390
 the involved 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 but milk leaves within the lines 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.820
 we always use bane one curses for this 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.690
 milan is the image 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750
 barn man standing by the court 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.340
 and also completely rubbish was under water so just use 21 bottom shifts 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.570
 properly 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.210
 but more often varies between 20 and the 26 lower teams that won 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.570
 the spurs not to harm I can be again with a very busy life 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 we start with alone 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.460
 along the back 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.420
 by stabbing smoking 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.240
 that way 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.590
 less too long enough 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.410
 check what the injury is on by stopping after 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.410
 all the way 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 in this way 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.730
 creil the people 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.330
 creemers 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.320
 in the field 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.500
 and the deceased 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 that's a different story 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.460
 it is easier 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.440
 was the case 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.070
 we just go delicious 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.730
 to start the button 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.930
 a flat can impose denying it 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.300
 why else 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 around the two lines 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.270
 we are going back 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.260
 because of this 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.600
 liddell single medium 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 but now instead of the balls start attracting the room 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.910
 partly because of this 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.000
 raise the sky 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 that way 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.100
 there is, however, a knot that now taps benefits that are going to attract 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.470
 it's an important one 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.740
 that we format the Netherlands 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 still milks wetting such that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.279
 weak to rebel 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.540
 and quite the setup it is just on those buttons that more stood alone on the street 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:14.099
 to go 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 so I that I further attract Peter Moore already put a system together 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.319
 by developments at the top of goals 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.809
 Rutte said the pool was flooded 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.119
 the first game 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.229
 for the school 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.159
 the takes the hand work so if you sit city is hard 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.909
 always nice terrace 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:33.750
 laid to the ground
