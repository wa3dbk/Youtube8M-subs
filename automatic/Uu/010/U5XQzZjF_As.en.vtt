00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
it because people are using the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.529 
it because people are using the
computers<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.290> am<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.239> over<00:02:09.420> my

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
computers that I am that are over my

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.630 
computers that I am that are over my
network<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.080> I'll<00:02:10.679> let<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.099> test<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.610> out

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
network so I'll let you test that out

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.660 
network so I'll let you test that out
and<00:02:12.030> have

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
and have

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.440 
and have
with<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.700> what<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:15.970> do<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:18.450> have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
with it but this is what you do and have

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.160 
with it but this is what you do and have
fun<00:02:19.690> with<00:02:19.840> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
fun with it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.800 
fun with it
I<00:02:20.200> tried<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.709> at<00:02:20.830> school<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:22.300> didn't<00:02:22.569> work

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
I tried it at school it didn't work

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.809 
I tried it at school it didn't work
because<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.620> wasn't<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.950> administrator<00:02:24.520> but

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
because I wasn't the administrator but

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.150 
because I wasn't the administrator but
maybe<00:02:25.480> your<00:02:25.720> school<00:02:25.959> has<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> crappy<00:02:26.560> firewall

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
maybe your school has a crappy firewall

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.240 
maybe your school has a crappy firewall
and<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:29.050> people<00:02:29.410> there<00:02:29.680> don't<00:02:29.920> know<00:02:30.100> what

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
and the people there don't know what

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.059 
and the people there don't know what
they're<00:02:30.370> doing<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.970> computer<00:02:31.270> so<00:02:32.069> maybe

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
they're doing on the computer so maybe

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.199 
they're doing on the computer so maybe
you<00:02:33.160> can<00:02:33.280> shut<00:02:33.430> down<00:02:33.489> your<00:02:33.610> friends<00:02:33.940> computer
