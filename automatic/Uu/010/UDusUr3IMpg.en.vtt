00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello girls today I am going to present to you my 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.900
 second video in my series of videos in 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.450
 Spanish and this is a perfect style 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.860
 for a night out where you want 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.860
 look great 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.470
 The first thing I'm going to do is apply the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.509
 fixator I chose this one in particular because 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.300
 has an illuminator that is going to make 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.680
 your eye shadow highlights even more what 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.320
 I'm going to apply on the whole eyelid 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.919
 including below the eyebrow and below the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.919
 lower eyelid 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.100
 In the next step I will fill 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.469
 define my eyebrows since the sege is a 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.469
 very important part of the face 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.300
 now I'm going to apply a shadow for eyes 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.190
 in dark cream can use the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.220
 color of your preference as coffee or 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.379
 dark green this color I'm going to apply 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.930
 in the crease of the eyelid using a 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.879
 thin brush you have to have a lot 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.200
 careful when applying it because it is required 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.780
 very defined 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.789
 to clean the shore and define it yet 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.479
 more I'm using an angled brush 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.479
 with corrector 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.350
 The next thing I'm going to apply is a 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.600
 shadow of light coffee using a brush 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.060
 blurred now this color I'm going to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.860
 apply this step in the arch of the eyebrow 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.750
 it requires nuancing it very well with the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.360
 color that we were previously in the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.280
 fold of the eyelid so that if 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.619
 they want to take their time since this step 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.869
 if it is a bit more technical and requires 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.640
 more patience as you see, I'm going 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.960
 from one color to another until you get the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 desired results 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
 right away I'm going to apply this color in the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 eyelid to the crease of the eye and this 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.330
 color is going to be used so that it is at 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.619
 base to highlight the brightness a little bit 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.619
 more and give it more dimension 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.219
 Now I'm going to mix this formula with the 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.259
 glitter to adhere to the eyelid using 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.469
 a very special brush that to me in 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.289
 I particularly love it because I 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.479
 helps to specify the brightness but only what 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.340
 I'm going to apply on the fold lid 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 down below nothing else 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.620
 and now I'm going to apply the eyeliner to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.620
 eyes in liquid 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.739
 I will also delineate the water line 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.870
 using a pencil eyeliner and then 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.160
 with a thin brush I'm going to draw 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.160
 a little the eyeliner 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.239
 immediately I was hooked from the eyelashes and 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.310
 I will apply two coats of mascara the last 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.269
 step to finish the eyes is to apply 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.269
 false eyelashes 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.810
 ok then we continue with the makeup 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.580
 I am applying the prebase in all my 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.580
 face using the tips of my fingers 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.400
 and now I'm going to apply makeup 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.400
 using this synthetic brush 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.500
 once finished applying the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.390
 makeup I'm going to apply the concealer 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.850
 under my eyes in the area of 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.160
 dark circles I'm using a sponge to 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.080
 fade it very well and I'm also going to 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.370
 use a small brush to give it a 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.370
 more uniform appearance 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.160
 right away I'm going to apply the powder 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.770
 translucent all over my face so that the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.530
 makeup does not run and at the same time give 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.949
 impeccable appearance and avoid the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.949
 brightness 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.029
 Now apply the bronzer below the 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.659
 cheekbones to make them stand out 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.659
 a little more 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.039
 I will apply a little flush 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.340
 rosita to give natural color to my 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.340
 cheeks 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.330
 since we finished the cheeks 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.939
 we continue now with the lips 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.620
 I'll be delineating them with a pencil and 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.310
 then painting them with a miller 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.310
 rosita 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.229
 and then here is the makeup has already 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.240
 finished I'm ready to leave 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.599
 party tonight to show off with my 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.599
 friends 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.070
 thank you very much for watching my videos 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.250

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.250
 next
