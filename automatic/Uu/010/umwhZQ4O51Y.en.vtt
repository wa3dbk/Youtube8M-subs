00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.290

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.690
 Today comes another so delicious 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.420
 recipe and chicken thighs with 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.640
 delicious garlic cream sauce if you 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.070
 want the ingredients are as simple as 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.270
 awesome you can modify it as always 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.710
 according to your taste 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.269
 you just need two 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.490
 chicken thighs of course go too 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.689
 three or four then you take it 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 five tablespoons of oil garlic salt pepper 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.850
 paprika and honey and you can 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.309
 of course herbs use by-election so 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 basil parsley then lays simply 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.219
 parsley in the pot 1 the cooking time 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.710
 is 45 minutes at 180 Â° with lid 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.899
 and then baked to about 200 degrees 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.079
 without cover please heat your oven 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.270
 now at 180 degrees before we do it first 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.399
 once the marinade we take that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.239
 oil and give all the spices easy 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.520
 in there 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.430
 By the way, the clove of garlic is easy 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.409
 just really crushed in the ultra 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.840
 in the ultra I do not always know 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.939
 it's called the ultra because it says it 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 comes from the casserole usually 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.320
 it would have to be that recipe too 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.869
 But every baking sheet works in the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 Ultra, it just gets super juicy and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.159
 crispy yes if you all your ingredients 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.930
 in the bowl together 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.180
 she puts the chicken thighs on her 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.580
 and dabbed dry in the casserole in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.170
 the ultra i always say the ultra me 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.299
 can not get used to the ultra 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.290
 one also paints this from all sides 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.180
 from the other side 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.250
 then he turns it around again so the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.450
 skin side should point upwards because 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.880
 Of course we want it right afterwards 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.880
 have a nice crispy and delicious 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.840
 Finally, I give one or two 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.110
 tablespoon honey generously on the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.000
 chicken legs 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.320
 then the lid comes on and off with it 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.650
 in the oven for 45 minutes at approx 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.650
 180 degrees 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.500
 after 45 minutes doing that 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.660
 Let's go and have a look and they are 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.490
 already goes through wonderfully in poultry 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.720
 That's relatively fast, too 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.220
 I do not have to go through every case 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.050
 cut through I already have that today 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.040
 For the second time I made the recipe 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.030
 know that it is through and then 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 Just sprinkle it again 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.320
 spread it again with the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.200
 bratensatz and there are another ten 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.570
 minutes for 200 degrees without dge in the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.760
 oven to brown and look at that 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.020
 how much sauce came out there 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.020
 that it is amazing 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.280
 you have great roasted aromas on the bottom of the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.840
 uld advice the the ultra and if 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.910
 You want two three now 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.560
 tablespoon cream milk or too 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.600
 Stirring in condensed milk tastes delicious 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.190
 garlic smells like you said 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.110
 do not like the garlic direction 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.299
 Can you also take herbs or what 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.100
 you like it drone yes tried 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.380
 just like always and you will 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.480
 see that it is a totally delicious and 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.489
 simple recipe you do not have to 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.840
 something else could be left in the hour 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.160
 I think that's great 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.780
 I hope you have my video 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160
 I like it a bit and am looking forward to it 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.160
