00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.509
 nowadays is very normal if you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.890
 computer store enters you 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.539
 all weird concepts you can see 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.119
 folding screen and screen can be released here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.170
 and loose keyboards with laptops 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.150
 but in the past it really wasn't at all 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.769
 so normal and actually it is asus 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.300
 yes started a bit on android 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.039
 then with their cap 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 transformer have little last year 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 you have many different transforms 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.469
 released and here on eva they leave again 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.440
 see a new one that simply 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.290
 transformer pet is called innovative no 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.190
 not really but he is packed with the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.190
 latest hardware 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.489
 Well 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.340
 starting with the screen 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.090
 last real high and transformer class 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.400
 infiniti 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.300
 have that resolution of 1920 by 1200 now 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.190
 Jacked up to 2560 by 1600 10.1 inches 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.660
 Bears in mind that he has something with your nose on it 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.160
 screen and that you still have that 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.960
 pixels almost can not see that is just 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.760
 very nice if you are a browser or 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.260
 reading text and in addition 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.390
 He also has a new one and so you see 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.070
 new system under chip and that is the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.330
 tegra 4 you don't have much yet 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.380
 considering he has long ago 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.340
 announced 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.869
 nvidia pays a lot of attention to it 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.180
 but little manufacturer 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.860
 to walk in the warm shape but asus has in 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.660
 put into use in any case that has 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.090
 4 processor cores of a new type 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.890
 with a high clock she cuts on paper 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.470
 means that this is really one of the fastest 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.330
 current tablet is a tried and tested 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.530
 concept so with all new hardware 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.960
 actually you would think this should be the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.630
 very best transformer cap ever made 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.729
 but that is not that screen 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.920
 have nothing to complain are awful 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.750
 nice screen with high resolution and good 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.190
 viewing angles and I actually had more of it 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.540
 expecting the entire construction 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.729
 bad a lot of experience with making 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.649
 of such a roof construction with your tablet 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 can click in the keyboard and here 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.160
 he just didn't do that well 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.110
 is not very sturdy 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.360
 you can wiggle and had a lot with it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.490
 actually expected better and also 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.440
 tegra 4 which is a bit disappointing on 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.240
 paper is the super fast chip him one 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.220
 benchmarks twisted pair and then comes 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.470
 also very good but what good is it for you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.390
 that theoretical performance as in the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.800
 party is not working well and that works 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.140
 it just not very simple things 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.060
 always open an application about itself 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.250
 notification pull you down 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.959
 it just didn't go smoothly 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.880
 shocked that faltered 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.530
 it may be the ek 4 march 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.340
 more like one against three of the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.340
 previous generation 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.870
 it is certainly not all bad with the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.700
 you transformer pad that on for example 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.260
 a keyboard still works very well 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.180
 fine even though its a bit small 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.840
 keys you can still reasonably well with 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.280
 to tap 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.780
 the same goes for touchpad was too 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.430
 still accessible and as I said 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.989
 screen is actually that is just that 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.730
 really good to have that is 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.170
 just nice next to no person what 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.969
 handy software me so it 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.280
 overall picture is not bad at all 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.230
 but it's those two things that 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.840
 for new that we really expected more 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.829
 and in practice the speed of that tk 4 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.269
 but maybe they can handle something 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.919
 Do these pre-production and watch 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.090
 samples that we see here, it turned out not to be 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.689
 that these are also the versions that are in the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.250
 store 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.269
 and maybe that various in the store 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.340
 is ultimately a better vernier 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.840
 gets on the software side they can 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.310
 also optimize things to care 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.650
 everything runs smoothly 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.969
 they do that and then you have this fall 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.430
 for view it 990 euros 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:37.250
 a very nice hi a tablet they do that 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.969
 don't see your transformer cap and then 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.969
 just disappointment
