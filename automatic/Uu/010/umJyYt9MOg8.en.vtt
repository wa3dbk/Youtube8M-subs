00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.989
 video to battlefield 4 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.780
 and now the third overall 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.400
 open video to ports i know now 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 not why that always I believe 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.989
 really that is actually always 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 the same as in two videos one man 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.390
 look for the ports out you can do it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 just google and then find the ports 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 for battlefield 4 again in this one 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.320
 but I thought about it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.690
 Just do it again and show 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.039
 exactly how it works so I have the here 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.860
 I've already got ports 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:15.300
 I had searched out now 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.310
 still for the pc but ps for the ps4 and 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.840
 the xbox I have now too 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.640
 Once again just picked out and with her 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.330
 as well as being up to date 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.300
 could and therefore it is easy 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.429
 as always as follows so open 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.190
 your browser is an upstairs 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:42.810
 that is the route ip in my case 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:44.909
 that's the 192 168 around 2.1 then it comes to you 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.820
 your router with me is here again 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.420
 the or still the speedport w 504 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.270
 v configuration data gives your password 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.509
 on 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.490
 so with me so you go so you go here 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.470
 or I have to network here now 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.520
 go and then stands here by rt and 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.670
 regulate the port 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.459
 so you know what is meant and 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.679
 important now is the ports we 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.190
 Freedoms are over the port 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.799
 upstream preceded and indeed 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.430
 define new rules as normal 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:29.130
 I will now be under designations 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:32.660
 battlefield 4 active for my pc ccp the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.310
 the networks are the commands 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.310
 just paste copy 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.290
 then we click on save data 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.890
 are transferred so that's it 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.750
 just made easy to play with so 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.960
 me it is again act like that too 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.730
 already said i have these the these 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.780
 really standard lex fall for me 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.080
 completely gone means ping has ahead 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.820
 lowered from 80 to 60 so i can do it 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
 really only recommend doing that 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.660
 and of course, if it does 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.240
 there could be questions in the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.620
 make comments or via pn and about 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.160
 of course, I would rate myself 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.160
 looking forward
