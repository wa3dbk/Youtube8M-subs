00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 good morning the youtuber klink vom 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.430
 Kanal klink gave me an important gift 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.430
 given and asks the question 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.269
 why do not we have this anymore 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.269
 cozy Christmas feeling like back then 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.369
 as a kid earlier was more 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.869
 yes sounds at all everything was better than 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.760
 we were still children for children 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.410
 is not only the cozy Christmas 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 feeling much less than for adults 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.119
 but all the comforting feelings are for 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.009
 children somehow much more comfortable and all 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.969
 unwilling feelings are a bit 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.380
 more unwell than for adults 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 but why do we experience moments like that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.790
 Christmas as a child much more intense than 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 as an adult son, that sounds better 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.350
 has five reasons number one for children 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.879
 Christmas is still new year at the latest 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.320
 after the thirtieth night is at night 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.480
 and somehow the air out but at 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
 his very first christmas there knows 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.489
 you do not really care why it 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.489
 at all goes 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.899
 the second time you realize that already 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.830
 Slowly it's kind of a good thing 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.479
 is merkels merkel otherwise catch up and 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.640
 the third time you start slowly 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 to understand the spirit of Christmas 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.280
 very nice here with the singing though 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 start while I gifts to the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.390
 I can just unpack as 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 effort can look and so we learn 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.080
 a little bit year by year as a child 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.150
 more like christmas works and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.290
 this is exciting number 2 ever 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.890
 children are many enthusiastic 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.360
 as adults and with enthusiasm 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.340
 our brain rewards us for 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.960
 revealing aha experiences and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 creates a natural learning 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 need when were you the last time 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.540
 Enthusiastic sounds children have up to 50 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.369
 times a day a veritable 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.840
 Enthusiasm storm and can 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.070
 for hours for the same excite 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 However, the disadvantage that they are 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.590
 for hours to inspire the same 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.270
 can be number three for kids 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.250
 something just like that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 happens for adults is christmas 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.670
 something you have to organize yes 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.350
 motives are tomorrow with you and on 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 second christmas holiday at grandma and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.130
 We already have a grandpa 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.049
 gift for and karl-heinz so god 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.000
 once you are writing you can write it on 27 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.770
 Deliver what warmly translates to number four 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 the christmas was maybe earlier 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.640
 not less than today for ours 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.830
 Consciousness tends to the past 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.150
 to transfigure in our memory and 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.040
 maybe that was what you considered today 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.709
 warm Christmas in remembrance 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.780
 have in truth much more wanted number 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.580
 five gifts as a child make you much 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.800
 has a much better gift and needs a lot for it 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.180
 less give yourself the gift 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.680
 giving away is just a lot 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.270
 better for a few self-painted 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.040
 pictures and memorized 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.100
 court has got bicycles 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.780
 Computer and gameboys back of the picture 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.470
 I made myself but wanted a wife 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.150
 and my son 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:49.530
 Well, what am I doing for you ? 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:51.330
 has of pocket money what do you think 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.769
 christmas was better or better as a child 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.209
 Do you have your gifts in one? 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.310
 Wrong color does not get anyhow 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.470
 give away an impulse gift now 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.709
 tektas table and that's a question he asks 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.280
 could actually have to answer 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.280
 burner 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.190
 Of course I know the answer already 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.019
 but if you want to know if snow 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.760
