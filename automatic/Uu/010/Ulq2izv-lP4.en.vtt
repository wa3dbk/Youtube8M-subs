to<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> camera<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to see on the camera this is one of the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.800 
to see on the camera this is one of the
few<00:01:08.510> little<00:01:09.510> flaws<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> jersey<00:01:10.260> had<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:12.540> name

looks<00:01:13.439> very<00:01:14.240> close<00:01:15.240> together<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:17.130> overall

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
looks very close together and overall

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.810 
looks very close together and overall
kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.270> sloppy<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
kind of sloppy you can see like the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.310 
kind of sloppy you can see like the
stitching<00:01:21.290> which<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.759> run<00:01:24.119> across

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.480 

the<00:01:28.320> whole<00:01:28.470> thing

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
the whole thing

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.460 
the whole thing
so<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.030> mean<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.420> closer<00:01:31.659> I<00:01:31.810> look<00:01:32.020> at<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.320> the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
so I mean the closer I look at it the

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.060 
so I mean the closer I look at it the
more<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.299> shittier<00:01:34.690> job<00:01:34.990> it<00:01:35.140> looks<00:01:35.170> but<00:01:35.979> I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
more of a shittier job it looks but I

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.120 
more of a shittier job it looks but I
don't<00:01:36.250> really<00:01:36.430> care<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.260> a<00:01:38.290> solicitor

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130
