00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:11.120
 Hi everyone, how are you? I want to talk. 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.150
 with you a respect of motorcycle battery 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.029
 using scented clothing is the people that 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.110
 xenon and show then governed type and 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.640
 with br 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.740
 Troy, I know it's pop, it's typing, we live with 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.849
 that constant risk of the battery 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.470
 Downloaded there we'll keep in hand 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.230
 but people always ask a year and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.330
 fashion in the comments of the corn is 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.400
 where I was showing how it is in the 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.280
 china people ask what to do 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.199
 not to charge good battery 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 there are several alternatives that 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.460
 people take it from you to carry you 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.650
 some people replace the battery 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.080
 thiago feres the bike for a battery of 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.059
 nobreak the matter 7 on vacation 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.559
 this will not guarantee that the solution 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.210
 of the problem she may be sick 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.549
 remains lit for a little more than 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.909
 time but will not really guarantee that 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:04.040
 download cef is not download 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.190
 can actually be unloaded is 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.580
 some other people usually do the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.620
 following exchange this lamp here 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.570
 water genius 42 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.140
 tell me not usually this lamp 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.600
 here is 50 watts and is inclusive 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.200
 I put there in the site in the site a phenom 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.120
 a goal lamp hence 20 parents 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.120
 It's not going to dominate so much conversation. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.330
 from here but maicon will provide a 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.860
 largest current in the chain is 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.080
 the battle will have a little more 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.630
 chain for when you want to give 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 xenon will not be in Japan for a while 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.510
 more time 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.780
 other people are looking to do what 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.930
 move the bike bombina to death 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.970
 really is looking to generate more current 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.090
 and this senate came to be that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.530
 would be the most feasible and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.930
 alternative to stroll because really 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.630
 arrived it would not discharge the battery 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.610
 that the girl would be generating more 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.450
 was some people and despite 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.960
 from China 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.390
 can provide is more possible to resort to 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.340
 for people who have their new bikes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.120
 and do not want the installation is the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.810
 Following 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.180
 try to use the floor only at night, right? 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.459
 avoid using shea nou during the day for 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.930
 here during the exciting day 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.310
 mainly with the yellow lamp 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.420
 and your mountain recharges its 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.250
 right battery 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.110
 so you will have competitors 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.959
 enough to use arrived during the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.140
 night when you need it, you should also avoid 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.480
 use the arrive every day is because the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.579
 not really be you need because 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.769
 when you start using every day 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:47.209
 It's you or it's every night and it 's when 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.890
 walk around in such br 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.989
 sometimes you do not walk the time 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.160
 enough in the morning to recharge 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.380
 your batteries 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.190
 so sometimes people listen I call 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.959
 during the week and arrived really goes 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.450
 erases does not recharge the battery anymore 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.310
 certain necessary 10 to spend two three 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.250
 four five days ahead source 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.370
 she arrived off for dolls 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.030
 so my tip is usually that 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.830
 folks 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.380
 try to use shea not only when 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.360
 necessary and if you do not want to move in 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.380
 electric part of your motorcycle a person 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.410
 there is also the issue of motorbikes 50 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:30.050
 alternating is that power is soon atrocious 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.610
 warns poor these functions with boarding school 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.440
 for 15 what happens 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.270
 there is one government and the other in the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.820
 appears in the photos that I'm going to work on 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.100
 with them the inside and the china 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.420
 experience a goal because these nodes 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.700
 we have the part there 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.190
 she made the following renan is already beyond 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.470
 You do not have to cut each battery 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.130
 also believe some people who have 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.500
 bikes we did not unload battery then 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.380
 really stay here for you who are 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.260
 the 11 and nine bikes will be given right 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.510
 I want to thank God that I had 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 any experience regarding 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.890
 large battery and voice 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.540
 xenon guitar 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.140
 I will not put here below the video 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.519
 Okay, let's extend this partnership come 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.579
 commenting that I'm focused here 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.730
 down green and share and button 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.760
