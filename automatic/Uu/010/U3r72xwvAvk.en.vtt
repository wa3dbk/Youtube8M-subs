not on the PRI or Prime because if it's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.480 
not on the PRI or Prime because if it's
on<00:00:49.230> Prime<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.010> happen<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.370> when

build it up on boxes or something and
put<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.569> the<00:01:18.659> gas<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.100> you

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
put it into the gas can and then if you

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.279 
put it into the gas can and then if you
move<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.579> to<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.819> prime<00:01:21.149> position<00:01:21.749> your

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
move this to the prime position your

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.080 
move this to the prime position your
fuel<00:01:22.619> petcock<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.600> gas<00:01:24.780> should<00:01:25.020> come<00:01:25.229> out

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
fuel petcock the gas should come out

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.059 
fuel petcock the gas should come out
I've<00:01:27.090> gone<00:01:27.569> ahead<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.840> I've<00:01:28.170> emptied<00:01:28.799> this

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
I've gone ahead and I've emptied this

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.690 
I've gone ahead and I've emptied this
tank<00:01:29.579> ahead<00:01:29.819> of<00:01:29.939> time<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.590> now<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.429> word

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
tank ahead of time so now one one word

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.849 
tank ahead of time so now one one word
on<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.359> way<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> fuel<00:01:34.200> petcock<00:01:34.619> works

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
on this the way the fuel petcock works

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.940 
on this the way the fuel petcock works
on<00:01:35.039> these<00:01:35.159> motorcycles<00:01:35.819> is<00:01:36.770> they<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
on these motorcycles is they have a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.879 
on these motorcycles is they have a
vacuum<00:01:38.280> valve<00:01:38.909> underneath<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.289> it

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
vacuum valve underneath here and it

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.669 
vacuum valve underneath here and it
works<00:01:41.009> off<00:01:41.249> from<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.789> engine<00:01:42.149> vacuum<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> what

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
works off from the engine vacuum so what

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.609 
works off from the engine vacuum so what
happens<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.600> when<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.719> start<00:01:45.749> the<00:01:46.139> engine<00:01:46.469> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
happens is when you start the engine and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230 
happens is when you start the engine and
the<00:01:46.799> engines<00:01:47.100> running<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.549> creates<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.030> vacuum

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the engines running it creates a vacuum

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
the engines running it creates a vacuum
which<00:01:48.719> lets<00:01:49.530> gasoline<00:01:50.219> run<00:01:50.429> into<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
which lets gasoline run into the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.399 
which lets gasoline run into the
carburetor<00:01:51.209> but<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.929> long<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.289> engine

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
carburetor but as long as the engine

carburetor but as long as the engine
shut<00:01:52.859> off<00:01:52.889> and<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.609> not<00:01:53.789> running<00:01:53.999> the<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
vacuum switch stops the gas from going

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.469 
vacuum switch stops the gas from going
into<00:01:58.139> the<00:01:58.200> carburetor<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.609> when<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
into the carburetor so when when that is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.929 
into the carburetor so when when that is
on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.380> reserve<00:02:01.740> position<00:02:02.459> there<00:02:02.729> it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
on the on or reserve position there it

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
on the on or reserve position there it
should<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.479> let<00:02:03.689> gas<00:02:03.959> out<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.499> if<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> does

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
should not let gas out now if it does

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
should not let gas out now if it does
you<00:02:05.340> probably<00:02:05.609> want<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.819> replace<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.179> vacuum

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you probably want to replace that vacuum

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.529 
you probably want to replace that vacuum
switch<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:08.520> underneath<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> petcock

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
switch that's underneath the petcock

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.960 
switch that's underneath the petcock
here<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.610> little<00:02:11.730> quick

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
here so a that's just a little quick

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.119 
here so a that's just a little quick
word<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.299> how<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.629> works<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.170> anyway<00:02:13.980> go

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
word on how that works so anyway go

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.080 
word on how that works so anyway go
ahead<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:14.370> drain<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.700> gas

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
ahead and drain that gas

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.699 
ahead and drain that gas
think<00:02:15.209> really<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:16.379> we'll<00:02:16.590> be

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
think really well and then we'll be

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.809 
think really well and then we'll be
right<00:02:16.860> back<00:02:19.040> okay<00:02:20.040> our<00:02:20.160> next<00:02:20.190> step<00:02:20.580> on

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
right back okay our next step on

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.390 
right back okay our next step on
removing<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.660> tank<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.769> go<00:02:23.129> ahead<00:02:23.190> let's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
removing the tank is to go ahead let's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.009 
removing the tank is to go ahead let's
go<00:02:23.489> ahead<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.730> chalk<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> wheel<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.840> rear

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
go ahead and chalk up the wheel the rear

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.199 
go ahead and chalk up the wheel the rear
wheel<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.650> might<00:02:25.800> want<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.129> keep<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
wheel because you might want to keep the

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.610 
wheel because you might want to keep the
bike<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:27.540> rocking<00:02:27.959> back<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.319> forth<00:02:28.500> as

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
bike from rocking back and forth as

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
bike from rocking back and forth as
you're<00:02:28.739> trying<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> get<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.220> tank<00:02:29.459> off

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you're trying to get the tank off

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.280 
you're trying to get the tank off
because<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> if<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.660> rocks<00:02:30.870> too<00:02:31.019> much<00:02:31.170> I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
because if you if a rocks too much I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.320 
because if you if a rocks too much I
could<00:02:31.500> come<00:02:31.860> off<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.099> kickstand<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.670> tip

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
could come off the kickstand and tip

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.270 
could come off the kickstand and tip
over<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.019> would<00:02:34.260> chock<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.890> rear<00:02:35.069> wheel

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
over so I would chock up the rear wheel

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.449 
over so I would chock up the rear wheel
and<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:36.180> go<00:02:36.510> ahead<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:36.780> put<00:02:37.500> your<00:02:37.530> fuel

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
and then go ahead and put your fuel

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.470 
and then go ahead and put your fuel
petcock<00:02:39.390> back<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> either<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> reserved

location<00:02:42.480> there<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.780> way<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:42.989> will<00:02:43.049> keep<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
location there that way it will keep the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.780 
location there that way it will keep the
gas<00:02:43.590> from<00:02:43.769> sloshing<00:02:44.310> out<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> little<00:02:44.610> bit

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
gas from sloshing out a little bit

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.880 
gas from sloshing out a little bit
that's<00:02:44.910> left<00:02:45.180> over<00:02:45.299> okay<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.410> next<00:02:46.620> thing<00:02:46.680> we

up a little bit okay there's a back the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.910 
up a little bit okay there's a back the
vacuum<00:03:18.569> line<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.989> we<00:03:19.079> talked<00:03:19.380> about<00:03:19.500> earlier

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
vacuum line that we talked about earlier

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.410 
vacuum line that we talked about earlier
that<00:03:19.980> goes<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> switch<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.269> other

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
that goes to the switch on the other

that goes to the switch on the other
side<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.750> petcock<00:03:22.109> this<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> line

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
side of the petcock this is the line

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.910 
side of the petcock this is the line
right<00:03:23.730> here<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.079> it's<00:03:25.650> got<00:03:25.799> this

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
right here this is this it's got this

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.280 
right here this is this it's got this
metal<00:03:26.430> coil<00:03:26.790> over<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.840> want<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.109> go<00:03:28.200> ahead

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
metal coil over it we want to go ahead

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.170 
metal coil over it we want to go ahead
and<00:03:28.530> pry<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.190> off<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.489> carburetor<00:03:29.910> there

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
and pry that off the carburetor there

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.150 
and pry that off the carburetor there
I've<00:03:30.389> done<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.810> ahead<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.109> time<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.410> there's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
I've done this ahead of time so there's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.470 
I've done this ahead of time so there's
a<00:03:32.220> little<00:03:32.430> clip<00:03:32.549> there<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:32.880> just<00:03:32.970> squeeze

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
a little clip there you can just squeeze

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.789 
a little clip there you can just squeeze
it<00:03:33.690> with<00:03:33.780> some<00:03:33.900> pliers<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.410> then<00:03:34.530> go<00:03:34.650> ahead

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
it with some pliers and then go ahead

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.699 
it with some pliers and then go ahead
and<00:03:34.920> just<00:03:35.040> pry<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.959> vacuum<00:03:36.959> line<00:03:37.139> off<00:03:37.349> like

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and just pry that vacuum line off like

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.780 
and just pry that vacuum line off like
so<00:03:38.299> there<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.389> is<00:03:40.069> and<00:03:41.069> then<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.700> go

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
so there it is and then I like to go

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.860 
so there it is and then I like to go
ahead<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.030> shove<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.420> through<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.750> other

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
ahead and shove that through the other

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.379 
ahead and shove that through the other
side<00:03:43.459> go<00:03:44.459> ahead<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.669> push<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:44.880> through<00:03:45.269> the

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
side go ahead and push that through the

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.699 
side go ahead and push that through the
other<00:03:45.540> side<00:03:45.750> because<00:03:45.959> when<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.319> remove<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
other side because when you remove the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.930 
other side because when you remove the
tank<00:03:46.919> you'll<00:03:47.160> want<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.639> out<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
tank you'll want to have it out of the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.390 
tank you'll want to have it out of the
way<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.090> go<00:03:48.690> ahead<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.010> we'll<00:03:50.190> be

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
way so go ahead and do that and we'll be

way so go ahead and do that and we'll be
right<00:03:50.730> back<00:03:52.220> okay<00:03:53.220> our<00:03:53.459> next<00:03:53.489> step<00:03:53.849> is<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.120> go

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
right back okay our next step is to go

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.120 
right back okay our next step is to go
ahead<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.569> what<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.769> here<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.040> I

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
lift the tank off so uh here's the

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.990 
lift the tank off so uh here's the
vacuum<00:04:50.479> line<00:04:50.689> it's<00:04:51.289> out<00:04:51.439> of<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.590> way<00:04:51.879> so<00:04:52.879> we're

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
vacuum line it's out of the way so we're

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.999 
vacuum line it's out of the way so we're
on<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.180> side<00:04:53.389> fuel<00:04:54.379> line's<00:04:54.590> out<00:04:54.770> of<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.919> way

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
on this side fuel line's out of the way

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.920 
on this side fuel line's out of the way
I<00:04:55.250> think<00:04:55.639> now<00:04:55.969> if<00:04:56.090> we<00:04:56.210> just<00:04:56.360> go<00:04:56.509> ahead<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:56.780> just

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
I think now if we just go ahead and just

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.170 
I think now if we just go ahead and just
kind<00:04:57.919> of<00:04:57.949> get<00:04:58.129> kind<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.550> lift<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.819> tank<00:04:59.030> up

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
kind of get kind of to lift the tank up

ring seals around that area right there

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.890 
ring seals around that area right there
so<00:07:00.880> check<00:07:01.880> that<00:07:01.910> out<00:07:02.090> and<00:07:02.390> then<00:07:02.450> we'll<00:07:02.810> go

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
from the speedometer cluster down inside

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:31.240 
from the speedometer cluster down inside
there<00:07:26.110> take<00:07:27.110> that<00:07:27.290> out<00:07:29.260> okay<00:07:30.260> and<00:07:30.560> then<00:07:30.740> the

down inside there I just use like a
handle<00:07:39.460> just<00:07:40.460> go<00:07:40.520> ahead<00:07:40.580> and<00:07:40.790> screws<00:07:41.000> I've

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300 
handle just go ahead and screws I've

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.840 
handle just go ahead and screws I've
done<00:07:41.450> these<00:07:41.600> ahead<00:07:41.810> of<00:07:41.870> time<00:07:41.990> so<00:07:42.140> you<00:07:42.410> can<00:07:42.850> see

done these ahead of time so you can see
how<00:07:43.940> it<00:07:44.000> goes<00:07:44.180> but<00:07:44.390> anyway<00:07:44.600> go<00:07:44.720> ahead<00:07:44.750> and<00:07:44.930> take

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.510 
stuff off and then your speedometer

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.969

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:51.979 
should just come right out of the front

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:52.450 
should just come right out of the front
of<00:07:52.070> the<00:07:52.130> tank
