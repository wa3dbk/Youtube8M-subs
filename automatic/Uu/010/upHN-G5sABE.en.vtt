00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
team I think is to be able to take a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.130 
team I think is to be able to take a
game<00:00:16.190> that<00:00:16.460> was<00:00:16.780> successful<00:00:17.780> I<00:00:17.840> had<00:00:17.990> some

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
game that was successful I had some

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.510 
game that was successful I had some
great<00:00:18.260> ideas<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.710> innovated<00:00:19.280> in<00:00:19.340> a<00:00:19.400> lot<00:00:19.490> of

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
great ideas and innovated in a lot of

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.640 
great ideas and innovated in a lot of
areas<00:00:19.759> and<00:00:20.119> really<00:00:20.240> trying<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:20.779> fix<00:00:21.410> all<00:00:21.560> the

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
areas and really trying to fix all the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.990 
areas and really trying to fix all the
problems<00:00:21.679> with<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.189> first<00:00:22.340> one<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:22.670> really

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
problems with the first one and really

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.609 
problems with the first one and really
focus<00:00:23.330> it<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:23.599> make<00:00:23.689> a<00:00:23.720> game<00:00:23.990> that's<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.529> know

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
focus it and make a game that's you know

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.050 
focus it and make a game that's you know
that's<00:00:24.830> really<00:00:24.980> competitive<00:00:25.580> with<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:25.849> top

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
that's really competitive with the top

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.669 
that's really competitive with the top
tier<00:00:26.240> of<00:00:26.359> shooters<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:26.839> think<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.109> two<00:00:27.289> big

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
tier of shooters I think the two big

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.380 
tier of shooters I think the two big
ideas<00:00:27.949> are<00:00:28.400> one<00:00:28.580> is<00:00:28.699> that<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.000> inherently

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
ideas are one is that it's inherently

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.060 
ideas are one is that it's inherently
co-op<00:00:29.810> there's<00:00:30.019> no<00:00:30.109> escaping<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.589> co-op<00:00:30.890> an

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
co-op there's no escaping the co-op an

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.770 
co-op there's no escaping the co-op an
army<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.400> two<00:00:31.550> lots<00:00:32.060> of<00:00:32.119> other<00:00:32.270> games<00:00:32.509> have<00:00:32.750> you

army of two lots of other games have you

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.410

the<00:01:12.860> 40th<00:01:13.220> day<00:01:13.250> initiative<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.940> big<00:01:14.300> focus<00:01:14.570> for

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
the 40th day initiative a big focus for

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.240 
the 40th day initiative a big focus for
us<00:01:14.690> too<00:01:14.870> is<00:01:14.990> making<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:15.620> just<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.070> world

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
us too is making not just the world

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.920 
us too is making not just the world
believable<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.090> characters<00:01:17.420> believable

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
believable but the characters believable

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.780 
believable but the characters believable
and<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.650> first<00:01:18.830> game<00:01:19.040> because<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.610> master

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
and in the first game because the master

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.490 
and in the first game because the master
are<00:01:20.000> always<00:01:20.450> down<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:20.870> these<00:01:20.930> must<00:01:21.170> became

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
are always down and these must became

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.320 
are always down and these must became
massively<00:01:22.159> iconic<00:01:22.730> I<00:01:22.850> think<00:01:23.030> that's<00:01:23.150> very

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
massively iconic I think that's very

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.149 
massively iconic I think that's very
powerful<00:01:23.510> but<00:01:24.200> we<00:01:24.320> also<00:01:24.470> wanted<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.860> create

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
powerful but we also wanted to create

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.190 
powerful but we also wanted to create
characters<00:01:25.400> where<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.390> know<00:01:26.510> they<00:01:27.050> can

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
characters where you know they can

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.570 
characters where you know they can
actually<00:01:27.320> flip<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.740> mask<00:01:27.950> up<00:01:28.159> outside<00:01:28.520> of

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
actually flip the mask up outside of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.510 
actually flip the mask up outside of
combat<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.440> be<00:01:30.590> believable<00:01:31.159> people

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
combat and and and be believable people

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.219 
combat and and and be believable people
in<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.760> environment<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:32.930> know<00:01:33.020> if<00:01:33.110> we

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
in the environment so you know if we

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.510 
in the environment so you know if we
want<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.440> do<00:01:33.500> cutscenes<00:01:33.920> or<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.370> your

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
want to do cutscenes or in your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.590 
want to do cutscenes or in your
interactions<00:01:35.000> with<00:01:35.090> other<00:01:35.210> characters

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
interactions with other characters

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.940 
interactions with other characters
they're<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:35.900> talking<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.440> sort<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.800> like<00:01:36.920> a

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
they're not talking to sort of like a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.530 
they're not talking to sort of like a
transformer<00:01:37.430> they're<00:01:37.760> talking<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.180> human

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
transformer they're talking to a human

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.990 
transformer they're talking to a human
being<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.800> lets<00:01:39.979> us<00:01:40.130> go<00:01:40.250> between<00:01:40.400> two<00:01:40.760> kind

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
being so it lets us go between two kind

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.090 
being so it lets us go between two kind
of<00:01:41.030> extremes<00:01:41.510> which<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.050> know<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.380> human

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
of extremes which is you know the human

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.560 
of extremes which is you know the human
version<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.729> then<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.940> kind<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.210> faceless

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
version and then the kind of faceless

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.969 
version and then the kind of faceless
killing<00:01:44.870> machine<00:01:45.080> version<00:01:45.290> which<00:01:45.560> i<00:01:45.680> think<00:01:45.740> is

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
killing machine version which i think is

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.770 
killing machine version which i think is
fun<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.610> keeps<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.000> sort<00:01:47.150> of<00:01:47.180> iconic<00:01:47.479> flavor

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
fun and keeps that sort of iconic flavor

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.690 
fun and keeps that sort of iconic flavor
one<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.409> big<00:01:48.560> keywords<00:01:49.159> for<00:01:49.310> us<00:01:49.430> too<00:01:49.610> is

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
one of the big keywords for us too is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.100 
one of the big keywords for us too is
that<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.000> choice<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:50.540> we're<00:01:50.690> going<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.870> allow

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
that is choice so we're going to allow

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.840 
that is choice so we're going to allow
you<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.290> be<00:01:51.440> less<00:01:51.650> nice<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.220> allow<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.580> be

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
you to be less nice and allow you to be

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.280 
you to be less nice and allow you to be
nicer<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.420> know<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.750> low<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:53.930> dollars<00:01:54.200> going

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
nicer you know the low the dollars going

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.800 
nicer you know the low the dollars going
to<00:01:54.409> be<00:01:54.440> keyed<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.280> actions<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.299> things<00:01:56.690> that

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
to be keyed on on actions so things that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.420 
to be keyed on on actions so things that
you've<00:01:56.900> done<00:01:57.080> in<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.260> past<00:01:57.350> will<00:01:57.860> key<00:01:58.010> future

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
you've done in the past will key future

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.920 
you've done in the past will key future
dialogue<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.120> choice<00:01:59.299> will<00:01:59.510> be<00:01:59.630> in<00:01:59.750> what

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
dialogue so the choice will be in what

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.080 
dialogue so the choice will be in what
you<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.200> like<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.740> know<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:01.100> showed<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> lot<00:02:02.060> of

you do like you know we showed a lot of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.940 
you do like you know we showed a lot of
the<00:02:02.240> hostage<00:02:02.540> scenarios<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.590> come<00:02:03.770> across

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
the hostage scenarios so you come across

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.649 
the hostage scenarios so you come across
hostages<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.820> scene<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.420> decide

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
hostages in the scene and you can decide

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.300 
hostages in the scene and you can decide
to<00:02:05.810> kill<00:02:05.990> them<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.320> then<00:02:06.380> later<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.890> your<00:02:07.159> guys

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
will comment on that and we're going to

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.759 
will comment on that and we're going to
assume<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.869> if<00:02:09.200> you're<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:09.470> sort<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.709> person

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
assume that if you're the sort of person

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.289 
assume that if you're the sort of person
who<00:02:10.009> goes<00:02:10.190> around<00:02:10.310> killing<00:02:10.549> hostages<00:02:10.849> then

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
who goes around killing hostages then

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.399 
who goes around killing hostages then
you're<00:02:11.420> not<00:02:11.510> exactly<00:02:11.749> the<00:02:11.989> nicest<00:02:12.079> of

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
you're not exactly the nicest of

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.019 
you're not exactly the nicest of
characters<00:02:12.859> so<00:02:13.010> we<00:02:13.430> might<00:02:13.579> give<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.849> bit<00:02:13.999> of

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:14.029 
characters so we might give you a bit of

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.420 
characters so we might give you a bit of
more<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.299> a<00:02:14.590> darker<00:02:15.590> tone<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.920> your<00:02:16.010> dialogue

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
more of a darker tone to your dialogue

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.870 
more of a darker tone to your dialogue
and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.310 
and
and<00:02:17.090> vice-versa<00:02:17.600> if<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.870> go<00:02:17.990> around<00:02:18.140> always

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
and vice-versa if you go around always

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.870 
and vice-versa if you go around always
looking<00:02:18.350> after<00:02:18.830> people<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.250> saving<00:02:19.580> people

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
looking after people and saving people

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.130 
looking after people and saving people
then<00:02:20.030> then<00:02:20.450> you're<00:02:20.570> going<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.750> be<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> little

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
then then you're going to be a little

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.380 
then then you're going to be a little
you<00:02:21.380> know<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.500> little<00:02:21.740> bit<00:02:21.860> nicer<00:02:22.070> but<00:02:22.640> also<00:02:22.790> I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
you know a little bit nicer but also I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.080 
you know a little bit nicer but also I
think<00:02:23.840> we're<00:02:24.170> pushing<00:02:24.350> most<00:02:24.710> of<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.430> they

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.640 
think we're pushing most of the the they

it's basically the ability to bring up a
little<00:02:45.380> window<00:02:45.590> into<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.040> world<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.400> will

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
little window into the world that will

little window into the world that will
give<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.760> extra<00:02:47.030> information<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.230> first

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
give you extra information so the first

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.200

game<00:02:48.560> had<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.160> GPS<00:02:49.550> line<00:02:49.820> which<00:02:50.030> showed

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
game had the the GPS line which showed

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.630 
game had the the GPS line which showed
you<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.660> path<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.710> your<00:02:51.770> next<00:02:52.040> objective<00:02:52.130> and
