00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.280
 the tools and before each week 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
 the large amphitheater of the sorbonne 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.770
 delahousse to sepa and an audience 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.389
 passionate there is listening to his word 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.070
 today he was kind enough to respond to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 questions that interested us we 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.509
 especially such the question 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.460
 concerning the resurfaced on which he 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.410
 dedicated to looking specifically at 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 our attention 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.189
 what influence do you think is exercising 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.919
 art in all its manifestations and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.890
 hold women in human behavior 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.250
 do you think that night in mind or in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.910
 contrary opens horizons for all 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.629
 activity that conditions life must to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 the long being pernicious although she 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.219
 could temporarily seemed good 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.129
 do if the dowry to help the man this 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.280
 can not be obviously when the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.730
 releasing this water conditioning 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.660
 without it becoming more sensitive to the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.240
 perception of the bo which is not the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:15.270
 negation of milk losc the art of good 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.760
 traditional or utilitarian it imposes 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.940
 conditioning that limit the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.100
 sensitivity and perception in 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.560
 opposition to this collective influence 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.220
 artists are tasks in order to 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.170
 discover new perceptions and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.130
 new modes of expression 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.640
 if this break is only a reaction 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.860
 it inevitably generates new 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.130
 models of new yom criteria that 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.150
 still imprison the mind the creation 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.650
 is never a reaction nor the product 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:03.030
 of a system or a criterion it is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.030
 own action we seem whatever she 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.370
 is reserved for a minority of people 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.610
 gifted because we confuse the ability 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.360
 of expression and the creative state 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.020
 this state and outside the field of 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.470
 the internet experience 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:30.099
 the athlete is only a car in 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.950
 corpo of memory and knowledge and 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:38.110
 can not concretely act on its contents 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.940
 so that there is creation 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:47.530
 it must stop thinking when the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.330
 thought is quite silent without 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.060
 Inside requirement there have created 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.110
 timeless enlightened minds 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.250
 is worried about the invasion of 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.910
 technique what do you think the technique 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.450
 is necessary it is well the cans 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.940
 but we must not transform everything 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 the process of our cabins have a 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.040
 memory case 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.019
 to learn a technique is very easy 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.650
 but and creators it's something else 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.720
 we believe that we are sufficient 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.680
 to learn a technique to become 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.100
 creator but the skill is not 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.489
 creation the technique we will have a 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 escape products eyes it keeps us 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.840
 to make their discoveries on or of a 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.079
 creative state the development and the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.670
 mechanism of the technique are 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:56.819
 fascinating easy to konÃ© don siegel the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:01.450
 task of integrating is arduous if we 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:05.739
 do not integrate the various entities that 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.549
 takes us away as well as their activities 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:13.660
 we can not be creative this 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:16.810
 deep integration nuptials established that 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.530
 by understanding the whole 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.840
 structure of our era since the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.130
 superficial layers of our 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.900
 consciousness 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.270
 up to the secrets 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.630
 to learn a technique avoided the 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.729
 discovery and understanding of these 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.350
 deep layers of consciousness 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:45.610
 they are ourselves the creative state 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.360
 is a constant discovered and we are 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.300
 deprive of this experience 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.600
 when our mind is absorbed by 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.280
 knowledge what remedies 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.760
 advocated you to current chaos our 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.300
 way of approaching this issue is well 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.840
 more important than the action she is 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.680
 of paramount importance 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.500
 know how to examine a problem 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.010
 this is important is that at 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.360
 mans can only be discovered when 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:28.960
 we are able to examine a 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.810
 question through ourselves and not to 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.750
 through two formulas 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.250
 I tell you that since this is a 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.479
 global catastrophe 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:44.320
 to examine it a spirit without 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:48.870
 prejudices you can not examine it 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:54.000
 as Christian Muslim Hindus 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:57.449
 at the end said nor as a capitalist 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.750
 bourgeois or proletarian communist 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:05.880
 it's because everyone looks at it under 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.919
 a limited aspect and offers remedies 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:14.020
 conditioned by a point of view 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:17.169
 particular that the crisis is there we 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:21.340
 we find before a precipice at 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:24.789
 edge of which we were brought by 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.300
 a distortion of our minds 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:31.409
 this situation developed at the 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:36.070
 favor of centuries of social division 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:37.960
 misallocation of the wealth of 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.039
 formula 1 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:45.910
 we have reached a misery at a 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:48.970
 indiscreet confusion if this is it 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:52.050
 that we want in France he 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.389
 we must move away from precipices 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:59.400
 look again at all our traditions 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.400
 in general
