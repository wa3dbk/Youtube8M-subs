00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this video I'm gonna show you how to

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.910 
in this video I'm gonna show you how to
sneak<00:00:03.179> through<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.510> sonars<00:00:04.020> in<00:00:04.319> Far<00:00:04.680> Cry<00:00:04.830> 3

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
sneak through the sonars in Far Cry 3

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.249 
sneak through the sonars in Far Cry 3
without<00:00:05.370> being<00:00:05.700> detected<00:00:05.819> so<00:00:06.629> there<00:00:06.960> are<00:00:07.049> four

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
without being detected so there are four

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.110 
without being detected so there are four
different<00:00:07.290> checkpoints<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.429> I'm<00:00:08.849> going<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
different checkpoints and I'm going to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.000 
different checkpoints and I'm going to
go<00:00:09.300> through<00:00:09.510> each<00:00:09.750> one<00:00:09.990> individually<00:00:10.380> because

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
go through each one individually because

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.910 
go through each one individually because
I<00:00:11.460> failed<00:00:12.030> times<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.500> first<00:00:13.710> checkpoint

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
I failed times so the first checkpoint

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.560 
I failed times so the first checkpoint
is<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> easiest<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.389> reward

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
is the easiest is just going to reward

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.390 
is the easiest is just going to reward

alert then what you need to do is just

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.790 
alert then what you need to do is just
wait<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.450> guard<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.989> walk<00:00:37.170> around<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

wait for this guard to walk around and
go<00:00:37.950> into<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.399> cave<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> don't<00:00:39.120> need<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
need to throw rocks to the far left of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.869 
need to throw rocks to the far left of
the<00:00:52.260> cave<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.040> they've<00:00:53.190> both<00:00:53.400> got<00:00:53.790> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the cave so that they've both got the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.939 
the cave so that they've both got the
back<00:00:54.089> turned<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> far<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.650> cave

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
back turned to the far right of the cave

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.310 
back turned to the far right of the cave
this<00:00:56.909> might<00:00:57.150> take<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> few<00:00:57.510> attempts<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> get

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this might take a few attempts to get

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:15.139 
this might take a few attempts to get
them<00:00:58.470> to<00:00:58.620> both<00:00:58.800> turn<00:00:59.040> around<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.460> once<00:01:14.149> but

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
them to both turn around at once but

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.400 
them to both turn around at once but
once<00:01:15.330> they<00:01:15.509> both<00:01:15.690> turn<00:01:15.929> around<00:01:16.200> you're<00:01:16.380> just

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
once they both turn around you're just

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.440 
once they both turn around you're just
going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> sneak<00:01:17.190> through<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.910> far<00:01:18.179> right<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
going to sneak through the far right of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:46.179 
going to sneak through the far right of
the<00:01:18.690> cave<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.679> little<00:01:19.920> path<00:01:20.220> here

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.319 

and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.670> you're<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.969> to<00:01:48.090> come<00:01:48.210> across

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and then you're going to come across

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.910 
and then you're going to come across
another<00:01:48.810> guard<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.229> need<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> throw<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
bridge there's no guards in this next

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
bit but just be careful that you don't

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.649 
bit but just be careful that you don't
run<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.460> attract<00:01:59.939> guards

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
run because it will attract guards

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:32.230 
run because it will attract guards
nearby<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
and then once you go through that cave

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.780 
and then once you go through that cave
that's<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.640> second<00:02:35.090> checkpoint<00:02:36.490> so<00:02:37.490> for<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
that's the second checkpoint so for the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.160 
that's the second checkpoint so for the
first<00:02:38.030> part<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.300> this<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.810> need<00:02:38.930> to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
first part of this you just need to

first part of this you just need to
sneak<00:02:39.440> across<00:02:39.710> keep<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.760> far<00:02:40.970> left

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
