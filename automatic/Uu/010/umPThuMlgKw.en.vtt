00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.390
 and now let's see what to do in the 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 in which case the cord remains ejected 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.620
 out at the hearing of his abuser 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 let's go my son tried screws 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.020
 let's remove the cover screws 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.150
 we removed the perfect screws above 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.270
 see this shell we have to remove 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.829
 the screws that are firm in the handle in 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.829
 this way comes over everything 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.300
 now who we see working though 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.730
 let's take the case where we have to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.149
 loosen this screw we unload the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 world 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 in case we are in one 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.880
 situation like that where love is 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:26.420
 ran away and Lanyard and download 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:30.080
 completely out with pliers 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:38.119
 we take one end of the spring e 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:46.430
 let's try to close it all inside the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:48.880
 his housing in as many votes because he did not 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.880
 you have nothing 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.490
 once the spring has re-entered the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.420
 its headquarters 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.630
 we get to this record here if you see 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.970
 here at a small break this must 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:16.070
 to fit into the end of the spring 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.230
 at the beginning how you want to call it first 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.730
 to put this one goes its cover 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.730
 that to his verse 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:40.930
 you have to put this where the end is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:46.650
 of the spring then started to play 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:50.550
 the agreement once the spring is mounted 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.550
 arguing to turn to the left 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:00.630
 we do not enter with the rope we find it 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.630
 all the charge even more the spring 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:19.030
 once entered the new wave of 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:26.800
 bring back the word but let's see 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:30.310
 a close life here is this then 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.300
 we are going to reassemble and will show you a 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.070
 job done 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.870
 if it works this is the first time 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.670
 I do a job like that so not 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.310
 I know if it can be done in other ways 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.220
 I improvised so don't take it 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.630
 all for man thanks 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.630
 let's try to see if we can 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.560
 yes the mechanism works the rope 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.560
 return we have solved
