00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.070
 the basis here is taken broccoli 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.980
 also we will add cabbage 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.099

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.739
 green and green beans 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.559
 besides we need potatoes 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.649
 carrots and onions all in one copy 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.570
 let's start with the fact that while we 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.940
 defrost all of you all these vegetables here 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.520
 these here in the freeze after not at me 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.270
 slightly defrosted we will now wash 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.730
 cold water but first thing first 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.300
 Let's start by cleaning the potatoes and 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.829
 put it to boil potatoes cut into 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.570
 arbitrary shape and cook about 5-7 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.540
 minutes while we deal with our 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.670
 vegetables and so is cooking our 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.070
 vegetable puree soup we start with 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.959
 potatoes and then pour half 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.600
 liter of water and give boil 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:23.450
 we drop our potatoes here cut into 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.100
 freeze some salt 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.779
 Need to gay salt and later us potatoes 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.179
 boil for seven to ten minutes 

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:35.020
 and only after that we will be here 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:38.209
 run all our other ingredients 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.029
 while we cook potatoes we 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:45.649
 wash with cold water 

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:48.439
 our our greens mean for one and a half 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.770
 liter of water but somewhere we take these 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.289
 seven large broccoli florets 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.709
 cabbage well here I have in this case 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.950

 also here it is these places are not cooked 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.950
 longer you try them so now 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.520
 less so as to cut such 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.520
