00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.729
 in this video I'm going to show you a 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.400
 error that comes in many of the 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.709
 versions of tractor pro 2 I only know that 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.490
 there are two versions that do not have one 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.560
 is version 203 the other one is that it's a 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.020
 older version but I do not remember 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.910
 what is the error happens when we are 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.280
 sounding a track and then doing the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.440
 mix when we press that feels 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.869
 a subtle audio cut as it will jump 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.039
 the beep I will do it several times so that 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.039
 notice and pay close attention 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.549
 it is important to clarify that this only 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.069
 happens when tractor has selected 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.090
 the bicing in tempo mode singh no 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.090
 this error happens 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.700
 this is all friends we listen to in the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.360
 next video do not forget them 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.480
