00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
most important part of this Joss is the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.910 
most important part of this Joss is the
controller<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.960> focus<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.619> what

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
controller we really focus a lot on what

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.690 
controller we really focus a lot on what
gamers<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.580> looking<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.090> precise<00:01:27.720> controls

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
tactility right sizing what makes it we

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.920 
tactility right sizing what makes it we
are<00:01:32.070> different<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.700> gives<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> potential

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
are different and gives it the potential

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.109 
are different and gives it the potential
of<00:01:34.079> changing<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.189> gaming<00:01:35.490> environment<00:01:35.610> is
