DJ I blame wheel 450 quadcopter just a
quick<00:00:12.190> look<00:00:12.370> around<00:00:12.460> I've<00:00:12.730> got<00:00:12.849> the<00:00:12.940> stock<00:00:13.349> DJI

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
quick look around I've got the stock DJI

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.220 
quick look around I've got the stock DJI
motors<00:00:15.280> and<00:00:15.879> I'm<00:00:16.000> using<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.390> API<00:00:16.630> for<00:00:16.689> crops

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
motors and I'm using the API for crops

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.050 
motors and I'm using the API for crops
that<00:00:17.439> came<00:00:17.680> with<00:00:17.860> it<00:00:17.890> right<00:00:18.130> now<00:00:18.189> and<00:00:18.700> it

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
that came with it right now and it

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.970 
that came with it right now and it
actually<00:00:19.119> seems<00:00:19.869> like<00:00:20.020> it<00:00:20.140> produces<00:00:20.590> plenty

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
actually seems like it produces plenty

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.799 
actually seems like it produces plenty
of<00:00:21.099> thrust<00:00:22.200> to<00:00:23.200> lift<00:00:23.230> all<00:00:23.710> this<00:00:23.919> stuff<00:00:24.809> I'm

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:25.809 
of thrust to lift all this stuff I'm

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:27.389 
of thrust to lift all this stuff I'm
pretty<00:00:26.050> happy<00:00:26.169> with<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:26.559> I<00:00:26.619> got<00:00:27.099> a<00:00:27.130> bunch<00:00:27.340> of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
top the KKT point o controller board and

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.099 
top the KKT point o controller board and
the<00:00:45.670> reason<00:00:45.940> I've<00:00:46.030> got<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.329> mounted<00:00:46.570> on<00:00:46.839> top

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
the reason I've got it mounted on top

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.899 
the reason I've got it mounted on top
right<00:00:47.499> now<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.829> just<00:00:47.859> so<00:00:48.219> I<00:00:48.249> can<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:48.460> tweak<00:00:48.730> it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
right now is just so I can you tweak it

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.279 
right now is just so I can you tweak it
and<00:00:49.030> get<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.269> buttons<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.839> all<00:00:49.929> that<00:00:50.109> good

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
and get to the buttons and all that good

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.229 
and get to the buttons and all that good
stuff<00:00:50.350> once<00:00:50.859> it's<00:00:51.010> completely<00:00:51.429> tweaked<00:00:52.059> out

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
stuff once it's completely tweaked out

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.809 
stuff once it's completely tweaked out
the<00:00:52.420> way<00:00:52.539> I<00:00:52.570> like<00:00:52.960> it<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.350> I'm<00:00:54.129> satisfied<00:00:54.429> with

the way I like it and I'm satisfied with
the<00:00:54.909> way<00:00:54.999> it's<00:00:55.149> flying<00:00:55.420> I'm<00:00:55.719> gonna<00:00:55.839> put<00:00:56.019> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the way it's flying I'm gonna put it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.630 
the way it's flying I'm gonna put it
inside<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.499> case<00:00:59.710> here<00:00:59.980> which<00:01:00.339> will<00:01:00.460> protect

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
inside the case here which will protect

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.630 
inside the case here which will protect
it<00:01:00.969> really<00:01:01.210> well<00:01:01.390> from<00:01:02.129> any<00:01:03.129> bumps<00:01:03.489> and

and it's just shock mounted with some
foam<00:01:14.610> I've<00:01:15.610> got<00:01:16.860> about<00:01:17.860> six<00:01:18.550> inch<00:01:18.870> risers<00:01:19.870> here

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350

are made out of 10 millimeter carbon
fiber<00:01:25.720> square<00:01:26.200> tubing<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.860> I've<00:01:27.760> just<00:01:28.000> got<00:01:28.210> it

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
fiber square tubing and I've just got it

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.970 
fiber square tubing and I've just got it
CA<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:30.010> zip<00:01:30.160> tied<00:01:30.370> on<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.410> far<00:01:32.440> they've

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
CA and zip tied on so so far they've

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:41.120 
CA and zip tied on so so far they've
worked<00:01:33.520> ok<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.490> back<00:01:38.400> cheesy<00:01:39.400> little<00:01:39.940> um

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
worked ok on the back cheesy little um

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.670 
worked ok on the back cheesy little um
dsm2<00:01:42.130> receiver<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.540> only<00:01:43.810> using<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.260> just<00:01:44.590> a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
dsm2 receiver and only using that just a

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.440 
dsm2 receiver and only using that just a
test<00:01:44.980> hover<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.520> all<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.820> good<00:01:45.970> stuff<00:01:46.030> so

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
test hover and all that good stuff so

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.980 
test hover and all that good stuff so
I'll<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.880> better<00:01:49.120> receiver<00:01:49.510> for<00:01:49.900> it

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
I'll get a better receiver for it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.110 
I'll get a better receiver for it
eventually<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:51.340> not<00:01:51.460> sure<00:01:51.640> what<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:51.910> want<00:01:52.060> to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
eventually I'm not sure what I want to

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.410 
eventually I'm not sure what I want to
put<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.360> here<00:01:52.600> yet<00:01:53.130> I've<00:01:54.130> got<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.850> 200

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.910 

and<00:02:05.590> I've<00:02:05.740> got<00:02:05.770> my<00:02:06.100> battery<00:02:07.920> apparently

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
and I've got my battery apparently

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.880 
and I've got my battery apparently
mounted<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.520> bottom<00:02:09.850> there<00:02:10.060> me<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
mounted on the bottom there me and that

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.090 
mounted on the bottom there me and that
will<00:02:12.010> probably<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.700> moved<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.120> top<00:02:13.950> once<00:02:14.950> i

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
will probably be moved to the top once i

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.770 
will probably be moved to the top once i
move<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.550> flight<00:02:15.760> controller<00:02:16.180> underneath

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
move the flight controller underneath

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.510 
move the flight controller underneath
and<00:02:17.230> that's<00:02:17.800> going<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> give<00:02:18.190> me<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> option

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and that's going to give me the option

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.890 
and that's going to give me the option
to<00:02:18.760> put<00:02:19.150> my<00:02:20.080> camera<00:02:20.320> mount<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.800> bottom<00:02:21.900> so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
to put my camera mount on the bottom so

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.160 
to put my camera mount on the bottom so
let's<00:02:23.470> see<00:02:24.660> everything's<00:02:25.660> soldered<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
let's see everything's soldered to the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.120 
let's see everything's soldered to the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440

the way a 550 quadcopter but i think
it's<00:04:11.650> an<00:04:11.739> aluminum<00:04:12.250> frame<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:13.720> i<00:04:13.900> picked<00:04:14.170> up
