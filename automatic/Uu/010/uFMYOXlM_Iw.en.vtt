00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.330 
isn't coming back down like that it just
stays<00:02:48.700> there<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.709> kind<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:50.980> click<00:02:51.220> it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
stays there you have to kind of click it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.039 
stays there you have to kind of click it
back<00:02:51.549> yourself<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:55.420> I'm<00:02:56.130> right<00:02:57.130> here<00:02:58.049> this

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
back yourself then I'm right here this

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.440 
back yourself then I'm right here this
little<00:02:59.320> spring<00:02:59.920> part<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.760> connects<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.329> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
little spring part that connects to the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.890 
little spring part that connects to the
shadow<00:03:01.690> there<00:03:02.820> you'll<00:03:03.820> see<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.269> there's<00:03:04.540> two

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
shadow there you'll see that there's two

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.289 
shadow there you'll see that there's two
little<00:03:05.320> holes<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:06.370> got<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.670> little<00:03:06.820> spring

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
little holes we got that little spring

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.849 
little holes we got that little spring
and<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:07.630> move<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.019> back<00:03:08.230> into<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.620> other

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
and just move it back into the other

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.090 
and just move it back into the other
hole<00:03:09.160> now<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.239> should<00:03:10.600> fix<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.650> problem

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
hole now that should fix the problem

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.160 
hole now that should fix the problem
you've<00:03:12.310> been<00:03:12.340> having<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.450> moved<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
you've been having so I moved it to the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.900 
you've been having so I moved it to the
third<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.980> one<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> little<00:03:15.370> bit<00:03:15.549> further<00:03:15.820> out

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
third the one a little bit further out

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.340 
third the one a little bit further out
you'll<00:03:16.150> know<00:03:16.329> what<00:03:16.420> i<00:03:16.480> mean<00:03:16.630> when<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.840> open<00:03:17.260> up

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
you'll know what i mean when you open up

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.470 
you'll know what i mean when you open up
your<00:03:17.410> camera<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.280> idea<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:19.030> an

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
your camera so the idea is that an

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.440 
your camera so the idea is that an
electronic<00:03:20.049> pulses<00:03:20.500> sent<00:03:20.739> out<00:03:20.890> when<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.450> fire

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
electronic pulses sent out when you fire

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.599 
electronic pulses sent out when you fire
your<00:03:22.480> shutter<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.500> comes<00:03:23.890> through<00:03:24.160> here<00:03:24.459> and

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
your shutter that comes through here and

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.640 
your shutter that comes through here and
tells<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.470> little<00:03:26.470> bottom<00:03:27.370> shutter<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:28.269> stay

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
tells this little bottom shutter to stay

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.440 
tells this little bottom shutter to stay
shut<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.579> now<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.820> see<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.120> we're<00:03:31.329> actually

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
shut so now you see that we're actually

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.080 
shut so now you see that we're actually
getting<00:03:31.750> loaded<00:03:32.109> through<00:03:32.470> but<00:03:33.130> when<00:03:33.940> you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
getting loaded through but when you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.720 
getting loaded through but when you
don't<00:03:34.329> have<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.690> electronics<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:36.040> comes<00:03:36.489> up

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
don't have the electronics it comes up

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.690 
don't have the electronics it comes up
with<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.840> all<00:03:37.989> we<00:03:38.140> do<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:39.190> grab<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.400> little

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
with it so all we do is we grab a little

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.400 
with it so all we do is we grab a little
magnet<00:03:40.060> we're<00:03:40.329> going<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.570> keep<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.870> pot<00:03:41.109> shot

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
magnet we're going to keep this pot shot

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.660 
magnet we're going to keep this pot shot
with<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> magnet<00:03:41.980> sir<00:03:42.220> ye<00:03:42.760> Shannon

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
with a magnet sir ye Shannon

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.210 
with a magnet sir ye Shannon
keep<00:03:44.240> that<00:03:44.450> down<00:03:44.750> there<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.319> then<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.010> pop

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
keep that down there and then you pop

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.839 
keep that down there and then you pop
your<00:03:46.400> magnet<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:47.020> like<00:03:48.020> that<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:49.930> now<00:03:51.849> your

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
your magnet in like that and now your

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.610 
your magnet in like that and now your
shutter<00:03:53.950> will<00:03:54.950> stay<00:03:55.580> shut<00:03:56.260> now<00:03:57.260> if<00:03:57.349> you<00:03:57.440> don't

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
shutter will stay shut now if you don't

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.110 
shutter will stay shut now if you don't
have<00:03:57.770> a<00:03:57.800> magnet<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.370> if<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:58.670> isn't<00:03:58.970> really

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
have a magnet and if this isn't really

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.420 
have a magnet and if this isn't really
working<00:03:59.420> for<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.020> you<00:04:00.950> can<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.220> find

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
working for you you can just find

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.540 
working for you you can just find
another<00:04:01.520> way<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:01.940> keep<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:03.280> bottom<00:04:04.280> shutter

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
another way to keep this bottom shutter

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.699 
another way to keep this bottom shutter
to<00:04:04.880> stay<00:04:05.209> down<00:04:05.750> rather<00:04:06.560> than<00:04:06.770> coming<00:04:07.069> up<00:04:07.250> with

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
to stay down rather than coming up with

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.040 
to stay down rather than coming up with
the<00:04:09.709> other<00:04:09.830> shut<00:04:10.100> off<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:11.540> you're<00:04:11.750> going<00:04:11.900> to

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
the other shut off so you're going to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.740 
the other shut off so you're going to
try<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:12.830> do<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.310> use<00:04:13.880> your<00:04:13.910> little<00:04:14.239> magnet<00:04:14.599> to

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
try and do is use your little magnet to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.120 
try and do is use your little magnet to
keep<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.140> down<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:16.310> now<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:16.880> opens<00:04:17.720> up

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
keep that down so now that opens up

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.409 
keep that down so now that opens up
without<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.280> bottom<00:04:19.489> trailer<00:04:19.700> coming<00:04:20.000> up<00:04:20.120> and

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
without the bottom trailer coming up and

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:31.569 
without the bottom trailer coming up and
all<00:04:20.630> we<00:04:20.720> do<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:20.930> put<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:21.530> back<00:04:21.799> together

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:31.579 

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:40.359 

then<00:04:32.579> close<00:04:33.059> back<00:04:33.119> up<00:04:34.819> put<00:04:35.819> your<00:04:35.939> film<00:04:36.179> in<00:04:38.149> and

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:40.369 
then close back up put your film in and

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:43.669 
then close back up put your film in and
now<00:04:41.369> you<00:04:41.429> have<00:04:41.759> a<00:04:42.059> working<00:04:42.509> allroad<00:04:43.079> compact

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:43.679 
now you have a working allroad compact

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:46.249 
now you have a working allroad compact
camera<00:04:44.039> you<00:04:44.729> really<00:04:45.179> have<00:04:45.360> many<00:04:45.629> settings<00:04:46.110> to

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
camera you really have many settings to

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.709 
camera you really have many settings to
play<00:04:46.439> with<00:04:46.619> you<00:04:46.829> do<00:04:47.039> have<00:04:47.459> this<00:04:47.969> switch<00:04:48.389> here

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
play with you do have this switch here

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.379 
play with you do have this switch here
which<00:04:49.079> will<00:04:49.610> pretty<00:04:50.610> much<00:04:50.699> change<00:04:51.209> the

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
which will pretty much change the

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.850 
which will pretty much change the
aperture<00:04:51.719> from<00:04:52.229> something<00:04:53.069> something<00:04:54.860> this

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
aperture from something something this

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.559 
aperture from something something this
switch<00:04:56.159> won't<00:04:56.459> do<00:04:56.699> anything<00:04:56.909> anymore<00:04:57.239> this

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
switch won't do anything anymore this

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.209 
switch won't do anything anymore this
little<00:04:57.899> dark<00:04:58.139> and<00:04:58.349> light<00:04:58.469> and<00:04:58.679> switch<00:04:59.009> because

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
little dark and light and switch because

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.909 
little dark and light and switch because
that<00:04:59.639> has<00:04:59.909> been<00:05:00.239> shut<00:05:00.479> off<00:05:00.769> because<00:05:01.769> there's

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
that has been shut off because there's

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.779 
that has been shut off because there's
no<00:05:02.009> batteries<00:05:02.489> but<00:05:02.879> I'm<00:05:03.089> pretty<00:05:03.479> sure<00:05:04.579> you<00:05:05.579> can

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
no batteries but I'm pretty sure you can

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.869 
no batteries but I'm pretty sure you can
work<00:05:05.969> out<00:05:06.179> something<00:05:06.479> maybe<00:05:06.869> if<00:05:07.019> you<00:05:07.139> just

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
work out something maybe if you just

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.100 
work out something maybe if you just
push<00:05:08.879> it<00:05:08.909> really<00:05:09.299> quick<00:05:09.509> you<00:05:09.659> should<00:05:09.869> be<00:05:10.019> able

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
push it really quick you should be able
