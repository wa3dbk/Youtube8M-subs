dude such a plain red rash free for a

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.430 
dude such a plain red rash free for a
moment<00:06:38.610> what<00:06:38.699> you<00:06:38.789> take<00:06:38.940> fall<00:06:39.289> it<00:06:40.289> was

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
moment what you take fall it was

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.659 
moment what you take fall it was
definitely<00:06:40.830> not<00:06:41.009> living<00:06:41.370> up<00:06:41.460> to<00:06:41.490> the

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
definitely not living up to the

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.879 
definitely not living up to the
nostalgia<00:06:42.150> hype<00:06:42.300> that<00:06:42.479> I<00:06:42.509> had<00:06:42.780> it<00:06:42.900> I<00:06:43.380> still<00:06:43.740> I

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
nostalgia hype that I had it I still I

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.740 
nostalgia hype that I had it I still I
think<00:06:43.949> the<00:06:44.160> past<00:06:44.400> two<00:06:44.880> games<00:06:45.120> that<00:06:45.389> we<00:06:45.479> played

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
think the past two games that we played

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.140 
think the past two games that we played
have<00:06:46.050> not<00:06:46.349> lived<00:06:46.620> up<00:06:46.770> no<00:06:47.250> I<00:06:48.530> mean<00:06:49.530> it's<00:06:49.710> like<00:06:49.830> I

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
have not lived up no I mean it's like I

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.879 
have not lived up no I mean it's like I
think<00:06:51.150> when<00:06:51.539> you're<00:06:51.660> younger<00:06:51.930> games<00:06:52.620> seem

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
think when you're younger games seem

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.189 
think when you're younger games seem
better<00:06:53.160> because<00:06:53.580> you<00:06:53.759> had<00:06:54.630> to<00:06:54.810> play<00:06:54.990> them

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 
better because you had to play them

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.390 
better because you had to play them
because<00:06:55.590> he<00:06:55.710> wouldn't<00:06:55.889> have<00:06:56.009> the<00:06:56.099> money<00:06:56.130> to

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
because he wouldn't have the money to

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.309 
because he wouldn't have the money to
either<00:06:56.550> rent<00:06:56.849> another<00:06:57.030> game<00:06:57.360> or<00:06:57.660> buy<00:06:58.169> another

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 
either rent another game or buy another

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.930 
either rent another game or buy another
game<00:06:58.650> so<00:06:58.860> you<00:06:58.919> were<00:06:59.009> like<00:06:59.160> this<00:06:59.430> has<00:06:59.669> to<00:06:59.819> be

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
game so you were like this has to be

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.270 
game so you were like this has to be
good<00:07:00.150> and<00:07:00.330> he<00:07:00.389> was<00:07:00.509> like<00:07:01.020> made<00:07:01.620> sure<00:07:01.919> you<00:07:02.069> kept

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
good and he was like made sure you kept

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.520 
good and he was like made sure you kept
playing<00:07:02.430> it<00:07:02.610> until<00:07:02.910> it<00:07:03.000> was<00:07:03.150> good<00:07:03.419> and<00:07:04.319> this

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
playing it until it was good and this

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.659 
playing it until it was good and this
game<00:07:04.680> could<00:07:04.919> have<00:07:04.949> been<00:07:05.160> good<00:07:05.250> if<00:07:05.310> we<00:07:05.490> played

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
game could have been good if we played

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.010 
game could have been good if we played
it<00:07:05.759> for<00:07:05.789> maybe<00:07:05.970> another<00:07:06.150> two<00:07:06.389> hours<00:07:06.419> it<00:07:06.900> got

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
it for maybe another two hours it got

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.080 
it for maybe another two hours it got
better<00:07:07.169> bikes<00:07:07.470> but<00:07:08.159> barring<00:07:08.789> through<00:07:09.000> the

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
better bikes but barring through the

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.330 
better bikes but barring through the
crappiness<00:07:09.720> of<00:07:09.990> the<00:07:10.229> early<00:07:10.620> game<00:07:10.770> is<00:07:10.979> not

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
crappiness of the early game is not

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.670 
crappiness of the early game is not
worth<00:07:11.580> it<00:07:11.759> no<00:07:12.090> you<00:07:12.300> knew<00:07:12.449> I<00:07:12.960> mean<00:07:13.409> it<00:07:13.560> looks

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
worth it no you knew I mean it looks
