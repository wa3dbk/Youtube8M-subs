00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.000
 ok my friends we even have three 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.410
 minutes all a bit all of us 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 That's why we have to treat the rectal ones anyway 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.700
 and welcome my name is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.400
 reputable now is singleplayer gameplay 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.199
 10 of the new medal of honor warfighter 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.270
 I've played at all 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:30.090
 electronic arts in cologne and i wish 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:32.399
 Have fun watching the video 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.980
 Gameplay scenes of today's videos 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.840
 Last weekend were at electronic 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.120
 arts in Cologne directly from myself 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.309
 recorded and he plays so we see 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.829
 here almost in medal of honor dolak 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.620
 loskill gameplay of the finest art 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 we were able to do two singleplayer campaigns 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 to play from the first single player 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.719
 campaign we are allowed now three 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.190
 minutes cut shows and that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.190
 I want to do this for you today 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.030
 or the whole course with the pc 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.430
 directly two gtx 680 in the sli connected so 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.710
 There was plenty of computing power available 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.750
 and I hope the you tube quality 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 can still compete with that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.680
 what we saw right on the spot 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.110
 namely graphically x men of honor one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.430
 Real real power sets the game 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.799
 he likes the same engine 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.049
 Battlefield 3 and is in my opinion 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.240
 after even a bit more 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.860
 screwed on a bit more refined 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.290
 So all the shadows are very ingenious 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 your weapon of slow motion 10 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.270
 Lighting is extremely good in scene 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 set so graphically leaves the game 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.369
 really nothing to be desired from 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.780
 the campaign is really going on 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.780
 whole time only around 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.360
 that does not just mean that it's here 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.770
 naturally tidy oomph and crashes 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.310
 and lots of houses in the air 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.640
 fly 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.079
 the level was also very good 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.060
 varied from his tasks 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.649
 we had a normal shooter mission 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.840
 we now see this little mini board 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.310
 I just tax what a very 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.659
 cool sequence what i did before 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 could not imagine we did that 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.950
 new sequence in the end and everything will be 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.899
 again with immediately scripted 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.209
 sequences and so on 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.940
 the flow of the game is really good 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.470
 persist will run the rock, the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.700
 Maybe you can spend all this time 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.200
 say deeper and even more 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.420
 Hacking afterwards also not exactly 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.860
 the fine English kind good that we are on 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.830
 every case still protecting the gun 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.040
 have it almost comes then 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.140
 gentlemanlike quiet has a particularly good 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.940
 I also liked the dynamics in the game 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.830
 So this change between fast 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.150
 10 that you have to walk frequently until the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.290
 next mission comes that one also times 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.840
 peace and there is already again 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.090
 the next of the quasi an ointment 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.920
 cartridges is waiting and that's right 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.690
 made really cool so the game 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.070
 you can hardly breathe 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.870
 you can of course a bit 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.850
 slow, here is my side 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.950
 building purely times you try 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.170
 to shoot one from the cover of 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.620
 get colleagues ammo and continue 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.209
 it's going to fight the next one 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.980
 in addition to the beautiful graphics is the very 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.600
 awesome sound really a point of the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.829
 okay impressed me here 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.350
 I also found sunbeams right 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.120
 great but we have quite often 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.100
 silent teeth in the game and then have 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.200
 we explosions and we hear individual 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.480
 gun shots that's really great 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.819
 made this combination 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.920
 supposedly peaceful quiet until 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.280
 The first shots are real 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.200
 So you should be excellent shooter because of 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.670
 then play the singleplayer part 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 I am sure that we medal 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.870
 of honor continue to do something decent 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.599
 get to gamble 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.709
 On the 25th of october it's time for me 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.730
 I hope I have you one 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.950
 bit with my own 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.239
 I can entertain gameplay scenes 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.190
 Say goodbye to me here now 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.470
 a headshot says thank you for watching 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.470
 until next time and skin in
