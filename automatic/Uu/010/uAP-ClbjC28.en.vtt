00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
get to them and it was pouring rain I

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.100 
get to them and it was pouring rain I
sat<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.470> bank<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.980> fell<00:01:52.190> asleep<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:53.110> slept

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
sat on the bank and fell asleep I slept

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.800 
sat on the bank and fell asleep I slept
for<00:01:54.290> 19<00:01:54.710> hours<00:01:55.100> straight<00:01:55.360> they<00:01:56.360> left<00:01:56.570> me<00:01:56.780> there

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
for 19 hours straight they left me there

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.520 
for 19 hours straight they left me there
asleep<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:58.060> woke<00:01:59.060> up<00:01:59.330> in<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.570> rain<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.229> thought

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
asleep I woke up in the rain and thought

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.880 
asleep I woke up in the rain and thought
there's<00:02:01.310> probably<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.940> better<00:02:02.210> way<00:02:02.479> than<00:02:02.510> this

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
there's probably a better way than this

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.350 
there's probably a better way than this
so<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.920> decided<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.640> do<00:02:04.910> carpentry<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:07.149> was<00:02:08.149> one
