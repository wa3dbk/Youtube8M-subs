trouble just paying the interest on his
loans<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:15.299> obvious<00:01:15.720> solution<00:01:16.080> would<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
loans the obvious solution would be to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.399 
loans the obvious solution would be to
either<00:01:17.189> cut<00:01:17.580> spending<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.210> increase<00:01:18.869> taxes

either cut spending or increase taxes

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.249 
either cut spending or increase taxes
but<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.520> he<00:01:20.610> cut<00:01:20.880> spending<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.840> people<00:01:22.110> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
but if he cut spending the people that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
but if he cut spending the people that
he's<00:01:22.380> spending<00:01:22.830> money<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.939> complain

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
he's spending money on would complain

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.880 
he's spending money on would complain
that<00:01:24.330> they<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.049> money<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> spend<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that they don't have money to spend and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.850 
that they don't have money to spend and
that<00:01:26.369> he<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.610> hurting<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> economy<00:01:27.650> if<00:01:28.650> he

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that he was hurting the economy if he

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.950 
that he was hurting the economy if he
tried<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> raise<00:01:29.460> taxes<00:01:30.060> enough<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.720> close

tried to raise taxes enough to close
this<00:01:31.470> gap<00:01:31.939> not<00:01:32.939> only<00:01:33.240> would<00:01:33.360> people

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
this gap not only would people

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.109 
this gap not only would people
definitely<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.500> less<00:01:34.680> money<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> spend<00:01:35.119> he'd

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
definitely have less money to spend he'd

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
definitely have less money to spend he'd
probably<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.450> riots<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.170> his<00:01:37.290> hands<00:01:37.700> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
probably have riots on his hands so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
probably have riots on his hands so
