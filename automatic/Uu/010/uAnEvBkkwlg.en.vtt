talk to him almost every day on FaceTime

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.359 
talk to him almost every day on FaceTime
and<00:01:20.900> know<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.170> great<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:23.220> had

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and know it was great and they they had

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
and know it was great and they they had
a<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.759> had<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.909> hot<00:01:24.150> start<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> season

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
a they had a hot start and the season

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.550 
a they had a hot start and the season
didn't<00:01:26.340> run<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.000> good<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.290> guess

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
didn't run that that good and so I guess

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
didn't run that that good and so I guess
they<00:01:28.740> finally<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.400> finally<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.180> finally

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
they finally they finally they finally

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.420 
they finally they finally they finally
made<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.900> far<00:01:31.439> better<00:01:31.710> especially<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
made it far better especially in the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
made it far better especially in the
league<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.930> disciplined<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
league it was very very disciplined that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
league it was very very disciplined that
they<00:01:34.740> lost<00:01:34.979> against<00:01:35.340> washing<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:35.790> home<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
they lost against washing at home and in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.510 
they lost against washing at home and in
the<00:01:36.630> cup<00:01:36.840> game<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> guess<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the cup game and so I guess there was a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
the cup game and so I guess there was a
big<00:01:38.729> chance<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> finals<00:01:40.320> but

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
big chance to to make in the finals but

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.679 
big chance to to make in the finals but
so<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.610> still<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> big<00:01:42.240> chance<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
so you know it's still a big chance to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.170 
so you know it's still a big chance to
to<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.710> play<00:01:43.890> us<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
to make it into play us and just the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.300 
to make it into play us and just the
main<00:01:45.390> tag<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> main<00:01:46.110> goal<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.590> guess<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
main tag and the main goal I guess the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
main tag and the main goal I guess the
season<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.729> well<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.869> everything<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
season as well and so everything is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.109 
season as well and so everything is
possible<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:50.070> especially<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.579> America<00:01:51.000> as

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
possible here especially in America as

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.310 
possible here especially in America as
soon<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.479> make<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> end<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
soon as we make it in the end the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.639 
soon as we make it in the end the
playoffs<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.540> win<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.470> they

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
playoffs you can you can win and so they

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990

honestly<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.239> was<00:02:44.420> really<00:02:44.660> pissed<00:02:44.840> off<00:02:45.019> because

honestly I was really pissed off because

two<00:02:46.069> days<00:02:46.220> later<00:02:46.610> Daniel<00:02:47.030> sent<00:02:47.390> me<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.950> a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
two days later Daniel sent me and like a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.309 
two days later Daniel sent me and like a
video<00:02:49.340> how<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:50.239> touched<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.690> cup<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.200> was

video how we touched the cup and I was

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.410 
video how we touched the cup and I was
really<00:02:51.560> disappointed<00:02:52.069> because<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.640> guess<00:02:53.390> he

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
really disappointed because I guess he

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.440 
really disappointed because I guess he
knew<00:02:53.840> how<00:02:54.110> much<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.860> would<00:02:55.370> affect<00:02:55.730> me<00:02:56.239> because

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
knew how much it would affect me because

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.750 
knew how much it would affect me because
I<00:02:57.049> don't<00:02:57.440> know<00:02:57.500> he<00:02:57.680> doesn't<00:02:57.980> care<00:02:58.129> about<00:02:58.370> about

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
I don't know he doesn't care about about

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.550 
I don't know he doesn't care about about
the<00:02:59.000> Blackhawks<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.510> about<00:02:59.750> ice<00:02:59.989> hockey<00:03:00.049> and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
the Blackhawks and about ice hockey and

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.490 
the Blackhawks and about ice hockey and
I<00:03:01.549> really<00:03:02.060> do<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.540> maybe<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.200> should<00:03:03.349> be

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
I really do and so maybe it should be

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.770 
I really do and so maybe it should be
different<00:03:04.069> that<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> touched<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:05.269> car<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:05.660> it
