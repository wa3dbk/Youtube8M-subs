00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
of the gun the piston chamber comes

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.880 
of the gun the piston chamber comes
right<00:01:17.070> out<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> front<00:01:18.320> nothing<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
right out of the front nothing to it you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
right out of the front nothing to it you
want<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> clean<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:21.229> give<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> look<00:01:22.530> through

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
want to clean it give you a look through

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
want to clean it give you a look through
the<00:01:22.890> piston<00:01:23.369> chamber<00:01:23.479> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> clean<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> no

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the piston chamber want to clean it no

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.440 
the piston chamber want to clean it no
prob<00:01:25.619> comes<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> front<00:01:27.020> piston

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
prob comes right out of the front piston

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
prob comes right out of the front piston
if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> clean<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> piston<00:01:31.590> really

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
if you want to clean the piston really

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.520 
if you want to clean the piston really
quickly<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.390> easily<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.350> but

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
quickly that's very easily to be but

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.480 
quickly that's very easily to be but
piston<00:01:35.960> protrudes<00:01:36.960> past<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.680> outer<00:01:37.829> casing

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
piston protrudes past the outer casing

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.670 
piston protrudes past the outer casing
so<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.299> squish<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> around<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.110> solvents

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so you can squish it around the solvents

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.120 
so you can squish it around the solvents
run<00:01:41.280> water<00:01:41.549> over<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.590> whatever<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.829> need<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
run water over it whatever you need to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
run water over it whatever you need to
do<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.640> clean<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.350> easy<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
do to clean a lot it's very easy to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.749 
do to clean a lot it's very easy to
clean<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.939> put<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.299> back<00:01:48.479> together<00:01:48.689> again

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
clean you put it back together again

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.050 
clean you put it back together again
slides<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.229> piston<00:01:56.790> give<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.880> another

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
slides over the piston give you another

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.859 
slides over the piston give you another
look<00:01:58.990> at<00:01:59.259> how<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.710> piston<00:02:00.369> rides<00:02:01.180> back<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
look at how the piston rides back and

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.760 
look at how the piston rides back and
forth<00:02:02.140> in<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.799> piston<00:02:03.220> chamber<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
forth in the piston chamber and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.830 
forth in the piston chamber and
everything<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.979> fastened<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.789> place<00:02:12.840> by

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
everything is fastened in place by

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.789 
everything is fastened in place by
tightening<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.670> front<00:02:15.670> collar

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.089 

and<00:02:22.799> that's<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:24.260> when<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> use<00:02:25.469> the<00:02:25.499> gun<00:02:25.799> I<00:02:25.829> like

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
and that's it when I use the gun I like

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.739 
and that's it when I use the gun I like
to<00:02:26.249> put<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> little<00:02:26.549> plastic<00:02:26.969> bag<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749 
to put a little plastic bag in the

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.800 
to put a little plastic bag in the
piston<00:02:28.170> chamber<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:29.599> there's<00:02:30.599> something

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
piston chamber so there's something

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
piston chamber so there's something
separating<00:02:31.170> all<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> parts<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.159> the<00:02:32.280> gun<00:02:32.519> from

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
separating all the parts of the gun from

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.170 
separating all the parts of the gun from
the<00:02:33.329> material<00:02:33.840> being<00:02:33.930> applied<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.969> to<00:02:35.969> do

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
