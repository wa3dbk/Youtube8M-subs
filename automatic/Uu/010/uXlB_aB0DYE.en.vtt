00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
now remember in the first video I had a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.649 
now remember in the first video I had a
handful<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.470> hair<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.909> brushing

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
handful of hair and that was brushing

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.170 
handful of hair and that was brushing
just<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.259> did<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.759> before<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.119> do

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just like I did now right before I do

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
just like I did now right before I do
the<00:02:00.390> video<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.740> showing<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.250> on

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the video so I'm showing you got it on

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.889 
the video so I'm showing you got it on
camera<00:02:02.630> one<00:02:04.430> two<00:02:06.649> three<00:02:07.649> strings<00:02:08.129> opposed<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
camera one two three strings opposed to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.380 
camera one two three strings opposed to
the<00:02:10.610> big<00:02:11.610> clump

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the big clump

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.240 
the big clump
that<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.600> had<00:02:12.840> before<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.530> three<00:02:13.890> strands

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
that I had before so three strands

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.050 
that I had before so three strands
shared<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.850> me<00:02:14.970> brushing<00:02:15.360> at<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.630> time<00:02:17.060> so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
shared for me brushing at that time so

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.790 
shared for me brushing at that time so
I'm<00:02:18.209> guessing<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.500> are<00:02:19.770> having

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
I'm guessing that if you are having

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.940 
I'm guessing that if you are having
problems<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:21.390> hair<00:02:21.660> maybe<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.800> have

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
problems with this hair maybe you have

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.610 
problems with this hair maybe you have
to<00:02:23.100> wash<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.580> first<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.569> because<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.410> has

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
to wash it first and then because it has

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460 
to wash it first and then because it has
significantly<00:02:26.430> stopped<00:02:26.850> not<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> point

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
significantly stopped not to the point

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.930 
significantly stopped not to the point
where<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.740> doesn't<00:02:28.830> shed<00:02:29.160> at<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:29.730> it's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
where it doesn't shed at all but it's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.350 
where it doesn't shed at all but it's
definitely<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> lot<00:02:31.560> less<00:02:31.980> than<00:02:32.030> what<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.270> was

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
definitely a lot less than what it was

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.020 
definitely a lot less than what it was
shedding<00:02:33.660> before<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.410> I'm<00:02:35.400> happy<00:02:35.760> about<00:02:35.850> that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
shedding before so I'm happy about that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.400 
shedding before so I'm happy about that
um<00:02:37.790> yeah<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.150> really<00:02:39.540> nice<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.959> just<00:02:39.989> I'm
