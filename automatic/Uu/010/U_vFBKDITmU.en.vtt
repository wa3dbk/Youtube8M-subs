crawdads all kind of little things
there's<00:00:37.830> a<00:00:37.890> whole<00:00:38.690> science<00:00:39.690> project<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.470> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there's a whole science project in that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.580 
there's a whole science project in that
grass<00:00:40.830> man<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:41.970> what<00:00:42.150> happens<00:00:42.630> is<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.380> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
grass man and so what happens is is it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
grass man and so what happens is is it
the<00:00:43.620> bluegill<00:00:44.190> come<00:00:44.910> under<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.210> grass<00:00:45.480> mat

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the bluegill come under that grass mat

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
the bluegill come under that grass mat
to<00:00:46.020> eat<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> beetles<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.800> bugs<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to eat the beetles and the bugs and the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.280 
to eat the beetles and the bugs and the
little<00:00:47.550> shrimp<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.870> comes<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
little shrimp and then here comes the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.110 
little shrimp and then here comes the
big<00:00:49.470> boys<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:49.950> behind<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.490> to<00:00:50.880> eat<00:00:51.000> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
they can eat the bluegill number one but

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.840

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so a little crawdad imitation like this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.430 
so a little crawdad imitation like this
bruiser<00:01:26.490> intruder<00:01:27.000> again<00:01:27.840> matched<00:01:28.050> up<00:01:28.320> with

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
bruiser intruder again matched up with

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.410 
bruiser intruder again matched up with
that<00:01:28.620> big<00:01:28.800> river<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.580> ounce<00:01:29.700> uh<00:01:29.909> well

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that big river to see one ounce uh well

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.719 
that big river to see one ounce uh well
actually<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:30.840> ounce<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.290> half<00:01:31.320> weight

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
actually that's ounce and a half weight

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.649 
actually that's ounce and a half weight
gets<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> through<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> grass<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.330> that's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
gets it through the grass and that's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
gets it through the grass and that's
good<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.280> why<00:01:35.490> those<00:01:35.640> fish<00:01:35.909> are<00:01:36.060> under

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
good but that's why those fish are under

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.190 
good but that's why those fish are under
there<00:01:36.420> they're<00:01:36.570> under<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:36.870> eating<00:01:37.140> a

long two and a half inches long the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.860 
long two and a half inches long the
Beals<00:02:19.310> are<00:02:19.580> small<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.120> bluegill<00:02:20.450> are<00:02:20.630> small

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
Beals are small the bluegill are small

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.420 
Beals are small the bluegill are small
there's<00:02:21.440> all<00:02:21.560> kind<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.800> little<00:02:21.920> things<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.340> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
there's all kind of little things in it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.480 
there's all kind of little things in it
and<00:02:22.610> nothing's<00:02:22.910> real<00:02:23.150> big<00:02:23.480> except<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.230> bass

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
and nothing's real big except the bass

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.750 
and nothing's real big except the bass
so<00:02:25.490> that's<00:02:26.450> why<00:02:26.780> grass<00:02:27.140> mats<00:02:27.470> are<00:02:27.650> good<00:02:27.830> is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
so that's why grass mats are good is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.280 
so that's why grass mats are good is
because<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.330> basically<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.840> food<00:02:30.110> source

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
because it's basically a food source

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.900 
because it's basically a food source
it's<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.890> floating<00:02:31.220> refrigerator

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
it's like a little floating refrigerator

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.370 
it's like a little floating refrigerator
out<00:02:32.090> there<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.630> can<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:32.930> visualize

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
out there so if you can just visualize

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.430 
out there so if you can just visualize
that<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:34.100> understand<00:02:34.520> why<00:02:35.080> those<00:02:36.080> are<00:02:36.110> good

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
that and understand why those are good

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.990 
that and understand why those are good
and<00:02:36.890> if<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.220> ever<00:02:37.310> get<00:02:37.460> in<00:02:37.550> an<00:02:37.640> area<00:02:37.880> where

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and if you ever get in an area where

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.070 
and if you ever get in an area where
there's<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.150> whole<00:02:38.300> bunch<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.570> grass<00:02:38.780> mats

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
there's a whole bunch of grass mats

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.040 
there's a whole bunch of grass mats
