00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 two 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.290
 Greetings friends, I'm the Fraud 74 and I 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 I will present lanceaba part of the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.190
 true stories about 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 caricatures continuing as 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.690
 we had a good time without taking more 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.070
 parties this time I'll tell you a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.080
 story 1 dead couple know how the fox 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.779
 has a strange way of counting the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.880
 chapters of the simpsons do not count 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 some making the number of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.859
 episodes is inconsistent the reason for 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.670
 this strange fact is an episode 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.469
 lost from season 1 find 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.930
 details of this episode is something 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.940
 difficult because nobody from the staff that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.370
 he worked on the show at that time 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.680
 talk about it so 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.430
 they managed to collect the lost episode 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.539
 It was written entirely by Matt Groening 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.410
 during the production of the first 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.079
 Mata season acted extra 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.109
 he was silent he looked nervous and something 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.300
 I forgot to mention is someone who 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.430
 was present at those times so 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.979
 regular makes the person angry 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.100
 question and you are prohibited from mentioning 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.409
 mother today first of this event in a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.210
 event where david silverman was 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 talking to someone in the audience 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.580
 he asked about the episode and silverman 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.689
 he just came out of the scene 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.810
 suddenly ending the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.140
 presentation the episode number 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.090
 lost was 7 06 with the title of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.720
 edward bar dead 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.579
 the episode 706 English Moor was made 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.770
 afterwards and he was granted the code of 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.710
 production of dead bar to hide the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.770
 existence of this one 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.510
 in addition to causing anger to ask 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.400
 any staff member on the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.170
 chapter will take you to do everything 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.930
 possible to stop talking 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.570
 directly with malware or in a 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.940
 fan convention and I managed to follow it after 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.009
 who finished talking to the public and 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.990
 eventually I had an opportunity to 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.280
 talk to him as he left the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.690
 building did not wet him that followed him 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.390
 probably thinking that he was another fan 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.940
 typical when I mentioned the episode 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.610
 lost he got stick and he started to 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.370
 tremble when I asked him if he could 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.850
 give details seemed to be about to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.030
 cry took a piece of paper he wrote 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.980
 with her mmm the audio begged me because 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.940
 never again mention the episode of 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.190
 new 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.320
 in the piece of paper was the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.319
 address of a site because I will not say 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.870
 for reasons to narrate in a second 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.840
 and enter the indicator address between 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.420
 a completely black site except for 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.909
 a line of yellow text a link of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.389
 download I clicked on the file 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:50.629
 started to get off once I finished 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:53.269
 download it my computer went crazy the 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:56.120
 worst of mine that you have seen restore 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.629
 system did not work the computer had 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.780
 have to be formatted totally before 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.389
 this copy the file to a cb and try to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.250
 open it on my new computer 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.030
 totally clean and as suspects 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.670
 it was an episode of the simpsons 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.860
 the episode began like all the others 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.620
 but with an animation quality 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.230
 really poor if they have seen the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.050
 animation to submit to benin was 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.150
 similar but less stable in the first 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.300
 part of it was normal but the characters 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.850
 they were a bit out of it 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.340
 homero looked angry, marjés looked 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.040
 depressed lisa looked extreme 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.290
 anxious was going seemed to be full of anger 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.420
 towards his parents 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.730
 the episode was about the simpsons 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.040
 going on a plane trip and almost to 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.680
 end of the first part when the 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.320
 plane was about 20 or 30 meters in 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.620
 the air bar broke a window of this 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.840
 was sucked out at the beginning of 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.030
 the series badly had an idea that the 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.430
 animated style of the world of the simpsons 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.690
 represent life and that death 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.380
 it will make everything more realistic 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.600
 that's why this episode happened the image of 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.760
 marta's corpse was barely recognizable 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.160
 in taking the full advantage of not 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.430
 they should cheer him up they made a drawing almost 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.560
 Realistic photo of the corpse of Barnes the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.930
 first act ended with an image 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.260
 extremely graphic of the corpse of barbie 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.930
 when the second homerous act began 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.220
 marge and liza were sitting at the table 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.370
 from the kitchen crying 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.770
 the crying seemed not to end 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.360
 becoming more painful and sounding 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.340
 extremely realistic with a better 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.100
 performance of which I would believe to the possible 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.230
 the animation began to decay even more 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.260
 while they cried and you could listen 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.720
 murmurs in the background the characters 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.060
 it seemed just animated 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.190
 they were lengthening and erasing themselves like 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.430
 Deformed shapes painted with colors 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.250
 random bright there were faces in the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.520
 window watching the ones varying one and 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.530
 again to never distinguish them 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.250
 perfectly crying followed by everything 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.380
 the second act act 3 started with a 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.680
 title specifying that one year had 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.500
 past power or marielisa was vízquel 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.230
 ethically thin yet sitting on the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.010
 table there was no trace of magic from the 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.010
 pets decided to visit the tomb of 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.260
 bart springfield was totally 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.840
 deserted and while walking the 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.560
 cemetery the houses became more and 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.260
 more decrepit they looked abandoned 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.690
 when they reached the grave the body of the 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.639
 art was lying in front of his grave 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.550
 looking like the end of the first 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.600
 act the family began to cry 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.060
 new 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.210
 eventually they stopped watching 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.689
 fixed the corpse of bart the camera 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.539
 he focused on a rosemary face 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:58.879
 according to the summary the episode put 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.860
 or made a joke in this part but not 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:04.159
 the version that reads is not audible 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.229
 can you know what the cameraman says 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.989
 he took a panoramic shot when the 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.819
 episode has ended the graves in the 

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:13.209
 background they had the names of each 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:17.239
 insolvencies 

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:19.549
 some nobody knew in 1989 

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:20.840
 some who had not yet been in the 

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:23.090
 Show 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.430
 All had death dates on them 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.040
 for those who died from that one 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.710
 then like michel jackson and gerald 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.199
 ferry are the dates indicated the day in 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.600
 who died the credits were 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.550
 silent and seemed written by hand 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.920
 the final image was that of the families 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.680
 without sun in his armchair but all 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.500
 drawn realistically similar to 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.080
 mud corpse 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.510
 it occurred to me at first after seeing 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.460
 the episode that could use the tombs 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.500
 to predict the death of all 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.080
 stars invited to the 100 are that 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.400
 they were still alive but there is something very strange 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.100
 with respect to those who have not died 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.940
 all their deaths are located in the 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.550
 same date 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.700
 well that was all we see in the 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.570
 next part subscribe to cibeles manita 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.570
 up thank you
