everywhere<00:01:10.130> which<00:01:11.130> means<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> light

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
everywhere which means it's the light

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.310 
everywhere which means it's the light
it's<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.480> really<00:01:12.660> intense<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it's just really really intense and it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.540 
it's just really really intense and it's
really<00:01:13.620> bouncing<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.070> into<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> face<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
really bouncing back into the face of

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.150 
really bouncing back into the face of
the<00:01:14.730> models<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> lot<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:16.170> using<00:01:16.620> these<00:01:16.680> faux<00:01:16.890> Tex

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
the models a lot so using these faux Tex

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.400 
the models a lot so using these faux Tex
Indra<00:01:18.120> strobes<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.780> TTL<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
Indra strobes with the TTL and the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.890 
Indra strobes with the TTL and the
high-speed<00:01:19.560> sync<00:01:20.040> means<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.630> kill

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
high-speed sync means i can really kill

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
high-speed sync means i can really kill
my<00:01:22.110> exposure<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> shutter<00:01:23.580> speed

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
my exposure with the shutter speed

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.660 
my exposure with the shutter speed
shooting<00:01:24.030> around<00:01:24.240> 12<00:01:24.630> thousands<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.050> a<00:01:25.110> second

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
shooting around 12 thousands of a second

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
shooting around 12 thousands of a second
so<00:01:26.670> i<00:01:27.120> don't<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.480> see<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> lot<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.200> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so i don't really see a lot of this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.050 
so i don't really see a lot of this
bright<00:01:28.680> light<00:01:28.710> around<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.370> and<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.910> really

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
bright light around here and it really

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
bright light around here and it really
gives<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.300> nice<00:01:30.390> exposure<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.440> really<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.620> nice

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
gives a nice exposure it's really a nice

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.940 
gives a nice exposure it's really a nice
feature<00:01:32.180> it's<00:01:33.180> helping<00:01:33.660> a<00:01:33.840> lot
