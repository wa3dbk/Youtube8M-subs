00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
same rules you know and and of course

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.490 
same rules you know and and of course
that's<00:00:57.879> where<00:00:58.149> you're<00:00:58.539> gonna<00:00:58.629> bite<00:00:58.870> heads<00:00:59.079> Sam

and<00:00:59.710> Grimm<00:00:59.859> go<00:01:00.070> back<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.670> know<00:01:00.749> over<00:01:01.749> 10<00:01:01.929> years

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
and Grimm go back you know over 10 years

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.650 
and Grimm go back you know over 10 years
right<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:03.100> history<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.670> as<00:01:03.969> you<00:01:04.510> know<00:01:04.629> very

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
right so the history is as you know very

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.390 
right so the history is as you know very
convoluted<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.680> think<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.130> there<00:01:06.280> is<00:01:06.370> a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
convoluted I think that there is a

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.749 
convoluted I think that there is a
definite<00:01:07.210> mutual<00:01:07.600> respect<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.380> know<00:01:08.740> that<00:01:09.520> Sam

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
definite mutual respect I know that Sam

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.580 
definite mutual respect I know that Sam
is<00:01:10.320> darn<00:01:11.320> good<00:01:11.619> at<00:01:11.860> what<00:01:12.070> he<00:01:12.220> does<00:01:12.369> I<00:01:13.259> also<00:01:14.259> know

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
is darn good at what he does I also know

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.800 
is darn good at what he does I also know
that<00:01:14.619> there<00:01:15.100> are<00:01:15.340> logistical<00:01:16.270> ways<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.659> do

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
that there are logistical ways to do

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.410 
that there are logistical ways to do
things<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.409> make<00:01:17.590> sense<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.460> me<00:01:18.670> I'm<00:01:18.909> very

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
things that make sense to me I'm very

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.539 
things that make sense to me I'm very
analytical<00:01:19.659> it's<00:01:20.290> know<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:21.009> plus<00:01:21.310> this

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
analytical it's know this plus this

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.310 
analytical it's know this plus this
equals<00:01:21.880> this<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.899> is<00:01:23.020> what<00:01:23.170> we've<00:01:23.290> been

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
equals this this is what we've been

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.200 
equals this this is what we've been
instructed<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.950> do<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.130> therefore<00:01:24.549> we<00:01:24.880> must<00:01:25.000> do

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
instructed to do so therefore we must do

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.719 
instructed to do so therefore we must do
this<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.409> highest<00:01:26.590> risk<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.399> no<00:01:27.549> we

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
this this is the highest risk so no we

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.249 
this this is the highest risk so no we
shouldn't<00:01:28.030> do<00:01:28.119> that<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.450> should<00:01:28.509> do<00:01:28.720> this<00:01:28.930> and

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
shouldn't do that we should do this and

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.740 
shouldn't do that we should do this and
