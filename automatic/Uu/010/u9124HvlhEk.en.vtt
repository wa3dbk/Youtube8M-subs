00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
have two T's you can see one here and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.390 
have two T's you can see one here and
one<00:02:38.160> there

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
okay well the menu said this T right

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.560 
okay well the menu said this T right
here<00:02:42.660> connects<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:44.100> solenoid<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.420> that

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
here connects that solenoid this is that

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.540 
here connects that solenoid this is that
line<00:02:45.980> see<00:02:46.980> if<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.490> over<00:02:47.520> here

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.790 

this<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.510> some<00:02:52.720> nice<00:02:52.960> thing<00:02:53.170> about<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
this is that some nice thing about the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.920 
this is that some nice thing about the
front<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.640> rear<00:02:54.790> center<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.720> front

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
front to the rear center to the front

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.170 
front to the rear center to the front
some<00:02:56.140> little<00:02:56.740> breather<00:02:56.920> hose<00:02:57.160> this<00:02:57.880> is<00:02:57.940> that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
some little breather hose this is that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.940 
some little breather hose this is that
line<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.600> runs<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.960> bottom<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.380> vacuum

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
line that runs to the bottom of vacuum

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.900 
line that runs to the bottom of vacuum
runs<00:03:00.610> down<00:03:00.820> up<00:03:01.060> underneath<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.540> frame<00:03:02.910> it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
runs down up underneath the frame it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.570 
runs down up underneath the frame it
comes<00:03:04.120> out<00:03:04.270> over<00:03:04.390> here

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
comes out over here

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.050 
comes out over here
it<00:03:06.580> connects<00:03:07.210> right<00:03:07.390> there<00:03:07.630> this<00:03:08.170> T<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:09.550> it's

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
it connects right there this T then it's

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.970 
it connects right there this T then it's
supposed<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.330> have<00:03:10.450> no<00:03:10.510> small<00:03:11.020> one<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:11.860> runs

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
supposed to have no small one that runs

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.190 
supposed to have no small one that runs
up<00:03:12.160> through<00:03:12.280> here<00:03:12.520> connects<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> bottom<00:03:13.930> R

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
up through here connects to the bottom R

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.170 
up through here connects to the bottom R
to<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.830> back<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.250> carburetor<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:15.970> that

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
to the back of that carburetor on that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.100 
to the back of that carburetor on that
little<00:03:16.390> port<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:17.340> then<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.760> tried<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.930> had

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
little port I then I tried that I had

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.050 
little port I then I tried that I had
this<00:03:20.260> line<00:03:20.530> had<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> longer<00:03:21.670> line<00:03:21.850> running

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
this line had a longer line running

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.520 
this line had a longer line running
right<00:03:22.150> here<00:03:22.240> and<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.750> had<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.020> running<00:03:23.230> just

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
right here and I had it running just

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.360 
right here and I had it running just
straight<00:03:24.000> directly<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.530> port<00:03:26.890> right

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
straight directly to this port right

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.130 
straight directly to this port right
here<00:03:27.720> okay<00:03:29.400> then<00:03:30.400> after<00:03:30.640> some<00:03:31.090> thinking<00:03:31.780> I

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
here okay then after some thinking I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.500 
here okay then after some thinking I
thought<00:03:32.350> huh<00:03:32.740> I'll<00:03:33.250> just<00:03:33.460> take<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.790> line<00:03:34.030> cut

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
thought huh I'll just take this line cut

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.320 
thought huh I'll just take this line cut
it<00:03:34.690> put<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> T<00:03:35.410> here<00:03:35.740> or<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> short<00:03:36.610> line<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:37.180> this

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
it put a T here or a short line to this

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.750 
it put a T here or a short line to this
port<00:03:37.660> then<00:03:38.290> have<00:03:38.740> my<00:03:38.890> regular<00:03:39.070> vacuum<00:03:39.370> line

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
port then have my regular vacuum line

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.640 
port then have my regular vacuum line
that<00:03:40.300> runs<00:03:41.400> up<00:03:42.400> over<00:03:42.700> here<00:03:43.030> into<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:44.500> bottom

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650
