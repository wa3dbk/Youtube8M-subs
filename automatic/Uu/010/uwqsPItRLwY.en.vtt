tell on every other nail I started with

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.589

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the ring I started with the black line

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.759 
the ring I started with the black line
like<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.489> saw<00:02:39.819> but<00:02:40.389> on<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.720> thumb<00:02:40.959> middle<00:02:41.409> and

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
like you saw but on my thumb middle and

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.559 
like you saw but on my thumb middle and
pinky<00:02:41.920> fingers<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.519> started<00:02:43.030> with<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> white

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
pinky fingers I started with a white

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.750 
pinky fingers I started with a white
line<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> center<00:02:44.349> of<00:02:44.469> my<00:02:44.620> nail<00:02:44.799> so<00:02:45.129> it<00:02:45.489> kind

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
line in the center of my nail so it kind

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.789 
line in the center of my nail so it kind
of<00:02:45.790> just<00:02:45.970> makes<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> little<00:02:46.720> bit<00:02:46.930> more<00:02:47.290> fun<00:02:47.769> I

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
of just makes it a little bit more fun I

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.110 
of just makes it a little bit more fun I
guess<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.489> makes<00:02:48.639> it<00:02:48.730> actually<00:02:49.000> look

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
guess and that makes it actually look

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.360 
guess and that makes it actually look
like<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.540> more<00:02:49.840> difficult<00:02:50.049> manicure<00:02:50.829> when<00:02:51.280> you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
like a more difficult manicure when you

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.830 
like a more difficult manicure when you
switch<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:51.760> up<00:02:51.879> like<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.389> I<00:02:52.419> think<00:02:52.569> this

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
switch it up like that so I think this

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.170 
switch it up like that so I think this
manicure<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.439> super<00:02:53.950> cool<00:02:54.250> when<00:02:54.609> people<00:02:54.879> look

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
manicure is super cool when people look

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.819 
manicure is super cool when people look
at<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.480> they're<00:02:55.659> going<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.840> think<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.620> are<00:02:56.650> a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
at it they're going to think you are a

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.979 
at it they're going to think you are a
