00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.610 
although those two modes are kind of
different<00:02:36.540> they're<00:02:36.720> built<00:02:37.020> around<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.410> very

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
different they're built around a very

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.400 
different they're built around a very
similar<00:02:37.920> feature<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:39.209> arcade<00:02:39.690> mode<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.230> main

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
similar feature in arcade mode the main

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.920 
similar feature in arcade mode the main
feature<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> story<00:02:41.459> mode<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.940> simulation

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
feature is a story mode in simulation

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.350 
feature is a story mode in simulation
mode<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.950> full<00:02:44.340> career<00:02:44.880> option

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
mode you get this full career option

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.630 
mode you get this full career option
which<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.080> nice<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.560> problem<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.280> story

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
which is nice the problem is the story

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.790 
which is nice the problem is the story
mode<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:47.989> basically<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.410> watered-down

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
mode is basically just a watered-down

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.920 
mode is basically just a watered-down
version<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> career<00:02:51.090> option<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.810> might

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
version of the career option you might

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.170 
version of the career option you might
have<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.350> finish<00:02:53.190> each<00:02:53.340> race<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.880> certain

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
have to finish each race in a certain

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.850 
have to finish each race in a certain
position<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.840> example<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.380> that's<00:02:55.560> about

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
position for example but that's about

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.040 
position for example but that's about
all<00:02:55.920> there<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> arcade<00:02:57.300> mode<00:02:57.540> things

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
all there is to the arcade mode things

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.229 
all there is to the arcade mode things
are<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> little<00:02:58.380> more<00:02:58.680> complex<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.850> career

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
are a little more complex in the career

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.589 
are a little more complex in the career
mode

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.449 

that's<00:03:04.469> where<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.769> get<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.129> through<00:03:05.370> all

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
that's where you get to go through all

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.759 
that's where you get to go through all
the<00:03:05.609> minutiae<00:03:06.150> you'd<00:03:06.329> expect<00:03:06.840> from<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.319> career

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
the minutiae you'd expect from a career

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.890 
the minutiae you'd expect from a career
mode<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.249> video<00:03:08.519> game<00:03:08.609> there<00:03:09.239> are<00:03:09.269> goals<00:03:09.629> to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
mode in a video game there are goals to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.140

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
set there are teams to join and there's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.119 
set there are teams to join and there's
