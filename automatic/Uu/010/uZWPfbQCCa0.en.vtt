00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
a follower of mine about the proper use

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.919 
a follower of mine about the proper use
of<00:00:12.750> cut<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:14.160> thought<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:15.030> an<00:00:15.389> important

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
of cut and I thought it was an important

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.439 
of cut and I thought it was an important
topic<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.859> actually<00:00:17.400> cover<00:00:17.609> here<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.330> I

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
topic to actually cover here because I

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.960 
topic to actually cover here because I
think<00:00:18.630> some<00:00:18.869> people<00:00:19.020> may<00:00:19.439> not<00:00:20.160> realize<00:00:20.460> some

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
think some people may not realize some

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.550 
think some people may not realize some
of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> nuances<00:00:21.689> about<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> cut<00:00:22.230> tool<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
of the nuances about the cut tool and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.810 
of the nuances about the cut tool and
how<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> works<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.189> I'm<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.640> ahead

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
how it works so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.019 
how it works so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:24.300> use<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.920> project<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.010> I've<00:00:26.130> been<00:00:26.160> working

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and use a project that I've been working

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.089 
and use a project that I've been working
at<00:00:27.150> picking<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> while<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.439> I'm

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
at picking out for a while here and I'm

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.950 
at picking out for a while here and I'm
going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.970> zoom<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.630> we're<00:00:30.810> going<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
going to just zoom in and we're going to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
going to just zoom in and we're going to
talk<00:00:31.170> about<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.619> cut<00:00:31.830> does<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.309> first<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> all

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
talk about what cut does so first of all

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.120 
talk about what cut does so first of all
we<00:00:32.940> want<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> make<00:00:33.329> sure<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:34.140> our<00:00:34.200> object<00:00:34.980> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we want to make sure that our object is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.760 
we want to make sure that our object is
selected<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.870> what<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.079> an<00:00:37.290> editable<00:00:37.620> poly

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
selected and what is an editable poly

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
selected and what is an editable poly
and<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.700> ahead<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.420> open

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and I'm going to go ahead and just open

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
and I'm going to go ahead and just open
up<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.230> graphite<00:00:40.680> modeling<00:00:41.070> tools<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.520> here

up our graphite modeling tools over here
and<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.219> our<00:00:44.610> modeling<00:00:45.450> tab

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and you can see we have our modeling tab

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840 
and you can see we have our modeling tab
here<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.320> cut<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.739> located<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
here and cut is located here on the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.479 
here and cut is located here on the
graphite<00:00:48.300> modeling<00:00:48.690> tools<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:50.010> located

here in the right-click quad menu so I'm
going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> use<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.289> same<00:00:55.649> tool<00:00:55.890> I'm<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.160> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
going to use the same tool I'm going to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.170 
going to use the same tool I'm going to
use<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
right-click quad menu and it really

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.220 
right-click quad menu and it really
doesn't<00:01:00.149> matter<00:01:00.270> whether<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.930> want<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> use

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
doesn't matter whether you want to use

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.020 
doesn't matter whether you want to use
snaps<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.640> was<00:01:02.760> part<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
snaps or not for this that was part of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
snaps or not for this that was part of
the<00:01:03.120> discussion<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.750> Twitter<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.100> do

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the discussion on Twitter is you know do

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
the discussion on Twitter is you know do
I<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.640> vertex<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.299> edge<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.720> whatever

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I want to use vertex or edge or whatever

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480 
I want to use vertex or edge or whatever
really<00:01:07.320> doesn't<00:01:07.619> matter<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
really doesn't matter because all the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
really doesn't matter because all the
feedback<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.240> need<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> about<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
feedback that you need to know about the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
feedback that you need to know about the
cut<00:01:10.320> tool<00:01:10.560> actually<00:01:10.799> occurs<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> tool<00:01:11.790> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
cut tool actually occurs on the tool so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.960 
cut tool actually occurs on the tool so
what<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> tool<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.369> actually

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
what the tool is for is for actually

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
what the tool is for is for actually
cutting<00:01:15.360> geometry<00:01:15.840> adding<00:01:16.680> slices<00:01:17.250> doing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
cutting geometry adding slices doing

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
cutting geometry adding slices doing
custom<00:01:18.000> modeling<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.780> sort<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> thing

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
custom modeling that sort of thing

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.310 
custom modeling that sort of thing
directly<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> surface<00:01:20.880> without<00:01:21.810> actually

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
directly on the surface without actually

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.649 
directly on the surface without actually
having<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.189> polygons<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.119> set<00:01:24.420> or

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
having to do like polygons in set or

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
having to do like polygons in set or
extrude<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.290> bevel<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.650> anything<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.100> that

extrude or bevel or anything like that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.980 
extrude or bevel or anything like that
so<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.450> ahead<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.689> choose<00:01:27.810> my

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
so I'm going to go ahead and choose my

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.819 
so I'm going to go ahead and choose my
cut<00:01:28.229> tool<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.720> you'll<00:01:30.720> notice<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.619> tool

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
cut tool and you'll notice that the tool

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.460 
cut tool and you'll notice that the tool
has<00:01:32.130> several<00:01:32.610> different<00:01:32.790> modes<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> operation

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
has several different modes of operation

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
has several different modes of operation
depending<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.829> type<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.070> geometry<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
depending on what type of geometry that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.620 
depending on what type of geometry that
I'm<00:01:36.240> rolling<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.650> mouse<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:38.100> top<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.299> for

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I'm rolling the mouse on top of so for

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.950 
I'm rolling the mouse on top of so for
example<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.979> mouse<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.189> currently<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.600> top

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
example if the mouse is currently on top

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.429 
example if the mouse is currently on top
of<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> polygon<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.399> icon<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.689> cursor<00:01:46.079> icon

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
of a polygon the icon the cursor icon

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
of a polygon the icon the cursor icon
takes<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.920> more<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.280> square<00:01:47.490> appearance<00:01:48.180> if

takes on more of a square appearance if

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.800 
takes on more of a square appearance if
I<00:01:48.930> slide<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> over<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:49.920> edge<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.820> takes<00:01:51.570> on

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I slide it over an edge it takes on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.380 
I slide it over an edge it takes on
linear<00:01:52.560> appearance<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.759> an<00:01:53.850> edge<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
linear appearance or that of an edge and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.330 
linear appearance or that of an edge and
if<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.570> roll<00:01:54.930> over<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.290> vertex<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.950> takes<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
if I roll over a vertex it takes on a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.569 
if I roll over a vertex it takes on a
very<00:01:56.610> small<00:01:57.290> almost<00:01:58.290> crosshair<00:01:58.979> type<00:01:59.310> shape

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
very small almost crosshair type shape

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.030 
very small almost crosshair type shape
and<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.119> how<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.750> tell<00:02:01.079> what

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and this is how you can tell what

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
and this is how you can tell what
attribute<00:02:02.820> or<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.090> aspect<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.750> geometry

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
attribute or what aspect of the geometry

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
attribute or what aspect of the geometry
that<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.460> cutting

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that you're actually going to be cutting

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
that you're actually going to be cutting
when<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> cut<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> purpose<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
when you cut now the purpose of the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.699 
when you cut now the purpose of the
whole<00:02:08.129> conversation<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.849> Twitter<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
whole conversation on Twitter was that

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.980 
whole conversation on Twitter was that
the<00:02:10.709> person<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.160> using<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.819> cut<00:02:12.000> tool<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
the person was using the cut tool and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.830 
the person was using the cut tool and
there<00:02:13.770> was<00:02:13.890> leaving<00:02:14.250> behind<00:02:14.400> extra<00:02:15.150> vertices

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
there was leaving behind extra vertices

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.510 
there was leaving behind extra vertices
that<00:02:15.870> they<00:02:16.110> then<00:02:16.260> had<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.530> go<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.040> manually

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
that they then had to go in and manually

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.030 
that they then had to go in and manually
well<00:02:18.090> together<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.740> shouldn't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
well together and that really shouldn't

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.240 
well together and that really shouldn't
happen<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:20.790> you're<00:02:21.390> using<00:02:21.630> cut<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.950> this

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
happen if you're using cut with this

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.280 
happen if you're using cut with this
method<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.270> example<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.080> want<00:02:25.230> to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
method so for example if I just want to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.900 
method so for example if I just want to
go<00:02:25.410> ahead<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.590> start<00:02:25.860> clicking<00:02:26.130> anywhere<00:02:26.520> I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
go ahead and start clicking anywhere I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.860 
go ahead and start clicking anywhere I
could<00:02:27.600> just<00:02:27.780> start<00:02:27.930> clicking<00:02:28.260> geometry<00:02:29.160> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
could just start clicking geometry and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.720 
could just start clicking geometry and
or<00:02:30.870> excuse<00:02:31.200> me<00:02:31.350> clicking<00:02:31.710> shapes<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.340> all<00:02:32.610> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
or excuse me clicking shapes and all of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.660 
or excuse me clicking shapes and all of
a<00:02:32.760> sudden<00:02:32.790> I've<00:02:33.270> cut<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.890> new<00:02:34.890> set<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.160> polygons

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
a sudden I've cut a new set of polygons

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.700 
a sudden I've cut a new set of polygons
directly<00:02:36.330> into<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> side<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> exit

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
directly into the side here on the exit

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.150 
directly into the side here on the exit
the<00:02:37.770> cut<00:02:37.950> tool<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.600> I'll<00:02:39.600> select<00:02:39.930> these<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:41.070> I

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the cut tool and I'll select these and I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.460 
the cut tool and I'll select these and I
can<00:02:41.340> see<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.790> I've<00:02:42.090> got<00:02:42.360> some<00:02:42.930> new<00:02:43.200> geometry

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
can see that I've got some new geometry

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.190 
can see that I've got some new geometry
there<00:02:43.950> now<00:02:44.190> that's<00:02:44.400> very<00:02:44.970> random<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.720> terms<00:02:46.020> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
there now that's very random in terms of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.560 
there now that's very random in terms of
how<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> created<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.100> I'll<00:02:47.520> go<00:02:47.940> back<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.390> cut

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
how I created it I'll go back to the cut

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.360 
how I created it I'll go back to the cut
tool<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:50.690> now<00:02:51.690> when<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.320> click<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.190> cut

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
tool and now when I click on the cut

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.760 
tool and now when I click on the cut
tool<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.790> know<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:54.600> certain<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.320> I'm<00:02:55.470> adding

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
tool I know for certain that I'm adding

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.240 
tool I know for certain that I'm adding
vertices<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.760> top<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.450> edges<00:02:58.140> not<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
vertices on top of edges not in the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.540 
vertices on top of edges not in the
middle<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.640> polygons<00:03:00.210> like<00:03:01.190> if<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.310> were<00:03:02.490> to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
middle of polygons like if I were to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.430 
middle of polygons like if I were to
just<00:03:03.000> click<00:03:03.240> anywhere<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.990> all<00:03:04.140> right

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
just click anywhere so it's all right

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.130 
just click anywhere so it's all right
click<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.010> process<00:03:05.850> I'm<00:03:06.090> still<00:03:06.960> in

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
click and that process I'm still in

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.640 
click and that process I'm still in
polygon<00:03:07.560> mode<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.790> I've<00:03:09.180> got<00:03:10.050> those<00:03:10.320> cuts

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
polygon mode and so I've got those cuts

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.970 
polygon mode and so I've got those cuts
there<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:12.080> then<00:03:13.080> finally<00:03:13.530> when<00:03:13.800> we're

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
there and then finally when we're

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.330 
there and then finally when we're
cutting<00:03:14.190> using<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.780> cutting<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.590> vertices<00:03:17.130> if

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
cutting using the cutting on vertices if

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.310 
cutting using the cutting on vertices if
you<00:03:17.460> want<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.790> line<00:03:17.940> up<00:03:17.970> cuts<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.600> vertices<00:03:19.050> we

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
you want to line up cuts on vertices we

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.990 
you want to line up cuts on vertices we
just<00:03:19.530> click<00:03:19.710> from<00:03:19.890> one<00:03:19.950> vertex<00:03:20.460> to<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.820> other

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
just click from one vertex to the other

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.350 
just click from one vertex to the other
and<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.200> sure<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.670> new<00:03:24.000> edge

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
and I know for sure that this new edge

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.780 
and I know for sure that this new edge
that<00:03:24.840> I've<00:03:24.960> cut<00:03:25.230> has<00:03:25.560> gone<00:03:25.800> from<00:03:26.340> one<00:03:26.580> vertex

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
that I've cut has gone from one vertex

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.820 
that I've cut has gone from one vertex
to<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.270> other<00:03:27.450> there<00:03:27.720> are<00:03:27.900> no<00:03:28.140> other<00:03:28.320> vertices

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
to the other there are no other vertices

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.950 
to the other there are no other vertices
there<00:03:29.100> as<00:03:29.250> long<00:03:29.430> as<00:03:29.670> I've<00:03:29.820> cut<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.840> the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
there as long as I've cut it in the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.690 
there as long as I've cut it in the
right<00:03:31.110> spot<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.740> I'll<00:03:31.860> go<00:03:32.010> into<00:03:32.190> vertex<00:03:32.520> mode

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
right spot so I'll go into vertex mode

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.940 
right spot so I'll go into vertex mode
I'll<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.690> do<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> quick<00:03:34.200> marquee<00:03:34.620> selection

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
I'll just do a quick marquee selection

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.160 
I'll just do a quick marquee selection
and<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:35.520> see<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.030> indeed<00:03:36.390> there's<00:03:36.930> one

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
and you can see that indeed there's one

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.560 
and you can see that indeed there's one
vertex<00:03:37.560> selected<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.520> indeed<00:03:39.300> there's

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
vertex selected there and indeed there's

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.600 
vertex selected there and indeed there's
one<00:03:39.720> vertex<00:03:40.080> selected<00:03:40.590> there<00:03:40.740> so<00:03:41.040> there

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
one vertex selected there so there

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.070 
one vertex selected there so there
really<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:43.170> very<00:03:43.260> clear<00:03:43.860> about<00:03:44.310> how<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
really is it's very clear about how the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.750 
really is it's very clear about how the
cut<00:03:46.410> tool<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.800> going<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.070> work<00:03:47.280> before<00:03:47.550> you

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
cut tool is going to work before you

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.660 
cut tool is going to work before you
actually<00:03:48.450> click<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.620> mouse<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:49.860> cut<00:03:50.520> it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
actually click on the mouse and cut it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.310 
actually click on the mouse and cut it
the<00:03:51.180> other<00:03:51.300> thing<00:03:51.570> about<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.900> cut<00:03:52.110> tool

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
the other thing about the cut tool

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.780 
the other thing about the cut tool
that's<00:03:52.560> kind<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.920> interesting<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.490> lot<00:03:53.580> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
that's kind of interesting that a lot of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.370 
that's kind of interesting that a lot of
people<00:03:54.030> may<00:03:54.180> not<00:03:54.300> realize<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:55.050> let<00:03:55.230> me<00:03:55.260> go

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
people may not realize is let me go

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.380 
people may not realize is let me go
ahead<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.590> get<00:03:55.680> out<00:03:55.800> of<00:03:55.830> this<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.180> I

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
ahead and get out of this is I can I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.960 
ahead and get out of this is I can I
don't<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.930> span<00:03:58.530> multiple<00:03:58.560> edges<00:03:59.280> with<00:03:59.700> one

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
don't I can span multiple edges with one

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.550 
don't I can span multiple edges with one
single<00:04:00.420> cut<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.840> it'll<00:04:01.050> automatically

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
single cut and it'll automatically

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.200 
single cut and it'll automatically
insert<00:04:02.130> all<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.370> required<00:04:03.150> cuts<00:04:03.650> along<00:04:04.650> that

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
insert all the required cuts along that

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.000 
insert all the required cuts along that
span<00:04:06.210> so<00:04:06.570> I'm<00:04:06.780> going<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.990> turn<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.440> cut<00:04:07.650> tool

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
span so I'm going to turn the cut tool

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.010 
span so I'm going to turn the cut tool
back<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.760> I'm<00:04:09.240> just<00:04:09.420> going<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.690> go<00:04:09.840> ahead

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
back on and I'm just going to go ahead

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.949 
back on and I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:04:10.170> click<00:04:10.410> on<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.950> edge<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.490> drag<00:04:12.300> all<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
and click on this edge and drag all the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.590 
and click on this edge and drag all the
way<00:04:13.050> down<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.860> edge<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.490> notice<00:04:15.390> that

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
way down to this edge and notice that

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.039 
way down to this edge and notice that
it's<00:04:15.840> already<00:04:16.109> cut<00:04:16.620> along<00:04:17.160> all<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.390> edges

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
it's already cut along all of the edges

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.990 
it's already cut along all of the edges
that<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.320> crossed<00:04:19.590> over<00:04:20.000> including

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
that it's crossed over including

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.330 
that it's crossed over including
maintaining<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.600> topology<00:04:21.960> there<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
maintaining the topology there so the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.100 
maintaining the topology there so the
cut<00:04:23.580> tool<00:04:23.790> is<00:04:23.910> actually<00:04:24.240> quite<00:04:24.479> powerful<00:04:24.660> if

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
cut tool is actually quite powerful if

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.320 
cut tool is actually quite powerful if
you're<00:04:25.229> adding<00:04:25.650> in

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
you're adding in

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.390 
you're adding in
geometry<00:04:26.509> after-the-fact<00:04:27.139> it's<00:04:28.129> just

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
geometry after-the-fact it's just

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.279 
geometry after-the-fact it's just
important<00:04:28.819> to<00:04:28.909> realize<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.689> what<00:04:30.169> these

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
important to realize that what these

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.760 
important to realize that what these
little<00:04:31.030> cursor<00:04:32.030> changes<00:04:32.750> mean<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.409> that'll

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
little cursor changes mean and that'll

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.309 
little cursor changes mean and that'll
help<00:04:33.919> you<00:04:34.189> maintain<00:04:34.719> proper<00:04:35.719> cuts<00:04:35.960> without

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
help you maintain proper cuts without

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.899 
help you maintain proper cuts without
adding<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.919> lot<00:04:37.069> of<00:04:37.189> extra<00:04:37.460> vertices<00:04:37.879> that

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
adding in a lot of extra vertices that

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.189 
adding in a lot of extra vertices that
you<00:04:38.060> then<00:04:38.300> have<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.599> go<00:04:38.629> in<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.020> clean<00:04:39.169> up

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
you then have to go in and clean up

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.469 
you then have to go in and clean up
later<00:04:39.469> anyways<00:04:40.430> I<00:04:40.580> hope<00:04:40.669> this<00:04:40.879> helps<00:04:41.120> again<00:04:41.330> my
