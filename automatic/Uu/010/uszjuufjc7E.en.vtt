this so let's let's go okay so you
actually<00:01:40.840> have<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.229> winner<00:01:41.619> here<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.369> it

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
actually have a winner here and it

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.260 
actually have a winner here and it
actually<00:01:43.060> seems<00:01:43.600> like<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.490> Google<00:01:45.729> Nexus<00:01:45.880> 5

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270

actually seems like the Google Nexus 5
here<00:01:46.690> actually<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.410> a<00:01:47.440> little<00:01:47.830> bit<00:01:47.920> quicker

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
here actually is a little bit quicker

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.760 
here actually is a little bit quicker
here<00:01:48.640> which<00:01:49.600> if<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.780> definitely<00:01:50.200> be<00:01:50.320> good<00:01:50.500> to

this one was it was a little bit slower
here<00:01:55.990> in<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.280> speed<00:01:57.660> so<00:01:58.660> that<00:01:59.050> could<00:01:59.200> be<00:01:59.229> good

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
here in the speed so that could be good

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.700 
here in the speed so that could be good
to<00:01:59.560> know<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:01.000> quite<00:02:01.150> durable<00:02:01.479> here<00:02:01.930> oh<00:02:02.110> I
