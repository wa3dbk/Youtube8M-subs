that<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.649> painted<00:01:44.189> mine<00:01:44.369> black

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that you can see I painted mine black

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.440 
that you can see I painted mine black
for<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> reason

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
for a reason

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.010 
for a reason
but<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:46.380> nuts<00:01:47.270> rest<00:01:48.270> against<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.780> metal

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
but these nuts rest against this metal

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
but these nuts rest against this metal
edge<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:50.009> comes<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> bezel

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
edge that actually comes with the bezel

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.749 
edge that actually comes with the bezel
now<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> 70<00:01:52.229> model<00:01:52.829> Mustang<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.549> right

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
now on the 70 model Mustang it's right

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.630 
now on the 70 model Mustang it's right
here<00:01:53.939> at<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> surface<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> chrome<00:01:55.399> on<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
here at the surface of the chrome on the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.859 
here at the surface of the chrome on the
72<00:01:57.229> 71<00:01:58.229> through<00:01:58.439> 73<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.369> bezel<00:01:59.869> retaining

72 71 through 73 the bezel retaining

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.810 
72 71 through 73 the bezel retaining
ring<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.469> actually<00:02:01.649> more<00:02:02.009> recessed<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
ring is actually more recessed in the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.380 
ring is actually more recessed in the
bezel<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.960> creates<00:02:04.380> quite<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> problem

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
bezel this creates quite a problem

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.550 
bezel this creates quite a problem
especially<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.899> get<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> headlight

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
especially when you get to the headlight

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.719 
especially when you get to the headlight
switch<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:08.069> which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.489> I'm<00:02:08.580> going<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
switch here which is what I'm going to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.070 
switch here which is what I'm going to
