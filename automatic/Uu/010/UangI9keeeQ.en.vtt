00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:12.320
 good morning and welcome to scandal today 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:16.070
 we are at ground events the flight of the 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.920
 swallows and swallows are the 62 m2 that 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:24.609
 they are going to intercept covered b 17s 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.769
 from of p 51 mustang mustangs for friends 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:32.240
 here the event went online for the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.829
 first time on March 14th will bring us 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.719
 probably also in the day of 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.100
 today 15 March an event from 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.110
 huge potential 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.820
 but unfortunately sent to cow by 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.239
 now mutilated and horribly devastated 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.420
 flight model of the m 2 follows which render 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.980
 this event an incredible shit 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.260
 also because however consider that 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.469
 this follows a little bit here we say 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.670
 the battles you see on film 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.930
 network now that I have called back 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.520
 that horrible signature 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.500
 it does n't have to make me think badly but anyway 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.360
 consider that 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.350
 and an event that recalls the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.350
 guardian angel those end of war between 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.930
 Americans and Germans was really a lot 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.530
 fought and here clearly the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.690
 Americans prevailed over the enemies of 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.490
 something like 10 to 1 of drive though 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.410
 let's say that at the organization level 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.020
 of the events that jeans gives us 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.720
 especially in this period and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 above all for the fact that yes 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.130
 they focus a lot on the planes that 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.940
 some are less used 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.250
 satisfaction 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.170
 in fact, the lack of satisfaction 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.140
 derives from the fact that the flight model 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.920
 of the m 2 6 2 which accounts should have 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.700
 almost do 800 900 kilometers per hour a 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.149
 7000 meters here I read this from profane 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.000
 sources here instead is an embarrassing thing 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.479
 does not move nailed I now have 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.480
 tried to acquire share but acquires 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.640
 decidedly much worse share than a 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.549
 propeller plane clearly considered 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.490
 that this is one of my top ten 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:25.020
 freer and then that I have then 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:29.350
 don't mind this is a stop plane 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.020
 many aim to conclude with m 2 2 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.510
 the playing out can start 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.280
 we try to do something for 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.310
 see which performances in comparison 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.850
 to our opponent direct that p 51d 5 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.360
 mustang p 51 of five must also here 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.560
 from p 51d 30 or even premium 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.720
 however we say no 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.220
 but very big 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.670
 I would say variations in the Modena file 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.800
 which is substantially the same however 262 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.420
 his when I came out to close 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.640
 the corner so now we concentrate 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.420
 on what it can be 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.790
 a burst on this then let's see what 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.310
 we can do this will be hanged 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.709
 probable more with my canons acci ok 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.200
 perfect to an impressive weaponry 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:23.440
 Now let's take a look at 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:27.200
 those 2 b 17 and the turn was destroyed 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.510
 second was destroyed and then however the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.370
 ours and middle 62 burns like a 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:37.100
 match is just touching you this 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.410
 purpose of 17 1 machine gun this becomes 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.540
 a match worse than the Japanese a 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.070
 when you turn on 2 6 2 then it's one thing 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.590
 that you can't keep yourself not 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.810
 will never switch off the Japanese juve 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.760
 and here comes what you want 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.739
 judge the Achilles if the adjudication is made 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.780
 well he shot me after i was already 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.050
 dead and brought home a beautiful one 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.230
 that therefore nothing is that to tell you 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.600
 the event is conceptually nice 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.340
 stupid because he sees a m 2 6 2 that is 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.180
 totally powerless before a pro 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.100
 plan as the 51 also for this time is 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.690
 always look at 6 o'clock not 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.739
 never forget to do it and see you 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.890
 to the next 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.890
 Hello
