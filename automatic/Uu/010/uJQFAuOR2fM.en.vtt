00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.190
BRAZIL X FRANCE

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.000
Did you score many goals in France?

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.210
-Ask a Frenchman.
-Here's one. Ask him.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.170
They call me "Le gran Jaja".

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.110
-Is this UFC?
-With the elbow?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.160
I'll tell UFC...

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.200
to hire that Frenchman!

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.180
Do you know what would cheer us up?
A funk singer!

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.200
That would make
be awesome!

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.030
The match is serious!
Don't make jokes about it.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.000
Nobody cares about Brazil.
It's a friendly match.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.220
The French are here.
All of Europe is here.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.070
There are more French people
here than in France!

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.160
Look out for the revolution!

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.110
Look out for the revolution!

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
It's 20min into the first half.
It'll be 1 x 0 for Brazil. Goal by Hulk.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.180
I just said that.
Are you a scientist?

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.170
He is a scientist. He likes to guess
About every comment we make.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.040
He is a scientist!

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.120
Honestly, I miss players
like Jairzinho, like Romário.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.140
-Me too.
-Like Ronaldo who used to make goals.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.090
I miss Romário.
I miss Romário.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.070
-Romário was the most modern.
-For sure. He was awesome.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.130
The end of the first half.
Save it for the second half.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.030
HALFTIME

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.140
Questions from Facebook.
From Pedro Lameu.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.180
Jairzinho, which part of the Brazilian
team do you consider the weakest.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.010
Cheers!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.110
The forward is the weakest part
of the Brazilian Team.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.010
Soccer is goals. If there is
no score, there is no win.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.030
If there is no score,
there is no victory.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.240
If there is no score,
there is no achievement.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.180
That's what happened
in the first half.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.150
So, forward is what's
missing for Brazil.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.030
Please send us a pizza cut
the French way!

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.090
There is no pizza in France,
my friend!

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.020
Let's slice it!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.100
-I'm from Leme! Pay attention man!
-He is our body surf man!

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.160
Just sliding down!

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.200
-Just sliding.
-That's the real essence.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.230
Soccer and surf have
a lot of technique.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.050
A lot of technique!

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.070
What grade do you give
to Felipão's management?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.150
-A grade of 2.
-2?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.150
And who is most
responsible for this grade?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.220
-Felipão himself.
-Exactly.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.240
Do you think this team
scares any other team?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.040
No, none.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.200
Please substitute that guy there!

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.210
Please, sit there.
And you are dismissed!

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.000
He's a waiter with content!
He is better than you!

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.140
-Look!
-Dismiss the intern, please!

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.190
Changes in Olho do Furacão.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.200
}André is off. Waiter is on!

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.080
That's what we want.
Brazilian victory!

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.080
We are winnig on our own merit!

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.040
We're playing better than France.
Congratulations!

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.020
PENALTY!

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.230
Go, Olivier! Go!

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.130
Cheer for Lucas!

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.120
Lucas is from Paris Saint Germain.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.200
Even Felipão is making some mistakes
like excess substitutions...

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.180
it makes us expect...

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.190
a nice Confederations Cup.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.060
END OF THE GAME

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.120
Friends, I guess you liked...

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.240
this first Brazilian
victory with Felipão.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.050
I liked it, too. But only
the second half.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.150
I like goals. If there are
no goals, I can't like it.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.180
I think it was an excellent match.
Brazil needs to play more.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.050
The athletes are great.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.060
Very talented.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.090
But they need more time together
to get along on the field.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.160
French soccer is worse than ours.
They have nothing.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.140
With all due respect to our Olivier.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.240
}You are kidding me that
your conclusion is...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.090
}that the match was shitty for France.
Sorry.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.000
}But France already makes great
wine, food, bread and cheese.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.150
Now it's time to invest in soccer.
'Cause it's hard.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.030
Don't forget:
Brazil x Japan.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.090
Japan is the first team...

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.080
to qualify
for the World Cup in Brazil.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.040
It's the second.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.200
Shut up, boy!
Shut up!
