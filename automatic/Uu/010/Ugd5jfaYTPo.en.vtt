00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.840
 totally 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.150
 My name is Andrea Santa Instructor 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.309
 the academy and today I will be 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.950
 accompanying them to give them some tips 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.930
 about mixer 2000 in this case 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.790
 specifically we are going to be talking 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.740
 of the graphic equalizer how it works 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.600
 this graphic equalizer really 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.490
 I 'm going to give you a way to 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.070
 how to use it let's say that one aspect 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.660
 so that you can develop a 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.660
 much more creative way of doing it 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.970
 first we have to select the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 channels that we are going to use in this 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.070
 case the mixer or in our units 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140
 are connected to channels 2 and 3 yes 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 but if I have connected to 1 of 4 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.040
 neck select the channels that I 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 want to start equalizing where in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.360
 the top part we will find the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.070
 Channels to camisea channel and channel to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.050
 another side because the equalizer is 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.659
 divided in two if I want hey click here and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.550
 will show me the four channels that 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.220
 is driving and I close and the same here 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.530
 four channels that I am driving 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.690
 well what will happen in the middle if I 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.310
 I already have some white lines 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.990
 of white lines is telling me the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.399
 point where how far is reaching 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.380
 the wave up to what point is it coming 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.450
 let's put it in this in these 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.660
 words let's suppose that these 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 lines that we have here white is like 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.679
 if they were a crossfader of the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.479
 frequencies so that to move from my 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.850
 channel 2 to channel 3 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.860
 speaking in frequencies that is all 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.110
 at a point like we do when 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 we are here if we are not going to have a step 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 of songs from one song to another 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.210
 song through pure frequencies if 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.560
 divide frequencies well by retaking what 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.440
 what are we talking about if I leave a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.119
 equalizer in half I'll have a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.640
 mix of frequencies also that I 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.409
 all the other channel plus the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.180
 channel 2 in this case then I will stay 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.190
 just playing channel 2 since I go 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.720
 going to channel 3, it's just going to 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.880
 sound the channel 3 true let's listen 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.470
 what I am explaining to you when a 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.640
 equalizer is on that is to say that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.709
 this button that we find here is 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.630
 twinkling I can leave the feader of 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 channel can give it to the top 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.890
 if you are not going to listen to what I throw 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.569
 here because because all the frequency 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.569
 they are towards channel 3 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.370
 but immediately I already read 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.600
 reproduction and pass everything to the channel 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.600
 2 is going to sound all channel 2 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.780
 and I'm beautiful xalapeÃ±as high 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.250
 Y
