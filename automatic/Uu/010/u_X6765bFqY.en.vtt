 Hi, I 'm here to talk to you. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.930
 a little bit about our channel 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.660
 youtube is a tool that we 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.179
 We started using it a little while ago. I have 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.480
 that for about three months it was already there montalvÃ£o 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.400
 which made for us because both videos 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.470
 that we have done not only to be in the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.689
 youtube as well as planting on the page 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.630
 subscriber and we had to take a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.580
 decision and this decision is the reason I 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.880
 to be recording we are recording this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.219
 video because we had to get out of the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.420
 footer of these videos that are exposed 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.850
 on Youtube 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.730

 questions comments and everything else 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.239
 some people signed up 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 questioning this because it seems that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
 people are talking things they do not have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.719
 courage to sign below does not have 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.899
 courage to be open for the exchange of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.190

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.469

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.950

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 youtube youtube 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.140
