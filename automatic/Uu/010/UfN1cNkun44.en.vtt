00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
moment this takes a little bit short I

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.400 
moment this takes a little bit short I
just<00:03:21.790> lift<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.210> all<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:22.960> just<00:03:23.140> slightly

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
just lift that all so it's just slightly

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.040 
just lift that all so it's just slightly
higher<00:03:24.070> than<00:03:24.100> they<00:03:24.370> had<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:27.660> know<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> bottom

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050
