00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.679 

so<00:00:02.010> here<00:00:02.399> I<00:00:02.429> am<00:00:02.610> right<00:00:02.970> after<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.419> fight<00:00:03.659> with

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so here I am right after the fight with

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.639 
so here I am right after the fight with
quail<00:00:04.049> egg<00:00:04.640> in<00:00:05.640> front<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.150> lever<00:00:06.649> after

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
quail egg in front of the lever after

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.080 
quail egg in front of the lever after
her<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.429> assume<00:00:09.330> it's<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.900> bring<00:00:10.110> up<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
her I assume it's going to bring up the

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.570 
her I assume it's going to bring up the
pretty<00:00:12.090> obvious<00:00:15.080> thing<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> middle<00:00:16.529> here

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
pretty obvious thing in the middle here

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:29.090 
pretty obvious thing in the middle here
or<00:00:17.580> give<00:00:17.820> me<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.940> cut<00:00:18.119> scene<00:00:18.330> alright<00:00:18.900> cool

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:01:10.660 

the<00:00:29.640> second<00:00:30.060> Bell

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.280 

so<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> looks<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.480> second<00:01:12.930> Bell<00:01:13.050> has

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so it looks like that second Bell has

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
so it looks like that second Bell has
actually<00:01:13.950> opened<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> gate<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.030> front<00:01:15.300> of<00:01:15.480> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
actually opened the gate in front of the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.590 
actually opened the gate in front of the
onion<00:01:16.140> guy<00:01:17.090> whom<00:01:20.600> yeah<00:01:23.060> who<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.240> looking<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
onion guy whom yeah who was looking to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.400 
onion guy whom yeah who was looking to
see<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.680> wait<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.840> for<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.870> gate<00:01:28.200> to

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
see and wait for that for that gate to

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.640 
see and wait for that for that gate to
open<00:01:28.440> so<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.400> pretty<00:01:29.610> cool<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:31.410> also

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
open so that's pretty cool that also

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
open so that's pretty cool that also
means<00:01:32.040> i<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> traverse<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.480> way

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630

going to let him creep all the way

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.620 
going to let him creep all the way
towards<00:03:32.080> me<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.940> then<00:03:34.000> I'm<00:03:34.239> just<00:03:34.269> going<00:03:34.570> to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
towards me and then I'm just going to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.470 
towards me and then I'm just going to
sidestep<00:03:35.230> him<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.560> go<00:03:35.650> save<00:03:35.980> at<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.190> bonfire

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
sidestep him and go save at the bonfire

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.680 
sidestep him and go save at the bonfire
before<00:03:37.480> he<00:03:37.780> has<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.900> chance<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:39.690> you

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
before he has a chance so that I can you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.030 
before he has a chance so that I can you
know<00:03:40.840> reset<00:03:41.320> him<00:03:41.940> maybe<00:03:43.350> that's<00:03:44.350> my<00:03:44.560> that's<00:03:44.920> my

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
know reset him maybe that's my that's my

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.030 
know reset him maybe that's my that's my
guess<00:03:45.250> ah<00:03:48.540> he<00:03:49.540> does<00:03:49.720> not<00:03:50.050> come<00:03:50.440> out<00:03:50.470> this<00:03:50.799> way

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
guess ah he does not come out this way

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.479 
guess ah he does not come out this way
so<00:03:51.760> looks<00:03:52.540> like<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.780> gotta<00:03:52.959> hit<00:03:53.140> him<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.500> don't

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
so looks like I gotta hit him I don't

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.210 
so looks like I gotta hit him I don't
know<00:03:54.549> what's<00:03:54.700> gonna<00:03:54.760> happen<00:03:58.620> he<00:03:59.620> has<00:03:59.829> died

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
know what's gonna happen he has died

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.210 
know what's gonna happen he has died
dropped<00:04:01.030> something<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.739> released<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.920> whole
