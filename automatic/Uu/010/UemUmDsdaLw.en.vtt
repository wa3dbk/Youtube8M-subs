00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 Hi girls in today's video I 'm going 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.809
 to teach you the correct way to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.870
 mars put lipstick liquid liquid lipstick 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.760
 March extending before starting the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.850
 tutorial, I just wanted to say something 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.769
 So you broke a mate lipstick. 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 when the mouth is very dry when 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.609
 It has very weak when isolated and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 so I would like you to always do 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.800
 There's a lip exfoliation I've already voted for. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.410
 on the blog but talking is pretty easy to do 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.719
 you take sugar and honey is passing 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 sides making circles is on time 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.739
 if you already see what type that skirt came out to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 line stays out so at the time already 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.570
 realize that it came out and that it smoother 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.399
 Of course not in the type but on a day that you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.320
 You will get a book so we one 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.420
 perfect time but as you go 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.070
 doing the exfoliation however his 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 Lips are getting better 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 well then let's start another look at me 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.110
 I'm going to ask you to take a base and a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.150
 base brush to leave the mouth 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 so well the color of the mouth well 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.040
 uniform color of skin and will pass in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 sides around the mouth also good 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 leaving the mouth very even with the color 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.360
 the skin you will be able to leave the color 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.920
 most real lipstick because sometimes with the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.479
 color of our skin mainly for 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 Who has a very red mouth? 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 change lipstick color 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 after passing the base of face in the mouth 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.070
 You'll need a pencil. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 can be an eye pencil also a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 lapse pink one lapse today the most lapse 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.220
 similar to the color of the lipstick that goes 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.189
 pass the lipstick marks to pass I got 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.090
 a shade of red but the button matiko 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.189
 I'm going to spend an angelic orange air well. 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.170
 I do not know if it's getting orange there 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.329
 but he is more drawn to the orange of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.030
 enjoy 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.560
 I'll spend it around my mouth here. 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.719
 after you passed mouth pencil 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 around the sides 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.399
 I did not ask you to r 3 to show the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.020
 example examples for you I got 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.170
 cocoa butter 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.830
 the lip moisturizer and you can unibanco 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.960
 use any one since it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.540
 the color because if he has something he went 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.780
 see melingo if it's orange 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.670
 it ended up changing the tone of the matte lipstick 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.670
 What are you going to use? 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.130
 I'll use cocoa butter myself and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.720
 do not even think about applying the director knows 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.370
 because then lipstick we will not go any more 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.120
 kill yourself because it will get too much market 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 pass the finger so she missed giving 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.460
 little slap on the lip just to not stay 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.120
 crackle button is not to hydrate the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.160
 cocoa butter in this case is well 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.300
 little girls just beats 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.950
 and then you'll end up with your 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.830
 matt hall liquid lipstick sure 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.230
 There you go and spend a lot of time. 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.080
 Calm down, that 's how it goes when you pass away. 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.000
 he dried it was he can not be revoked 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.280
 in the layer will get very thick then 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.390
 You have to think calmly, kind of 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.390
 first and hit 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.810
 after that I have to always spend 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:29.780
 I usually do 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:32.180
 so without this legal side just so to 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.969
 body uniform 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.540
 then it's to end 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:40.549
 you have to correct most night 71 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.489
 even corrected because if you have linear 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.659
 Mending mouth here is gonna get more 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.060
 still pretty mouth 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.069
 so I will correct convincing the language of 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.730
 cat I got a collective and if it's da 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.159
 source 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.159
 I'll pass around the heavy ones. 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.780
 now let's go to the conclusion 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.219
 you must always be with the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.469
 mouth to mouth 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.689
 type make exfoliation pass moisturizer 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.719
 this will help a lot for your 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:14.389
 mouth with lipstick tomato looks pretty 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:17.419
 second is before the start of the day when 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.430
 you pass base in the whole mouth to 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.190
 smooth the color of the skin and mouth 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.949
 thus leaving the color of the lipstick more real 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.620
 a third one I say you pass a pencil 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.930
 and back of the lips because of that you know 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.240
 How far can you get with a tomato 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.070
 in the room you easily pass 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.169
 cocoa butter but not straight in the mouth 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.000
 just by tapping with your finger 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.509
 even the small cocoa butter 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.300
 Do not know if it 's me I say pass a lip. 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.000
 balm before a little before just to give 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.849
 It gets a little easier to pass know 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.060
 the mouth does not get so cracked a fifth 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.159
 step is I indicate you think with 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.530
 calm but at the same time fast ba 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.720
 tomato before it right liquid lipstick 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.460
 medium before it dries 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.550
 You have to be very careful when 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.190
 to make one more mistake of mate because 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.680
 When you pass he pulls out very fast. 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.240
 and if you pass if they fall on you 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.310
 pass another layer from above it goes 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.500
 end up getting thick cra that Ian was 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.800
 horrible without going through much caring 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.289
 very careful at the same time fast no 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 indicate to be doing so I say you 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.800
 to do so 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.139
 if I happen to leave a little button 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.920
 we know here a little bit here 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.070
 inside 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.290
 It's unfortunately I could not do it. 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.680
 a way for the trustee to go over 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.420
 everything knows and stay normal no no 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.880
 well I tried to do it did not go well 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.310
 I took it all and do it all over again. 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.710
 or type possession only in the part that was 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.020
 missing this, yes it 's this girls 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.910
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.530
 It's very easy so 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.630
 I do not know if the most correct way 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.920
 pass liquid martin lipstick but that's it 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.280
