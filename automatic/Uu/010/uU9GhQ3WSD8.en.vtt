00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.800 

so<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:02.190> hand<00:00:03.350> is<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.799> come<00:00:04.890> up

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
so this hand is going to come up

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.560 
so this hand is going to come up
expanding<00:00:06.810> upward<00:00:07.880> so<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.179> what<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.360> call

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
expanding upward so this is what we call

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.950 
expanding upward so this is what we call
pong<00:00:09.929> again<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> pong<00:00:11.210> energy<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.750> as

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
pong again this is a pong energy so as

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.740 
pong again this is a pong energy so as
the<00:00:13.469> energy<00:00:14.099> comes<00:00:14.490> up<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.139> movement

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
the energy comes up in for this movement

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:29.710 
the energy comes up in for this movement
it<00:00:18.750> sinks<00:00:19.529> down<00:00:19.770> into<00:00:21.080> this<00:00:22.080> back<00:00:22.470> right<00:00:23.220> side

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.479 

the<00:00:30.720> right<00:00:30.750> hand<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.740> also<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:34.489> help

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the right hand is also going to help

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.990 
the right hand is also going to help
balance<00:00:35.850> me<00:00:36.270> by<00:00:36.870> feeding<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.649> leg<00:00:37.980> okay<00:00:38.520> so

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
balance me by feeding this leg okay so

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.540 
balance me by feeding this leg okay so
let<00:00:39.180> me<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.870> by<00:00:40.020> myself<00:00:40.170> here

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.630 

here<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> road<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.030> TN<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> revolving<00:00:46.640> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
here the road on TN is revolving this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.959 
here the road on TN is revolving this
leg<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.360> staying<00:00:48.930> attached<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.610> weight

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
leg is is staying attached as the weight

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.750 
leg is is staying attached as the weight
shifts<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.910> side<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.809> filling<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:56.489> site

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
shifts this side is filling up this site

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
shifts this side is filling up this site
is<00:00:56.910> empty<00:00:57.500> this<00:00:58.500> leg<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.190> gathering<00:01:01.399> as<00:01:02.780> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
is empty this leg is gathering as this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.609 
is empty this leg is gathering as this
hand<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.290> coming<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> energy<00:01:06.479> comes<00:01:06.780> up

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
hand is coming down the energy comes up

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.210 
hand is coming down the energy comes up
to<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.060> base<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> neck<00:01:12.500> if<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.979> down

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to the base of the neck if I go down

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.590 
to the base of the neck if I go down
with<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.090> energy<00:01:16.130> easy<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.549> lose<00:01:18.240> one's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
with this energy easy to lose one's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.929 
with this energy easy to lose one's
balance<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> counter<00:01:20.310> bounce<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
balance so the counter bounce this is

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.390 
balance so the counter bounce this is
going<00:01:21.270> down<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> energy<00:01:22.860> moves<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
going down so the energy moves up the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.770 
going down so the energy moves up the
spine<00:01:26.720> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> same<00:01:28.170> time<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.420> hand<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
spine at the same time the right hand is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
spine at the same time the right hand is
filling<00:01:33.619> discounters<00:01:34.619> bellows<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:37.729> this

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
filling discounters bellows then as this

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.420 
filling discounters bellows then as this
is<00:01:39.210> expanding<00:01:40.020> upward<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:41.009> would<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.250> very

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
is expanding upward it would be very

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.899 
is expanding upward it would be very
easy<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.829> thing<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.280> keep<00:01:47.460> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
easy to do this the thing to keep this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
easy to do this the thing to keep this
together<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:50.460> side<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.390> dropping<00:01:52.380> can

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
together is a this side is dropping can

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.880 
together is a this side is dropping can
you<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:53.040> instead<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.430> coming<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
you see instead of coming up here the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.929 
you see instead of coming up here the
energy<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.969> dropping<00:01:57.600> down<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.939> it's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
energy is dropping down here and it's

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.249 
energy is dropping down here and it's
coming<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.439> back<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.820> side<00:02:06.259> at

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
coming down back into this back side at

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
coming down back into this back side at
the<00:02:07.439> same<00:02:07.710> time

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the same time

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.450 
the same time
this<00:02:09.240> hand<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.750> pressing<00:02:10.259> downward<00:02:18.350> okay<00:02:19.460> now

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
this hand is pressing downward okay now

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.150 
this hand is pressing downward okay now
at<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.700> point<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.390> coming<00:02:21.720> up<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.890> would<00:02:23.040> be

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
at this point it's coming up it would be

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.440 
at this point it's coming up it would be
very<00:02:23.310> easy<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.850> him<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.210> pull<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:25.230> away<00:02:26.450> pull

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
very easy for him to pull this away pull

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
very easy for him to pull this away pull
say<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.200> yeah<00:02:28.410> because<00:02:28.560> my<00:02:28.920> I'm<00:02:29.250> kind<00:02:29.580> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
say just yeah because my I'm kind of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430 
say just yeah because my I'm kind of
coming<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.480> he<00:02:30.510> could<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.200> like

coming up and so he could kind of like
if<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.740> were<00:02:31.860> doing<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.370> movement<00:02:34.730> since

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
if you were doing this a movement since

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.630 
if you were doing this a movement since
this<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:35.940> going<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.240> be<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:37.110> way<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:38.400> see

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
this is going to be go this way you see

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.220 
this is going to be go this way you see
it<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.940> be<00:02:39.090> going<00:02:39.420> too<00:02:40.080> much<00:02:40.320> here<00:02:41.930> okay<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:42.989> we

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it to be going too much here okay so we

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.500 
it to be going too much here okay so we
need<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.280> concerned<00:02:44.910> because<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
need to to be concerned because this

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.060 
need to to be concerned because this
energy<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.959> coming<00:02:46.140> here<00:02:46.380> we<00:02:46.739> need<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.950> find

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
energy is coming here we need to find

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.930 
energy is coming here we need to find
this<00:02:47.550> balance<00:02:48.209> here<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:53.340> hand<00:02:53.820> is

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
this balance here so one is that hand is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.690 
this balance here so one is that hand is
pressing<00:02:54.450> down<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:57.950> here<00:02:58.950> let<00:02:59.130> me<00:02:59.160> know<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.550> you

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.500 
empty this side this side is going to go
this<00:03:20.070> way<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:20.640> as<00:03:20.820> he<00:03:20.970> pulls<00:03:21.239> her

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.449 

it's<00:03:30.050> sort<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.379> like<00:03:30.440> holding<00:03:31.040> like<00:03:31.430> a

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
it's sort of like holding like a

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.190 
it's sort of like holding like a
tightrope<00:03:31.760> walker<00:03:33.549> finding<00:03:34.549> this<00:03:34.670> balance<00:03:35.200> so

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
tightrope walker finding this balance so

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.930 
tightrope walker finding this balance so
in<00:03:36.379> that<00:03:36.500> Don<00:03:36.739> Tian<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.720> revolving<00:03:38.720> this<00:03:39.379> way

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
in that Don Tian is revolving this way

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:50.350 
in that Don Tian is revolving this way
counterclockwise<00:03:48.099> this<00:03:49.099> side<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.670> feeling<00:03:50.120> as

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
counterclockwise this side is feeling as

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.850 
counterclockwise this side is feeling as
this<00:03:50.540> side<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:50.900> empty<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.230> right<00:03:51.440> side<00:03:51.709> is

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
this side is empty the right side is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.720 
this side is empty the right side is
feeling<00:03:52.190> as<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.430> less<00:03:52.610> side<00:03:52.849> empties<00:03:53.470> yeah

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
feeling as the less side empties yeah

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.350 
feeling as the less side empties yeah
now<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.060> beautiful<00:03:56.269> because<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:01.610> the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
now this is beautiful because so the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.229 
now this is beautiful because so the
energy<00:04:02.720> drops<00:04:03.049> down<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.590> right<00:04:04.129> side<00:04:04.489> as<00:04:04.940> the

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
energy drops down the right side as the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.460 
energy drops down the right side as the
left<00:04:05.450> side<00:04:05.900> advances<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:07.670> balance<00:04:08.120> as<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
left side advances to balance as the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.900 
left side advances to balance as the
left<00:04:09.709> side<00:04:10.160> continues<00:04:11.030> moving<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.690> emptying

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
left side continues moving and emptying

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:24.190 
left side continues moving and emptying
the<00:04:13.910> right<00:04:14.180> side<00:04:14.569> advances

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.670 

and<00:04:24.430> lastly<00:04:25.430> we're<00:04:25.970> going<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.330> come<00:04:26.600> into<00:04:26.840> fist

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
and lastly we're going to come into fist

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.740 
and lastly we're going to come into fist
under<00:04:27.920> elbow<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:28.970> think<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.270> can<00:04:29.480> see

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
under elbow and this I think you can see

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.020 
under elbow and this I think you can see
pretty<00:04:30.410> easily<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:33.320> counterbalance<00:04:33.950> is<00:04:34.490> that

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
pretty easily the counterbalance is that

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.600 
pretty easily the counterbalance is that
as<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.810> right<00:04:36.110> side<00:04:36.770> retreats<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:39.280> left<00:04:40.280> side

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
as the right side retreats the left side

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
as the right side retreats the left side
advances<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:43.220> hand<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.730> pulling<00:04:44.000> down<00:04:44.210> and

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
advances this hand is pulling down and

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.990 
advances this hand is pulling down and
this<00:04:44.690> is<00:04:44.750> coming<00:04:45.110> up<00:04:45.380> so<00:04:45.830> there's<00:04:46.070> not<00:04:46.250> much<00:04:46.310> in

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
this is coming up so there's not much in

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.730 
this is coming up so there's not much in
the<00:04:47.390> way<00:04:47.420> of<00:04:49.300> its<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.990> energy<00:04:51.170> is<00:04:51.410> fairly

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
the way of its the the energy is fairly

00:04:51.740 --> 00:05:01.030 
the way of its the the energy is fairly
central<00:04:52.520> here<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:59.300> Don<00:04:59.570> Tian<00:04:59.930> is<00:05:00.170> now<00:05:00.740> moving

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
central here the Don Tian is now moving

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.170 
central here the Don Tian is now moving
clockwise<00:05:05.260> that<00:05:06.260> that<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.250> Dante<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:07.790> moving

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
clockwise that that the Dante is moving

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.840 
clockwise that that the Dante is moving
back<00:05:08.480> on<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.960> right<00:05:09.170> side<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.730> forward<00:05:10.730> on

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
back on the right side and forward on

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.630 
back on the right side and forward on
the<00:05:10.970> left<00:05:11.210> side<00:05:14.530> so<00:05:15.530> if<00:05:15.890> we<00:05:16.100> do<00:05:16.250> this<00:05:16.370> together

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
the left side so if we do this together

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.820 
the left side so if we do this together
we<00:05:17.270> put<00:05:17.450> all<00:05:17.660> of<00:05:17.690> these<00:05:17.960> various<00:05:18.620> elements

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
we put all of these various elements

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:29.320 
we put all of these various elements
together<00:05:25.240> we're<00:05:26.240> coming<00:05:26.570> back<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:28.330> turning

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
together we're coming back and turning

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.610 
together we're coming back and turning
so<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.690> thing<00:05:29.900> that's<00:05:30.080> going<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.320> keep<00:05:30.470> us

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
so the thing that's going to keep us

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.370 
so the thing that's going to keep us
going<00:05:30.650> too<00:05:31.400> far<00:05:31.700> is<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.750> right<00:05:32.990> foot

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
going too far is the is the right foot

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.140 
going too far is the is the right foot
heel<00:05:34.160> is<00:05:34.430> pressing<00:05:35.210> down<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:36.670> left<00:05:37.670> foot<00:05:37.970> is

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
heel is pressing down the left foot is

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.330 
heel is pressing down the left foot is
filling<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:39.380> give<00:05:39.950> us<00:05:40.070> a<00:05:40.190> break<00:05:41.590> then<00:05:42.590> as<00:05:42.860> we

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
filling to give us a break then as we

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.810 
filling to give us a break then as we
come<00:05:43.580> into<00:05:43.760> our<00:05:43.910> Center<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:49.040> energy<00:05:49.400> moves<00:05:49.640> up

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
come into our Center the energy moves up

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.730 
come into our Center the energy moves up
the<00:05:49.880> spine<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:51.740> base<00:05:51.920> of<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:52.310> neck<00:05:53.740> the

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
the spine to the base of the neck the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.710 
the spine to the base of the neck the
right<00:05:55.010> side<00:05:55.310> fills<00:05:55.760> as<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.240> left<00:05:56.420> side

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
right side fills as the left side

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.850 
right side fills as the left side
empties<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:59.090> right<00:05:59.330> leg<00:05:59.630> is<00:05:59.870> at<00:06:00.020> the<00:06:00.260> break<00:06:00.590> as

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
empties the right leg is at the break as

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.310 
empties the right leg is at the break as

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.080 

then<00:06:08.280> as<00:06:08.820> we<00:06:09.420> step<00:06:12.230> the<00:06:13.230> left<00:06:13.560> side<00:06:13.890> is<00:06:14.370> pawing

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
going to shift back just a little bit it

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.660 
going to shift back just a little bit it
skips<00:06:34.140> in<00:06:34.350> here<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:37.680> left<00:06:38.130> foot<00:06:38.340> has

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
skips in here the the left foot has

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.670 
skips in here the the left foot has
braking<00:06:39.480> qualities<00:06:40.170> to<00:06:40.500> it<00:06:40.530> here<00:06:41.150> then<00:06:42.150> as<00:06:42.680> we
