happy day to leave a like and let's get
right<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.030> were<00:00:33.090> going

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
right into this so what you were going

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.700 
right into this so what you were going
to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.570> make<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.930> way<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.260> location

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to do is make your way to this location

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.139 
to do is make your way to this location
and<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> were<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.940> run

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and what you were going to do is run

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
and what you were going to do is run
forward<00:00:36.540> double<00:00:36.840> jump<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.230> boost<00:00:37.440> forward

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
forward double jump and boost forward

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.590 
forward double jump and boost forward
and<00:00:37.980> activate<00:00:38.399> hover<00:00:38.579> mode<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.450> land

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and activate hover mode so you can land

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
and activate hover mode so you can land
in<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.870> spot<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.530> once<00:00:40.739> you've<00:00:40.860> landed<00:00:41.010> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
in this spot and once you've landed in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
in this spot and once you've landed in
this<00:00:41.370> spot<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.730> you're<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
this spot what you're going to do is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
this spot what you're going to do is
move<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.170> were<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> double<00:00:43.860> jump

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
move out you were going to double jump

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889 
move out you were going to double jump
so<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.670> land<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.059> barrier<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
so you can land on this barrier and you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.940 
so you can land on this barrier and you
were<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.140> much<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.440> gonna<00:00:46.620> follow<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
were pretty much just gonna follow it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.740 
were pretty much just gonna follow it
around<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.300> once<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
around like I do and once you get to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.970 
around like I do and once you get to
this<00:00:48.899> spot<00:00:49.079> what<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this spot what you're going to do is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.010 
this spot what you're going to do is
double<00:00:50.280> jump<00:00:50.460> again<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.940> double<00:00:51.480> jump<00:00:51.660> again

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
double jump again and double jump again

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.540 
double jump again and double jump again
and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.039> able<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.430> onto

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and then you will be able to get onto

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
and then you will be able to get onto
the<00:00:53.730> roof<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> first<00:00:54.629> part<00:00:54.989> we're

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the roof now the first part we're

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
the roof now the first part we're
actually<00:00:55.289> use<00:00:55.590> hover<00:00:55.800> mode<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
actually use hover mode you can do it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.310 
actually use hover mode you can do it
without<00:00:56.850> hover<00:00:57.090> mode<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.199> more

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
without hover mode it is just a lot more

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
without hover mode it is just a lot more
tricky<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.129> pretty<00:00:59.370> much<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.760> double

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
tricky you pretty much have to double

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
tricky you pretty much have to double
jump<00:01:00.329> boost<00:01:00.570> forward<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.079> boost<00:01:01.469> forward

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
jump boost forward and boost forward

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
jump boost forward and boost forward
again<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.149> actually<00:01:03.300> land<00:01:03.570> on

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
again and then you can actually land on

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.030 
again and then you can actually land on
the<00:01:03.780> barrier<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.470> say<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> lot

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the barrier but I can say it is a lot

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
the barrier but I can say it is a lot
harder<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.299> recommend<00:01:06.330> using

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
harder to do so I would recommend using

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
harder to do so I would recommend using
hover<00:01:07.170> mode<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.130> glitch<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.340> really

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
hover mode so this glitch is really

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.219 
hover mode so this glitch is really
really<00:01:08.760> awesome<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.510> easy<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
really awesome really easy to do and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.070 
really awesome really easy to do and
working<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> xbox<00:01:11.250> 360<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.790> ps3<00:01:12.119> pretty<00:01:12.930> much

working on xbox 360 and ps3 pretty much
from<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> map

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
from here to actually get out of the map

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.859 
from here to actually get out of the map
all<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.090> follow<00:01:15.240> where<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> go

all you have to do is follow where I go
it's<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.500> straightforward<00:01:16.740> pretty

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's a really straightforward pretty

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.679 
it's a really straightforward pretty
much<00:01:17.340> come<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.790> roof<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
much come on to this roof and what you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.179 
much come on to this roof and what you
were<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.560> small<00:01:19.740> strafe

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
were going to do is just a small strafe
