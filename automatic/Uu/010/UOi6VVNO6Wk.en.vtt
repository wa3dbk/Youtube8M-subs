00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.410 

what's<00:01:35.710> more<00:01:35.860> important<00:01:36.429> is<00:01:36.670> how<00:01:37.000> this<00:01:37.179> thing

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
what's more important is how this thing

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.039 
what's more important is how this thing
drives<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.119> comes<00:01:43.240> as<00:01:43.450> no<00:01:43.479> surprise<00:01:43.659> to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
drives what it comes as no surprise to

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.200 
drives what it comes as no surprise to
me<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:44.799> up<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.460> company's<00:01:45.819> usual

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
me that it's up to the company's usual

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.940 
me that it's up to the company's usual
standards<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.929> mean<00:01:47.049> it's<00:01:47.170> no<00:01:47.259> exaggeration<00:01:47.380> to

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
standards I mean it's no exaggeration to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.100 
standards I mean it's no exaggeration to
say<00:01:48.039> that<00:01:48.189> howdy<00:01:48.490> probably<00:01:48.970> do<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.270> best<00:01:49.539> car

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
say that howdy probably do the best car

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.410 
say that howdy probably do the best car
interiors<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:51.099> the<00:01:51.459> world<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.090> sort<00:01:52.330> of

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
interiors in the world of this sort of

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.020 
interiors in the world of this sort of
price<00:01:52.689> it's<00:01:53.140> all<00:01:53.349> very<00:01:53.380> very<00:01:53.890> understated<00:01:54.520> I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
price it's all very very understated I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.830 
price it's all very very understated I
think<00:01:55.450> it's<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.630> less-is-more<00:01:55.990> approach<00:01:57.840> it's

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
think it's a less-is-more approach it's

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.600 
think it's a less-is-more approach it's
made<00:01:59.080> from<00:01:59.200> aluminium<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.890> steel<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:00.490> it's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
made from aluminium and steel so it's

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.179 
made from aluminium and steel so it's
light<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.179> all<00:02:01.599> models<00:02:01.959> have<00:02:02.200> start<00:02:02.619> stop<00:02:03.009> and

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
recuperation which means the overall

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.889 
recuperation which means the overall

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899

technology<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:55.819> is<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.000> car<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.720> huge

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
technology this is a car of huge

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.009 
technology this is a car of huge
efficiency<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.129> I<00:02:58.400> think<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.299> design<00:02:59.450> speaks

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
efficiency and I think the design speaks

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.319 
efficiency and I think the design speaks
for<00:03:00.230> itself<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.799> sits<00:03:01.159> beautifully<00:03:01.610> on<00:03:02.180> the

for itself it sits beautifully on the

for itself it sits beautifully on the
road<00:03:02.599> as<00:03:02.900> real<00:03:03.560> presence<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:04.430> apart<00:03:04.970> from<00:03:05.000> all
