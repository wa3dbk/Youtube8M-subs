00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.650
 travel and putting makeup and everything 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.320
 a little bit of all those feminine things 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.119
 purchases 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.800
 of everything but my position is 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.810
 makeup is that I like more than 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.050
 all sharing and stimulating 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.180
 share it with you here is the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.860
 world that is a community that is 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.470
 subscribe if you want to continue seeing more 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.849
 videos of all those feminine and 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.890
 this video what we are going to do is 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.629
 deal with a topic that I think everyone 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.340
 argued we have tried to do well is 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.710
 the line two types face and that this one that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.900
 a little yes lengthened and I wanted to do it for 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.940
 girls that maybe are not so artistic 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.350
 but he suffers a little with his hands that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 it's my case that I can make a 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.070
 outlined yes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 for our tricks because I do not 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.829
 it goes so well, so I'm going to show you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.000
 our tricks so that you too 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.519
 they can make it look like a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.290
 professional but when maybe your 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.050
 hands 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.699
 in the video you please keep good 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 until the end because I'm a surprise 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.850
 at the end of the video and do not forget to spend 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.979
 for my channel also so they can see 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.450
 more tips because I'm left with an attack 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.060
 I left everything as basic as a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.940
 delineated up super crazy things from 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.649
 halloween special effects and in which 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.180
 they are very much videos so let's go 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.979
 I wait for you on the channel I will wait for your 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.149
 comments and again do not forget 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.920
 subscribe here is the game 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.990
 inscription to the channel and see action on 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.460
 video because I have some super surprises 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.500
 and if there is action plan 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.179
 removed will be searched I'm walking and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.830
 will start using a base for 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.830
 make sure that lasted me until 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.210
 and I'm going to use at least one test 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.310
 of corrector but very little because 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.860
 Sometimes they are not specialized for you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.570
 last an eyeliner I can do everything 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 otherwise make you run away because 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.270
 It is our past 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.310
 so we made more linear and you 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.580
 It dominates linear black liquid that sometimes 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.750
 I 'm afraid you 'll use it and if not 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.540
 They are very good with liquid eyeliner 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 worry because it does not matter because of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.600
 done this technique is enough to do 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.750
 more parties but those with their hands 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.490
 but nice if they have flower courses or 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.470
 that in my case can support the one with 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.880
 surface like a table or something and 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.680
 that helps them a lot then what 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.300
 let's do is start other 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.980
 small but what I do is that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.980
 I start at the center of my eye 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.880
 help to work by bits 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.880
 some line 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.900
 and then if I want to continue delineating 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.000
 because ine in half but I do want 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.160
 finally do the internal pounds 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.040
 then as it increases and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.700
 thicknesses 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.700
 a cat's eye 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.640
 Now we are going to make the patita wanting 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.040
 that makes the fan more this look 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.370
 it's very important that you stand up because if 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.370
 is tomorrow 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:22.469
 to do it any way we're not going to put together 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:24.780
 There is 6 life was not nice that nothing 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.120
 so he is about to say everything is 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.889
 finished but so do not be left going to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.959
 do it now I work it and I will return it to 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.340
 teach them how it was to be cute 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.900
 free now what are we going to do is take 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.659
 a swab and what you want to do with 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.579
 extra simply remove the cotton 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.810
 cited that it has and leave the gases as if 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.770
 they were nothing more 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.770
 the stick 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.950
 and now what he is going to do is simply 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.080
 soak it with a little bit of albert 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.569
 dweller of machine 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.610
 and now with this stick what is called 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.290
 clean the edge 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.879
 I'm basically creating my way 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.879
 I can do it with the top 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.440
 at an angle so that they remain super 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.299
 perfect and that's exactly what 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.669
 it arrived then I'm reviewed how 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.720
 remove black shadow and for the edge 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.720
 flips of brush 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.340
 the caregiver who asks for the brush 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.820
 miwa field 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.320
 and I'm going nowhere 15 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.320
 and cleaning with cumbias 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.680
 and I'm doing 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Quick 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.630
 you are ready to be put for the 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.200
 night service 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:18.180
 I saw her in the fire finally we hope that 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:22.110
 it's ready and it's really fun and now 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.110
 all the videos that we have 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:33.040
 and also a brand that revises tomorrow 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.840
 Wednesday with three of the video so that 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.520
 can see them and can participate in the 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.389
 rhythm that will be in the channel so 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.150
 things and I hope to see you soon 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:47.340
 either in chopped or perhaps again 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.340
 throughout the world we have been 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.860
 to
