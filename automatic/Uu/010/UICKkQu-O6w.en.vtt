of the videos but they're missing the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.430 
of the videos but they're missing the
point<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.750> point<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:45.260> have<00:00:45.350> these

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
point the point is that we have these

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.010 
point the point is that we have these
incredibly<00:00:45.980> robust<00:00:46.719> workbooks<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:47.840> go

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
incredibly robust workbooks that go

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.560 
incredibly robust workbooks that go
along<00:00:48.260> with<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:49.219> actual<00:00:49.489> video<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.239> yes

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
along with the actual video and and yes

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.240 
along with the actual video and and yes
the<00:00:50.719> video<00:00:50.960> content<00:00:51.410> is<00:00:51.500> where<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.770> marrow<00:00:52.100> of

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
the video content is where the marrow of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.729 
the video content is where the marrow of
the<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.329> learning<00:00:53.629> takes<00:00:53.840> place<00:00:54.110> through<00:00:54.649> the

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
the the learning takes place through the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.139 
the the learning takes place through the
repetition<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.520> watching<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.940> actual

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
repetition to watching the actual

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.479 
repetition to watching the actual
process<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.170> after<00:00:57.469> that<00:00:57.590> it<00:00:57.860> really<00:00:58.190> helps

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
process but after that it really helps

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.490 
process but after that it really helps
if<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.850> get<00:00:59.059> in<00:00:59.180> there<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.600> you<00:01:00.079> do<00:01:00.289> those

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
if you get in there and you do those

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.020 
if you get in there and you do those
assignments<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:01.190> are<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.550> workbooks

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
assignments that are in the workbooks

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.400 
assignments that are in the workbooks
and<00:01:02.210> you<00:01:02.510> follow<00:01:02.809> through<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:03.170> actually

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
and you follow through and you actually

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.680 
and you follow through and you actually
do<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.129> execution<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.149> pieces<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:05.660> I

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
do the execution of the pieces that I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.900 
do the execution of the pieces that I
have<00:01:06.020> led<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.289> or<00:01:06.710> Eric<00:01:07.310> or<00:01:07.490> any<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.789> other

the<00:01:29.450> phase<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.960> actually<00:01:30.290> got<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.530> gist<00:01:30.740> of

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
the phase and actually got the gist of

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.210 
the phase and actually got the gist of
what<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.159> phase<00:01:31.369> really<00:01:31.869> really<00:01:32.869> was<00:01:32.990> about

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
what that phase really really was about

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.320 
what that phase really really was about
but<00:01:34.220> we're<00:01:34.369> gonna<00:01:34.460> be<00:01:34.670> doing<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:34.970> mostly<00:01:35.210> on

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
but we're gonna be doing it mostly on

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.820 
but we're gonna be doing it mostly on
the<00:01:35.420> fact<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:35.960> we're<00:01:36.170> assuming<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.740> you

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
the fact that we're assuming that you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.109 
the fact that we're assuming that you
really<00:01:37.220> want<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.490> get<00:01:37.610> good<00:01:37.729> for<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:37.970> right

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
really want to get good for the right

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.390 
really want to get good for the right
reasons<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.320> we<00:01:39.650> want<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.920> little<00:01:39.950> bit<00:01:40.280> of

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
reasons and so we want a little bit of
