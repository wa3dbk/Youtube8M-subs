pop this courtesy hopper pocket so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
pop this courtesy hopper pocket so
that's<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.920> excuse<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.149> should<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.989> able

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
that's my excuse but you should be able

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.219 
that's my excuse but you should be able
to<00:01:04.229> respawn<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.830> ball<00:01:04.979> okay<00:01:05.990> let's<00:01:06.990> give<00:01:07.140> me

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to respawn the ball okay let's give me

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
to respawn the ball okay let's give me
another<00:01:07.439> rich

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.490 

so<00:01:12.820> there<00:01:13.119> even<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.540> white<00:01:13.750> wouldn't<00:01:14.110> move<00:01:14.229> for

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
so there even a white wouldn't move for

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.680 
so there even a white wouldn't move for
very<00:01:14.770> slimy<00:01:15.100> or<00:01:15.310> mastication<00:01:15.850> world<00:01:16.360> with

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
very slimy or mastication world with

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.530 
very slimy or mastication world with
little<00:01:16.900> wine<00:01:19.229> better<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.909> they<00:01:22.090> can<00:01:22.420> achieve

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
little wine better so they can achieve

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.390 
little wine better so they can achieve
spot<00:01:22.990> will<00:01:23.200> put<00:01:23.409> them<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.770> touching<00:01:24.190> ball

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
spot will put them in is touching ball

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.719 
spot will put them in is touching ball
so<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.479> perfect<00:01:25.780> stop<00:01:26.259> shop<00:01:26.530> not<00:01:26.860> the

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
so that is a perfect stop shop not the

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.090 
so that is a perfect stop shop not the
ball<00:01:27.940> finishing<00:01:28.509> where<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.930> red<00:01:29.110> ones<00:01:29.380> it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
ball finishing where the red ones it's

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.770 
ball finishing where the red ones it's
for<00:01:30.310> where<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> object<00:01:30.880> awards<00:01:31.300> that's<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.600> big

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
for where the object awards that's a big

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.300 
for where the object awards that's a big
misconception<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.649> that's<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.040> stop<00:01:33.280> shot

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
misconception that that's a stop shot

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.450 
misconception that that's a stop shot
it's<00:01:33.700> done<00:01:33.940> shot<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.479> it's<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:35.740> important<00:01:36.430> to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
it's done shot and it's so important to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.969 
it's done shot and it's so important to
have<00:01:36.759> that<00:01:37.060> level<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:37.930> control<00:01:37.990> where<00:01:38.770> any

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
have that level of control where any

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.910 
have that level of control where any
difference<00:01:39.490> any<00:01:39.759> power<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:41.740> can

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
difference any power that you can

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.889 
difference any power that you can
actually<00:01:42.100> achieve<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.850> perfect<00:01:43.119> stop<00:01:43.630> shot

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
actually achieve that perfect stop shot

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually achieve that perfect stop shot
and<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.820> foundation<00:01:46.630> for<00:01:46.780> positional

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
and that is a foundation for positional

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.499 
and that is a foundation for positional
favourite<00:01:47.890> especially<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.550> because<00:01:49.240> if<00:01:49.360> you

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
favourite especially on because if you

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.910 
favourite especially on because if you
know<00:01:49.660> how<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.929> do<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.410> with<00:01:50.590> complete

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
know how to do that with complete

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.730 
know how to do that with complete
control<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.700> anytime<00:01:52.570> at<00:01:52.780> any<00:01:52.929> speed<00:01:53.410> at<00:01:53.710> any

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
control on anytime at any speed at any

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.370 
control on anytime at any speed at any
distance<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.990> imagine<00:01:56.470> how<00:01:56.560> easy<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.340> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
distance then imagine how easy it is to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.080 
distance then imagine how easy it is to
modulate<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.770> to<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.580> position<00:02:01.060> you

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
modulate that to the position you

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.630 
modulate that to the position you
actually<00:02:01.600> do<00:02:01.810> need<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.740> this<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.070> in<00:02:03.190> front<00:02:03.550> of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
actually do need so this is in front of

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.649 
actually do need so this is in front of
our<00:02:03.789> set<00:02:04.119> point<00:02:04.149> of<00:02:05.140> control<00:02:06.090> after<00:02:07.090> which

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
our set point of control after which

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.419 
our set point of control after which
you're<00:02:07.960> able<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.320> have<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.769> full<00:02:09.039> breakfast

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
you're able to have a full breakfast

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.370 
you're able to have a full breakfast
water<00:02:09.670> people<00:02:11.190> position<00:02:12.190> possibility<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.380> if

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
water people position possibility so if

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.630 
water people position possibility so if
I<00:02:14.530> wanted<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.830> play<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.190> on<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.400> bit<00:02:15.610> more

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
I wanted to play this on a bit more

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.520 
I wanted to play this on a bit more
speed<00:02:16.090> other<00:02:16.390> than<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.780> go<00:02:16.900> obviously<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.350> bit

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
speed other than to go obviously a bit

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.520 
speed other than to go obviously a bit
higher<00:02:17.769> on<00:02:17.799> cue<00:02:18.220> ball<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:22.209> then<00:02:23.049> control

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
higher on cue ball and then control

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.180 
higher on cue ball and then control
becomes<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.130> much<00:02:24.190> more<00:02:24.370> difficult<00:02:26.190> there's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
becomes that much more difficult there's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.530 
becomes that much more difficult there's
usually<00:02:27.459> an<00:02:27.730> optimum<00:02:28.150> speed<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.810> which<00:02:30.540> it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
usually an optimum speed of which it's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.840 
usually an optimum speed of which it's
most<00:02:31.930> easy<00:02:32.260> for<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> plan<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.190> actually<00:02:33.370> stop

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
most easy for a plan to actually stop

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:43.840 
most easy for a plan to actually stop
the<00:02:33.970> ball<00:02:34.120> perfectly<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.130> went<00:02:36.370> much<00:02:36.610> slower

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.860 

that's<00:02:44.850> one<00:02:45.060> forward<00:02:45.480> half<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.780> little

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that's one forward half so just a little

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.410 
that's one forward half so just a little
bit<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.260> speed<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:53.160> master<00:02:53.610> those<00:02:53.790> ones<00:02:54.060> first

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
bit of speed so master those ones first

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.910 
bit of speed so master those ones first
and<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.540> pliers<00:02:57.900> increase<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
and then have your pliers increase the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.590 
and then have your pliers increase the
distance<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.550> which<00:02:59.700> they're<00:02:59.940> able<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.420> get

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
distance of which they're able to get

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.530 
distance of which they're able to get
that<00:03:00.780> full<00:03:01.050> stop<00:03:01.350> shop<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.910> want<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> make

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
that full stop shop you want to make

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.290 
that full stop shop you want to make
everything<00:03:05.060> okay

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.199 

and<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:10.290> thing<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.709> do<00:03:10.860> really<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.400> get<00:03:12.000> them

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
and the thing to do really is get them

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:22.460 
and the thing to do really is get them
to<00:03:13.190> draggable<00:03:14.190> first<00:03:20.930> I'm<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.170> doing<00:03:22.440> that

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
to draggable first I'm just doing that

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:30.740 
to draggable first I'm just doing that
with<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.160> two<00:03:23.220> one

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.730 

little<00:03:31.380> bit<00:03:31.470> closer<00:03:31.740> so<00:03:33.470> straight<00:03:34.470> with<00:03:34.680> a

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
little bit closer so straight with a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.710 
little bit closer so straight with a
black<00:03:34.950> as<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:35.400> read<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.180> straight<00:03:36.390> with<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
black as if read it straight with the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.310 
black as if read it straight with the
black<00:03:36.930> into<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.500> that's<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:39.020> that's<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.200> good

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
black into that that's it that's a good

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.380 
black into that that's it that's a good
average<00:03:40.820> position<00:03:43.670> keeps<00:03:44.670> through<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.180> reps

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
average position keeps through the reps

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.250 
average position keeps through the reps
will<00:03:45.780> achieve<00:03:47.210> too<00:03:48.210> close<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> pocket

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
will achieve too close to the pocket

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.960 
will achieve too close to the pocket
Buddhist<00:03:49.790> distance<00:03:50.790> away<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:52.670> high<00:03:53.670> number

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
Buddhist distance away so high number

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.180 
Buddhist distance away so high number
one<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.600> ball<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.170> just<00:03:55.860> get<00:03:56.040> your

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
one on the ball and just get your

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:07.010 
one on the ball and just get your
players<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.910> play<00:03:57.210> different<00:03:57.750> speeds<00:04:06.020> certain

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
players to play different speeds certain

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.440 
players to play different speeds certain
things

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.350 

that<00:04:10.050> different<00:04:10.440> space<00:04:10.879> portal<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.000> cable

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
that different space portal the cable

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.479 
that different space portal the cable
doesn't<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:13.080> difference<00:04:13.500> being<00:04:13.769> reaction

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
doesn't the difference being reaction

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:22.220 
doesn't the difference being reaction
white<00:04:19.760> so<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:20.880> maybe<00:04:21.090> twenty<00:04:21.570> percent<00:04:21.600> speed

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
white so it's maybe twenty percent speed

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.020 
white so it's maybe twenty percent speed
lose<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.650> bit<00:04:22.889> more<00:04:23.070> than<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.310> previous<00:04:23.760> shot

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
lose a bit more than the previous shot

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:38.970 
lose a bit more than the previous shot
still<00:04:24.450> get<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> drag<00:04:24.960> shop

you've<00:04:45.500> dropped<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.920> ball<00:04:49.570> there<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.750> cue<00:04:51.200> ball

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
you've dropped a ball there the cue ball

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.860 
you've dropped a ball there the cue ball
was<00:04:51.650> trying<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.820> stop<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> little<00:04:53.480> bit<00:04:53.600> more<00:04:53.780> on

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
was trying to stop a little bit more on

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.200 
was trying to stop a little bit more on
earth<00:04:54.020> you<00:04:54.260> notice<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.830> but<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.670> just<00:04:55.700> didn't

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
earth you notice that but it just didn't

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.550 
earth you notice that but it just didn't
have<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.540> strength<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.440> stay<00:04:57.830> in<00:04:57.890> position<00:04:58.550> I

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
have the strength to stay in position I

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:09.360 
have the strength to stay in position I
think<00:05:00.560> reason<00:05:00.950> stay<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.190> little<00:05:01.550> bit<00:05:01.670> more

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.240 

maybe<00:05:10.370> smiling<00:05:11.030> more<00:05:11.590> now<00:05:12.590> it's<00:05:12.770> finding<00:05:13.040> it

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
maybe smiling more now it's finding it

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.670 
maybe smiling more now it's finding it
harder<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.730> move<00:05:14.000> forward<00:05:14.600> as<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.350> hits<00:05:15.590> the

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
harder to move forward as it hits the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.910 
harder to move forward as it hits the
red<00:05:15.950> there<00:05:16.820> further<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.450> pushing

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
red there further to the pushing

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.130 
red there further to the pushing
resolution<00:05:18.920> yeah<00:05:22.300> just<00:05:23.300> keep<00:05:23.510> up<00:05:23.690> with<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
resolution yeah just keep up with the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.080 
resolution yeah just keep up with the
building<00:05:24.530> speed<00:05:24.860> but<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.220> target<00:05:25.640> is<00:05:25.730> to<00:05:25.790> hit

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
building speed but the target is to hit

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.520 
building speed but the target is to hit
8:1<00:05:27.880> not<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:29.150> stop<00:05:29.420> the<00:05:29.540> ball<00:05:29.720> that's<00:05:30.170> the<00:05:30.350> big

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
8:1 not to stop the ball that's the big

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.170 
8:1 not to stop the ball that's the big
mistake<00:05:30.920> in<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:31.250> shop<00:05:31.490> people<00:05:31.850> trying<00:05:32.090> to

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
mistake in the shop people trying to

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.780 
mistake in the shop people trying to
stop<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.480> ball<00:05:32.660> target<00:05:33.470> is<00:05:33.740> hit<00:05:33.950> age<00:05:34.190> 1<00:05:34.550> and

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
stop the ball target is hit age 1 and

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:46.370 
stop the ball target is hit age 1 and
the<00:05:35.030> speed<00:05:35.180> you<00:05:35.420> need<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.780> stop

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.290 

that's<00:05:47.380> getting<00:05:47.500> out<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:47.890> maybe<00:05:48.070> 40%<00:05:48.790> speed

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
that's getting out to maybe 40% speed

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.790 
that's getting out to maybe 40% speed
seeing<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.390> gradual<00:05:53.550> buildup<00:05:54.550> of<00:05:55.560> garlic<00:05:56.560> as

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
seeing a gradual buildup of garlic as

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:11.700 
seeing a gradual buildup of garlic as
well<00:06:08.010> yes<00:06:09.010> obviously<00:06:09.220> if<00:06:09.820> your<00:06:10.000> players<00:06:10.710> begin

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
well yes obviously if your players begin

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.220 
well yes obviously if your players begin
losing<00:06:12.310> control<00:06:12.820> or<00:06:13.060> 40%<00:06:13.450> speed<00:06:14.020> then<00:06:14.200> you

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
losing control or 40% speed then you

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.020 
losing control or 40% speed then you
know<00:06:14.470> you<00:06:14.530> need<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.800> reduce<00:06:15.160> the<00:06:15.400> distance<00:06:15.820> to

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
know you need to reduce the distance to

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.390 
know you need to reduce the distance to
the<00:06:16.150> ball<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:16.630> go<00:06:17.050> back<00:06:17.260> to<00:06:17.500> mastering<00:06:18.190> this

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
the ball and go back to mastering this

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.460 
the ball and go back to mastering this
perfect<00:06:19.090> structure<00:06:19.540> on<00:06:19.720> middle<00:06:20.020> distance

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
perfect structure on middle distance

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.890 
perfect structure on middle distance
shots<00:06:20.770> rather<00:06:21.580> than<00:06:21.820> long<00:06:22.180> shots<00:06:22.510> but<00:06:22.720> by<00:06:22.840> the

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
shots rather than long shots but by the

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.960 
shots rather than long shots but by the
time<00:06:23.200> players<00:06:23.590> up<00:06:23.800> to<00:06:23.830> pink<00:06:24.160> level<00:06:24.550> in<00:06:24.730> the

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
manage a needs to a decent degree 50%

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:42.409 
manage a needs to a decent degree 50%
speed

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.360 

that's<00:06:43.419> finding<00:06:43.780> it<00:06:43.870> a<00:06:44.020> little<00:06:44.470> bit<00:06:44.710> harder<00:06:45.159> to

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
that's finding it a little bit harder to

00:06:45.370 --> 00:07:05.760 
that's finding it a little bit harder to
move<00:06:45.699> forwards

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.540 

yeah<00:07:06.770> I'll<00:07:06.950> say<00:07:07.250> that<00:07:07.430> 65<00:07:08.090> for<00:07:08.390> me<00:07:08.630> my<00:07:09.550> personal

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
yeah I'll say that 65 for me my personal

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.110 
yeah I'll say that 65 for me my personal
scale<00:07:11.150> I<00:07:11.950> mean<00:07:12.950> some<00:07:13.310> my<00:07:13.490> intention<00:07:13.970> was<00:07:14.090> to

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
scale I mean some my intention was to

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:29.530 
scale I mean some my intention was to
hit<00:07:14.360> 61<00:07:14.930> I<00:07:15.170> actually

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.540 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.170 

[Applause]

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.390 

so<00:07:36.170> again<00:07:36.320> it's<00:07:36.440> just<00:07:36.500> observing<00:07:37.100> all<00:07:37.280> the

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400 
so again it's just observing all the

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.160 
so again it's just observing all the
cueball<00:07:37.700> is<00:07:37.760> doing<00:07:38.150> at<00:07:38.240> these<00:07:38.390> individual

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.170 
cueball is doing at these individual

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.450 
cueball is doing at these individual
speeds<00:07:39.440> the<00:07:39.530> most<00:07:39.710> important<00:07:40.190> thing<00:07:40.310> is

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.460 
speeds the most important thing is

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.660 
speeds the most important thing is
hitting<00:07:41.180> h1<00:07:41.600> on<00:07:41.720> the<00:07:41.810> bottom<00:07:42.110> of<00:07:42.200> all<00:07:42.350> and<00:07:43.100> I'm

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:43.670 
hitting h1 on the bottom of all and I'm

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.110 
hitting h1 on the bottom of all and I'm
getting<00:07:44.140> accurate<00:07:45.140> so<00:07:45.650> Sekulow<00:07:46.550> can<00:07:46.790> do<00:07:47.060> to

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 
getting accurate so Sekulow can do to

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.230 
getting accurate so Sekulow can do to
speed<00:07:48.080> on<00:07:48.230> intending<00:07:48.650> to<00:07:48.830> play<00:07:50.230> drive
