00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.490

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.860
 well, clear and the most beautiful stork children 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:05.140
 already have huge hunger and ask 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:06.300
 where you stay you do not forget what something 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.190
 to eat 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.990
 I already have enough in my stomach 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.100
 I would do that for the little ones 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.770

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.190

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.190
 no backpack 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:33.469
 so it looks so from there I remain 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:41.780
 rather with my cake is like that 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:43.909

 a really great stork worked out 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:47.810
 but next time I come 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.289

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.289
