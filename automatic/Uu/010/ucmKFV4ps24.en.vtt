00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.380
 very good the kids welcome from 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.970
 channel I am a feature with a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.259
 new video in minecraft and as you will see 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.630
 in the title we are in a new 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:26.349
 tutorial a dye farm tutorial 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.660
 very cheap automatic and super 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.539
 compact I have not seen more compact the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.790
 moment farm and good is super 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.350
 fast others then first I have to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.839
 say that this only serves for vision 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.860
 1.7 from minecraft which is the last one that has 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.629
 come out and it only serves for these four 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.460
 for these four plants that are double 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.500
 As you can see they have two hits as you see 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.840
 they all have two and this helps us 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.620
 planted of the 1.7 in future versions 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.010
 I imagine that they only take one hit 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.600
 box is worth I take this here because this one 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 only occupies one for this only serves to 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 doubles and fox plants 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.980
 this plant has the property that if 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.190
 we apply one of bowler appears in mono 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.580
 they release a dye and they duplicate 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.500
 for the other and this if we apply several 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.080
 well not for infinite dye coming out 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.440
 ok then this I took it from it this 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.420
 idea and I've picked up let's catch it's by 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.030
 example since I have it and done this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.370
 cabin that is quite compact 6-3 of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.100
 high the good and three high three of 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.730
 wide and three long we would say though 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.330
 you are a square and it is super compact 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.310
 in super efficient and super fast and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.250
 well then we have to place in the middle 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.620
 the plant the loading dispensers 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.010
 of mobile as not this you can use although 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.690
 be here and hopper if you want it's worth not 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.310
 I know what you want to put hop is like this for 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.350
 load it for nothing and in my case I'm going to 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990
 use only the load of a dispenser 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.270
 which are 9 stacks of what's good in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.190
 this case are going to be bowling and good the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.750
 production of this is being a trunk 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.240
 It's worth for a double to put it here 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.240
 to easily fill a trunk 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.070
 double integer and this one we are going to fill this 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.220
 row here and this row I'm going to put 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.560
 so I'm not going to check it 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.210
 I'll leave a time lapse, I do not know, I can imagine 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.190
 how to put all the time what it takes 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.930
 and it's putting a stopwatch so that what 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.560
 look and nothing 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.560
 I leave you with the trailer 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.030
 ah 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.040
 d 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.190
 for me 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 ah 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.490
 that's why it 's up here 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.740
 perfect and if we apply here 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.540
 Well, not that we collect anything else so 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.320
 We are not going to buy when we have this 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.420
 around here as you see this trunk almost whole 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.310
 more than a third 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.590
 I would say two and two thirds that pussy are 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.540
 three- thirds has filled and this has 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.390
 Completely filled a double trunk 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.430
 complete and here is that two-thirds of 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.590
 a normal one because I do not know how long 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.050
 has sincerely delayed does not calculate 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.340
 still and well, I'm going to show you 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.400
 build them is very simple 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.770
 build very cheap also as I say and 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.620
 Very compact it this will work 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.050
 I always imagine I do not think I change it 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.090
 and well, we just take a 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.390
 block of 10 wells or embers block a 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.630
 block with grass 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.020
 and we put it like that 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.009
 torches here 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.060
 another here here and here it's worth this is 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
 important that you place them and this 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.990
 way because if they do not place it it's like that 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.690
 will work also how the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.849
 original that is the one that I have designed and 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.800
 here we will put the rest in all these 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.400
 let's put here putting the torch 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.810
 already or is it to turn it off then 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.190
 we would not have activated now 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.050
 just when I'm here we see how 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.169
 You see begin operating after 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.210
 activate then for this because here we put 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.129
 the plant in this case good because 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.860
 catch state here for example and the 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:01.500
 we would put there and with it the bowler hat 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.659
 because with rhythm love bone and kiwis here 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.060
 in the dispenser it would increase this and 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.580
 thus producing all the dyes 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.540
 that we want this then we can 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.790
 we put this way in this 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.030
 so it's good and then here for example 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.849
 Each state produces two stands of 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.009
 of dyes 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:24.249
 and nothing I hope you liked this 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:29.099
 video and give it to there are favorites and we 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:29.099
 we see in the next tutorial bye bye
