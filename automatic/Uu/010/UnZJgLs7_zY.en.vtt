00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.550
 we sleep falls back on the agreement of the major 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.699
 so we come to the second part which is therefore in minor mode 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.859
 we will start on the middle 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.310
 and the army part that is much more complex in plan by monique 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.849
 and therefore at the level of the left hand also who want that 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.489
 heavily involved 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:26.779
 because he has a lot of 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.410
 Passengers change at the level of harmonies with facade agreements 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.130
 transitions and transpositions 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.150
 so the transmission is that the melodic patterns the departures of 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.160
 transpose a little higher so 2009 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.370
 rafa diez civil 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.330
 as explained by jean-marie lemoine 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 in fact I'm trying their site 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.850
 the tone relative to washing 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 so the pattern is logical I'm here at the bar 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.710
 at 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.660
 at 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 the paris police 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.230
 if learning 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.420
 otherwise it's the same pattern and fun 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.430
 com 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.870
 they transcribe will also transpose on all harmonies that go 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.480
 with 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.250
 something also about the patients nice thing does 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.100
 composer 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 every day we will have direct access to a tour 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.580
 still 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.530
 % var 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.510
 there 1 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.700
 so these are the same the individual 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.890
 m but the American soil 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.460
 who are first financially at the end of the loire also say 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.180
 to try to maintain 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.820
 awareness 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 then all remaining if possible but the mythical 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 most sensitive music 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 before the informal truce 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200
 at 1000 m 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 the middle finger and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 the odious leader 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.380
 with a hundred students 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.409

 in India it's the fifth is dead without 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.859
 The results are in 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.859

 even though 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.859
 and here we understand 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.759
 to accompany this plan resumes the melody 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.399

 auditions of Paris so that it holds 6 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:21.879
 so this passenger appearing 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.959
 still happy 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.629
 she 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.629
 we do not have 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:30.599
 so he did 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.819
 after three patients in F minor this deep water 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.129

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.739
 here is the synopsis 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.839
 I agree 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:02.489
 it's a 17% deal with one-ninth of the flights and its place 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.279
 so it allows to resume and continue this drama but over a year 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.139
