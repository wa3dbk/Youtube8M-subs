00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
year's to finish fourth I think it was a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.180 
year's to finish fourth I think it was a
positive<00:02:26.910> season<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.200> way<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.830> missed<00:02:29.040> out

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
positive season the way we we missed out

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.890 
positive season the way we we missed out
on<00:02:29.220> Champions<00:02:29.489> League<00:02:29.880> was<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> absolute

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
on Champions League was a absolute

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.770 
on Champions League was a absolute
disaster<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.640> got<00:02:32.640> into<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.299> losing<00:02:33.630> that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
disaster and got into the to losing that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.509 
disaster and got into the to losing that
way<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.799> we've<00:02:34.950> gotta<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.280> again

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
way but you know we've gotta go again

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.190
