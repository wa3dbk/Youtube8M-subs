00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.640
 The Tiguan is not a real success story 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.710
 Everyday VW has already announced earlier this year that the second 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.880
 Generation in the summer will come to the dealership from the announcement center 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.119
 From February to mid-May, around 18,000 customers have signed up for the new Tiguan 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.470
 decided to have never seen or driven without a team 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.560
 Advance laurels get very few cars 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.480
 what has VW compared to the first generation can still improve the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.059
 Supply of assistance systems left as the first generation of the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.130
 compact suvs rolled to dealers in 2007, there was a possibility 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.840
 Detecting the automatic high beam Dynamic Light Assist and the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.210
 Lane Keeping Assisters do not come in the nineties yet 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.579
 Start-stop-automatic and an electronic differential lock 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.600
 rather, add off-road capability 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.990
 so the ears completely revised though both variants Werner two 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.610
 Variants once 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.440
 The e-variant Track recommends more on Roughrider and Beamer a lifestyle 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 her variant 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.310
 we both are adjusted about work from both the stern and the face 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.920
 now to our design line 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.700
 Because the whole vehicle will be stiffened altogether by the acoustician 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.159
 Revised form counteracted yes by the chassis revised percent of 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.159
 natural powertrain percent updated in particular 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.640
 in the direction of consumption but also made more powerful anyway 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.620
 less consumption 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.110
 The Tiguan is home on paved roads he can with a big 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.460
 Number of optional extras inside and outside according to the personal 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.770
 Taste and demands are already equipped the basis 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.470
 Equipment can be seen 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.620
 Berganfahrhilfe and a cd-radio are standard 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.010
 In terms of engines, there are seven engines to choose from four TASE engines 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.060
 between 122 and 210 hp are added three turbo diesels with 110 140 ounces 100 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.060
 and 70 hp z
