you know when you watch stuffs like that
you<00:04:28.000> know<00:04:28.150> but<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:29.470> was<00:04:29.590> interesting<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.480> it

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
you know but it was interesting and it

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.080 
you know but it was interesting and it
makes<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.780> realize<00:04:31.960> hey<00:04:32.470> maybe<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:33.220> shouldn't

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090

go<00:04:34.660> on<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.810> private<00:04:35.110> server<00:04:35.530> because<00:04:35.890> maybe

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
go on a private server because maybe

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.250 
go on a private server because maybe
 up<00:04:36.700> will<00:04:37.090> happen<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.630> this

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
 up will happen and this

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.120 
 up will happen and this
wasn't<00:04:38.500> even<00:04:38.830> more<00:04:39.400> up<00:04:39.550> because<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
wasn't even more up because the

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.670 
wasn't even more up because the
frickin<00:04:42.820> game<00:04:43.300> went<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.750> his<00:04:43.900> actual<00:04:44.380> TV

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
frickin game went to his actual TV

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.130 
frickin game went to his actual TV

escaped<00:04:54.310> text<00:04:54.730> box<00:04:54.910> right<00:04:55.210> there<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.660> that's

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
escaped text box right there and that's

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.710 
escaped text box right there and that's
pretty<00:04:56.770> freaky<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.730> it<00:04:58.060> went<00:04:58.270> away<00:04:58.510> from

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
pretty freaky that it it went away from

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.060 
pretty freaky that it it went away from
the<00:04:59.110> actual<00:04:59.530> computer<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.120> TV<00:05:01.540> screen

the actual computer to the TV screen

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.690 
the actual computer to the TV screen
really<00:05:03.070> interesting<00:05:03.610> actually<00:05:05.370> but<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.580> know

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
really interesting actually but you know

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.230 
really interesting actually but you know
the<00:05:07.390> length<00:05:07.600> was<00:05:08.380> rather<00:05:08.830> short<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.730> that's

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
the length was rather short and that's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.280 
the length was rather short and that's
the<00:05:10.330> only<00:05:10.510> thing<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.780> have<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:10.960> say<00:05:10.990> bad<00:05:11.260> about

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
the only thing I have to say bad about

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.100 
the only thing I have to say bad about
it<00:05:11.890> that<00:05:12.250> was<00:05:12.910> short<00:05:13.210> but<00:05:13.419> I<00:05:13.480> guess<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.870> kind<00:05:14.080> of

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
it that was short but I guess it kind of

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.290 
it that was short but I guess it kind of
worked<00:05:14.350> for<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.710> story<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:15.280> know<00:05:15.310> there<00:05:16.180> was

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
worked for the story you know there was

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.090 
worked for the story you know there was
a<00:05:16.330> neat<00:05:16.540> there<00:05:17.260> wasn't<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.590> need<00:05:17.740> for<00:05:17.919> anything

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
a neat there wasn't a need for anything

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.630 
a neat there wasn't a need for anything
afterwards<00:05:19.260> but<00:05:20.260> I<00:05:20.530> like<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.520> know

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
afterwards but I like this you know

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.630 
afterwards but I like this you know
there<00:05:22.090> isn't<00:05:22.419> much<00:05:23.220> World<00:05:24.220> of<00:05:24.400> Warcraft

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
creepypastas out there and the previous

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.620 
creepypastas out there and the previous
ones<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.400> read<00:05:27.610> were<00:05:27.850> actually<00:05:28.270> pretty<00:05:28.540> good

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
ones I read were actually pretty good

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.350

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
and this one was also pretty neat so I

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.680 
and this one was also pretty neat so I
honestly<00:05:35.800> thought<00:05:36.640> this<00:05:36.910> was<00:05:37.150> genuinely

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
creepy

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.340 
creepy
and<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:40.240> made<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.389> learn<00:05:41.600> thing<00:05:41.900> just<00:05:42.199> like
