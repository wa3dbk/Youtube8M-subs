I and Dave Thomas with cars dot com

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.410
when we review cars we look at things like fuel efficiency

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.360
reliability and safety to recommend cars
for different people

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.380
for some time car like the Corvette Z 06

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.840
threw all that out the window you may not 
tell just from looking but the Z 06 is

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.710
radically different than a regular
Corvette purse of the NBA and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.140
a prime the frame is awesome and
aluminum says lighter weight

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.210
miss check out the size of these tires
the from the back

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.559
one easy way to tell here behind Z06
rather than a regular Corvette is a size

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.250
that I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.760
the SX is a high-performance machine

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.980
when we say that we're not kidding has
505 horsepower 7 later and

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.370
it's all going to the rear wheel saloon
blame any 7 dealers for not letting a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.030
the casual walk and test drive it but
all I really need to do two felonies

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.920
with do that it in 2006

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.120
is not so high performance GM is
updating its entire fleet with better

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.660
and better in tears every year

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.520
but permit stuck somewhere in the last
decade so when you look at everything

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.170
inside

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.240
it kinda looks old but likely for
Corvette

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.830
everyone should be lookin our because
you can take the ZO six straight from

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.080
the street to the track

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.970
but Chevy is give me a little convenient
button right here

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.549
which was a Corvette from have a nanny
motor when you're on the street was

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.110
backtracking trolls on him

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.200
get some extra safety features he had it
once it turns out that traction control

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.720
system yet another time

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.189
and it goes into what they call
competitive driving the and that's for

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.890
the track that's for hardcore driving
the question is what would you do it 505

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.079
horsepower even 06 quarterback

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.100
and you really can't use all that
horsepower every day going from

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.619
point A to point B where really comes in
handy is

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.310
me on the highway you guys the path
anyone you want to in a split second

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.649
you can take honor as an off-ramp like
you're on a racetrack

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.680
it's just us a perm driving machine now

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.340
of course the best place to use this is
actually a real track that's a lot of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.110
drivers will do it 06 and now if in
going from home to the track and back on

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.679
a highway

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.840
there's simply no better car Naseem 106
can do

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.580
the question is who recommended yeah we
recommend when I take

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.610
speeding ticket yellow here your color
choice black or blue collar

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.790
that but for the money seventy thousand
dollars and the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.870
performance there is in a better buy out
