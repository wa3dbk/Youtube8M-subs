this<00:01:06.229> particular<00:01:06.680> shift<00:01:07.100> assembly<00:01:07.580> is<00:01:07.759> what

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
this particular shift assembly is what

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.999 
this particular shift assembly is what
obviously<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.570> gives<00:01:08.750> not<00:01:09.289> sits<00:01:09.590> on<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.800> top

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
obviously that gives not sits on the top

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.499 
obviously that gives not sits on the top
obviously<00:01:10.220> changing<00:01:10.850> gears<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.180> everybody

obviously changing gears that everybody
loves<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.170> hate<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:13.520> particular<00:01:13.850> one<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.539> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
loves to hate this particular one is the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.820 
loves to hate this particular one is the
fact<00:01:14.990> which<00:01:15.140> then<00:01:15.320> while<00:01:15.530> we've<00:01:15.680> already

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
fact which then while we've already

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.460 
fact which then while we've already
fitted<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.340> new<00:01:16.520> STI<00:01:17.030> short<00:01:17.600> shift<00:01:17.869> kit<00:01:18.140> and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
fitted the new STI short shift kit and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.440 
fitted the new STI short shift kit and
what<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.070> want<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.310> do<00:01:19.400> today<00:01:19.549> is<00:01:19.939> show<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.270> what

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
what I want to do today is show you what

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.539 
what I want to do today is show you what
we're<00:01:20.840> actually<00:01:20.990> doing<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.590> hit<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.130> this

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
we're actually doing to hit it so this

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.980 
we're actually doing to hit it so this
is<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.790> whole<00:01:23.090> mechanism<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.689> can<00:01:23.810> sort<00:01:23.960> of

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
is the whole mechanism you can sort of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.300 
is the whole mechanism you can sort of
get<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.140> bit<00:01:24.260> of<00:01:24.380> an<00:01:24.439> idea<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.830> why<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.130> such<00:01:25.280> a

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
get a bit of an idea of why it's such a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.310 
get a bit of an idea of why it's such a
major<00:01:25.640> job<00:01:25.970> this<00:01:26.210> part<00:01:26.540> has<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.869> come<00:01:27.049> out<00:01:27.080> from

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
major job this part has to come out from

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.350 
major job this part has to come out from
underneath<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.860> car<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:28.640> obviously<00:01:29.090> is

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
underneath the car this obviously is

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.810 
underneath the car this obviously is
from<00:01:29.689> inside<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.380> car<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.159> whole<00:01:31.310> trim<00:01:31.670> and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
from inside the car the whole trim and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.910 
from inside the car the whole trim and
console<00:01:32.240> area<00:01:32.570> has<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.869> be<00:01:32.960> removed<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.590> of

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
console area has to be removed and of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.100 
console area has to be removed and of
course<00:01:34.159> you've<00:01:34.610> got<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.820> reverse<00:01:35.600> lockout

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
course you've got the reverse lockout

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.499 
course you've got the reverse lockout
and<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.950> way<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.250> mechanism<00:01:37.759> moves<00:01:37.970> there<00:01:38.210> so

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
and the way the mechanism moves there so

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.810 
and the way the mechanism moves there so
that<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.560> effectively<00:01:40.009> what<00:01:40.340> comes<00:01:40.610> in<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
that is effectively what comes in the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.429 
that is effectively what comes in the
kit<00:01:40.939> what<00:01:41.630> I'll<00:01:41.750> do<00:01:41.900> now<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.170> we'll<00:01:42.409> come

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
kit what I'll do now is we'll come

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.020 
kit what I'll do now is we'll come
underneath<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.950> car<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.490> we'll<00:01:43.790> show<00:01:44.000> you

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
underneath the car and we'll show you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.609 
underneath the car and we'll show you
what<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:44.360> looks<00:01:44.540> like<00:01:44.720> under<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.200> car<00:01:45.409> and

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
what it looks like under the car and

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.870 
what it looks like under the car and
then<00:01:45.770> finally<00:01:46.189> what<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.490> was

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
then finally what it was

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.410 
then finally what it was
on<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.030> top<00:01:54.579> raucous<00:01:55.579> underneath<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.210> car

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
on the top raucous underneath the car

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.450

and<00:01:56.689> this<00:01:56.930> is<00:01:57.049> particularly<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.829> part<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.369> the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
and this is particularly a part of the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.289 
and this is particularly a part of the
area<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.729> you've<00:01:58.820> got<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.000> get<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
area that you've got to get to the

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.730 
area that you've got to get to the
bottom<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.689> structure<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.229> see<00:02:00.380> me<00:02:00.439> forget

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
bottom of the structure to see me forget

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.990 
bottom of the structure to see me forget
my<00:02:00.860> cameraman<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.369> come<00:02:01.549> around<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.850> can

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
my cameraman to come around you can

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.580 
my cameraman to come around you can
actually<00:02:02.090> have<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> look<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.229> I'll<00:02:03.350> show<00:02:03.530> you

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
actually have a look and I'll show you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.230 
actually have a look and I'll show you
some<00:02:03.799> still<00:02:04.070> photos<00:02:04.100> but<00:02:04.610> up<00:02:04.729> around<00:02:04.939> here

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
some still photos but up around here

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.480 
some still photos but up around here
above<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.659> tail-shaft<00:02:05.929> is<00:02:06.860> where<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> bottom

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
above the tail-shaft is where the bottom

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.279 
above the tail-shaft is where the bottom
of<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.640> shift<00:02:07.850> mechanism<00:02:08.000> comes<00:02:08.599> down<00:02:08.989> and

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
of the shift mechanism comes down and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.870 
of the shift mechanism comes down and
connects<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.190> cables<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.789> everything

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
connects to the cables and everything

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.600 
connects to the cables and everything
from<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.510> bottom<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.930> floor<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:13.489> can

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
from the bottom of the floor and you can

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.930 
from the bottom of the floor and you can
actually<00:02:13.760> remove<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:15.380> heat<00:02:15.739> shield<00:02:16.069> which

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
actually remove this heat shield which

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.210 
actually remove this heat shield which
sits<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:19.430> access<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.910> part<00:02:20.360> above

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
sits up in here to access the part above

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.410 
sits up in here to access the part above
and<00:02:22.220> obviously<00:02:22.730> that's<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.090> makes<00:02:23.269> it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and obviously that's what makes it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.539 
and obviously that's what makes it
complicated<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:24.019> down<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.319> bottom<00:02:24.440> here<00:02:24.620> but

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
complicated is down the bottom here but

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.800 
complicated is down the bottom here but
you've<00:02:25.730> got<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.910> disconnect<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.660> then

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
you've got a disconnect and then

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.140 
you've got a disconnect and then
reconnect<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.470> cables<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.700> connect<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
reconnect the cables that connect the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.979 
reconnect the cables that connect the
gearshift<00:02:29.599> assembly<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.620> transmission

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.729 

so<00:02:38.989> we<00:02:39.079> finished<00:02:39.410> fitting<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:40.390> Subaru<00:02:41.390> STi

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
so we finished fitting the Subaru STi

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.800 
so we finished fitting the Subaru STi
short<00:02:42.739> ship<00:02:42.980> assembly<00:02:43.519> on<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.420> car<00:02:44.660> we're

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
short ship assembly on the car we're

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.780 
short ship assembly on the car we're
going<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.989> take<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.349> for<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> spin<00:02:45.620> now<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:47.230> just

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
going to take it for a spin now and just

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.350 
going to take it for a spin now and just
see<00:02:50.510> our<00:02:50.540> different<00:02:50.810> fields<00:02:51.909> as<00:02:52.909> we<00:02:53.120> spoke

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
see our different fields as we spoke

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.640 
see our different fields as we spoke
before<00:02:53.480> everybody's<00:02:54.019> complaint<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.620> that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
before everybody's complaint is that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.400 
before everybody's complaint is that
this<00:02:55.010> short<00:02:55.310> shift<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.760> just

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.680 

what<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.220> necessary<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.970> dramatically

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
what is necessary to dramatically

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.740 
what is necessary to dramatically
improve<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.050> car<00:03:02.210> whereas<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.330> original

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
improve the car whereas the original

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.970 
improve the car whereas the original
factory<00:03:03.990> one<00:03:04.380> with<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:06.440> that's<00:03:07.440> fitted<00:03:07.800> like

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
factory one with the that's fitted like

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.880 
factory one with the that's fitted like
steering<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.460> big<00:03:08.640> ball<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> jelly<00:03:10.140> which<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.740> was

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
steering a big ball of jelly which I was

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.490 
steering a big ball of jelly which I was
very<00:03:10.920> critical<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.790> my<00:03:11.940> other<00:03:12.150> road<00:03:13.140> test

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
very critical in in my other road test

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.730 
very critical in in my other road test
and<00:03:16.070> just<00:03:17.070> initial<00:03:18.200> opinion<00:03:19.200> driving<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.710> now

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
and just initial opinion driving it now

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.050 
and just initial opinion driving it now
is<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.400> certainly<00:03:21.980> feels<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.130> lot<00:03:23.280> more<00:03:23.550> direct

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.500 

and<00:03:27.340> obviously<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.760> would<00:03:28.850> expect<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.330> be

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
and obviously you would expect it to be

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.400 
and obviously you would expect it to be
a<00:03:29.540> lot<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.900> little<00:03:30.140> bit<00:03:30.230> more<00:03:30.410> nachi<00:03:30.650> example

fairly major installation job as far as

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.700 
fairly major installation job as far as
fitting<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.750> not<00:03:37.900> like<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.230> gym<00:03:38.440> these

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
fitting it's not like the gym these

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.260 
fitting it's not like the gym these
short<00:03:38.980> shifts<00:03:39.340> which<00:03:39.520> unfortunately<00:03:39.850> not

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
short shifts which unfortunately not

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.330 
short shifts which unfortunately not
available<00:03:40.690> for<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:40.930> model<00:03:41.200> which<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.650> nice

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
available for this model which is nice

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.030 
available for this model which is nice
and<00:03:42.550> quick<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.820> easy<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.150> fit<00:03:43.390> but<00:03:43.920> from<00:03:44.920> a

and quick and easy to fit but from a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.890 
and quick and easy to fit but from a
performance<00:03:45.640> touring-car<00:03:46.180> point<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.750> view<00:03:46.840> I

performance touring-car point of view I

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.490 
performance touring-car point of view I
think<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.470> probably<00:03:47.680> worth<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.640> um

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.260 

let's<00:03:52.070> be<00:03:52.190> honest<00:03:52.430> it's<00:03:52.580> all<00:03:52.700> about<00:03:52.910> what<00:03:53.120> you

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
let's be honest it's all about what you

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.940 
let's be honest it's all about what you
think<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.690> what<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.470> depending<00:03:54.860> on

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
think and what you like and depending on

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.590 
think and what you like and depending on
how<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.220> drive<00:03:55.430> your<00:03:55.700> car<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.180> what<00:03:56.330> means

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
how you drive your car and what means

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.970 
how you drive your car and what means
the<00:03:56.750> most<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:57.020> you<00:03:57.140> most<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.500> people<00:03:57.830> watching

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
the most to you most of people watching

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.750 
the most to you most of people watching
or<00:03:58.220> probably<00:03:58.460> driving<00:03:59.450> a<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:01.010> auto<00:04:01.190> version

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
or probably driving a the auto version

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.280 
or probably driving a the auto version
because<00:04:01.940> Supra<00:04:02.360> sell<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.630> lot<00:04:02.810> more<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.170> auto

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
because Supra sell a lot more the auto

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.580 
because Supra sell a lot more the auto
version<00:04:03.920> Liberty<00:04:04.550> GTS<00:04:05.090> than<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.600> six-speed

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
version Liberty GTS than the six-speed

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.480 
version Liberty GTS than the six-speed
manual<00:04:06.620> versions<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:08.980> there<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.070> have<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.280> the
