00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.280
 to all the generation to watch soap operas 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.009

 child pastor the only one who had a 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.520
 certain friendship relationship with the one 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.020
 the water spoke the sullen of the angels 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.690
 attention these bucolic landscapes 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.520
 certain murals hey incredible we're 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.220
 watching a cartoon please if it is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 I did not say them I apologize that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.260
 became a box office phenomenon in 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.360
 the whole world the cartoons 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.300
 Japanese were not exported until they 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.950
 nascent and when it appears this starts 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.500
 an insatiable appetite until the day of 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.980
 today to understand the Japanese series and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.090
 find that the best scripts and 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.180
 how much could he get 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.129
 in product with a cartoon and this 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.340
 it was the first great winning example of 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.650
 all the free planes lady di la 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.110
 princess lady disappeared 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.989
 diana said that one of the things that most 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.980
 they liked in their life to have seen in it 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.450
 heim charged fanatic but she 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.629
 obviously with the freedom that promotes 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.629
 obviously these landscapes last 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.629
 debauchery 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.250
 but obviously something revolutionary but 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.380
 notice that there is no evil is only 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.360
 take off your clothes to walk as much as 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.780
 because I peddle anyone with his pants 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.030
 patched but I needed the face of 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.870
 rich me not because not what he rescues 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.420
 from this teaches he was trading his fund of 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.250
 the table and have a straw bed or 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.780
 does not want to come back as well as what they eat 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.150
 horses with at least one fabra 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.640
 and lie down in the barn 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.159
 Mira was a clean healthy life but 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.700
 attention let's see for the first time 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.370
 grandfather who reject them and says arrives 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.280

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.760
 heidi 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.530
 it's true the other did a chapter in 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.109
 the one that fell through a gorge in the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.390
 cart and he is the tree in dad's 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:47.959
 apartheid and that's why perhaps in a 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.959
 accident 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.239
 the grandfather and then I learned to love 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.849
 It is the obligation of water 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.650
 quarter 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.629

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.919
 accompanied these aunts that charge when 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:44.020
 died in the parents but now it's turn 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.560
 of the grandfather and think that he has left the 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.560
 clothes boots 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.639
