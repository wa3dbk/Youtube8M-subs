which my son now normally need to

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.060 
which my son now normally need to
connect<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.460> more<00:02:11.670> bar<00:02:15.440> okay<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.740> symbol

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
connect one more bar okay so that symbol

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.860 
connect one more bar okay so that symbol
of<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.220> track<00:02:17.460> is<00:02:17.670> complete<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.360> takes<00:02:18.600> no

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
of the track is complete it takes no

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.540 
of the track is complete it takes no
more<00:02:19.140> than<00:02:19.200> two<00:02:19.440> minutes<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.190> pretty

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
more than two minutes and it's pretty

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.730 
more than two minutes and it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:21.030> all<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.050> wheels<00:02:22.260> move

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
straightforward all the wheels move

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.199 
straightforward all the wheels move
independently<00:02:23.340> which<00:02:23.580> means<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.180> use

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
independently which means you can use

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.940 
independently which means you can use
this<00:02:24.480> tool<00:02:24.690> not<00:02:24.900> only<00:02:25.260> with<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> straight<00:02:25.740> track

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
this tool not only with a straight track

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.510 
this tool not only with a straight track
but<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.880> any<00:02:27.180> curved<00:02:27.570> track<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:29.070> might<00:02:29.250> want

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
but with any curved track you might want

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.880 
but with any curved track you might want
to<00:02:29.580> use<00:02:29.790> I'll<00:02:30.180> put<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.600> rag<00:02:31.020> or<00:02:31.230> flexible<00:02:31.650> track

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
to use I'll put a rag or flexible track

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.920 
to use I'll put a rag or flexible track
which<00:02:32.100> I'll<00:02:32.250> show<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.459> later<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.660> dolly

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
which I'll show you later and this dolly

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.530 
which I'll show you later and this dolly
works<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.770> perfectly<00:02:35.370> next<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.300> let

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
works with it just perfectly next up let

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.770 
works with it just perfectly next up let
me<00:02:36.660> set<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.170> straight<00:02:37.410> track<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.420> these<00:02:39.570> are

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
me set up a straight track so these are

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.390 
me set up a straight track so these are
the<00:02:39.840> bar<00:02:40.050> ends<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:42.410> key<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.770> connect<00:02:44.040> everything

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the bar ends a key to connect everything

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:55.630 
the bar ends a key to connect everything
together

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.850 

so<00:02:56.640> my<00:02:56.790> thought<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:56.970> ready<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:58.470> took<00:02:58.590> me<00:02:58.680> about

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
so my thought is ready it took me about

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.460 
so my thought is ready it took me about
10<00:02:59.070> minutes<00:02:59.280> or<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.870> assemble<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> whole

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
10 minutes or so to assemble the whole

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.830 
10 minutes or so to assemble the whole
thing<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.580> ever<00:03:02.700> had<00:03:02.850> anyone<00:03:03.060> helping<00:03:03.540> me<00:03:03.690> it

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
thing you ever had anyone helping me it

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.080 
thing you ever had anyone helping me it
probably<00:03:04.140> would<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.320> about<00:03:04.620> five<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.940> it's

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
probably would be about five so it's

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.280 
probably would be about five so it's
really<00:03:06.240> not<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> big<00:03:06.690> deal

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
really not a big deal

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.500 
really not a big deal
using<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.220> Dalek<00:03:08.520> for<00:03:08.670> your<00:03:08.760> shoot<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.210> really

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
using a Dalek for your shoot I really

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.790 
using a Dalek for your shoot I really
like<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.050> lot<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.200> sliders<00:03:10.500> which

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
like that it's a lot of sliders which

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.160 
like that it's a lot of sliders which
are<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.100> easy<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.640> assemble<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.660> transport

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
are so easy to assemble and transport

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.950 
are so easy to assemble and transport
but<00:03:13.800> assembling<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:14.550> dolly<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.330> really<00:03:15.840> not

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
but assembling this dolly is really not

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.930 
but assembling this dolly is really not
a<00:03:16.020> big<00:03:16.200> deal<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.860> be<00:03:17.010> used<00:03:17.220> much<00:03:17.910> more

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
a big deal and can be used much more

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.370 
a big deal and can be used much more
often<00:03:18.330> than<00:03:18.540> one<00:03:18.840> would<00:03:19.020> think

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
often than one would think

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.290 
often than one would think
so<00:03:19.770> let<00:03:19.920> me<00:03:19.950> now<00:03:20.190> stick<00:03:20.460> a<00:03:20.550> tripod<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:21.150> this

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
so let me now stick a tripod on this

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.210 
so let me now stick a tripod on this
thing<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.690> choose<00:03:21.900> some<00:03:22.110> test<00:03:22.350> footage<00:03:22.410> one

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
thing and choose some test footage one

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.610 
thing and choose some test footage one
of<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.550> big<00:03:24.030> advantages<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.660> using<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:25.080> dolly

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
of the big advantages of using a dolly

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.950 
of the big advantages of using a dolly
rather<00:03:25.830> than<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.400> slider<00:03:27.210> is<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.780> can

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
rather than a slider is that you can

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.650 
rather than a slider is that you can
really<00:03:28.260> make<00:03:28.530> dramatic<00:03:29.010> movements<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.480> I'm

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
really make dramatic movements if I'm

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.090 
really make dramatic movements if I'm
not<00:03:30.750> mistaking<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.290> truck<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.710> three<00:03:31.950> meters

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
not mistaking this truck is three meters

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.000 
not mistaking this truck is three meters
long<00:03:32.490> which<00:03:33.270> is<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.660> much<00:03:33.840> longer<00:03:34.140> than<00:03:34.770> most

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
long which is so much longer than most

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.710 
long which is so much longer than most
of<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.460> sliders<00:03:35.850> you'll<00:03:36.060> find<00:03:36.330> on<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.540> market

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
of the sliders you'll find on the market

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.530 
of the sliders you'll find on the market
let<00:03:37.260> me<00:03:37.350> now<00:03:37.470> try<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:38.010> pulling<00:03:38.400> in<00:03:38.730> short<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
let me now try this pulling in short and

00:03:39.540 --> 00:04:45.130 
let me now try this pulling in short and
let's<00:03:40.200> see<00:03:40.410> what<00:03:40.770> its<00:03:40.890> gonna<00:03:41.070> look<00:03:41.340> like

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.630

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
with my dolly this is basically a rubber

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.020 
with my dolly this is basically a rubber
tube<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.530> can<00:04:52.710> be<00:04:52.830> positioned<00:04:53.100> in<00:04:53.430> any<00:04:53.790> way

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.080 
through some good and bad points of
using<00:06:37.630> such<00:06:37.840> dolly<00:06:38.140> over<00:06:38.710> let's<00:06:39.280> say<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.700> DSLR

using such dolly over let's say a DSLR

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.820 
using such dolly over let's say a DSLR
slider<00:06:40.390> I<00:06:40.630> really<00:06:40.870> love<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.110> sliders<00:06:41.530> on<00:06:41.680> how

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
slider I really love the sliders on how

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.320 
slider I really love the sliders on how
portable<00:06:42.310> they<00:06:42.430> are<00:06:42.580> you<00:06:42.850> can<00:06:43.030> put<00:06:43.210> them

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
portable they are you can put them

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330 
portable they are you can put them
anywhere<00:06:43.480> and<00:06:44.050> you<00:06:44.290> can<00:06:44.440> create<00:06:44.650> some<00:06:44.770> really

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
anywhere and you can create some really

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.610 
anywhere and you can create some really
amazing<00:06:45.730> images<00:06:46.120> when<00:06:46.330> used<00:06:46.540> properly<00:06:46.630> but

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
amazing images when used properly but

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.740 
amazing images when used properly but
they<00:06:47.740> are<00:06:47.830> limited<00:06:48.250> by<00:06:48.430> the<00:06:48.490> length<00:06:48.730> and<00:06:49.060> by

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
they are limited by the length and by

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.500 
they are limited by the length and by
the<00:06:49.810> weight<00:06:50.080> that<00:06:50.530> they<00:06:50.770> can<00:06:50.950> handle<00:06:51.480> with<00:06:52.480> a

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
the weight that they can handle with a

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.440 
the weight that they can handle with a
dolly<00:06:52.750> another<00:06:53.050> hand<00:06:53.380> you<00:06:53.650> can<00:06:54.550> put<00:06:54.820> a<00:06:55.030> lot<00:06:55.300> of

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
dolly another hand you can put a lot of

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.440 
dolly another hand you can put a lot of
weight<00:06:56.040> not<00:06:57.040> just<00:06:57.340> a<00:06:57.490> basic<00:06:57.730> vehicle<00:06:58.060> that<00:06:58.420> I

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
weight not just a basic vehicle that I

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.020 
weight not just a basic vehicle that I
have<00:06:58.720> here<00:06:58.990> but<00:06:59.800> you<00:07:00.010> can<00:07:00.160> have<00:07:00.370> a<00:07:00.550> monitor

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
have here but you can have a monitor

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.480 
have here but you can have a monitor
rails<00:07:01.330> follow<00:07:01.690> focus<00:07:01.930> anything<00:07:02.890> you<00:07:03.010> want<00:07:03.250> and

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
rails follow focus anything you want and

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.840 
rails follow focus anything you want and
I<00:07:04.360> think<00:07:04.390> the<00:07:05.380> way<00:07:05.530> it<00:07:05.590> actually<00:07:05.770> adds<00:07:06.340> more

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
I think the way it actually adds more

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.180 
I think the way it actually adds more
stability<00:07:07.540> to<00:07:07.960> this<00:07:08.110> ring<00:07:08.380> also<00:07:08.920> with<00:07:09.070> the

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
stability to this ring also with the

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.950 
stability to this ring also with the
dolly<00:07:09.400> your<00:07:09.640> movement<00:07:10.030> is<00:07:10.180> only<00:07:10.390> limited<00:07:10.690> by

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
dolly your movement is only limited by

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.680 
dolly your movement is only limited by
the<00:07:11.080> length<00:07:11.410> of<00:07:11.650> your<00:07:11.860> track<00:07:12.420> my<00:07:13.420> straight

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
the length of your track my straight

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.630 
the length of your track my straight
track<00:07:13.990> I<00:07:14.200> think<00:07:14.230> is<00:07:14.680> 3<00:07:14.920> meters<00:07:15.280> and<00:07:15.310> this

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
track I think is 3 meters and this

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.570 
track I think is 3 meters and this
flexible<00:07:16.120> one<00:07:16.390> is<00:07:16.780> also<00:07:17.230> are<00:07:17.380> 3<00:07:17.590> meters<00:07:17.740> so<00:07:18.520> I

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
flexible one is also are 3 meters so I

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.940 
flexible one is also are 3 meters so I
can<00:07:18.730> create<00:07:19.090> a<00:07:19.330> really<00:07:19.600> strong<00:07:19.750> movement<00:07:20.710> that

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
can create a really strong movement that

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.190 
can create a really strong movement that
adds<00:07:21.190> a<00:07:21.310> lot<00:07:21.400> of<00:07:21.460> production<00:07:21.910> value<00:07:22.020> this<00:07:23.020> doll

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
adds a lot of production value this doll

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.960 
adds a lot of production value this doll
is<00:07:23.320> more<00:07:23.560> expensive<00:07:23.860> than<00:07:24.190> your<00:07:24.340> average<00:07:24.640> just

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
is more expensive than your average just

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.760 
is more expensive than your average just
large<00:07:25.240> slider<00:07:25.540> but<00:07:25.870> I<00:07:25.900> think<00:07:26.140> it's<00:07:26.290> one<00:07:26.590> of<00:07:26.620> the

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.770 
large slider but I think it's one of the

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.170 
large slider but I think it's one of the
cheapest<00:07:27.070> dollies<00:07:27.370> that<00:07:27.400> you<00:07:27.580> can<00:07:27.700> get<00:07:27.940> I

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180 
cheapest dollies that you can get I

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.030 
cheapest dollies that you can get I
highly<00:07:28.930> recommend<00:07:29.320> it<00:07:29.440> especially<00:07:29.560> if<00:07:29.950> you

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040 
highly recommend it especially if you

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.560 
highly recommend it especially if you
want<00:07:30.220> to<00:07:30.280> add<00:07:30.430> some<00:07:30.670> really<00:07:30.850> nice<00:07:31.090> shots<00:07:31.330> there

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.570 
want to add some really nice shots there
