00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to know how much dough to use well it's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
to know how much dough to use well it's
easy<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.510> tear<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> piece<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.590> roughly

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
easy you tear off a piece that's roughly

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.340 
easy you tear off a piece that's roughly
the<00:01:41.130> same<00:01:41.310> size<00:01:41.580> as<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.540> ball<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> cheese<00:01:43.320> just

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the same size as the ball of cheese just

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.950 
the same size as the ball of cheese just
kind<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:43.920> eyeball<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.720> about

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
kind of eyeball it if it's if it's about

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.030 
kind of eyeball it if it's if it's about
the<00:01:46.080> same<00:01:46.290> that'll<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.830> enough<00:01:47.040> though

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the same that'll be enough though

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
the same that'll be enough though
so<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.369> our<00:01:50.689> dough

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
so we have our dough

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
so we have our dough
we're<00:01:52.200> flattening<00:01:52.650> out<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> disc<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
we're flattening out to a disc on a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.920 
we're flattening out to a disc on a
floured<00:01:54.060> board<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.780> work<00:01:55.290> surface<00:01:55.470> anyway<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
floured board or work surface anyway and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.380 
floured board or work surface anyway and
we're<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.080> use<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> rolling<00:01:58.470> pin<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.390> get

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
we're going to use a rolling pin and get

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.800 
we're going to use a rolling pin and get
this<00:02:00.630> too<00:02:04.369> once<00:02:05.369> we've<00:02:05.580> got<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.479> set<00:02:06.689> up

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this too once we've got this the set up

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.009 
this too once we've got this the set up
this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.640> 150<00:02:08.640> grams<00:02:08.909> of<00:02:09.119> cheese<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.869> when

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
this is a 150 grams of cheese that when

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.869 
this is a 150 grams of cheese that when
I<00:02:10.049> do<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.679> need<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> begin<00:02:11.370> folding

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
I do it and now we need to begin folding

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.140 
I do it and now we need to begin folding
this<00:02:12.209> into<00:02:12.870> what's<00:02:13.019> called<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.349> top<00:02:14.250> knot<00:02:14.489> so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
this into what's called a top knot so

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.809 
this into what's called a top knot so
I'm<00:02:16.019> going<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> take<00:02:16.409> this<00:02:16.590> begin<00:02:17.280> pinching<00:02:17.730> it

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
I'm going to take this begin pinching it

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.490 
I'm going to take this begin pinching it
around<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.480> don't<00:02:18.659> have<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.959> super

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
around you don't have to be super

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
around you don't have to be super
careful<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.129> it's<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.579> not<00:02:20.790> like

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
careful with this it's it's not like

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.479 
careful with this it's it's not like
making<00:02:21.810> some<00:02:22.049> grits<00:02:22.290> where<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:23.010> important

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
making some grits where it's important

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.680 
making some grits where it's important
to<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.270> very<00:02:25.050> very<00:02:25.349> neat<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.069> is

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
to be very very neat because this is

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.500 
to be very very neat because this is
end<00:02:26.810> up<00:02:26.900> getting<00:02:27.170> flattened<00:02:27.650> down<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.510> what

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
end up getting flattened down and what

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.000 
end up getting flattened down and what
we're<00:02:29.630> working<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:30.080> right<00:02:30.110> now<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> bottom

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
we're working on right now is the bottom

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.430 
we're working on right now is the bottom
side<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.300> really<00:02:32.780> isn't<00:02:32.960> going<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.260> show

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
side so it really isn't going to show

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.170 
side so it really isn't going to show
anyway<00:02:33.800> but<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.310> do<00:02:34.430> need<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.670> have<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.940> good

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
anyway but you do need to have a good

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.140 
anyway but you do need to have a good
solid<00:02:35.720> seal<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:38.000> it's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
solid seal on this so that when it's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.960 
solid seal on this so that when it's
cooking<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.870> cheese<00:02:39.140> won't<00:02:39.350> run<00:02:39.650> out<00:02:39.970> that

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
cooking the cheese won't run out that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.990 
cooking the cheese won't run out that
will<00:02:41.180> not<00:02:41.390> be<00:02:41.600> good<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:46.370> once<00:02:46.550> we've<00:02:46.700> got<00:02:46.730> all

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
will not be good so once we've got all

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.320 
will not be good so once we've got all
this<00:02:47.270> gathered<00:02:47.810> together<00:02:48.170> here<00:02:48.410> at<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> top

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
this gathered together here at the top

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.990 
this gathered together here at the top
pinched<00:02:50.330> into<00:02:51.310> solid<00:02:52.310> unit<00:02:52.610> now<00:02:52.760> we're<00:02:52.880> going

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
pinched into solid unit now we're going

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.370 
pinched into solid unit now we're going
to<00:02:53.060> start<00:02:53.210> flattening<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.780> down<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.750> little

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
to start flattening it down and a little

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.030 
to start flattening it down and a little
bit<00:02:57.560> flat<00:02:58.000> will<00:02:59.000> bit<00:02:59.120> more<00:02:59.270> flour<00:02:59.570> and<00:03:00.040> start

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
bit flat will bit more flour and start

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.940 
bit flat will bit more flour and start
flattening<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.550> from<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.820> other<00:03:01.940> side<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
flattening it from the other side and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.920 
flattening it from the other side and
you<00:03:03.950> may<00:03:04.070> discover<00:03:04.460> this<00:03:04.700> little<00:03:05.210> pockets<00:03:05.780> of

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
you may discover this little pockets of

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.620 
you may discover this little pockets of
air<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.350> here<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:08.030> may<00:03:08.150> not<00:03:08.300> be<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> good

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
air in here that that may not be a good

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.140 
air in here that that may not be a good
thing<00:03:08.690> okay<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:10.310> might<00:03:10.430> have<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.700> do<00:03:10.880> is

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
thing okay so you might have to do is

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.710 
thing okay so you might have to do is
take<00:03:11.390> some<00:03:12.260> kind<00:03:12.710> of<00:03:12.830> dowel<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.340> little<00:03:14.210> knife

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
take some kind of dowel a little knife

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.630 
take some kind of dowel a little knife
or<00:03:15.050> something<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.620> poke<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.980> hole<00:03:16.130> in<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.490> and

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
or something and poke the hole in it and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.820 
or something and poke the hole in it and
press<00:03:17.450> all<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.780> air<00:03:17.930> out<00:03:17.960> this<00:03:18.410> will<00:03:18.590> seal

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
press all that air out this will seal

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.700 
press all that air out this will seal
itself<00:03:19.070> again<00:03:19.580> anyway<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.540> cooking<00:03:20.900> so

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
itself again anyway as it's cooking so

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.350 
itself again anyway as it's cooking so
your<00:03:21.860> idea<00:03:22.130> here<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.030> want<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.210> make

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
your idea here is that you want to make

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.020 
your idea here is that you want to make
this<00:03:23.950> round<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:26.230> even<00:03:27.460> if<00:03:28.460> you<00:03:28.580> absolutely

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
this round and even if you absolutely

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.010 
this round and even if you absolutely
want<00:03:29.270> to<00:03:29.360> have<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.930> back<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> seal<00:03:30.650> one

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
want to have the back of the seal one

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.140 
want to have the back of the seal one
and<00:03:33.020> once<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.830> got<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.280> point<00:03:34.640> now

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.310 

you<00:03:38.150> can<00:03:38.270> start<00:03:38.570> kneading<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> pan<00:03:39.170> with

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
you can start kneading the pan with

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.620 
you can start kneading the pan with
butter<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.770> we<00:03:40.310> have<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.459> pan<00:03:40.730> over<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.570> medium

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
butter and we have a pan over a medium

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.920 
butter and we have a pan over a medium
heat<00:03:42.200> on<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> still<00:03:42.800> one<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.280> ten<00:03:43.610> it's<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.910> six<00:03:44.239> so

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
heat on a still one to ten it's a six so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.199 
heat on a still one to ten it's a six so
it's<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.560> close<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.520> medium<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.880> little<00:03:47.090> bit

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
it's a close to medium a little bit

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.900 
it's a close to medium a little bit
harder<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.480> medium<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:47.900> we're<00:03:48.470> melting

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
harder to medium and we're melting

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.830 
harder to medium and we're melting
approximately<00:03:49.910> an<00:03:50.000> ounce<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.360> butter<00:03:50.570> into

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
approximately an ounce of butter into

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.479 
approximately an ounce of butter into
this<00:03:51.080> forward<00:03:51.890> proceed

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
this forward proceed

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.110 
this forward proceed
the<00:03:52.640> butter<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:52.940> melted<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:54.410> can<00:03:54.470> see<00:03:55.120> little

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the butter is melted you can see little

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.420 
the butter is melted you can see little
bubbles<00:03:56.300> coming<00:03:56.540> up<00:03:56.870> out<00:03:57.050> of<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.560> now

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
bubbles coming up out of it and now

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.000 
bubbles coming up out of it and now
we're<00:03:58.580> going<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.730> put<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.690> disk<00:04:00.380> of<00:04:00.560> pastry

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
we're going to put this disk of pastry

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.620 
we're going to put this disk of pastry
down<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:03.380> good<00:04:04.370> side<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.730> top<00:04:04.940> side<00:04:05.150> goes

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
down the good side the top side goes

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.479 
down the good side the top side goes
facedown<00:04:06.080> on<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.260> pan<00:04:06.500> first<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.370> we're

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
facedown on the pan first and we're

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.790 
facedown on the pan first and we're
going<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.640> cook<00:04:07.820> this<00:04:07.970> slowly<00:04:08.360> this<00:04:09.050> is<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.260> part

start cooking the other side so give it
about<00:04:22.070> two<00:04:22.400> minutes<00:04:22.580> before<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:23.180> turn<00:04:23.390> it

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
about two minutes before you turn it

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.480 
about two minutes before you turn it
it's<00:04:24.230> actually<00:04:24.380> been<00:04:24.740> about<00:04:24.919> three<00:04:25.310> minutes

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
it's actually been about three minutes

now and now there's a skin on the other
side<00:04:30.530> we<00:04:30.980> were<00:04:31.070> ready<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.370> flip<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.760> for<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
side we were ready to flip it for the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.439 
side we were ready to flip it for the
first<00:04:32.180> time

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
first time

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.080 
first time
and<00:04:33.020> I'm<00:04:33.860> actually<00:04:34.279> going<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.639> turn<00:04:34.819> the<00:04:34.969> heat

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
and I'm actually going to turn the heat

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.149 
and I'm actually going to turn the heat
down<00:04:35.150> now<00:04:35.509> from<00:04:35.749> six<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.169> five<00:04:36.529> we're<00:04:36.979> going<00:04:37.099> to

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
down now from six to five we're going to

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.700 
down now from six to five we're going to
slow<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.370> down<00:04:37.490> even<00:04:37.729> more<00:04:38.319> and<00:04:39.319> you'll<00:04:39.559> begin

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
slow it down even more and you'll begin

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.189 
slow it down even more and you'll begin
to<00:04:39.979> notice<00:04:40.210> after<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.479> couple<00:04:41.719> more<00:04:41.870> minutes

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
to notice after a couple more minutes

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.309 
to notice after a couple more minutes
that<00:04:42.469> this<00:04:42.680> begins<00:04:43.159> to<00:04:43.279> to<00:04:43.819> puff<00:04:44.360> up<00:04:44.509> and<00:04:44.779> rise

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
that this begins to to puff up and rise

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.469 
that this begins to to puff up and rise
and<00:04:46.159> now<00:04:46.309> I<00:04:46.339> have<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.610> concern<00:04:46.999> ourselves<00:04:47.029> with

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
and now I have to concern ourselves with

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.360 
and now I have to concern ourselves with
cooking<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.169> edges<00:04:48.589> and<00:04:48.800> how<00:04:49.009> we're<00:04:49.159> going<00:04:49.249> to

or three more minutes on this side and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.159 
or three more minutes on this side and
we<00:05:13.669> can<00:05:13.699> go<00:05:13.939> back<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.389> first<00:05:14.629> side<00:05:14.839> again

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
we can go back to the first side again

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.579

and again we're going to we're going to

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.409 
and again we're going to we're going to
keep<00:05:18.770> rotating<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.370> around<00:05:19.520> pushing<00:05:20.300> it

keep rotating this around pushing it

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.480 
keep rotating this around pushing it
against<00:05:20.749> the<00:05:20.900> edges<00:05:21.169> of<00:05:21.499> the<00:05:21.560> pan<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:22.310> keep

against the edges of the pan to keep

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.429 
against the edges of the pan to keep
those<00:05:22.669> sides<00:05:22.969> cooking<00:05:23.449> and<00:05:23.659> this<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.110> going<00:05:24.379> to

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
those sides cooking and this is going to

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.679 
those sides cooking and this is going to
be<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.740> long<00:05:24.979> process<00:05:25.009> well<00:05:25.699> not<00:05:25.969> that<00:05:26.120> long<00:05:26.149> the

to cook and you can see in from the side

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:35.249 
to cook and you can see in from the side
now<00:05:32.110> how<00:05:33.110> fat<00:05:33.409> this<00:05:33.620> is<00:05:33.770> getting<00:05:34.159> is<00:05:34.729> this<00:05:35.029> is<00:05:35.210> a

just keep turning it back and forth if

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.860 
just keep turning it back and forth if
you<00:05:47.089> get<00:05:47.210> against<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:47.719> sides<00:05:49.509> let<00:05:50.509> it<00:05:50.629> cook
