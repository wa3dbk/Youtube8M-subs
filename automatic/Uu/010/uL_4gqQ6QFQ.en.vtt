00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
but they say that they hope the way the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.530 
but they say that they hope the way the
reward<00:02:28.590> systems<00:02:29.100> work<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.730> titles<00:02:30.240> and

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

as<00:02:32.850> long<00:02:33.480> as<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.930> character<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.459> at<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.540> level

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
as long as the character is at a level

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
as long as the character is at a level
that<00:02:36.750> they<00:02:37.050> could<00:02:37.230> reach<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.160> achievement

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
that they could reach that achievement

than later but I'm very excited about

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.190 
than later but I'm very excited about
this<00:03:04.739> one<00:03:04.890> as<00:03:05.040> well<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:06.330> just<00:03:06.600> means<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
this one as well it just means that the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.280 
this one as well it just means that the
hard<00:03:07.380> work<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.709> do<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:07.860> one<00:03:08.280> tune<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:10.140> your

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
hard work you do on one tune like your

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
hard work you do on one tune like your
main<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.800> really<00:03:11.190> pay<00:03:11.370> off<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.120> others

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
main can really pay off for the others

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.979 
main can really pay off for the others
and<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.840> makes<00:03:14.090> doing<00:03:15.090> those<00:03:15.270> things<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.810> lot

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.590 
and it makes doing those things a lot
more<00:03:16.020> valuable<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:17.070> my<00:03:17.220> opinion<00:03:17.549> because<00:03:18.209> one

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
more valuable in my opinion because one

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.880 
more valuable in my opinion because one
