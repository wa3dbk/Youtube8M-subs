00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
brain because just before the game came

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.700 
brain because just before the game came
out<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:22.970> indeed<00:00:23.600> before<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.140> review<00:00:24.350> embargo

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
out and indeed before the review embargo

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.560 
out and indeed before the review embargo
is<00:00:24.830> lifted<00:00:24.860> you<00:00:25.580> bet<00:00:25.730> soft<00:00:25.880> put<00:00:26.000> out<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.150> trailer

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
is lifted you bet soft put out a trailer

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.200 
is lifted you bet soft put out a trailer
that<00:00:26.600> showed<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.170> Eiffel<00:00:27.560> Tower<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:28.210> Nazis

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
that showed the Eiffel Tower and Nazis

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.359 
that showed the Eiffel Tower and Nazis
which<00:00:29.480> doesn't<00:00:30.230> make<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.650> huge<00:00:30.920> amount<00:00:31.220> of

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
which doesn't make a huge amount of

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.330 
which doesn't make a huge amount of
sense<00:00:31.610> because<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:33.020> game<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:34.220> we're

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
sense because the game that we're

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.240 
sense because the game that we're
talking<00:00:34.460> about<00:00:34.670> unity<00:00:35.150> is<00:00:35.360> set<00:00:36.140> in<00:00:36.380> a<00:00:36.800> period

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
where the Eiffel Tower didn't yet exist

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
also known as a rift mission which

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.590 
also known as a rift mission which
trying<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.530> dance<00:01:03.890> around<00:01:04.069> the<00:01:04.429> spoilers<00:01:04.969> area

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
trying to dance around the spoilers area

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.239 
trying to dance around the spoilers area
and<00:01:06.249> there's<00:01:07.249> a<00:01:07.340> part<00:01:07.670> where<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:09.560> simulation

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
and there's a part where the simulation

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.940 
and there's a part where the simulation
that<00:01:10.340> you're<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.639> for<00:01:11.149> Paris<00:01:11.990> starts<00:01:12.799> to

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
that you're in for Paris starts to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.699 
that you're in for Paris starts to
collapse<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.479> have<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.810> jump<00:01:15.049> out<00:01:15.259> of<00:01:15.319> the

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
collapse so you have to jump out of the

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.629 
collapse so you have to jump out of the
parish<00:01:16.100> time<00:01:16.369> frame<00:01:16.700> into<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:18.100> future<00:01:19.100> Paris

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
parish time frame into a future Paris

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.910 
parish time frame into a future Paris
time<00:01:20.179> frame<00:01:20.450> which<00:01:20.749> in<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.109> case<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.619> the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
time frame which in this case is the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.319 
time frame which in this case is the
world<00:01:22.789> war<00:01:22.969> two<00:01:23.289> Eiffel<00:01:24.289> Tower<00:01:24.560> area<00:01:25.069> I<00:01:25.329> love

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.500 
overdrive as a pillow this you just run
around<00:02:09.050> collecting<00:02:09.440> points

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
around collecting points

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.660 
around collecting points
but<00:02:11.659> your<00:02:12.080> else<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.470> mean<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:13.099> nazi-occupied

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
general gist of the side mission that

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.960 
general gist of the side mission that
you're<00:02:30.140> saying<00:02:30.379> is<00:02:30.680> you've<00:02:31.549> got<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> room

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
around and collect the pieces of data

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.880 
around and collect the pieces of data
and<00:02:34.299> because<00:02:35.299> there's<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.840> fellow<00:02:36.230> assassin

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
and because there's a fellow assassin

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.470 
and because there's a fellow assassin
that<00:02:37.129> has<00:02:37.430> become<00:02:37.640> trapped<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.420> the

that has become trapped in the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.800 
that has become trapped in the
simulation<00:02:39.409> that<00:02:40.220> you're<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:41.420> once<00:02:41.659> you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
get to the magical number that's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.729 
get to the magical number that's
floating<00:02:43.970> at<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.120> top<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.540> screen<00:02:44.739> this

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
floating at the top of the screen this

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.619 
floating at the top of the screen this
assassin<00:02:46.370> will<00:02:46.549> appear<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.299> go<00:02:47.390> save

assassin will appear and you can go save

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.990 
assassin will appear and you can go save
them<00:02:48.190> but<00:02:49.190> you've<00:02:49.340> also<00:02:49.489> got<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.760> try<00:02:49.909> and

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
them but you've also got to try and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.819 
them but you've also got to try and
collect<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.299> much<00:02:50.450> data<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.409> after

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
collect as much data as you can after

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.910 
collect as much data as you can after
that<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.480> improve<00:02:53.480> your<00:02:53.510> score<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.739> more

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
too much detail because it is it is a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
moment that once you see it in the game

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.170
