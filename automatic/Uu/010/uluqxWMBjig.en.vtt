worth<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.989> food<00:00:40.230> per<00:00:40.559> year<00:00:40.829> which<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.190> pretty

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
worth of food per year which is pretty

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.510 
worth of food per year which is pretty
hard<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.469> imagine<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.829> much<00:00:43.980> money<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.370> is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
hard to imagine how much money that is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
hard to imagine how much money that is
but<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.210> than<00:00:45.390> we've<00:00:45.570> spent<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.100> wars

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
but that's more than we've spent on wars

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670 
but that's more than we've spent on wars
some<00:00:47.760> years<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.930> how<00:00:48.960> much<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.260> spend

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
some years and we know how much we spend

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
some years and we know how much we spend
on<00:00:49.860> wars<00:00:50.190> another<00:00:51.000> example<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.690> our<00:00:51.809> food

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
on wars another example is that our food

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.040 
on wars another example is that our food
stamp<00:00:52.860> program<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.489> 76<00:00:54.149> billion<00:00:54.480> dollars<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
stamp program is 76 billion dollars a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
stamp program is 76 billion dollars a
year<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.739> much<00:00:55.949> federal<00:00:56.250> aid<00:00:56.640> we

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
year so that's how much federal aid we

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.010 
year so that's how much federal aid we
give<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.320> food<00:00:58.320> stamps<00:00:58.789> well<00:00:59.789> over<00:01:00.420> twice<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
give in food stamps well over twice that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
give in food stamps well over twice that
amount<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.410> throw<00:01:01.649> away<00:01:01.770> per<00:01:02.070> year<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.309> it's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
amount we throw away per year so it's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.929 
amount we throw away per year so it's
it's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.420> food<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.619> simply<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.760> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it's a lot of food so really simply if I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.330 
it's a lot of food so really simply if I
open<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> dumpster<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.140> basically<00:01:07.710> full<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
open a dumpster it's basically full of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.770 
absurd and I think in the past that was
an<00:03:01.070> issue<00:03:01.160> people<00:03:01.910> haven't<00:03:02.270> caught<00:03:02.420> on<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.600> the
