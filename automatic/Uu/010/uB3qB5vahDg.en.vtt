I also purchased another pattern which I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
I also purchased another pattern which I
thought<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.230> pretty<00:00:55.440> much<00:00:55.770> always<00:00:56.070> some

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thought was pretty much always some

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.750 
thought was pretty much always some
money<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.410> pattern<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.430> dress

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
money so that pattern was this dress

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.350 
money so that pattern was this dress
form<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:02.570> really<00:01:03.570> simple<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:05.360> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
form because it was really simple and it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.859 
form because it was really simple and it
was<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:07.950> nine<00:01:08.610> ten<00:01:09.000> dollars<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
was like I think nine ten dollars and I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.620 
was like I think nine ten dollars and I
didn't<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.070> anyway<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.630> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
didn't really like it anyway so it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.960 
didn't really like it anyway so it
doesn't<00:01:12.689> give<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> doll<00:01:13.950> any<00:01:14.189> dimension<00:01:14.820> it's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
doesn't give the doll any dimension it's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.010 
doesn't give the doll any dimension it's
quite<00:01:15.270> flat<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.640> if<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.970> stuffed<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> too<00:01:18.750> much

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
quite flat and if I stuffed it too much

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.490 
quite flat and if I stuffed it too much
it<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.500> look<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:20.070> fat<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.500> don't

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it would look really fat and I don't

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.800 
it would look really fat and I don't
know

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
know

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.149 
know
so<00:01:24.810> anyways<00:01:25.229> umm<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.540> pretty<00:01:28.500> much<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.950> M

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
so anyways umm so that pretty much the M

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
so anyways umm so that pretty much the M
dolls<00:01:29.640> look<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:31.520> okay<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:34.079> base

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
dolls look like this okay and the base

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.020 
dolls look like this okay and the base
looks<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.509> inserted<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.659> um

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
looks like that so I just inserted a um

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.899 
looks like that so I just inserted a um
I<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.680> six<00:01:40.680> millimeter<00:01:41.189> foam<00:01:41.579> which<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I think six millimeter foam which is

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.670 
I think six millimeter foam which is
like<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> caught<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:43.369> quarter<00:01:44.369> inch<00:01:44.549> fine<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
like a caught up quarter inch fine so I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.499 
like a caught up quarter inch fine so I
cut<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.280> according<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> pattern<00:01:48.329> which

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
cut that according to the pattern which

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.840 
cut that according to the pattern which
is<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:50.630> won't<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.020> um<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.340> into<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.790> just

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
is a I won't that um go into that just

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.170 
is a I won't that um go into that just
to<00:01:54.299> give<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> stability<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.060> put<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
to give a stability so when you put the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.679 
to give a stability so when you put the
sand<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.219> gives<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.969> stick

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
sand on that gives it something to stick

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.010 
sand on that gives it something to stick
on<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> flap<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> stand

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
on to and make a flap and for the stand

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.119

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
you can see here the UM fabric is too

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.930 
you can see here the UM fabric is too
soft<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.870> when<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.410> try<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.620> sew<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.340> had

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
soft in it when you try to sew it I had

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.270 
soft in it when you try to sew it I had
today<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.080> want<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.470> couple<00:03:29.800> of<00:03:29.830> times

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
today so I just want a couple of times

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.210 
today so I just want a couple of times
down<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.700> mine<00:03:30.850> just<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.269> seal<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.720> up

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
down that mine just to seal it up

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.280 
down that mine just to seal it up
because<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.880> don't<00:03:34.450> know<00:03:34.630> if<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.810> fabric<00:03:34.959> is

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
because I don't know if the fabric is

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.759 
because I don't know if the fabric is
just<00:03:35.459> phrasing<00:03:36.459> just<00:03:37.300> makes<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.959> hard<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.650> work

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
just phrasing just makes it hard to work

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.580 
just phrasing just makes it hard to work
with<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.720> see<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.200> one's<00:03:41.470> a

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
with so as you can see here this one's a

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.790 
with so as you can see here this one's a
crossing<00:03:41.830> fabric<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:42.550> this<00:03:42.940> one's<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.480> bit

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
crossing fabric so this one's a bit

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.880 
crossing fabric so this one's a bit
thicker<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:44.830> easier<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.459> work<00:03:45.640> with<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.890> this

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
thicker and easier to work with and this

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.820 
thicker and easier to work with and this
one<00:03:50.430> was<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.459> curtain<00:03:52.030> fabric<00:03:52.209> which<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:52.870> quite

easy news as well so you won't get that

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.479 
easy news as well so you won't get that
um<00:03:56.670> splitting<00:03:58.320> fraying<00:03:59.320> effect<00:03:59.739> like<00:03:59.890> that

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489
