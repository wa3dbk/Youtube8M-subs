00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.629
 So Halle only together to a very special as the clock because I have 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.709
 This time not 3 march for you but only one 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:14.099
 and around this app is called Parking and Men is for 79 cents in the App Store too 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.640
 I have a sieve and very very nice game 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.620
 but it's not just that he wants to make me the top one today, but 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.130
 I also have a plot of Blue Coat for you then I am 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.899
 At the end I will give away I'll tell you how it all should work 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.939
 and so on 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.940
 Now I'll show you the APA Pocking Meniar 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.740
 on my new a portal represents third generation has arrived today 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.760
 I think I'll do that in the video or something 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.230
 but it was the first time porsche-manager make 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.179
 to post in Mannheim is her 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.289
 Parking that could be a Mayer using 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 the acceleration phase and here alone using 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.350
 that is percent of the screen movement 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.650
 instead of a new game here 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.090
 Here it is explained now here once 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.100
 Can I just give it gas on the right side and move it through 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.170
 I can control my car screen 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.780
 I have a total of percent life e5 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.020
 and if I hit it somewhere today, it would always be a way of life 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.310
 You also have to drive very carefully 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.230
 and I've come yet certainly time is Lambert and I can this EM 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 $ Signs to collect extra money 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.660
 The level for me start to Pröll driver so to speak 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.970
 up here you see the time here still mine 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.660
 Life as I still have whether one always has 500 Mill 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.750
 and the robes, however, looks 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.780
 the amount of money that is highscore at the same time 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.369
 always when countries have done and also have time left over and experience 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.460
 here gets the points for it 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.649
 and now I can just here you see the red arrow 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.700
 There you will be told where to go 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.990
 and now I have to park the pure ones 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.340
 on the green field 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.980
 first levels he just looked like you can already collect his first points 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.849
 and then just on Conti Mio 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.969
 here you can already see here is the steep way clock 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.519
 but that too is not really a problem 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:26.929
 I really enjoyed the game so I do not blame it 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.369
 "Very very far" played I think Müller wants 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:34.249
 30 and as far as I know myself also not exactly how many there is everything 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.389
 15 different cars you can drive 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.889
 that means so by percent 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.999
 fast races Flitzern small to small cars that stand out 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:48.489
 how deep but I can not look so good at percent to right tracks 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.650
 with a loud so on where you then just stop collecting the trailer 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.199
 and so on 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.359
 we ensure the graphics are also very nice 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.619
 Although not quite as the partially but very pretty designed like me 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:02.259
 find 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.469
 So in the hands the developers groan a lot done 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.769
 and all that then stops for 79 cents you already in the Mini Cooper 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.869
 but he also wants to be wrapped up properly 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.029
 their percent important some parcels 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:27.339
 yes, not afford 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.309
 that was only natural, of course 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.669
 preview 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.669
 Effect so you see what happens 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.629
 you do not just focus on me one anymore 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.080
 I just go here by Brendan Smyth 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.599
 for strawberries is once said of course here in the world 5 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.790
 and then again 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.900
 Crosstour Roth crosses over what has to be done in this country 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.259
 Street 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.809
 as Annika Burg at the neighbor 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.599
 you can not even reset that would just start again 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.649
 carry on or exile 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.459
 That's exactly what I'm doing now in the panometer in the auction also you 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.859
 you can set your name once 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.069
 and then also could Saud and make music and so far the body's own 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.199
 only she thinks I want to play 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.559
 exactly you could choose me 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:18.900
 also very nice 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.939
 and around 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.949
 you can handle another tax that percent just that 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.599
 Motion control here 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.949
 make up 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.340
 and then this is also explained directly here 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.110
 to date 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.110
 Moving to Altenstadt had something to steer here 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.740
 Moscow works very well but I rather stick to it 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.370
 Activity EUR 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.360
 I think that's nice in the game but who the old blow or 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.199
 Belgrade is sitting in the bus and so much else is shaking 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.650
 very very pleasant 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.550
 as I said I would like one 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.150
 So of course, I still want to lead Trummer Korter 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.020
 give 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.949
 Percent all this is pretty easy 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.440
 though below this video you're just in the comments below 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.620
 capitalized Meena year 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.970
 he was Kenny Ortega's capital 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.419
 So just a minus sign and then just your comment 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.620
 one is allowed under each 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.110
 make a comment more is not allowed of course who so Matenaer around 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.080
 would rate the video with five stars and have had more condition old 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.400
 I actually have one today, this video likes to feature but all 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.639
 that's why Simic gives you extra voices or something 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.889
 and then I'll play all this 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.639
 I also think of a very popular Random website 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.689
 Focus Ork then I would have it then 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:57.069
 Choose as I said very simple rules and of course you have to 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.520
 did not subscribe 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.949
 he would be very nice if he was just like your friends or something 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.940
 say you'll just quit smoking ipod touch or so that m will too 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.319
 Videos creators on YouTube and so on 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.469
 if you like my videos of course but only 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.759
 I hope they do and so have relished subscribing once again with relish 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.249
 is the first and then just take a man yes - only carry euro income 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:22.360
 a comment 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.430
 and pretty 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.589
 yes, what I wish you good luck 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.700
 that all changes this 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.949
 Twenty-fifth on 25 Struck Tobor should end this 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.479
 And from there, percent will no longer be targeted for comments 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.389
 yes I wish you much fun with Parkin Meniar if you already have 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.860
 or if moose want to buy or good luck 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.360
 because with the goal gets wins
