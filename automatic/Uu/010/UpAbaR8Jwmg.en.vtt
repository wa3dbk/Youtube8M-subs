00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.400
 hi everybody this is max and channel clash of 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.290
 clans tivi 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.240
 in today's video I would like to 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.849
 tell and show development strategy 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.580
 who consider the most optimal and 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.410
 which I stick to myself for the beginning to you 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.740
 need to define your goals in 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.410
 the game 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.340
 although I think most players and not 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.400
 the same is a farm and a set of cups with 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.949
 subsequent entry of a good clan in 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.080
 good plan, we need to do is correct 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.300
 participate in a cafe and not just 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.409
 to participate but also to win for this 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.559
 we need a good 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.159
 fortified base with reliable girls in 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.870
 principle 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.680
 based on my personal experience to 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.019
 Seventh level town hall and no 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.239
 special meaning to somehow bother 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.780
 coming up with a base 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.570
 put knowledge as you like but with 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.470
 this with farm resources and with farm 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.439
 goblets, too, you wear town hall for the wall 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.170
 in most cases a player with good 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.920
 deed that attacks you seeing 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.609
 town hall 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.960
 behind the wall will take it out and it will not carry 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.259
 the rest of the base even if there 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.399
 there will be a large amount of resources 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.710
 so think check 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.130
 experiment and now 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.409
 directly to the development strategy 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.409
 at first I'll describe it in general 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.499
 when moving to a new level town hall 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.380
 and the sequence of knowledge flow 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:48.890
 should be something like this first 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.590
 turn 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.409
 you shake a lab that will give you 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.039
 more powerful warriors and faster 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.030
 development 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.990
 then come the vault for the gold of the elixir 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.619
 so as for pumping guns edition you 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.020
 need more resources which are previous 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.700
 storage cannot hold 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.760
 then you pump over protective 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.610
 constructions then goes wall to 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.930
 maximum level then go fires 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.690
 so -called who would 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.690
 Well, then go already barracks 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.790
 pump the rest of the building 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.650
 If you want from three or more 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.660
 builders then you can basically 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.810
 pump several buildings at once 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.980
 at the same time that is, let's say you can 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.350
 swing two guns or two barracks well or 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.730
 two bonfire there or any other 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.580
 combinations it is all to your taste 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.959
 Well, for example, my base is completely 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.910
 I recently moved to the seventh level 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.370
 town hall and that of course gave me 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.880
 new spaces for development the very first 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.330
 day i put an extra 50 units 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.180
 fences pumped them up to level five 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.840
 also almost immediately I put all the guns 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.450
 except tessile 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.080
 I have them so far cooked 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.300
 at last 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.780
 but in a few days I will put them 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.310
 of course I rebuilt the base right away and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.180
 stuck one more and rdf as you see it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.680
 I am now swinging to the second level 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.329
 that's it for these builders I will 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.690
 to download 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:35.680
 rdf yes most likely immediately 5 and then 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.680
 this rdf 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:44.730
 as judging by my experience it is in 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:48.030
 clan battles at my levels 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.190
 development levels in the game in general and 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.510
 seventh level of town hall and often 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.480
 attack balls 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.860
 but either by air there dragons flies 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:03.150
 balls so well pumped 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.900
 rdf and vitally important to you as well, 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.840
 bleed 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.760
 the lab is already swinging giant in it 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.250
 4 levels since I will be soon 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.270
 in remaining here as there almost 4 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.740
 five days I will go to farm the cup because 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:25.680
 i need 4 builder and not enough how 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.490
 once again about 210 crystals and 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:34.110
 getting into the crystal league will give me 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.250
 those cherished 250 crystals so here 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:43.170
 as soon as i get 4 builders i 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:46.230
 I'll put it in closely after 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:50.400
 pumping strength you I will pumping 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.320
 remaining guns and most likely on 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.540
 the seventh tom holly i will linger longer 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.970
 because I decided to pump more mine 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.050
 to the maximum level I do not know yes 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.310
 what they can be there but i rather have them 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.940
 just pumping oh yeah i completely forgot about 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.940
 spire factory 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.420
 I have something that is not worth pumping 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.710
 but I think that tonight I'm her 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:20.480
 put yes completely forgot about her need 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.770
 I also pump in another repository for 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.520
 black elixir 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.200
 I will not save for the king and now 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.750
 so you are not bored at all 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.730
 i will show you my farm yesterday 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.120
 bows 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:45.380
 barbarians enough standard farm 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.770
 resources on the edges of such a semi-neglected 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.350
 most likely even an abandoned base and 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.830
 so I put the stuff here a couple 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.410
 barbarian so they demolished percents 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.270
 so let go of Pushkin's bows for them 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.960
 do not reach out and they calmly begin 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.350
 take out building resources here now 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.110
 so when I went down 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.450
 barbarians second wave bows barbarian 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.210
 distract the attention of defo for now 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:20.090
 bows endure resources and so unpretentious 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:25.490
 farm resource tactics I almost always 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.889
 I use and almost always successfully when 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.689
 this 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:35.370
 such an army is built about 20 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:38.189
 minutes building is worth the cost of it 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:44.729
 is a little less than 20 thousand definitely not 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:49.710
 I remember and at the same time it is good 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:51.870
 takes out the bases so look further 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.909
 I went to fill the percentages and now pick up 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.449
 this elixir ah and this gold 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:57.449
 mine 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:00.120
 here I have students long have you well on them 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.370
 shoot mortar and yes of course sad 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.060
 here he blows and 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.419
 I release more bows so they already 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.400
 tortured this mine 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:15.060
 I think they do not dunk, I do not remember exactly 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:18.000
 Already yes, most likely, it will not soak, but here I am 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.150
 the whole elixir has removed a little gold here 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.490
 now rented produce barbarians rather 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.419
 just the last barbarian from where by 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.660
 bows come 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:32.010
 yes it is here on this mine all the same to 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:35.669
 probably finish and yes and in the end a little bit 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.550
 not enough and now there is an account at the mine 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:42.360
 here and a little elixir in the vaults but 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:46.050
 at the same time I took the cup took 235 elixir 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.960
 and almost 200 gold think at the cost of 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:52.620
 an army of 20,000 elixir is completely 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.169
 slightly, well, plus I was looking for a base 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.630
 probably spent about five minutes about 

00:07:55.169 --> 00:08:01.229
 15 thousand gold but this is also not 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:03.330
 Essentially with such a farm, well 

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:06.419
 if you like the video like 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:10.020
 subscribe to the channel subscribe 

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:12.240
 On my group vkontakte also look 

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:18.110
 my first video link will be somewhere 

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.110
 at the top well and new meetings
