00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.160 
behold Despicable Me 2 action figures
I<00:00:04.529> found<00:00:05.370> these<00:00:05.580> over<00:00:05.940> at<00:00:06.089> Toys<00:00:06.330> R<00:00:06.569> Us<00:00:06.629> for

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
I found these over at Toys R Us for

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.400 
I found these over at Toys R Us for
about<00:00:08.000> $7.99<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.300> course<00:00:09.719> when<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.960> returned

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
about $7.99 of course when I returned

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.089 
about $7.99 of course when I returned
for<00:00:10.679> more

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
for more

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.360 
for more
they<00:00:11.490> were<00:00:11.550> now<00:00:11.960> $9.99<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> price<00:00:14.040> point

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
they were now $9.99 so the price point

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580 
they were now $9.99 so the price point
is<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> little<00:00:14.969> ridiculous<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.839> that's<00:00:16.320> why<00:00:16.560> I

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
is a little ridiculous and that's why I

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
is a little ridiculous and that's why I
suggest<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.940> blind<00:00:18.240> bag<00:00:18.510> figures

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
suggest going for the blind bag figures

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
suggest going for the blind bag figures
because<00:00:19.859> they<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.220> only<00:00:20.369> $2.99

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
because they are only $2.99

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.660 
because they are only $2.99
of<00:00:21.660> course<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.470> blind<00:00:22.769> bag<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.220> harder<00:00:23.550> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
of course with blind bag it's harder to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939 
of course with blind bag it's harder to
find<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.090> character<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
find the character you want but the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980 
find the character you want but the
action<00:00:26.279> figures<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:26.880> also<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.210> little<00:00:27.420> larger

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
action figures are also a little larger

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.290 
action figures are also a little larger
and<00:00:28.170> there's<00:00:28.619> some<00:00:28.890> small<00:00:29.730> points<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
and there's some small points of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.540 
and there's some small points of
articulation<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:31.349> them<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.070> maybe<00:00:32.340> if

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
articulation with them so maybe if

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.760 
articulation with them so maybe if
you're<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:33.270> big<00:00:33.420> fan<00:00:33.480> you'll<00:00:34.050> fork<00:00:34.590> out

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.799 
you're a really big fan you'll fork out
the<00:00:34.800> bucks<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.520> them<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.630> just

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
Steve Carrell as an actor so kind of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.170 
Steve Carrell as an actor so kind of
neat<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.380> figure<00:04:47.890> in<00:04:48.130> some<00:04:48.490> way<00:04:48.669> of<00:04:48.910> him

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
neat to have a figure in some way of him

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.830 
neat to have a figure in some way of him
so<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.730> he's<00:04:51.730> a<00:04:51.790> little<00:04:52.000> bit<00:04:52.150> bigger<00:04:52.450> than<00:04:52.690> the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
so and he's a little bit bigger than the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.159 
so and he's a little bit bigger than the
minions<00:04:53.200> of<00:04:53.410> just<00:04:53.770> like<00:04:53.950> probably<00:04:54.820> not<00:04:55.390> the

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
minions of just like probably not the

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.590 
minions of just like probably not the
appropriate<00:04:56.470> size<00:04:57.010> but<00:04:57.430> just<00:04:58.030> enough<00:04:58.330> for<00:04:58.540> an

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
appropriate size but just enough for an

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.370 
appropriate size but just enough for an
action<00:04:58.960> figure

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
action figure

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.210 
action figure
play<00:05:00.220> I<00:05:01.210> think<00:05:02.140> he's<00:05:02.290> a<00:05:02.500> definite<00:05:03.010> worth

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
play I think he's a definite worth

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.280 
play I think he's a definite worth
getting<00:05:03.640> if<00:05:03.760> you're<00:05:04.450> going<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.660> get<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.900> couple

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
getting if you're going to get a couple

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.820 
getting if you're going to get a couple
of<00:05:05.350> these<00:05:05.500> see<00:05:05.890> like<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.400> said<00:05:06.669> very<00:05:07.330> typical<00:05:07.900> so

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
of these see like I said very typical so

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.500 
of these see like I said very typical so
that<00:05:09.070> pretty<00:05:09.310> much<00:05:09.430> does<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:09.910> for<00:05:10.090> the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
that pretty much does it for the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.280 
that pretty much does it for the
Despicable<00:05:11.440> Me<00:05:11.470> 2<00:05:11.680> action<00:05:12.490> figures<00:05:13.260> again<00:05:14.260> I

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
Despicable Me 2 action figures again I

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.260 
Despicable Me 2 action figures again I
would<00:05:14.650> suggest<00:05:14.890> looking<00:05:15.250> for<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.700> blind<00:05:15.970> bag

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
would suggest looking for the blind bag

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.230 
would suggest looking for the blind bag
characters<00:05:16.840> they're<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.500> little<00:05:18.070> smaller<00:05:18.490> but

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
characters they're a little smaller but

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.030 
characters they're a little smaller but
you<00:05:19.540> know<00:05:19.660> they're<00:05:19.870> way<00:05:20.080> more<00:05:20.110> worth<00:05:20.710> the

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
you know they're way more worth the

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.550 
you know they're way more worth the
value<00:05:21.520> I<00:05:21.790> think<00:05:21.940> because<00:05:22.419> the<00:05:22.900> action<00:05:23.230> figures

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
value I think because the action figures

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.240 
value I think because the action figures
really<00:05:24.010> don't<00:05:24.250> move<00:05:24.520> much<00:05:24.850> as<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:26.050> blind<00:05:27.010> bag

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
really don't move much as the blind bag

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.820 
really don't move much as the blind bag
figures<00:05:27.700> but<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:28.780> can<00:05:28.900> also<00:05:29.020> just<00:05:29.380> get<00:05:29.620> them

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
figures but you can also just get them

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.220 
figures but you can also just get them
