getting pretty long and it's really

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.050 
getting pretty long and it's really
thick<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.350> put<00:02:25.800> about<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> quarter

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
thick so I put about like a quarter

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.770 
thick so I put about like a quarter
maybe<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.140> nickel<00:02:28.560> quarter<00:02:29.010> amount<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.780> just

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
put it I flip my hair over and put it in

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000 
put it I flip my hair over and put it in
and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:33.510> style<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:34.050> hair<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.680> really

cuts<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.820> frizz<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.300> my<00:02:36.420> hair<00:02:36.660> so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
cuts down on the frizz in my hair so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.820 
cuts down on the frizz in my hair so
that's<00:02:38.070> that's<00:02:38.670> something<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.210> look<00:02:39.300> into<00:02:39.830> if

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's that's something to look into if

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.430 
that's that's something to look into if
you<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.460> want<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> sarum<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.390> use<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:42.900> again

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.570 
when I'm straightening my hair but I use
both<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.200> one<00:02:46.410> says<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.920> tames<00:02:47.190> frizz

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
both and this one says it tames frizz

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.240 
both and this one says it tames frizz
for<00:02:47.910> glossy<00:02:48.360> shine<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.770> what<00:02:50.130> you

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
for glossy shine so this is what you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.890 
for glossy shine so this is what you
would<00:02:50.340> use<00:02:50.610> if<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.000> were<00:02:51.120> straightening<00:02:51.510> or

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
would use if you were straightening or

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.570 
would use if you were straightening or
your<00:02:52.050> hair<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.410> straight<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.950> makes<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.250> shiny

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
your hair is straight and makes it shiny

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.820 
your hair is straight and makes it shiny
and<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.330> does<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.780> add<00:02:54.900> some<00:02:55.200> shine<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.680> your

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
