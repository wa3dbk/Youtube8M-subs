00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.430
 so here we have a chair we're going 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.900
 makeover we will give him a small side 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.900
 baroque 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.230
 so we will apply a cream of 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.500
 colors after having it of course well 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.000
 prepared thought etc and then we 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.460
 will come to skate with the sir skated 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.570
 so on the rose that will give him a 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.570
 little chic side 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.760
 so all is used to skate arises 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 presenting tubes like this so with the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.570
 brush to the iss and that is very hard in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.570
 do we take the wax for these 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.760
 here we will come 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.729
 then we have to strongly support 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 at the beginning we will go light here 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.950
 according to what we want the effect that 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.950
 we want to do 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.500
 we will insist certain places or not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.380
 at all we can turn like these 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.320
 in the vintage you have here to skate 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.590
 you have different gold hours you have 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.330
 money and you have white waxes 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 black blue pink and green that's so 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.740
 for example as I just did 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.180
 a little bit too much you do not panic 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.390
 here you see I may have one 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.880
 little bit come it does not matter 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.899
 before the sirn dries 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.340
 we will remove with cotton wick 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.490
 I can withdraw one supporting more 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.900
 what I just did here 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.900
 it depends on the desired effect 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.860
 do not wait for a long drying 1 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.740
 you saw I'm right now 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.470
 income to withdraw because otherwise 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.020
 a sirh so after adheres very well 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.580
 then you can also removed a little 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.440
 shooting with steel wool a small fir 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.260
 scratch it here I'm going to pull out for 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:54.730
 to make you see see I rediscover the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:56.350
 pink and over you go boorish and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.780
 with the cotton wick 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.470
 you see there I can add I 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.430
 can withdraw 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.650
 it's really freedom what and I 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.100
 will do this operation on the crowd 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.100
 of the chair 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.420
 this is a very slight effect since the 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.650
 wax did not have time to adhere 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:37.430
 strongly support that gives me 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:40.550
 exactly the desired effect I did 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.250
 surface by doing this I withdraw to 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.540
 send it waxes like that that are 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.820
 either silver or gold in fact are very 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.830
 blanket see we could very well 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.870
 the deaths we would see almost no pink 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.790
 bottom the other cyr in addition to one side 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.010
 a bit translucent 1 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.040
 they will be less covering it will give 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.540
 more this aspect there without going 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.540
 to skate immediately 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.600
 and so here I go back up the cise that 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.019
 I'm going to have relooked according to my 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.019
 patina 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.000
 There you go
