and<00:00:35.230> after<00:00:36.010> playing<00:00:36.190> through<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.790> remainder

and after playing through the remainder

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.790 
and after playing through the remainder
of<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.420> game<00:00:37.450> I<00:00:37.630> can<00:00:37.990> say<00:00:38.200> with<00:00:38.380> certainty

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
of the game I can say with certainty

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.290 
of the game I can say with certainty
that<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.640> is<00:00:39.990> probably<00:00:40.990> the<00:00:41.230> best<00:00:42.000> remake<00:00:43.000> of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
that this is probably the best remake of

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.030 
that this is probably the best remake of
any<00:00:43.570> video<00:00:43.900> game<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.410> I've<00:00:44.560> ever<00:00:44.710> played

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
any video game that I've ever played

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.310 
any video game that I've ever played
because<00:00:45.820> in<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.240> end<00:00:46.390> this<00:00:46.600> doesn't<00:00:47.020> deviate

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
because in the end this doesn't deviate

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.070 
because in the end this doesn't deviate
all<00:00:47.560> that<00:00:47.740> much<00:00:47.920> from<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.370> original<00:00:48.790> version

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
time playing them and a game like this

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.520 
time playing them and a game like this
requires<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.489> lot<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.760> precision<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:42.380> good

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.180 

usually<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.049> just<00:02:48.200> suck<00:02:48.590> at<00:02:48.620> games<00:02:48.980> where

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
usually I just suck at games where

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.970 
usually I just suck at games where
you're<00:02:49.280> running<00:02:49.400> around<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:50.530> platforms<00:02:51.620> it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
you're running around on platforms it's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.089 
you're running around on platforms it's
platformers<00:02:53.440> for<00:02:54.440> whatever<00:02:54.560> reason<00:02:55.010> when

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
platformers for whatever reason when

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.410 
platformers for whatever reason when
you're<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.370> spaceship<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.060> have<00:02:56.209> more

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
you're in a spaceship you have more

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.180 
you're in a spaceship you have more
freedom<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.870> fly<00:02:57.200> around<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.590> dodge<00:02:57.829> things

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
freedom to fly around and dodge things

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.699 
freedom to fly around and dodge things
but<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.390> platformer<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.079> don't<00:03:00.440> have<00:03:00.590> as

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
but on a platformer you don't have as

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.589 
but on a platformer you don't have as
much<00:03:00.829> freedom<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.730> then<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:02.000> course<00:03:02.060> Bionic

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
much freedom and then of course Bionic

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.000
