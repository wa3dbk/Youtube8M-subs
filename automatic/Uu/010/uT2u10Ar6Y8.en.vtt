00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.280
 cardiocirculatory system anatomy 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:06.780
 good of the upper limb 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.500
 in this video we will see the real 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 to underarm the brachial the lunar radial 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.570
 it's a little hint of the venous circle 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.810
 of the hand but we will pause in 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.279
 especially on the two there really is 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.960
 important ones of the arm that are those 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.509
 superficial the cephalic and the basilica 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
 here it is very simplified the circle 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.059
 of the arm the axillary vein with his 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 collateral circulation the brachial veins e 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.230
 then the two superficial veins which in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.329
 reality flow into the scene of the poor king 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.769
 s 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.960
 the axillary vein originated in 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.030
 correspondence of the lower margin of the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.219
 great breastplate to then go to 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.280
 running towards the suq lavia e 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.199
 continue almost imperceptibly in it 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.079
 use as a say point for the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 lateral margin of the first coast ed 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.339
 here it comes the king a vein 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.409
 rather long than as the name implies 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.950
 itself runs for the most part 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.970
 inside the armpit 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.440
 let's take a look at his circle 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.140
 collateral the superior chica nature e 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.830
 the closest collateral to the first 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.200
 costa drains all the intercostal space 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.860
 first to go and throw yourself 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.540
 in the axillary vein the thoracic vein a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.650
 chrome ial and a vein that drains good 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.840
 part of the big and small bib is 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.460
 also a branch that extends backwards 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 to go and touch the color of the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.320
 scapula dorsal thoracic vein a vein 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.570
 which descends with a branch along the line 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.000
 choose media with another along the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.430
 lateral margin of the scapula giving 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.730
 also a small branch that drains the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.240
 subscapularis muscle the veins cir 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.400
 complexes of the humerus form a system 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.150
 a motive band around the head of 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.790
 let's look at this bone veins 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.280
 brachialis are called brachial wells 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.110
 precisely because they are two and they correspond 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.980
 to the brachial artery here they are 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.140
 they form a circle that joins that 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.320
 of brachial art but as the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.360
 name are two in number 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.540
 in the same way the radial veins and one 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.520
 that come together in it have it 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.090
 same course of radial arteries 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.590
 alinari 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.500
 but they are two in number for each 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.570
 artery their slopes are 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.200
 represented by the venous circle of the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:44.060
 hand of love look at the two veins 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.850
 superficial cephalic lavina born from 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.570
 dorsal hand of the hand immediately 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.880
 posteriorly with respect to the thumb and yes 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.430
 fly along the region 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.250
 of the forearm running nor on the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.739
 side portion at the level of the fold 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.320
 of the elbow from some branches anastomosis c 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.080
 after which it continues laterally with respect 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.780
 at the biceps brachialis and passes between 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.360
 deltoid biceps and then between deltoid and 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.400
 major bib for later 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.320
 deepen in the triangle of the triduum 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.030
 bib to go out in the 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:24.530
 axillary vein instead the basilic vein is 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.950
 opposite is already born in the region fly 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.950
 in correspondence however of the palm of the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.840
 hand at the level of the last metatarsal yes 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.080
 leads to run over the region fly 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.190
 forearm this time on average 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.350
 arrived at the level of the fold of the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.209
 elbow from some collateral for then 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.820
 running sideways from the 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.670
 biceps and in the middle of it deepen 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.100
 to go directly into the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.190
 axillary vein at cable level 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.190
 axillary 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.010
 finally the venous circulation of the hand 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.030
 it's much more complex than that 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.890
 blood 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.900
 here too we can observe three arches 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.090
 which then flow into the radial veins 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.610
 all seas and in these three arcs go to 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.459
 flow into branches that drain blood 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.209
 from inter-metatarsal spaces of course 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.209
 from the fingers
