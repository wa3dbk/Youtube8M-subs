dangling off of it those are called

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
dangling off of it those are called
anthers<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> they<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> little<00:00:36.000> pouches

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
anthers and they are the little pouches

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
anthers and they are the little pouches
that<00:00:36.540> actually<00:00:37.230> produce<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> contain<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that actually produce and contain the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.360 
that actually produce and contain the
pollen<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> what<00:00:39.870> I've<00:00:39.989> been<00:00:40.020> doing<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
pollen and what I've been doing is is I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.069 
pollen and what I've been doing is is I
just<00:00:41.399> simply<00:00:41.700> take<00:00:42.300> them<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:43.020> them

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
just simply take them and I put them

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.220 
just simply take them and I put them
into<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.440> bowl<00:00:44.420> strap<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> right<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.780> there<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
into a bowl strap it right in there and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.500 
into a bowl strap it right in there and
then<00:00:47.010> every<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.460> often<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.690> shake<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
then every so often I will shake it and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.110 
then every so often I will shake it and
this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.890> few<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.550> ones<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.030> have

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this is just a few of the ones that have

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.170 
this is just a few of the ones that have
been<00:00:54.270> growing<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:55.610> that<00:00:56.610> I've<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:56.850> cut

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
been growing here that I've actually cut

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
been growing here that I've actually cut
off<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:58.980> I've<00:00:59.070> collected

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
off and this is just what I've collected

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
off and this is just what I've collected
this<00:00:59.579> morning<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.050> pretty<00:01:01.260> decent

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
this morning and it's a pretty decent

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.230 
this morning and it's a pretty decent
amount<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.780> pollen

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.820 

see<00:01:08.840> some<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.050> that<00:01:09.140> yellow<00:01:09.440> in<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.680> bowl

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
see some of that yellow in the bowl

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.550 
see some of that yellow in the bowl
there<00:01:10.100> underneath<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.000> little<00:01:11.120> anthers<00:01:11.560> that

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
there underneath the little anthers that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.980 
there underneath the little anthers that
are<00:01:12.680> now<00:01:12.740> empty<00:01:13.120> so<00:01:14.120> there<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.540> go<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:14.870> this

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
are now empty so there you go and this

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.930 
are now empty so there you go and this
is<00:01:15.110> just<00:01:15.230> a<00:01:15.320> regular<00:01:15.440> old<00:01:15.650> paintbrush<00:01:16.460> this<00:01:16.820> is

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
is just a regular old paintbrush this is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.970 
is just a regular old paintbrush this is
the<00:01:17.030> one<00:01:17.120> that<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.330> asked<00:01:17.600> April<00:01:18.560> affected

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
the one that I asked April affected

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.760 
the one that I asked April affected
borrow<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:21.020> that's<00:01:21.410> where<00:01:21.530> we're<00:01:21.620> going<00:01:21.740> to

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
borrow so that's where we're going to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.870 
borrow so that's where we're going to
use<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.070> apply<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:22.370> here<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.820> little

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
use to apply it here in just a little

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.150 
use to apply it here in just a little
bit<00:01:24.130> now<00:01:25.130> they<00:01:25.460> have<00:01:25.610> grown<00:01:25.850> nice<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.300> long

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
bit now they have grown nice and long

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.270 
bit now they have grown nice and long
he's<00:01:28.160> called<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.610> silks<00:01:30.010> let's<00:01:31.010> do<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.160> this

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
he's called the silks let's do it this

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.420 
he's called the silks let's do it this
way<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.490> I'll<00:01:31.729> block<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.030> camera<00:01:33.190> now<00:01:34.190> each

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
way so I'll block the camera now each

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.430 
way so I'll block the camera now each
and<00:01:34.610> every<00:01:34.760> one<00:01:34.910> of<00:01:34.940> these<00:01:35.180> silks<00:01:36.140> every

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
and every one of these silks every

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.850 
and every one of these silks every
individual<00:01:36.950> silk<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.520> connected<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:39.229> corn

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
individual silk is connected to a corn

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.670 
individual silk is connected to a corn
kernel<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.810> each<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.020> every<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.530> them

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
kernel and each and every one of them

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.340 
kernel and each and every one of them
must<00:01:42.950> be<00:01:43.009> pollinated<00:01:43.550> because<00:01:43.970> they<00:01:44.119> will

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
must be pollinated because they will

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.810 
must be pollinated because they will
create<00:01:45.350> little<00:01:45.619> tubes<00:01:45.920> inside<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.700> themselves

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
create little tubes inside of themselves

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.700 
create little tubes inside of themselves
they're<00:01:47.270> basically<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.720> little<00:01:47.960> conduit<00:01:48.410> so

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
they're basically a little conduit so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.840 
they're basically a little conduit so
that<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:50.950> pollens<00:01:51.950> poor<00:01:52.220> can<00:01:52.490> actually

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
that the pollens poor can actually

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.260 
that the pollens poor can actually
travel<00:01:53.090> down<00:01:53.420> into<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.170> ear<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.270> pollinate

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
travel down into the ear and pollinate

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.620 
travel down into the ear and pollinate
the<00:01:56.390> kernel<00:01:56.780> which<00:01:57.410> then<00:01:58.040> gives<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:59.300> corn

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
the kernel which then gives you the corn

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.400 
the kernel which then gives you the corn
that<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.990> on<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.200> cob<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.430> make<00:02:01.880> sure<00:02:02.410> two

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
that is on the cob so to make sure two

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.040 
that is on the cob so to make sure two
things<00:02:03.680> actually<00:02:04.360> first<00:02:05.360> one<00:02:05.540> being<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.810> you

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
things actually first one being that you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.900 
things actually first one being that you
can<00:02:06.229> get<00:02:06.440> all<00:02:06.649> of<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:07.660> in<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.959> nice<00:02:09.170> neat<00:02:10.009> way<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
can get all of it in a nice neat way you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.490 
can get all of it in a nice neat way you
want<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.120> cut<00:02:11.270> them<00:02:11.390> short<00:02:11.750> like<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.170> have<00:02:12.320> this

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
want to cut them short like I have this

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.570 
want to cut them short like I have this
one<00:02:12.680> here<00:02:12.920> which<00:02:13.100> has<00:02:13.220> already<00:02:13.370> been

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
one here which has already been

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.479 
one here which has already been
pollinated<00:02:14.620> see<00:02:15.620> how<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:15.920> nice<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.310> short

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
pollinated see how it's nice and short

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.420 
pollinated see how it's nice and short
there<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.600> can<00:02:17.830> possibly<00:02:18.830> even<00:02:19.100> see<00:02:19.220> some

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
there and you can possibly even see some

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.590 
there and you can possibly even see some
of<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.580> yellow<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.000> leaf<00:02:20.150> there<00:02:20.390> just

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
of the yellow on the leaf there just

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.470 
of the yellow on the leaf there just
below<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.840> that's<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> pollen<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:23.180> right<00:02:23.239> so

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
below it that's the pollen all right so

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.670 
below it that's the pollen all right so
we're<00:02:23.660> going<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> cut<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.140> one<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.410> look<00:02:24.560> just

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
we're going to cut this one to look just

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.160 
we're going to cut this one to look just
like<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.480> kind<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.750> gather<00:02:29.959> it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
like that so you just kind of gather it

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.320 
like that so you just kind of gather it
up<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.350> little<00:02:30.440> bit<00:02:30.650> like<00:02:30.799> that<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:34.250> then<00:02:35.209> you

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
up a little bit like that and then you

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.509 
up a little bit like that and then you
give<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.660> nice<00:02:35.840> short<00:02:36.080> cut<00:02:36.350> BAM

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
give it a nice short cut BAM

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.789 
give it a nice short cut BAM
so<00:02:38.330> there<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.570> go<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.989> then<00:02:39.380> that's<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:39.680> you

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
so there you go and then that's what you

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.990 
so there you go and then that's what you
have<00:02:39.830> left<00:02:40.130> over<00:02:40.250> these<00:02:41.239> are<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.450> silks<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
have left over these are the silks and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.310 
have left over these are the silks and
they're<00:02:44.000> kind<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.239> softened<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:45.049> ever<00:02:45.170> so

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
they're kind of softened just ever so

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.949 
they're kind of softened just ever so
slightly<00:02:45.350> sticky<00:02:45.940> fishy<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.690> little<00:02:47.870> bit

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
slightly sticky fishy and a little bit

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.850 
slightly sticky fishy and a little bit
squishy<00:02:48.200> yes<00:02:48.590> all<00:02:49.580> right<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:51.560> we've<00:02:51.739> done

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
squishy yes all right so now we've done

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.000 
squishy yes all right so now we've done
that<00:02:53.260> another<00:02:54.260> reason<00:02:54.530> why<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.680> want<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.920> do

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
that another reason why you want to do

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.490 
that another reason why you want to do
that<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.370> also<00:02:55.610> because<00:02:56.209> as<00:02:56.829> this<00:02:57.829> ear<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.970> cob

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
that is also because as this ear the cob

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.759 
that is also because as this ear the cob
continues<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.650> develop<00:03:00.860> its<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:03.500> to

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
continues to develop its going to

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.280 
continues to develop its going to
produce<00:03:03.980> new<00:03:04.430> silks<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.120> when<00:03:05.840> those<00:03:05.989> grow

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
produce new silks and when those grow

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.900 
produce new silks and when those grow
they<00:03:06.560> will<00:03:06.590> grow<00:03:06.860> out<00:03:07.010> longer<00:03:07.370> they'll<00:03:07.730> grow

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
they will grow out longer they'll grow

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.460 
they will grow out longer they'll grow
out<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.209> know<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.510> rest<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.140> them<00:03:09.320> so

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
out you know the rest of this on them so

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.810 
out you know the rest of this on them so
you'll<00:03:09.680> know<00:03:09.829> those<00:03:10.130> are<00:03:10.310> new<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.610> that<00:03:10.730> you

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you'll know those are new and that you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.100 
you'll know those are new and that you
need<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.030> pollinate<00:03:11.360> those<00:03:11.540> as<00:03:11.720> well<00:03:11.840> to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
need to pollinate those as well to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.470 
need to pollinate those as well to
ensure<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.500> get<00:03:12.620> as<00:03:12.739> many<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.670> kernels<00:03:14.030> to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
ensure you get as many of the kernels to

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.270 
ensure you get as many of the kernels to
swell<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:14.750> as<00:03:15.079> possible<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:15.950> get<00:03:16.100> nice<00:03:16.250> big

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
swell up as possible so you get nice big

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.920 
swell up as possible so you get nice big
ears<00:03:16.850> filled<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.389> corn<00:03:18.320> all<00:03:19.250> right<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.930> now

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
and I've knocked some of the anthro

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.560 
and I've knocked some of the anthro
shells<00:03:25.040> out<00:03:25.310> there<00:03:25.610> we're<00:03:26.270> just<00:03:26.390> going<00:03:26.510> to

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
shells out there we're just going to

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.190 
shells out there we're just going to
take<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> brush<00:03:27.850> stop<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:28.970> right<00:03:29.090> in<00:03:29.240> there<00:03:32.200> so

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
you get a nice bit of yellow on it

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.430 
you get a nice bit of yellow on it
except<00:03:38.300> I'm<00:03:38.630> not<00:03:38.690> really<00:03:38.930> getting<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> punch

you got to do and of course you'll see
the<00:03:56.380> pollen<00:03:57.380> deposited<00:03:57.920> on<00:03:58.040> it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.410 

it's<00:04:11.129> kind<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.340> like<00:04:11.489> bob<00:04:11.700> ross<00:04:11.970> painting

and<00:04:26.740> there<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.790> go<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.690> process<00:04:30.990> so

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
and there you go that is the process so

and there you go that is the process so
when<00:04:32.230> you're<00:04:32.350> done<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.830> will<00:04:32.920> be<00:04:32.980> able<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.280> see

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
when you're done you will be able to see

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.920 
when you're done you will be able to see
the<00:04:33.580> pollens<00:04:34.000> all<00:04:34.150> over<00:04:34.360> there<00:04:34.570> you'll<00:04:34.720> see<00:04:34.870> it

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
the pollens all over there you'll see it

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.380 
the pollens all over there you'll see it
all<00:04:35.050> sticking<00:04:35.410> to<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.220> silks<00:04:36.940> that<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.150> cut
