00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 One thing is with digital technology we can use frequency ranges 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 do not make any rides turn 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.909
 this abundance of the then KStG figures paper the product manager 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.809
 presented and we know that what about the new reference Molitor rden 22 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.300
 to explain 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.230
 the few would be the 22 food in principle 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.300
 inexpensive alternative to and radii 20 diadem 20 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.700
 was the very first digital CRC studio monitor worldwide 15 years ago 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.220
 and they just gave us the idea that we also have art costs so one 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.530
 want to offer cost-effective variant and diamonds 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.970
 Berlin she will be from the streets Pfeiffer "Yes the couple 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.420
 4200 lie 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.700
 it's easy to achieve why we use digital technology 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.400
 and think that it makes sense that Asus has companies on three 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.560
 Get in points 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.140
 One thing we can do with the digital technique is for Pänz Weichen 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.200
 They do not realize any currency making any NABU would sequence soft 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.750
 is fun in Trier 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.560
 We can turn here in vain then they ask Steinheid 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.080
 from up to 80 DB 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.670
 without trips Trier 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.020
 that means we have 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.570
 which we value very much because of simple time proper behavior in 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.480
 the crossover already can 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.340
 let's stick with the two fleeting behaviors 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 Digital technology also gives us the opportunity 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.300
 the drives of the two coaches that is from the book doner and from the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.310
 Work room 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.970
 on a level with which one can see here now is the Hochrhöner and also at 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.909
 all other than the testing subjects of the tweeter if you look a bit behind 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.360
 offset in front 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.850
 and thereby you have runtime difference between the two were free 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.970
 With the digital technology you have the opportunity to the farm to a bit too 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.560
 delay and virtually bring to the same level as the deep 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.259
 Midrange of drive per 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.009
 that also indicates there we have to quasi a temporal problem which in two ways 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.779
 to see 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:14.729
 mix now 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.359
 that revenge itself a little bit tirelessly but I ask how it works 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:18.959
 look at that 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.169
 the sound is not noticeable to me then as 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:26.719
 Do you have the studio shots to shell out higher Mascher 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.909
 so far he has had his fingers what is that better than in all the others 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.700
 than to be 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.220
 Generally the problem if the year is not a time right percent a nothing 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.220
 as an important game in the box 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.089
 no real derby tracking can be done 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.069
 So that means if you can imagine that 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.629
 if I spit now just into the camera and would 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.869
 say there comes my wife and both here 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.729
 and I can perceive with my heard if Dessau and Verdi now 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.729
 comes directly from the camera or just five inches next to it 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.069
 that is a run time difference of a few centimeters the bonds were 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.069
 arrive at different times 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.439
 Now I have to clear it up 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.179
 Time is sensitive to the PI time sensitive to our hearing 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.729
 and around 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.519
 two ways systems are simply company presence area and so on 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.769
 Current range separated that is somewhere between two and four kilos 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.949
 heart 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.199
 and it can 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.969
 a simply a time difference instead of Handel then I have no 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.879
 reasonable of the region 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.059
 Hertha now joined vocal recording 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.429
 straight from vocal vocal recordings 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:40.919
 So vocals are clearly vocally recorded 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.699
 Berlin but also otherwise so Menzel just not in the area where our hearing 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.679
 also works best and salt quite often 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.999
 Karben the classic 2d the scenes the separation between the two 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.309
 drivers 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.319
 and so from the autumn then temporal problem so so is Dr 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.229
 big honor advantage of 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.329
 Bad Neuenahr the 22 on the simple that we make the finished picture much better 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.559
 perceive better and in the end, of course, exactly 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.729
 can mix 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.839
 Absolutely Alsmann you can really hold the Ministry Center is in the middle 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.109
 and when I start 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.899
 the singer had really and exactly in the middle 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.590
 and not as 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.039
 somehow Sputnik processor 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.819
 3 December so you have the impression also Prof in two life issues or also 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.819
 register more 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.309
 the 1 s 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:33.899
 Important and Digital Daimler or Digital and Digital would have to be digital 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.490
 Equalization we here who reads theirs 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.410
 that is, we do when the box goes with the crossover 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.919
 and with the delay from the tweeter 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.919
 Let's make a measurement of the speaker 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.340
 and so is an expert example of how my peace is explained 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.800
 One kilo of autumn in the kids too much 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.150
 we take that 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.430
 these measurements 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.940
 and Windsor once that means we invest and fly food 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.360
 again in which the hosts enter 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.949
 under the SP they bicker forms 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.279
 Music signal 2 the PayPal a kita-place from that if I then again before 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.270
 the box Massa I have no more problems Tablets I really hold that 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.300
 is music signal calls 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.000
 that's not just a kilo heart like in this example, but when 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.020
 entire frequency range 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.529
 and also over the entire phases that was called from then on 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.379
 In retrospect Wind Systems succeed 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.370
 Sequence the Yaris and also rides a year 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.180
 So you enable me, so to speak 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.719
 Blood is just as good 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.129
 what mixed together 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.819
 Brunner so far preference monitor and on 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.159
 Of course, it's also great as a mastering uniform 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.309
 as with the monitor you just have the absolute control 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.659
 about the mix and what you are doing 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.719
 Anyone who really beats that for it and I say that 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.839
 Schlarmann easy to have already or when it comes out 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.530
 they have end of May it will appear in the trade for the company now still has 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.889
 a prototype is Norbert Siebel's series production should henceforth 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:07.629
 therefore travel 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.570
 if not soon 4200 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.500
 around fare and that is also the price of the road presented 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.260
 okay so I have with you for this really bus arrival 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.839
 explained 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.830
 we should be expanding yes 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.930
 Minute final whistle 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.559
 the one software from Karl Kamer 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:27.240
 Tunisia's body he Chur
