Hi everybody, Bohus here for FotodioxPro.com,
and in this video, we're going to explore

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.390
some of the lens mounting possibilities of
the Blackmagic URSA camera. Now we just came

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.119
back from NAB 2015, and not only were Blackmagic
showing off the URSA camera, they were showing

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.990
off the URSA Mini, a compact version of this
beastly guy. And what's cool is you can get

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.160
the camera in one of two lens mount options,
either a PL mount or an EF, a Canon mount.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.150
And I chose Canon because that opens you up
to a ton of lens mounting possibilities. For

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.680
me, filmmaking is about experimenting with
weirdo lenses, whether it's something that you

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.030
find at the camera shop or the thrift shop,
and through low-cost adapters you can add

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.210
almost any lens onto an URSA camera. Like,
for example in my hands here I've got a Canon FD

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.030
to EOS lens adapter. Canon FD, those are the
lenses that came before the EOS line, and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.299
there are tons of them out there--you can
get primes, you can get zooms, there's even

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.150
one soft focus lens that Canon made in the
FD mount--and all you do is just pop this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.230
guy onto your lens and pop it onto your camera
and you're ready to go with a bunch of very

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.690
affordable and yet really good looking lenses.
Now if you do want to go back to PL you can

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.440
use this adapter, this is a PL to EOS adapter,
the only thing is, you'll have to remove this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.350
tripod foot to fit this front structure, that's
just two Phillip screws. But just lock this

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.920
on and you can have PL lenses too. Here's
a really simple one--There are tons of great

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.140
Nikon lenses out in the world, one of the
best ones is the Nikon 14-24, it's an ultra

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.340
wide, very low distortion, very nice lens.
In order to mount this guy here's all you do:

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.780
as you can see the adapter's very very
thin, just line up the dots like you would

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.540
when you're mounting any other lens. There
we go, locked on. Now let's get this cover off,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.640
and line up the dots again,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.219
and there you go. Now this is a CinePro lens adapter,

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:20.099
which means it comes with this little handle
that you can screw in right here.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.340
This let's you control the aperture of the lens using
this cool little handle. And now you can use

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.620
a Nikon still lens as a cinema lens. And we've
got countless varieties of adapters, in fact

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.560
here's a list right now on your screen that
shows you all the kinds of lenses you can

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.120
adapt to the EF system, which means that your
URSA camera, whether you have the big one

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.230
or the mini one, is open to a whole wide world
of lens possibilities when you get an URSA

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.169
with an EF mount on the font. If you want
