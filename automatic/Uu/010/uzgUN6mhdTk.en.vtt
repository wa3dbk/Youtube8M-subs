a lot of creepiness happening in that
movie<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:35.730> think<00:04:36.090> that's<00:04:36.210> what<00:04:36.390> made<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.630> so

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
movie but I think that's what made it so

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.640 
movie but I think that's what made it so
different<00:04:38.820> than<00:04:39.240> other<00:04:39.480> movies<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.170> just<00:04:40.470> love

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
the sequels weren't as good as the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.820 
the sequels weren't as good as the
original<00:04:54.900> because<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.380> know<00:04:55.500> it's<00:04:55.680> really

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.529 
planning on doing a sequel or something
I<00:06:37.070> guess<00:06:37.100> it<00:06:37.400> never<00:06:37.490> really<00:06:37.850> worked<00:06:38.030> out<00:06:38.240> I

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
I guess it never really worked out I

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.480 
I guess it never really worked out I
don't<00:06:38.990> know<00:06:39.080> I'm<00:06:39.410> not<00:06:39.500> exactly<00:06:39.979> sure<00:06:40.340> if

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
don't know I'm not exactly sure if

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.219 
don't know I'm not exactly sure if
that's<00:06:40.759> true<00:06:40.850> or<00:06:41.210> not<00:06:41.360> if<00:06:41.509> you<00:06:41.630> guys<00:06:41.750> know<00:06:41.990> let

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
that's true or not if you guys know let

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:43.930 
that's true or not if you guys know let
me<00:06:42.350> know<00:06:42.500> but<00:06:42.979> I<00:06:43.160> really<00:06:43.550> think<00:06:43.729> that

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
me know but I really think that

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.790 
me know but I really think that
Anastasia<00:06:44.360> would<00:06:44.600> make<00:06:44.750> an<00:06:44.900> amazing<00:06:45.199> Broadway

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
Anastasia would make an amazing Broadway

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.700 
Anastasia would make an amazing Broadway
show<00:06:46.039> whoever<00:06:46.520> owns<00:06:46.789> the<00:06:46.970> rights<00:06:47.090> should<00:06:47.720> just

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
show whoever owns the rights should just

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.950 
show whoever owns the rights should just
make<00:06:49.160> it<00:06:49.310> into<00:06:49.580> a<00:06:49.610> Broadway<00:06:50.000> show<00:06:50.030> because<00:06:50.720> it

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
make it into a Broadway show because it

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.230 
make it into a Broadway show because it
shouldn't<00:06:51.350> be<00:06:51.620> over<00:06:52.130> I<00:06:52.340> think<00:06:52.430> that<00:06:52.970> it<00:06:53.090> has

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
shouldn't be over I think that it has

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.570 
shouldn't be over I think that it has
amazing<00:06:53.539> music<00:06:53.750> an<00:06:54.199> amazing<00:06:54.770> storyline<00:06:55.310> it

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
amazing music an amazing storyline it

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.200 
amazing music an amazing storyline it
has<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.510> big<00:06:56.810> elaborate<00:06:57.800> sets<00:06:58.460> I<00:06:58.970> mean

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
has the big elaborate sets I mean

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.279 
has the big elaborate sets I mean
there's<00:06:59.389> so<00:06:59.539> much<00:06:59.630> potential<00:06:59.990> with<00:07:00.260> that

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
there's so much potential with that

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.620 
there's so much potential with that
movie<00:07:00.740> to<00:07:01.010> be<00:07:01.039> made<00:07:01.370> into<00:07:01.850> a<00:07:02.030> show<00:07:02.330> I<00:07:02.570> think

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
movie to be made into a show I think

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.120 
movie to be made into a show I think
would<00:07:02.960> be<00:07:03.020> amazing<00:07:03.320> I<00:07:03.560> think<00:07:03.680> someone<00:07:04.100> should
