00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.779 
motion blur filter in Photoshop so I'm
gonna<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.619> boring<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.070> rather

busy<00:00:18.180> image<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.109> made<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> forest<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
busy image I made in a forest so the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420 
busy image I made in a forest so the
first<00:00:21.900> thing<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.920> duplicate

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
first thing I'm going to do is duplicate

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.269 
first thing I'm going to do is duplicate
this<00:00:23.670> background<00:00:23.939> layer<00:00:24.420> by<00:00:25.130> dragging<00:00:26.130> it

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this background layer by dragging it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.580 
this background layer by dragging it
down<00:00:27.060> onto<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.689> new<00:00:27.960> layer<00:00:28.380> icon<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:30.349> do<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
down onto this new layer icon I do this

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.020 
down onto this new layer icon I do this
because<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.369> preserve<00:00:32.579> this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
because I like to preserve this

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.940 
because I like to preserve this
background<00:00:33.270> layer<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.110> case<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> go

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
background layer in case I want to go

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
background layer in case I want to go
back<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.450> rename<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.230> new

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
back so I'm going to rename the new

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.330 
back so I'm going to rename the new
layer<00:00:38.059> motion<00:00:39.059> blur<00:00:41.809> okay<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.190> gonna

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
layer motion blur okay so I'm gonna

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.049 
layer motion blur okay so I'm gonna
select<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> filter<00:00:45.210> menu<00:00:45.800> blur<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.219> then

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
select the filter menu blur and then

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
select the filter menu blur and then
motion<00:00:48.899> blur<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.870> window<00:00:52.230> pops<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.770> here

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
motion blur and this window pops up here

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
motion blur and this window pops up here
and<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.430> allows<00:00:53.460> me<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.180> select<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and this allows me to select the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.700 
and this allows me to select the
direction<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> blur<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> could<00:00:58.500> change

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
direction of the blur so I could change

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.420 
direction of the blur so I could change
it<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.579> horizontal<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.430> but

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it to be horizontal if I want it to but

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
it to be horizontal if I want it to but
I<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> blur<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> same

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
I want the blur to go in the same

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.850 
I want the blur to go in the same
direction<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.939> trees<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.140> I'll<00:01:07.439> make<00:01:07.710> that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
direction as the trees so I'll make that

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.270 
direction as the trees so I'll make that
90<00:01:08.250> degrees<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.970> I've<00:01:09.780> selected<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> most

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
90 degrees and I've selected the most

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.380 
90 degrees and I've selected the most
blur<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.659> change<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.549> whatever

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
blur you can change that to be whatever

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.840 
blur you can change that to be whatever
you<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.619> taste<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.250> I'm

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you want it to be for your taste so I'm

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.109 
you want it to be for your taste so I'm
choosing<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.049> maximum<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.830> I'll<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.790> okay

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
choosing the maximum and I'll say okay

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.440 
choosing the maximum and I'll say okay
now<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> show<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
now what I want to show you is that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.899 
now what I want to show you is that
while<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.720> mimics<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.740> panning<00:01:29.490> technique

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
while this mimics a panning technique

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.539 
while this mimics a panning technique
that<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.780> camera<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.530> find<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.369> can

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that you could do in camera I find I can

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
that you could do in camera I find I can
always<00:01:32.729> tell<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.450> someone<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:33.900> done<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
always tell when someone has done this

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.469 
always tell when someone has done this
in<00:01:34.500> Photoshop<00:01:35.070> because<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.670> edges<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
in Photoshop because the edges of the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.789 
in Photoshop because the edges of the
image<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:37.049> look<00:01:37.290> right

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
image don't look right

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.069 
image don't look right
so<00:01:38.579> I'm<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.880> zoom<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> hundred

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
so I'm gonna zoom in to a hundred

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.690 
so I'm gonna zoom in to a hundred
percent<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> show<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.430> mean

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
percent here to show you what I mean

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.789 
percent here to show you what I mean
so<00:01:44.700> here's<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> middle<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> image<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so here's the middle of the image and it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.030 
so here's the middle of the image and it
has<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> pretty<00:01:47.340> even<00:01:47.700> blur<00:01:48.500> but<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> go

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
has a pretty even blur but when I go

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.270 
has a pretty even blur but when I go
down<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.759> bottom<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> image<00:01:51.799> all<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
down to the bottom of the image all of a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
down to the bottom of the image all of a
sudden<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.790> blur<00:01:54.030> isn't<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.630> even<00:01:55.049> anymore

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
sudden that blur isn't so even anymore

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.319 
sudden that blur isn't so even anymore
and<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.610> some<00:01:56.850> distinct

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and you can really see some distinct

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:05.380 
and you can really see some distinct
lines<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.250> I'll<00:02:02.399> zoom<00:02:02.610> back<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:03.180> again<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
lines so I'll zoom back out again and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
lines so I'll zoom back out again and
what<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.619> simply<00:02:08.220> crop<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
what I'm going to do is simply crop that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.040 
what I'm going to do is simply crop that
out<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.629> I'm<00:02:09.750> using<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.200> crop<00:02:10.410> tool

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.700 

and<00:02:13.320> I'm<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.710> gonna<00:02:13.800> go<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.710> crop

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
and I'm just gonna go like this and crop

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:27.230 
and I'm just gonna go like this and crop
out<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.090> edges<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> image<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:26.240> now

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
out the edges of the image like that now

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.320 
out the edges of the image like that now
while<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.380> I'll<00:02:28.500> add

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
while I'm here I think that I'll add

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.710 
while I'm here I think that I'll add
some<00:02:30.330> contrast<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:31.820> fair<00:02:32.820> bit<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.120> contrast

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
some contrast a fair bit of contrast

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.900 
some contrast a fair bit of contrast
actually<00:02:34.520> lower<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.790> brightness<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.390> little

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
actually lower the brightness a little

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.470 
actually lower the brightness a little
and<00:02:40.430> maybe<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.550> little<00:02:41.910> bit<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> levels<00:02:44.480> like

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
and maybe a little bit of levels like

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.230 
and maybe a little bit of levels like
that<00:02:46.010> much<00:02:47.010> better<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.550> think<00:02:47.910> that's<00:02:48.060> much

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
that much better I think that's much

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.890 
that much better I think that's much
more<00:02:48.420> interesting<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.550> another<00:02:51.150> thing<00:02:51.240> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
more interesting so another thing that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.230 
more interesting so another thing that
you<00:02:52.290> can<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.710> here<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.340> add<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.490> little<00:02:53.790> bit<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
you can do here to add a little bit of a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.340 
you can do here to add a little bit of a
twist<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:56.220> reveal<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.170> these

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
twist to it is to reveal one of these

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.410 
twist to it is to reveal one of these
trees<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.430> its<00:02:59.820> original<00:03:00.230> non<00:03:01.230> blurred<00:03:01.620> form

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
trees in its original non blurred form

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.520 
trees in its original non blurred form
so<00:03:03.420> what<00:03:03.600> I'm<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.900> do<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:04.170> create<00:03:04.410> a

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
so what I'm going to do is create a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.940 
so what I'm going to do is create a
layer<00:03:04.740> mask<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.750> going<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.140> define

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
layer mask and that is going to define

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.520 
layer mask and that is going to define
which<00:03:08.940> part<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> image<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.960> want<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.350> have

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
which part of the image I want to have

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.380 
which part of the image I want to have
the<00:03:10.740> blur<00:03:10.890> effect<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.490> which<00:03:11.730> part<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.150> don't

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the blur effect in which part I don't

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.560 
the blur effect in which part I don't
want<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.020> blur<00:03:13.200> effect<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.120> all<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> do

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
want to have the blur effect so all I do

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.020 
want to have the blur effect so all I do
to<00:03:15.840> add<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.140> layer<00:03:16.320> mask<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.980> click<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.790> icon

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
to add the layer mask is click this icon

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
to add the layer mask is click this icon
here<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:21.350> everything<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.650> white<00:03:22.980> and

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
here and everything that is white and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.820 
here and everything that is white and
then<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.180> layer<00:03:24.360> mask<00:03:24.660> will<00:03:25.020> show<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.470> effect

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
then the layer mask will show the effect

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.010 
then the layer mask will show the effect
and<00:03:26.280> half<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.610> want<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.970> take<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.270> effect<00:03:27.570> out<00:03:27.780> I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
and half I want to take the effect out I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.560 
and half I want to take the effect out I
simply<00:03:28.650> paint<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.070> black<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:30.570> I'm<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:31.080> to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
simply paint it black so I'm going to

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.290 
simply paint it black so I'm going to
select<00:03:33.570> my<00:03:33.780> paintbrush<00:03:34.730> make<00:03:35.730> my<00:03:35.910> foreground

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
select my paintbrush make my foreground

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.260 
select my paintbrush make my foreground
color<00:03:36.660> black<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:38.100> I'm<00:03:38.280> gonna<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.610> ahead<00:03:38.760> I'm

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
color black and I'm gonna go ahead I'm

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.330 
color black and I'm gonna go ahead I'm
gonna<00:03:40.170> increase<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.530> size<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> brush<00:03:41.280> a

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
gonna increase the size of the brush a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.760 
gonna increase the size of the brush a
bit<00:03:41.610> here<00:03:42.030> I'm<00:03:42.750> gonna<00:03:43.020> go<00:03:43.170> ahead<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.500> erase

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
bit here I'm gonna go ahead and erase

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:52.220 
bit here I'm gonna go ahead and erase
the<00:03:44.010> street

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.140 

now<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:52.920> can<00:03:53.129> probably<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:53.550> I'm<00:03:53.640> going<00:03:53.970> over

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
now you can probably see I'm going over

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.970 
now you can probably see I'm going over
the<00:03:54.420> edges<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.989> tree<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> little<00:03:55.560> bit<00:03:55.709> here

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
the edges of the tree a little bit here

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.729 
the edges of the tree a little bit here
but<00:03:56.160> I'll<00:03:56.519> fix<00:03:56.849> that<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.450> minute<00:03:57.739> sometimes

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
but I'll fix that in a minute sometimes

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.589 
but I'll fix that in a minute sometimes
with<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.280> blur<00:03:59.519> it's<00:03:59.879> a<00:04:00.000> little<00:04:00.209> bit<00:04:00.300> hard<00:04:00.540> to

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
with the blur it's a little bit hard to

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.259 
with the blur it's a little bit hard to
tell<00:04:00.950> where<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:01.980> edge<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.489> tree<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.879> so

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
tell where the edge of the tree is so

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.059 
tell where the edge of the tree is so
I'm<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.629> gonna<00:04:03.720> go<00:04:03.959> over<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.680> little<00:04:04.860> bit

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
I'm just gonna go over it a little bit

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.559 
I'm just gonna go over it a little bit
to<00:04:05.220> make<00:04:05.370> sure<00:04:05.580> I've<00:04:05.730> included<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.330> whole

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
to make sure I've included the whole

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.089 
to make sure I've included the whole
tree<00:04:09.200> okay<00:04:10.730> now<00:04:11.730> as<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.540> mentioned<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.800> white

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
tree okay now as I mentioned the white

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.550 
tree okay now as I mentioned the white
part<00:04:14.459> reveals<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.269> effect<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.169> black

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
part reveals the effect and the black

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.699 
part reveals the effect and the black
part<00:04:17.010> hides<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.760> effect<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:19.109> what<00:04:19.410> I'm<00:04:19.530> gonna

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
part hides the effect so what I'm gonna

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.360 
part hides the effect so what I'm gonna
do<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:20.370> switch<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.910> white<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:22.100> fix<00:04:23.100> these

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
do is switch to white and fix these

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.310 
do is switch to white and fix these
edges<00:04:23.760> where<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:23.970> went<00:04:24.240> over<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.720> over<00:04:25.200> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
edges where I went over the over the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.210 
edges where I went over the over the
edge<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.650> tree<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.700> switch<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.210> white<00:04:28.220> I'm

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
edge of the tree so switch to white I'm

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.270 
edge of the tree so switch to white I'm
going<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.520> zoom<00:04:29.729> in<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.060> bit<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.410> can<00:04:31.530> see<00:04:32.070> this

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
going to zoom in a bit so I can see this

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.070 
going to zoom in a bit so I can see this
better<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:34.010> reduce<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.280> size<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.880> my<00:04:36.060> brush

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.790 

quite<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.290> much<00:04:42.860> say<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:43.889> hundred<00:04:44.460> here<00:04:44.790> and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
quite that much say a hundred here and

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.700 
quite that much say a hundred here and
I'm<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:47.040> gonna<00:04:47.160> fix<00:04:47.580> these<00:04:47.790> edges<00:04:48.710> and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
I'm just gonna fix these edges and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.400 
I'm just gonna fix these edges and
essentially<00:04:50.639> I'm<00:04:50.880> painting<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.570> effect<00:04:51.990> back

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
essentially I'm painting the effect back

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.950 
essentially I'm painting the effect back
in<00:04:53.419> where<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:54.450> went<00:04:54.780> over<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.350> lines<00:04:59.810> you<00:05:00.810> might

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960
