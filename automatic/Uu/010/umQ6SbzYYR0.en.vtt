there I don't know who coined it the
bracket<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.530> death<00:03:29.739> but<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.340> was<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.060> know

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
bracket of death but it was it you know

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.670 
bracket of death but it was it you know
it<00:03:31.510> certainly<00:03:32.080> was<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.350> stack<00:03:33.070> bracket<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
it certainly was a stack bracket and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.840 
it certainly was a stack bracket and
whoever<00:03:35.680> came<00:03:35.920> out<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.250> bracket<00:03:36.610> i<00:03:36.640> think

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850
