 So the last episode was good for him 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350

 so I know that's okay then 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.229
 I want to do that 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.520
 so that you log in okay then 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.350

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.620
 provided of course provided 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.050

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.300
 not only supports people with 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 original minecraft so that lasts now 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.320
 short in the moment 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.860
 exactly 15 new version we will be 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.930
 again and again description you have 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:49.630
 a link will get you a folder 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:52.790
 that you take your baking with instances so take 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.460
 you can now find the multi folder 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.860
 the file created what that was 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.930
 Now that was the stated terry 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.440
 right here is an original minecraft 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.430
 so run the original if someone 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.760
 tutorial what the word beck download 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.680
 then you get a lot of files the 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.600
 you just have to mark everyone 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 look that well all are marked the 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.320
 Just copy and copy it 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.300
 shopping in the points folder then asks if 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.830
 something was just wanted to write 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.020
 process for all then activate 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.060
 copied here 130 megabytes 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.310
 she asks individual files also 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.769
 down here all of them and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.160
 copy and put that important 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.680
 Administrators have rights so now 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.120
 overwriting certain files 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.580
 Of course without revenue power 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.900
 does not work now then what 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.830
 I just wanted something right 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.860
 say maybe then set in when we do 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.100
 now then the start and again 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.489
 Deposits take that course now 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.440
 a little longer until it starts on your pc 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.950
 is to have a little jobs and 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.580
 so on 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.100
 forget is that will not run as 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.780
 you already need two to three 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.570
 java would have to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.760
 Show that the web works as we do 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.430
 see here the minecraft versions ford 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.790
 model or on-site if deep one 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.739
 installed and created 89 mods bauer and 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.720
 so on here is easy and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.700
 single player there is the let's play world 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.220
 already included you can then 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.030
 of course there is also a direct game 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.030
 for a certain time 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.780
 since pretty big start right where 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.790
 I ended the last episode because 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.790
 I have not played anything yet 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:02.390
 and you can continue right there 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:05.590
 play where I stopped just there 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.590
 continue where I left off 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.239
 this is all china, that's all 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.110
 stayed the same again 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.030
 run through 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.229
 also the whole will be there and have everything 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.479
 her and just as said this time this 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.080
 Full package also rocker zeiss and 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:30.889
 so on I can pay it for a short time 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:32.960
 the seed of squat times are here are 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:39.229
 who pays visible things rocker 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:43.789
 every fusion generator also the mobile 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.050
 I still hiding here the 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.800
 refuel 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.289
 here you have the whole 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.410
 stories and everything else in it 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.410
 contain 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.450
 so it's really one on one as well 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.770
 I play now 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.930
 Why I am in Taunusstein now 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.320
 just because I hurt this as 25 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.000
 So play will be official 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.950
 Of course I do not play unofficially 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.270
 of course continue is perhaps then 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.650
 one more time in the app to download but 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.650
 I do not do any more videos 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.210
 So I think that has it all 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.450
 you should not back at this motto 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.190
 Forget when your program is 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.190
 Of course, above it is just starting 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.930
 I do not have that as an autostadt 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.050
 Simply written in with monitoring 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.020
 and then it works all the same 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.419
 Textures are gone then means extremely gone 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.169
 you can find in the forum 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.880
 just drop by that's it 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:51.250
 finally ready 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:53.810
 similar to minimize that again here 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:58.510
 but that was it hopes 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:01.010
 have fun with this tutorial when asking yes 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.910
 but I answered 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.070
 questionable so rather a forum because there 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.510
 any amount is already over mine 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.160
 separate previous tutorial and us 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.170
 quite a few questions answered 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.270
 So first look in the forum before 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:19.670
 So your new questions are a lot of fun 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:24.250
 With this motto pack and see you 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.250
 then just let's play so people
