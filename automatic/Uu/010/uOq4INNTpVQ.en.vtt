scent<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.299> is<00:02:09.420> nothing<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.110> final

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
scent so this is nothing like the final

00:02:10.440 --> 00:03:37.630 
scent so this is nothing like the final
mix<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.880> gives<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> some<00:02:12.299> idea
