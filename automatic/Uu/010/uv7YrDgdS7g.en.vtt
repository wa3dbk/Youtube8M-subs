I was taking an old drilling bit and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
I was taking an old drilling bit and
that's<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.100> were<00:01:38.189> using<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.060> was

that's what they were using then I was

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.850 
that's what they were using then I was
heating<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.500> were<00:01:40.560> holding

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
heating it up and then they were holding

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
heating it up and then they were holding
out<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> pin<00:01:41.430> hitting<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> sledge

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
out on the pin hitting it with a sledge

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830 
out on the pin hitting it with a sledge
hammer<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.670> those<00:01:44.670> pins<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.689> get

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
and Ordos changing out to the mower
blades<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.869> course<00:01:58.140> those<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.500> become

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790
