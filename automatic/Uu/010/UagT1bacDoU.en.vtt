00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.290
 I care for the 4 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.899

 Percent at the vending machine and team reins to put on yes and no 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.119
 then back in time to be outside smoking one 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.869
 would not have been possible then 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.819
 Bieck once in a while now and again I would have made it in the meantime 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.189

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.189

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.729
 No, the telly is not 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.949
 Rust is the last 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.379

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.049

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.909
 Patients with Cora 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.669
 yesterday 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.249
 around 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.730
 a good deed said so 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.349
 now I am too 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.579
 I am enough pressure 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.889
 Hanks plays her now 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.049
 I'm not supposed to be too 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.559
 not smoking now 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.520
 if you went to sleep too long 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.019
 next morning 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.569

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.149
 gone to no one needs 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.519
 why is it that they continue to talk and have fun together? 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.279
 I read that 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:06.099
 around and sometime in the late afternoon percent said someone has to say to me 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.139
 Percent interest is roughly estimated 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.509
 that's not the case yet 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.939
 since then is not so 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:14.790

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.459
 his mirror 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.389

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.809
 important who else said on now 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.819
 the rest of the crew just made fun again to distract themselves 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.129
 Form always are very difficult 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.169
 I was breathed on the sovereign dismissed 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.990
 Percent with others together but what drunk 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.100

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.300
 Nothing 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.250
 I'm afraid 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.150
 Two big bikes are reduced to zero in the front 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.169

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.370
 I've been waiting for weeks for free so stood 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.529
 I did not listen to one 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:01.729
 not until today 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.729
 and it's been six years now 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.330
 the only one in life and I had when he came home and why 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.889

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:14.870
 own hand 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.990
 After all, my keyboard has caught the first day because there long-term save 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.680
 that somehow has automatism 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.919
 When I realized that I had to grin and around 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:26.990
 the wars 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.590
 then I dreamed for a while every six months or so that I did 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.279
 catching myself smoking 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.679
 because I have to because I am simply reported would have reported you need 

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:37.550
 but not 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.849
 why did you have the cigarette somehow I thought that in a dream and then 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.319
 woke up 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.830

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.149
 no changes no al Qaeda no withdrawal symptoms nothing 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.749
 I should be able to touch 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.210
 08 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.210
 I own 300 meters but not one and 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.129
 Altena 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.680
 who was really I have 300 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.629
 but I can 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.349
 Minute and more 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.740
 not the round 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.460
 Number 9 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.939
 I hate life 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:22.759
 hatred 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.029
 absolute 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.930
 I hate to win 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.550

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.779

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.639
 Nevertheless, every day I have to do it every day 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:41.969
 with as men 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.209
 you have to be creative if you are with someone who has ice-hold you have to 

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:46.309
 be creative 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.409
 I actually love Granny all the time

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.469
 he is always right in matters she is not right 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:55.099
 Recently she told me 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.909
 800 milliliters without a badge 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.739
 One of the perpetrators of the post release was 50 meters 

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:02.809
 to reach 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:05.770
 I tried to explain it at short notice 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.849
 In the end I said a good lie was a blatant lie 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:10.689
 absolutely smooth lie 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:13.939
 there will be no eliminate that I tell 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:17.389
 it's a lie 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.389
 with Alzheimer's you just learn to do things you do not like 

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.899
 Massing I am always right 

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:25.879
 Although my girlfriend are firmly her 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.789
 My girlfriend GÃ¼nay said smoke 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:31.119
 if I'm not right 

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:32.889
 I rode so long 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:35.979
 until the other one is so diligent that I'm right 

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:38.199
 I do not know if that's a fact 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.119
 The fact is that he is said 

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:42.610
 if it is true 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.889
