00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.509
 all the strings 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.229

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 I only want to use the last four races 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 but be careful when you play goal block the first two 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.830
 then you will need a major gift 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.420

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.350
 with stress fingers 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.479
