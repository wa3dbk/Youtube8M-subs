I<00:02:31.069> bolted<00:02:31.489> together

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
I bolted together

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.900 
I bolted together
there's<00:02:33.470> bolts<00:02:33.800> down<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.760> there's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
there's bolts down here and there's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.589 
there's bolts down here and there's
bolts<00:02:35.209> up<00:02:35.360> here<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:36.560> hold<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.420> this

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
bolts up here that hold this on but this

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.830 
bolts up here that hold this on but this
is<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:39.129> quarter-inch<00:02:40.129> because<00:02:40.849> I<00:02:40.879> might<00:02:41.450> use

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
is a quarter-inch because I might use

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.570 
is a quarter-inch because I might use
just<00:02:42.109> eighth<00:02:42.319> inch<00:02:42.620> there's<00:02:43.040> too<00:02:43.280> much<00:02:43.430> flex

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
just eighth inch there's too much flex

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.040 
just eighth inch there's too much flex
when<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.940> would<00:02:45.000> press<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.420> medal<00:02:45.780> into<00:02:45.960> the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
when I would press the medal into the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.780 
when I would press the medal into the
grinder<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.710> would<00:02:46.830> flex<00:02:47.100> too<00:02:47.340> much<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.730> to

way it's way over here out of the way
from<00:04:24.360> with<00:04:24.510> my<00:04:24.750> bandsaw<00:04:25.760> so<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.990> that's<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
from with my bandsaw so and that's the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.640 
from with my bandsaw so and that's the
only<00:04:28.860> thing<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:29.190> have<00:04:29.430> plugged<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.750> there<00:04:31.020> as

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
only thing I have plugged in to there as

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.580 
only thing I have plugged in to there as
well<00:04:32.040> at<00:04:32.760> some<00:04:33.060> point<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.900> can<00:04:34.080> see<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.500> was

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
well at some point you can see it was

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.530 
well at some point you can see it was
plugged<00:04:34.890> into<00:04:35.070> here<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.430> bumped<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.330> throw

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
plugged into here I bumped it and throw

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.170 
plugged into here I bumped it and throw
that<00:04:36.780> out<00:04:36.840> for<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.440> that's<00:04:38.220> not<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.520> big<00:04:38.669> deal<00:04:38.700> it

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
that out for it that's not a big deal it

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.630 
that out for it that's not a big deal it
still<00:04:39.510> works

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
still works

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.220 
still works
so<00:04:41.640> there's<00:04:41.850> my<00:04:42.000> angle<00:04:42.210> grinder<00:04:42.240> itself<00:04:42.960> so

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
so there's my angle grinder itself so

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.770 
so there's my angle grinder itself so
the<00:04:43.410> big<00:04:43.590> question<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:44.160> why<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.480> have<00:04:45.630> my

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
the big question is why so I have my

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.990 
the big question is why so I have my
angle<00:04:46.110> grinder<00:04:46.290> set<00:04:46.650> up<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.919> way<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.400> know

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
angle grinder set up that way you know

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.140 
angle grinder set up that way you know
why<00:04:48.210> not<00:04:48.360> just<00:04:48.419> clamp<00:04:49.350> my<00:04:49.590> blade<00:04:50.580> or<00:04:51.060> my<00:04:51.330> steel

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
why not just clamp my blade or my steel

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.750 
why not just clamp my blade or my steel
to<00:04:52.360> my<00:04:52.600> vice<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.230> put<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.160> angle<00:04:54.340> grinder<00:04:54.520> in

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
to my vice and put the angle grinder in

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.660 
to my vice and put the angle grinder in
my<00:04:54.820> hand<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.450> go<00:04:55.720> along<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.260> way<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.680> I

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
my hand and go along it that way and I

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.760 
my hand and go along it that way and I
found<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.330> it's<00:04:58.630> easier<00:04:59.110> for<00:04:59.140> me<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.410> move<00:04:59.620> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
found it it's easier for me to move the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.120 
found it it's easier for me to move the
blade<00:05:00.130> with<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.760> steel<00:05:01.560> rather<00:05:02.560> than<00:05:02.800> for<00:05:03.010> me

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
blade with the steel rather than for me

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.890 
blade with the steel rather than for me
to<00:05:03.250> move<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.640> integrator<00:05:04.090> itself<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:06.900> it's

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
to move the integrator itself and it's

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.230 
to move the integrator itself and it's
just<00:05:08.170> easier<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:08.920> more<00:05:09.040> effective<00:05:09.370> more

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
just easier and more effective more

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.390 
just easier and more effective more
efficient<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.110> found<00:05:11.470> when<00:05:12.100> I<00:05:12.130> first

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
efficient that I found when I first

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.390 
efficient that I found when I first
started<00:05:12.700> off<00:05:12.790> making<00:05:13.330> knives<00:05:13.860> all<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:14.920> had<00:05:15.280> was

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
started off making knives all I had was

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.690 
started off making knives all I had was
the<00:05:15.550> Engel<00:05:15.820> grinder<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.390> a<00:05:16.870> 1<00:05:17.080> by<00:05:17.230> 30<00:05:17.560> and<00:05:17.890> a

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
the Engel grinder and a 1 by 30 and a

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.840 
the Engel grinder and a 1 by 30 and a
grinder<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.240> found<00:05:19.630> was<00:05:20.530> a<00:05:20.860> lot<00:05:21.130> more<00:05:21.310> efficient

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
grinder I found was a lot more efficient

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.180 
grinder I found was a lot more efficient
and<00:05:22.270> I'm<00:05:22.390> are<00:05:22.540> quicker<00:05:22.840> plate<00:05:23.290> on<00:05:23.410> my<00:05:23.440> blades<00:05:23.860> I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
and I'm are quicker plate on my blades I

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.130 
and I'm are quicker plate on my blades I
tried<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.060> lot<00:05:25.270> of<00:05:25.330> different<00:05:25.420> types<00:05:25.930> of

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
tried a lot of different types of

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.340 
tried a lot of different types of
cutting<00:05:26.950> utensils<00:05:27.460> cutting<00:05:27.940> tools<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.600> know

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
cutting utensils cutting tools you know

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.230 
cutting utensils cutting tools you know
hacksaw<00:05:29.950> obviously<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.520> takes<00:05:30.550> forever<00:05:30.940> and

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
hacksaw obviously that takes forever and

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.150 
hacksaw obviously that takes forever and
where's<00:05:32.080> your<00:05:32.290> arms<00:05:32.590> down<00:05:32.740> after<00:05:32.980> you<00:05:33.040> get<00:05:33.130> a

where's your arms down after you get a

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.850 
where's your arms down after you get a
blade<00:05:33.400> gun<00:05:33.670> I've<00:05:34.270> tried<00:05:34.540> my<00:05:34.660> bandsaw<00:05:34.960> with<00:05:35.830> a

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
blade gun I've tried my bandsaw with a

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.360 
blade gun I've tried my bandsaw with a
bi-metal<00:05:36.550> blade<00:05:37.060> inside<00:05:37.510> that<00:05:37.810> bandsaw<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.680> I

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
bi-metal blade inside that bandsaw and I

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.580 
bi-metal blade inside that bandsaw and I
really<00:05:39.610> only<00:05:39.670> got<00:05:39.970> through<00:05:40.270> maybe<00:05:41.260> three

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
really only got through maybe three

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.190 
really only got through maybe three

blades or so before or free knife blade
before<00:05:44.410> the<00:05:44.950> bandsaw<00:05:45.760> blade<00:05:46.060> became<00:05:46.660> too<00:05:46.870> dull

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
before the bandsaw blade became too dull

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
lot of heat within the blade that I was

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.950 
lot of heat within the blade that I was
cutting<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:54.160> it<00:05:54.310> was<00:05:54.460> it<00:05:54.670> was<00:05:54.730> hard<00:05:54.910> to<00:05:55.060> handle

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960

shaking<00:06:02.380> it<00:06:02.500> for<00:06:02.650> company<00:06:03.600> now<00:06:04.600> it's<00:06:04.840> just<00:06:05.110> a

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
shaking it for company now it's just a

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.900 
shaking it for company now it's just a
regular<00:06:05.560> wood<00:06:05.770> band<00:06:06.010> saw<00:06:06.160> and<00:06:06.310> that<00:06:06.580> probably

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
regular wood band saw and that probably

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.550 
regular wood band saw and that probably
has<00:06:07.060> a<00:06:07.090> lot<00:06:07.180> to<00:06:07.210> do<00:06:07.390> with<00:06:07.420> it<00:06:07.720> but<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:08.140> tried<00:06:08.410> to

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
has a lot to do with it but I tried to

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.350 
has a lot to do with it but I tried to
buy<00:06:08.950> metal<00:06:09.250> blade<00:06:09.460> and<00:06:09.700> didn't<00:06:09.940> work<00:06:10.090> for<00:06:10.120> me

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
buy metal blade and didn't work for me

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.380 
buy metal blade and didn't work for me
also<00:06:11.080> use<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:11.470> jig<00:06:11.710> saw<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:12.640> jigsaw<00:06:13.060> working

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
also use a jig saw the jigsaw working

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.230 
also use a jig saw the jigsaw working
very<00:06:13.570> well<00:06:13.660> but<00:06:14.500> it<00:06:14.800> cost<00:06:15.640> us<00:06:15.820> an<00:06:15.970> up-and-down

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
very well but it cost us an up-and-down

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.300 
very well but it cost us an up-and-down
motion<00:06:16.540> they<00:06:16.960> would<00:06:17.140> vibrate<00:06:17.350> my<00:06:17.650> whole<00:06:17.860> table

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
motion they would vibrate my whole table

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.010 
motion they would vibrate my whole table
and<00:06:18.340> very<00:06:18.790> difficult<00:06:19.120> for<00:06:19.420> me<00:06:19.510> the<00:06:19.600> clamp<00:06:19.840> is

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
and very difficult for me the clamp is

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.590 
and very difficult for me the clamp is
steel<00:06:20.260> down<00:06:22.350> see<00:06:23.350> what<00:06:23.530> else<00:06:23.680> did<00:06:23.800> I<00:06:23.860> try<00:06:24.600> and

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
steel down see what else did I try and

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.630 
steel down see what else did I try and
like<00:06:25.750> I<00:06:25.840> said<00:06:26.020> is<00:06:26.170> I<00:06:26.440> got<00:06:26.770> the<00:06:26.890> angle<00:06:27.070> grinder<00:06:27.190> I

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
like I said is I got the angle grinder I

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.520 
like I said is I got the angle grinder I
tried<00:06:28.180> the<00:06:28.330> Englander<00:06:28.780> and<00:06:28.810> it<00:06:29.050> worked<00:06:29.290> so

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
tried the Englander and it worked so

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.500 
tried the Englander and it worked so
much<00:06:29.680> better<00:06:29.970> while<00:06:30.970> going<00:06:31.180> through<00:06:31.480> a

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
much better while going through a

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.150 
much better while going through a
website<00:06:31.990> I<00:06:32.200> found<00:06:33.000> some<00:06:34.000> shop<00:06:34.270> tools<00:06:35.160> some

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.100 
he was using it to cut the relief cut in
the<00:06:43.930> blade<00:06:45.120> looks<00:06:46.120> like<00:06:46.330> how<00:06:46.480> you<00:06:46.540> have<00:06:46.810> right

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
the blade looks like how you have right

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.560 
the blade looks like how you have right
here<00:06:47.440> in<00:06:48.250> the<00:06:48.340> blade<00:06:48.610> itself<00:06:49.060> and<00:06:49.300> that's<00:06:49.360> what

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
here in the blade itself and that's what

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.780 
here in the blade itself and that's what
he<00:06:49.720> was<00:06:49.840> using<00:06:50.020> it<00:06:50.200> for<00:06:50.440> and<00:06:50.980> he<00:06:51.460> had<00:06:51.580> a<00:06:51.610> table

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
he was using it for and he had a table

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.940 
he was using it for and he had a table
set<00:06:52.150> up<00:06:52.180> and<00:06:52.330> you<00:06:52.660> just<00:06:52.900> me<00:06:53.260> and<00:06:53.530> be<00:06:53.710> done<00:06:53.740> with

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
set up and you just me and be done with

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.130 
set up and you just me and be done with
it<00:06:54.250> and<00:06:54.460> I<00:06:55.330> thought<00:06:55.600> that<00:06:55.660> would<00:06:55.840> be<00:06:55.900> a<00:06:55.990> good

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
it and I thought that would be a good

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.790 
it and I thought that would be a good
idea<00:06:56.260> to<00:06:56.590> bolt<00:06:56.920> it<00:06:57.010> to<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.190> table<00:06:57.910> and

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
idea to bolt it to the table and

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.930 
idea to bolt it to the table and
use<00:06:59.129> it<00:06:59.840> just<00:07:00.840> cut<00:07:01.020> my<00:07:01.169> blades<00:07:01.550> the<00:07:02.550> grinding

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
use it just cut my blades the grinding

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.119 
use it just cut my blades the grinding

disk itself I get really cheap at local
hardware<00:07:05.430> store<00:07:05.789> and<00:07:06.060> there<00:07:06.750> are<00:07:06.810> a<00:07:06.840> lot<00:07:06.870> of

one disk I think that's a lot cheaper or
more<00:07:16.919> cost-effective<00:07:17.789> than<00:07:17.819> using<00:07:18.479> my<00:07:19.139> to<00:07:19.860> buy

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009 
more cost-effective than using my to buy
