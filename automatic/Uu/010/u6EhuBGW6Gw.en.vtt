in<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.279> quick<00:00:17.550> tip<00:00:17.730> video<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.359> want<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.660> talk

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
in this quick tip video we want to talk

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109 
in this quick tip video we want to talk
about<00:00:18.869> head<00:00:19.439> glitching<00:00:19.710> new<00:00:20.490> benefit<00:00:20.910> for

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
about head glitching new benefit for

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.820 
about head glitching new benefit for
mechanics<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.439> effectively

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
mechanics and what you can effectively

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.269 
mechanics and what you can effectively
do<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.310> counter<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.590> you<00:00:25.590> probably<00:00:25.949> have

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
do to counter that as you probably have

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
do to counter that as you probably have
noticed<00:00:26.460> already<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.210> infantry<00:00:27.720> players<00:00:28.199> get

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
noticed already if infantry players get

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.250 
noticed already if infantry players get
hit<00:00:28.710> state<00:00:29.099> which<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> jerk<00:00:29.880> around<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
hit state which and jerk around and to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.130 
hit state which and jerk around and to
duck<00:00:31.529> down<00:00:31.710> their<00:00:31.980> heads<00:00:32.540> that<00:00:33.540> doesn't<00:00:34.050> look

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
duck down their heads that doesn't look

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.319 
duck down their heads that doesn't look
too<00:00:34.320> dramatic<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.100> point<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.640> has<00:00:36.090> its

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
too dramatic at this point but has its

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
too dramatic at this point but has its
relevance<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.410> infantry<00:00:37.860> player<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
relevance if that infantry player is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.160 
relevance if that infantry player is
using<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> piece<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.969> cover<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.629> allows<00:00:39.960> him

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
using a piece of cover that allows him

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.190 
using a piece of cover that allows him
to<00:00:40.200> perform<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> so-called<00:00:41.129> head<00:00:41.610> glitching

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
to perform the so-called head glitching

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
to perform the so-called head glitching
the<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.739> works<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.250> bullets

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the way that this works is that bullets

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.850 
the way that this works is that bullets
aren't<00:00:45.480> actually<00:00:45.899> fired<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> weapons

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
aren't actually fired from the weapons

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
aren't actually fired from the weapons
that<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.219> models<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.820> holding<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.780> would

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that the models are holding which would

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.990 
that the models are holding which would
be<00:00:49.110> behind<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.649> piece<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.980> cover<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
be behind that piece of cover here but I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
be behind that piece of cover here but I
actually<00:00:51.390> fired<00:00:51.660> from<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> eyes<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
actually fired from the eyes of the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
actually fired from the eyes of the
player<00:00:53.160> now<00:00:54.149> let's<00:00:54.539> look<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.930> happens<00:00:54.960> if

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
player now let's look at what happens if

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.139 
player now let's look at what happens if
the<00:00:55.469> same<00:00:55.710> player<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.309> using<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> piece

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the same player that's using the piece

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.450 
the same player that's using the piece
of<00:00:57.270> cover<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.840> being<00:00:58.379> fired<00:00:58.649> upon<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.250> soon

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
of cover is being fired upon in as soon

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
of cover is being fired upon in as soon
as<00:00:59.579> he<00:00:59.670> gets<00:00:59.850> shot<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> head<00:01:00.420> he<00:01:00.629> ducks

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
as he gets shot in the head he ducks

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.219 
as he gets shot in the head he ducks
down<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:02.399> literally<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.359> vulnerable<00:01:03.989> for

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
down and is literally and vulnerable for

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.859 
down and is literally and vulnerable for
split<00:01:04.559> second<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> apply<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
split second here so if you apply the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
split second here so if you apply the
basic<00:01:07.409> damage<00:01:07.920> model<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.369> most<00:01:08.610> assault

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
basic damage model that most assault

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.200 
basic damage model that most assault
rifles<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.960> example<00:01:10.320> age<00:01:10.470> 23<00:01:10.950> 25<00:01:11.729> damage

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
rifles have for example age 23 25 damage

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.190 
rifles have for example age 23 25 damage
up<00:01:12.510> close<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.880> over<00:01:14.880> medium<00:01:15.240> distances<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
up close but over medium distances like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130 
up close but over medium distances like
10<00:01:16.560> meters<00:01:16.890> plus<00:01:17.189> three<00:01:18.030> head<00:01:18.240> shots<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.960> be

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
10 meters plus three head shots would be

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.170 
10 meters plus three head shots would be
needed<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.040> kill<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> guy<00:01:20.520> that's<00:01:20.820> using<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
needed to kill the guy that's using the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
needed to kill the guy that's using the
head<00:01:21.360> glitch<00:01:21.600> because<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> damage<00:01:22.890> drop

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
head glitch because of the damage drop

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.870 
head glitch because of the damage drop
off<00:01:23.400> over<00:01:23.670> distance<00:01:24.799> usually<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.520> will<00:01:26.700> land

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
off over distance usually you will land

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.090 
off over distance usually you will land
two<00:01:27.360> head<00:01:27.570> shots<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:28.140> getting<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> third<00:01:28.890> end

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
two head shots but getting the third end

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
two head shots but getting the third end
is<00:01:29.220> increasingly<00:01:29.820> difficult<00:01:30.060> simply<00:01:30.600> because

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
is increasingly difficult simply because

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.190 
is increasingly difficult simply because
the<00:01:31.110> player<00:01:31.380> model<00:01:31.710> ducks<00:01:31.950> down<00:01:32.509> even<00:01:33.509> using

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the player model ducks down even using

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.749 
the player model ducks down even using
high<00:01:34.350> rate<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> fire<00:01:34.799> weapons<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> famas

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
high rate of fire weapons like the famas

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.560 
high rate of fire weapons like the famas
here<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.770> quite<00:01:37.770> difficult<00:01:38.570> since

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
here this is quite difficult since

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
here this is quite difficult since
hitting<00:01:39.990> three<00:01:40.350> head<00:01:40.560> shots<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.250> quick

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
hitting three head shots and quick

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.060 
hitting three head shots and quick
succession<00:01:42.119> seems<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.860> quite<00:01:43.860> difficult

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
succession seems to be a quite difficult

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
succession seems to be a quite difficult
task<00:01:44.490> our<00:01:44.759> quick<00:01:45.030> tip<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.509> regard<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
task our quick tip in this regard is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.520 
task our quick tip in this regard is
pretty<00:01:46.770> simple<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.310> try<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.119> scar-h<00:01:48.720> this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
pretty simple just try the scar-h this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
pretty simple just try the scar-h this
one<00:01:49.740> has<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> different<00:01:50.189> damage<00:01:50.700> model<00:01:51.030> when

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
one has a different damage model when

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.690 
one has a different damage model when
compared<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> other<00:01:51.990> assault<00:01:52.560> rifles
