00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
test for them because in a way they got

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.840 
test for them because in a way they got
found<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.110> yet<00:00:37.320> last<00:00:37.739> year<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.520> way<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
found out yet last year the way that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.220

Chelsea<00:00:39.239> played<00:00:39.510> them<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.840> didn't<00:00:40.110> really

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Chelsea played them they didn't really

have<00:00:40.350> an<00:00:40.620> answer<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:43.260> know<00:00:43.320> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
have an answer and the you know it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
have an answer and the you know it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
a planet they haven't got a plan B so if

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
a planet they haven't got a plan B so if
you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.480> keep<00:00:48.690> them<00:00:48.870> away<00:00:49.440> from<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.920> keep<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you can keep them away from go keep it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.729 
you can keep them away from go keep it
tight<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> middle<00:00:51.690> make<00:00:52.199> sure<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> mess

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
tight in the middle make sure the mess

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.459 
tight in the middle make sure the mess
is<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.129> too<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> ball<00:00:54.350> well<00:00:55.350> then

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
is not too much on the ball well then

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.720 
is not too much on the ball well then
you<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> chance<00:00:55.980> against<00:00:56.340> him<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you have a chance against him and they

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.700 
you have a chance against him and they
have<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.960> come<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.530> an

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
have just they have to come up with an

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
have just they have to come up with an
alternative<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.820> if<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.120> good<00:01:00.270> test<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.629> our

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
alternative as if a good test for our

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200 
alternative as if a good test for our
lads<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.219> Wednesday<00:01:02.219> night<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:02.969> it's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
lads on Wednesday night because it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.240 
lads on Wednesday night because it's
still<00:01:04.110> obviously<00:01:04.530> find<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.890> our<00:01:05.010> way<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
still obviously find in our way of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.950 
still obviously find in our way of
preseason<00:01:05.640> he's<00:01:05.939> still<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.240> quite<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.479> yet

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
preseason he's still not quite there yet

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.679 
preseason he's still not quite there yet
and<00:01:07.189> similar<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> them<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and similar to them and that so it's you

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.990 
and similar to them and that so it's you
can<00:01:09.869> measure<00:01:10.080> yourself<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.680> where<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.950> are

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
can measure yourself to where you are

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.250 
can measure yourself to where you are
pre-season<00:01:12.000> enough<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> chase<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
pre-season enough you have to chase the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870 
pre-season enough you have to chase the
ball<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.220> big<00:01:14.430> big<00:01:14.640> problem

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
ball and that's that's a big big problem

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
ball and that's that's a big big problem
you<00:01:15.119> face<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> play<00:01:15.810> Barcelona<00:01:16.320> when

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you face when you play Barcelona when

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
you face when you play Barcelona when
you<00:01:16.950> start<00:01:17.220> chasing<00:01:17.460> well<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.659> spend<00:01:18.930> all

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
you start chasing well you spend all

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.450 
you start chasing well you spend all
your<00:01:19.200> energy<00:01:19.259> once<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> ball

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
your energy once you get the ball

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.240 
your energy once you get the ball
they're<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.390> quick<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.380> putting<00:01:22.799> pressure<00:01:23.070> on

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
they're so quick and putting pressure on

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
they're so quick and putting pressure on
you<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.330> within<00:01:24.570> five<00:01:24.689> passes<00:01:25.439> they

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you and you know within five passes they

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
you and you know within five passes they
need<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.700> must<00:01:27.030> have

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
need to have that of they they must have

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.630 
need to have that of they they must have
the<00:01:27.360> ball<00:01:27.540> back<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:29.040> go<00:01:29.220> back<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the ball back if not they go back and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.789 
the ball back if not they go back and
they<00:01:29.700> save<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> preserve<00:01:30.540> their<00:01:30.960> energy<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
they save and preserve their energy so

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260 
they save and preserve their energy so
it's<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.220> sort<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:32.909> thought<00:01:33.240> out

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's really sort of a well thought out

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
it's really sort of a well thought out
plan<00:01:33.420> where<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> player<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.950> don't<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
plan where as a player you don't get to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
plan where as a player you don't get to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
see you obviously travel an awful lot

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359

go to we're behind the scenes now so we

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.249 
go to we're behind the scenes now so we

actually see an awful lot more he's it's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.690 
actually see an awful lot more he's it's
different<00:01:46.530> when<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.920> travel<00:01:47.310> when<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.579> look

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
different when we travel when you look

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.910 
different when we travel when you look
at<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> first<00:01:48.119> team<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.649> staff

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
at the first team now and and the staff

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.380 
at the first team now and and the staff
behind<00:01:50.100> them<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.119> sports

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
behind them and you know sports
scientists<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.259> all<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> lot

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
scientists and all that it's it's a lot

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460 
scientists and all that it's it's a lot
more<00:01:53.729> professional<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.689> suppose<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.140> world

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
more professional I suppose is the world

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.450 
more professional I suppose is the world
even<00:01:55.649> though<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.890> professional<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.369> our

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
even though it was professional in our

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.270 
even though it was professional in our
day<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.880> gone<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> new<00:01:57.360> level<00:01:57.540> enough

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
day and it's gone to a new level enough

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.830 
day and it's gone to a new level enough
but<00:01:59.280> off<00:01:59.399> behind<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.790> scenes<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.750> meet

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
but off behind the scenes we get to meet

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
but off behind the scenes we get to meet
the<00:02:00.990> fans<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.409> well<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:01.950> anywhere<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the fans as well I think anywhere in the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.819 
the fans as well I think anywhere in the
world<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.909> go<00:02:03.200> United<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.290> such<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> huge

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
world now you go United have such a huge

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
world now you go United have such a huge
following<00:02:05.060> particularly<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> Far<00:02:06.329> East<00:02:06.360> we

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
following particularly the Far East we

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.999 
following particularly the Far East we
all<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.649> always<00:02:07.770> has

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
all know about that but there always has

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.529 
all know about that but there always has
been<00:02:08.039> open<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> Scandinavian<00:02:09.509> countries

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
been open in the Scandinavian countries

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.290 
been open in the Scandinavian countries
even<00:02:10.440> gone<00:02:10.770> back<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> 80s<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.760> 70s<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
even gone back to the 80s and 70s I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.130 
even gone back to the 80s and 70s I
think<00:02:12.450> there's<00:02:12.569> always<00:02:12.690> been<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> big

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
think there's always been a big

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.759 
think there's always been a big
following<00:02:13.290> here

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
following here

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.350 
following here
I<00:02:13.799> think<00:02:14.189> it's<00:02:14.280> gonna<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.579> draw<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.030> think

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
I think it's gonna be a draw I think

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.000 
I think it's gonna be a draw I think
it's<00:02:15.720> pretty<00:02:16.500> season<00:02:16.890> game<00:02:17.069> it's<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it's pretty season game it's it's a the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.589 
it's pretty season game it's it's a the
result<00:02:20.459> doesn't<00:02:20.640> really<00:02:20.849> matter<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.329> it's<00:02:21.480> a

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
result doesn't really matter but it's a

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.280 
result doesn't really matter but it's a
lot<00:02:21.840> about<00:02:22.079> not<00:02:22.319> losing<00:02:23.390> phase<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:25.170> know

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
lot about not losing phase and you know

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.740 
lot about not losing phase and you know
you<00:02:26.129> know<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.400> game<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.970> game<00:02:27.209> will<00:02:27.510> be

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
you know the game the game will be

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.580 
you know the game the game will be
watched<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:30.109> people<00:02:31.109> will<00:02:31.319> take<00:02:31.530> notice

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
watched and people will take notice

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.589 
watched and people will take notice
because<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.790> Manchester<00:02:33.269> United

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
because it is Manchester United

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.050 
because it is Manchester United
Barcelona<00:02:33.689> I<00:02:34.109> think<00:02:34.349> both<00:02:34.500> teams<00:02:34.909> wants<00:02:35.909> to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
Barcelona I think both teams wants to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.339 
Barcelona I think both teams wants to
come<00:02:36.239> out<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.689> game

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
come out of this game

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.670 
come out of this game
not<00:02:37.829> having<00:02:38.099> lost<00:02:38.909> massively<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.659> so<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> think

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
not having lost massively and so I think

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.039 
not having lost massively and so I think
it's<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.099> be<00:02:41.220> true<00:02:41.400> yeah<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.390> agree<00:02:42.900> with

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
it's going to be true yeah I agree with

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.839 
it's going to be true yeah I agree with
that<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.349> particularly<00:02:43.980> preseason<00:02:44.489> both

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
that and particularly preseason both

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.059 
that and particularly preseason both
both<00:02:45.750> teams<00:02:45.989> are<00:02:46.109> not<00:02:46.200> quite<00:02:46.409> there<00:02:46.650> yet<00:02:46.709> you

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
both teams are not quite there yet you

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.099 
both teams are not quite there yet you
know<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.310> mean<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.730> terror<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.389> often<00:02:48.629> teams<00:02:48.870> up

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
and usually when you get to top teams

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.220
