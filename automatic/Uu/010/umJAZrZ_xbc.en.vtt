00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.990
 toothpick 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.550

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.820
 so calibrated that it does not stop so that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.470

 son suffering red 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.580

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.580
 little more then 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.620
 chance
