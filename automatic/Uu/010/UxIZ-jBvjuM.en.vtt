today<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.399> want<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.939> give<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.179> an<00:00:03.570> overview<00:00:04.080> of

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
today I want to give you an overview of

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.610 
today I want to give you an overview of
Awesome<00:00:05.250> whispers<00:00:05.819> which<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.080> first<00:00:07.379> time

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
Awesome whispers which is the first time

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.040 
Awesome whispers which is the first time
I've<00:00:07.859> attempted<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.610> use<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.599> contiguous

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
I've attempted to use the contiguous

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.879 
I've attempted to use the contiguous
method<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.010> shoulder<00:00:11.639> construction<00:00:12.320> now<00:00:13.320> it's

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
method of shoulder construction now it's

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.259 
method of shoulder construction now it's
a<00:00:13.950> little<00:00:14.099> different<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.910> most<00:00:15.089> other

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
a little different for most other

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.540 
a little different for most other
shoulder<00:00:15.660> constructions<00:00:16.260> because<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:17.369> its

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
shoulder constructions because like its

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.880 
shoulder constructions because like its
name<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.850> suggest<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.170> been<00:00:19.439> done<00:00:19.650> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
name would suggest it's all been done in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.660 
name would suggest it's all been done in
one<00:00:20.189> piece<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.140> it's<00:00:22.140> quite<00:00:22.470> similar<00:00:23.010> as<00:00:23.189> you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
one piece and it's quite similar as you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.359 
one piece and it's quite similar as you
can<00:00:23.850> probably<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> set<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.830> shoulder

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
can probably see to a set in shoulder

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.089 
can probably see to a set in shoulder
method<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.210> you've<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.990> shaped<00:00:28.769> arm

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
method because you've got shaped arm

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.269 
method because you've got shaped arm
holes<00:00:29.490> worked<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.330> from<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> shoulder<00:00:30.990> seam<00:00:31.439> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
holes worked out from a shoulder seam so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.979 
holes worked out from a shoulder seam so
how<00:00:32.640> does<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.910> whole<00:00:33.120> thing<00:00:33.149> fit<00:00:33.600> together

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
how does the whole thing fit together

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.709 
how does the whole thing fit together
basically<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.430> start<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
basically what you start with is you

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.780 
basically what you start with is you
start<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.350> across<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.100> back<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> neck

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
start with across the back of the neck

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.560 
start with across the back of the neck
you<00:00:39.420> cast<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.230> stitches<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
you cast on your stitches then at the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.260 
you cast on your stitches then at the
same<00:00:42.809> time<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.469> both<00:00:43.530> shoulder<00:00:44.370> seams<00:00:44.670> I'm

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
same time on both shoulder seams I'm

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
same time on both shoulder seams I'm
just<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> show<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.350> side<00:00:46.379> here

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
just going to show you on one side here

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.150 
just going to show you on one side here
you<00:00:47.520> start<00:00:47.879> increasing<00:00:48.530> right<00:00:49.530> side<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you start increasing right side and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
you start increasing right side and
wrong<00:00:50.489> side<00:00:50.850> row<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> way<00:00:51.840> down<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.320> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
wrong side row all the way down so you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
wrong side row all the way down so you
can<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.980> stitches<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.550> coming<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:53.969> here

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
can see the stitches are coming out here

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
can see the stitches are coming out here
and<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.320> happens<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> other<00:00:56.190> side

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and the same happens on the other side

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.060 
and the same happens on the other side
so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> keep<00:00:57.690> doing<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.289> till<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.739> reach

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so you keep doing that till you reach

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.510 
so you keep doing that till you reach
the<00:00:59.430> width<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.969> your<00:01:00.690> shoulder<00:01:01.260> across<00:01:01.949> here

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the width of your shoulder across here

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.509 
the width of your shoulder across here
and<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:03.750> happening<00:01:04.260> across<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and it's happening across here at the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.700 
and it's happening across here at the
very<00:01:05.760> same<00:01:06.060> time<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:07.590> you've

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
very same time so then when you've

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
very same time so then when you've
reached<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> edge<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.760> shoulder<00:01:09.210> tip

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
reached the edge of your shoulder tip

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.469 
reached the edge of your shoulder tip
you<00:01:10.200> change<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.920> stitch<00:01:11.130> markers<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you change your stitch markers and you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
you change your stitch markers and you
actually<00:01:12.720> put<00:01:13.049> some<00:01:13.590> stitches<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.460> between

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
actually put some stitches in between

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.810 
actually put some stitches in between
the<00:01:15.450> sleeves<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.680> side<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the sleeves here on this side and the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.719 
the sleeves here on this side and the
same<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> other<00:01:18.360> side<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.860> instead

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
same on the other side and now instead

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.270 
same on the other side and now instead
of<00:01:21.060> increasing<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.720> shoulder<00:01:22.290> seams<00:01:22.590> you're

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
of increasing your shoulder seams you're

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.690 
of increasing your shoulder seams you're
increasing<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:24.409> actual<00:01:25.409> sleeve<00:01:26.310> stitches

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
increasing your actual sleeve stitches

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390 
increasing your actual sleeve stitches
here<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.020> looks<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> session<00:01:28.890> sleeve

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
here so it looks like a session sleeve

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.760 
here so it looks like a session sleeve
but<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.420> being<00:01:30.750> done<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> same<00:01:31.439> time

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but it's all being done at the same time

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.670 
but it's all being done at the same time
so<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:32.939> actually<00:01:33.180> doing<00:01:33.540> increases<00:01:34.500> every

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so you're actually doing increases every

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.010 
so you're actually doing increases every
right<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> wrong<00:01:35.640> side<00:01:35.909> row<00:01:36.119> initially<00:01:36.689> here

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
right and wrong side row initially here

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.190 
right and wrong side row initially here
and<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.579> work<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:38.970> way<00:01:39.030> down<00:01:39.200> they

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and then as you work your way down they

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.340 
and then as you work your way down they
change<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.280> every<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:41.820> side<00:01:41.850> row

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
change to just every right side row

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.639 
change to just every right side row
similar<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> set<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.070> sleeve<00:01:44.420> for<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.869> method

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
similar to a set in sleeve for my method

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
similar to a set in sleeve for my method
of<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.250> actually<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.170> slowed<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.380> down

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
of this I actually then slowed it down

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.039 
of this I actually then slowed it down
for<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.659> until<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.810> reach<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
for a bit here until we reach the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.609 
for a bit here until we reach the
underarm<00:01:52.920> area<00:01:53.340> where<00:01:54.180> we've<00:01:54.600> got<00:01:54.840> increases

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
underarm area where we've got increases

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.679 
underarm area where we've got increases
again<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.490> sleeve<00:01:56.820> first<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
again on the sleeve first of all in the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.080 
again on the sleeve first of all in the
right-side<00:01:58.140> row<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.640> wrong<00:01:59.820> side

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
right-side row then right and wrong side

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
right-side row then right and wrong side
row<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.170> few<00:02:01.409> body<00:02:01.710> increases<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
row and then a few body increases and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
row and then a few body increases and
then<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.810> most<00:02:04.079> top<00:02:04.350> down<00:02:04.649> we're<00:02:05.189> going

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
then just like most top down we're going

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.670 
then just like most top down we're going
to<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.549> some<00:02:05.939> underarm<00:02:06.540> stitches<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.350> cast

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
to have some underarm stitches here cast

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.130 
to have some underarm stitches here cast
on<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.160> well<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.239> rest<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> body<00:02:09.869> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
on as well and the rest of the body is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.200 
on as well and the rest of the body is
the<00:02:10.289> same<00:02:10.530> as

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
the same as

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.720 
the same as
most<00:02:11.360> top-down<00:02:11.900> constructions<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.160> hopefully

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
most top-down constructions so hopefully

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.900 
most top-down constructions so hopefully
that<00:02:13.910> was<00:02:14.060> helpful<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.990> understand

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
that was helpful to understand

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.410 
that was helpful to understand
contiguous<00:02:17.080> construction<00:02:18.080> method
