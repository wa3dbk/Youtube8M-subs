00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.030
 for 13 years and it looked like 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.250
 sounded war but every combat mission 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 helicopter and every broken army 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.859
 all-terrain vehicle returned from afghanistan 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.930
 accompanying another sound basket lint 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.449
 at which the congress is increasingly turning 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.460
 your attention after 10 years of war and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.150
 lawmakers are tightening control over 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.980
 by means 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 they cut the minimum budget 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.430
 defense ministry for 2014 to 500 billion 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.719
 dollars and require reporting and it's not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.430
 the easiest task and the pentagon ball 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.320
 remains the only us agency 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 who can not account for their 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.129
 expenses before taxpayers all 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.050
 other structures are subject to revision 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.059
 the Ministry of Defense has never been 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.699
 audit despite the fact that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.190
 she spends 150 million financial 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.920
 transactions per year and its budget is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.899
 a fifth of government spending is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.370
 should have happened many years ago 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.229
 as with the ministry of internal 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.220
 security is ridiculous that the pentagon is not 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.400
 accounts for money 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.530
 taxpayer budget hawks like 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.630
 Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma now 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.610
 few years have been insisting on auditing 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 Pentagon checks previous 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 bills offered encouragement 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.939
 to the ministry of defense if it leads to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.100
 order your finances unlike them 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.950
 Cobbern bill of expenditure verification 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.720
 Pentagon for 2013 suggests 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.939
 punishment for military violate 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 regulations but this document is still 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.299
 is pending 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.130
 the pentagon plans to bring its 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.829
 bookkeeping in order seventeenth year 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.130
 although many believe that these terms are quite 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.180
 about have their own reasons 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 imperfect legislation in the field 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.840
 financing military operations 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.329
 allows the contractor to keep in their 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.009
 in the hands of both the congress and the pentagon they are not 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.890
 give conduct audits 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.750
 who catch both their employees and themselves 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 Pentagon involved in wastes 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.740
 one of the main reasons why congress 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.719
 still not forced the pentagon 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.090
 report expenses this statement 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.180
 that the department is too vast for complete 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.009
 verification is very difficult but not 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.629
 give up and say the Pentagon 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.490
 too much is not worth it 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.070
 worry 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.080
 and although former congressman ron paul is already 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.990
 small policy his business continues 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.640
 son senator rand paul national 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.740
 defense is one of the most important budget items 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.720
 and one of the few legal functions 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.030
 meeting the requirements of the constitution but we 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.430
 should not give the Pentagon carte blanche 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.960
 even if congress is on revision 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.670
 obsolete data check 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.010
 Pentagon computers can become 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.230
 nightmare as reported by Reuters 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.600
 computer systems departments were 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.670
 created in the seventies and no way 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.710
 with each other not related according 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.180
 senator tom cover on if pentagon 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.040
 put in order financial statements 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.260
 it would help him avoid 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.870
 inefficient use of resources and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.940
 would save up to 25 billion 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.130
 dollars annually in the next 10 years 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.060
 In addition, some argue that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.920
 after revision 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.010
 the pentagon will appear in its true 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.070
 guises and here's a check will show how 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.840
 negotiations are underway and deals are being made 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.600
 US military industrial complex and to whom 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.460
 it's profitable him 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.350
 however until the pentagon 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.480
 agreed to check can be long 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.880
 guess what exactly she would have shown 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.970
 how much can you save money and really 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.600
 does anything change megan lo r rt 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.600
