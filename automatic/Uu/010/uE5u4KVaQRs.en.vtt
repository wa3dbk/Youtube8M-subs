00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
nylons and unfortunately I have gotten a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.130 
nylons and unfortunately I have gotten a
run<00:02:09.259> in<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.800> back<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.130> one<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.310> them<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.480> went

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
run in the back of one of them so I went

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140 
run in the back of one of them so I went
ahead<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.350> poked<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.740> hole<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.130> made<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> run<00:02:13.580> in

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
ahead and poked a hole and made a run in

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.460 
ahead and poked a hole and made a run in
the<00:02:14.300> second<00:02:14.660> one<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.930> way<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.170> kind<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
the second one that way it kind of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.589 
the second one that way it kind of
looked<00:02:15.680> like<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.760> design<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.390> have

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
looked like that was the design to have

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.860 
looked like that was the design to have
runs<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.560> my<00:02:18.680> stockings<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.489> back

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
runs and my stockings in the back

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.300 
runs and my stockings in the back
so<00:02:20.560> there's<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.330> on<00:02:22.540> these<00:02:23.310> long

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
so there's that and I have on these long

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.580 
so there's that and I have on these long
dress<00:02:24.970> socks<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.540> think<00:02:25.750> there<00:02:25.930> are<00:02:26.020> men's<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.930 
dress socks I think there are men's I
can't<00:02:26.800> remember<00:02:27.069> I<00:02:27.220> got<00:02:27.400> them<00:02:27.550> at<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.730> dollar

can't remember I got them at the dollar

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.610 
can't remember I got them at the dollar
store<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.390> they<00:02:28.720> were<00:02:28.810> only<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.050> dollar<00:02:29.110> but

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
store so they were only a dollar but

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.589 
store so they were only a dollar but
they're<00:02:29.739> just<00:02:29.920> black<00:02:30.580> dress<00:02:30.880> socks<00:02:31.300> that
