00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.990
 years ago when I was younger my parents took me on vacation in the 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.389
 city ​​and everywhere that hydrates her 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.729
 half of them 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.929
 so much debate said so much one against another winning team 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.210
 I wanted to know everything you need to know about the PNV 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.500
 and they showed me step by step how the foot worked in their bed and throw 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.009
 the ideas of the first time you try 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.810
 zelaya gets stuck starting 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.900
 It was great when I got home we left Beijing that at every moment of the 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.750
 day I wanted to do the best half chandor that everyone and who happened 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.329
 After Antonio decided they had announced that he competed 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.290
 and destiny to teach to play beauty every child that huca 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.710
 it seemed impossible but I knew that I had to teach them there are stages of 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.980
 xinjiang and tizapán make history and without personally attending art that returns to 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.980
 the city in clubs or have invited me to the tournament 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.770
 that explains everything, it may not be the best in your town but that's not great 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.080
 thing we do not doubt taison and do not be brusque lt10 an apology thanks 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.730
 the t worry becker status ale 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.960
 hear it or worse things so you know why I'm here to train 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.700
 and that's a friend we are here to make your dreams of life come true and meditated 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.660
 this end that 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.300
 and good 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.110
 oberá edad 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.610
 that story is moving but now maybe because there it happens 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.900
 at this campaign height he will be a big fighter but now we do not have 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.610
 time to train the map 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.040
 we have to concentrate on the American tournament 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 it's a bad team, but that's how I see it, nothing more to say 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.740
 be so severe the door or 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.090
 the last battle in berkeley 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.790
 it was the fourth one has perished 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.070
 that means that we are not the number one right 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.260
 the forgotten nothing there is a lot of time to train 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.929
 I would also say that it is quite difficult to practice at the border 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.909
 this does not look like the fight training center but here 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.969
 we are and we can not leave 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.949
 nothing more guys take a look around let's forget that practice 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.949
 relax for once life is too short to discuss 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.010
 keep it so that everything is 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.660
 mixed adobe houses 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.270
 the restaurant were missing please Antonio I'm at your side premiere moment 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.659
 pp aralar ea and eb efe 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.680
 this means that we end up with belinda spain 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.689
 my idea the gentleman says that the tooth 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.229
 louis 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.779
 piana 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.249
 what good ap 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.319
 expte 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.319
 that too 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 this year 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:05.779
 It is true 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.779
 This makes no sense 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.670
 stressed that the same Mr. validity 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.239
 and well he says he does not know is that things are wrong 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.219
 things are being done 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.309
 this is what is written here explains why to carpinteyro 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:31.259
 says that the fault to him would have to see it and pool stores according to 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.399
 this we have to completely redesign turbid and to optimize two beasts life 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:38.259
 otherwise he is doomed to lose again 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:42.429
 no no no this means that there is and if we will have to be awake all the 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:47.299
 night trying to find a solution to this as it redesigned mild April 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.749
 he does not 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.709
 those laws that you have to reconfigure 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.759
 free 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.409
 then you can make yourself feel 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.739
 Frankfurt agencies with birds as much as I do 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.929
 but we have to make the attempt you can do it g is like that and while there are 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.929
 a whole carnival of spare parts here 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.389
 compared to the training center this place is a desert 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.649
 I was tempting Mr. dispensation for dinner 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.159
 do not worry guys 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.159
 I know he has a plan 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.150
 but what are we doing up here 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
 precisely through the art of the army 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.159
 for that reason with small containers of it 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.499
 so they are in front you have to make sure behind him especially 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.129
 where is it 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.120
 otherwise the dengue incidence rate 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.210
 this week I have been given 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.210
 the laws of that office 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.870
 jaar harvard advances down 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.860
 with the improvement 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.229
 well not exactly the exercise 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.900
 need a poster 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.900
 fourth place 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.050
 He referred that it would be a bridge fighting genil 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.089
 Brussels from one moment to another 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.170
 it's a year-end 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.780
 but she wants to be better at this so do additional tasks and asthma 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.550
 apparently everything I can and listening since the world champion 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.810
 You can dream everything you want, but that will help because when 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.810
 wake up from your dream you will understand that nothing has changed 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.620
 there's only one way to make that come true you have to devote all your 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.659
 life to sport concentrate on that otherwise friend is like you're 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:10.809
 wasting time 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.989
 maybe you can perform high quality work that you see improve 

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:19.359
 I really do not have time for this, that is what matters because the 

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:22.359
 citizens ride 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.180
 besides her and can not walk medicine 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.199
 when doing much better than them now but the day will come when I am 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.630
 there before the cut the attack the matter the fourth victory of the year and 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.470
 he said sorry until he chopped up like this 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.440
 jeter the world champion of the opera in more than a couple of navarra 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.229
 they also stand out from study 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.530
 now I understand why you are also against and are 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.850
 both are very happy to be saying both believe they can do what 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:02.360
 that they want while in themselves nothing 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:05.909
 a lot and that today is a lot of time 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.379
