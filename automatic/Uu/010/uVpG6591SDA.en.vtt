and um for this song I'll actually use a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.609 
and um for this song I'll actually use a
cover<00:00:14.519> from<00:00:15.089> YouTube<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> actual<00:00:16.260> song

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
cover from YouTube not the actual song

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.230 
cover from YouTube not the actual song
it's<00:00:17.300> done<00:00:18.300> by<00:00:18.660> kalo<00:00:19.439> readers<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.340> no<00:00:20.670> readers

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
it's done by kalo readers or no readers

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.259 
it's done by kalo readers or no readers
um<00:00:21.619> they<00:00:22.619> did<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:23.070> good<00:00:23.340> person<00:00:23.939> effect

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
um they did a really good person effect

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.210 
um they did a really good person effect
because<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.630> slightly<00:00:24.869> slower<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
because it's slightly slower and I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.870 
because it's slightly slower and I
thought<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.039> version<00:00:29.310> will<00:00:29.670> be

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
thought to to use this version will be

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.139 
thought to to use this version will be
pretty<00:00:30.480> ideal<00:00:30.840> cos<00:00:31.260> um<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.579> harder<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
pretty ideal cos um it will be harder to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.420 
pretty ideal cos um it will be harder to
teach<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.690> when<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.170> temper<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> pretty<00:00:35.130> fast

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
teach it when the temper is pretty fast

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.600 
teach it when the temper is pretty fast
so<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.630> chose<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> anyway<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.610> yeah

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
so I just chose this anyway and yeah

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
so I just chose this anyway and yeah
they're<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.120> good<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.559> song

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they're really good and for this song

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.190 
they're really good and for this song
you<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.760> need<00:00:41.969> five<00:00:42.329> chords<00:00:42.840> G<00:00:43.399> an<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
you will just need five chords G an a a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:54.380 
you will just need five chords G an a a
B<00:00:46.200> minor<00:00:47.629> F<00:00:48.629> sharp<00:00:49.020> minor<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.629> B<00:00:51.629> flat<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:54.030> for

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
B minor F sharp minor and B flat so for

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.630 
B minor F sharp minor and B flat so for
the<00:00:54.570> G<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.320> basically<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.250> said<00:00:56.489> before

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the G it's basically as I said before

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.060 
the G it's basically as I said before
think<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> triangle<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.770> the

think of it as a triangle here it's the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
think of it as a triangle here it's the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the 3rd fret G and the next one is an e

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.070 
the 3rd fret G and the next one is an e
which<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> basically<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.240> 3rd<00:01:12.600> string<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:41.690 
your ring finger on the top string 4
fret<00:01:38.900> it's<00:01:39.900> basically<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.500> an<00:01:40.680> A<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.430> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
fret it's basically like an A so it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
fret it's basically like an A so it's
the<00:01:42.530> 3rd<00:01:43.790> string<00:01:44.790> 1st<00:01:45.240> fret<00:01:45.360> top<00:01:45.810> string<00:01:45.869> 2nd

the 3rd string 1st fret top string 2nd
fret<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> place<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:48.659> ring<00:01:49.350> finger

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.090 

the<00:01:56.110> last<00:01:56.350> one<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.130> b-flat<00:01:58.120> which<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.470> like

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
the last one is a b-flat which is like

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.899 
the last one is a b-flat which is like
in<00:02:00.700> exact<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.030> staircase<00:02:01.360> but<00:02:02.110> it's<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
in exact a staircase but it's the the

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.109 
in exact a staircase but it's the the
bottom<00:02:04.840> two<00:02:05.050> strings<00:02:05.110> on<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.100> first<00:02:06.400> fret<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
bottom two strings on the first fret the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.150 
bottom two strings on the first fret the
third<00:02:07.150> string<00:02:07.840> seventh<00:02:08.259> fret<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.920> top

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
third string seventh fret and the top

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.060 
third string seventh fret and the top
string<00:02:09.429> on<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> third<00:02:09.970> fret<00:02:12.870> flat<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.800> for

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
string on the third fret flat and so for

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.830 
string on the third fret flat and so for
the<00:02:15.250> strumming<00:02:15.730> pattern<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.330> tend<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.660> do

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the strumming pattern what I tend to do

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.670 
the strumming pattern what I tend to do
is<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.500> well<00:02:18.340> based<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.630> how<00:02:19.930> they<00:02:20.170> played<00:02:20.440> it

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
is just well based on how they played it

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.930 
is just well based on how they played it
with<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.130> intro<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.760> goes<00:02:22.380> down<00:02:23.380> down<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.790> for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
with the intro it goes down down so for

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.340 
with the intro it goes down down so for
the<00:02:31.060> intro<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.570> chords<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.080> will<00:02:32.200> need

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
the intro the chords that you will need

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.340 
the intro the chords that you will need
are<00:02:32.709> just<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.610> G<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.170> just

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
are just the G and then a and you just

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.040 
are just the G and then a and you just
ultimately<00:02:35.560> play<00:02:36.340> them<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.720> strumming

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
ultimately play them with the strumming

00:02:38.050 --> 00:03:14.000 
ultimately play them with the strumming
pattern<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.620> goes

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.710 

so<00:03:15.010> for<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.430> versus<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.240> strumming<00:03:16.690> pattern

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
so for the versus the strumming pattern

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.120 
so for the versus the strumming pattern
that<00:03:17.050> I<00:03:17.110> tend<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.470> use<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.890> just<00:03:18.190> down<00:03:18.930> down

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
that I tend to use is just down down

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.760 
that I tend to use is just down down
Chuck<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:22.090> instead<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.780> down

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
Chuck so instead of down

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.920 
Chuck so instead of down
I<00:03:23.800> just<00:03:24.160> chuck<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.330> if<00:03:25.570> you<00:03:25.690> want<00:03:25.870> you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
I just chuck it and then if you want you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.110 
I just chuck it and then if you want you
can<00:03:26.080> just<00:03:26.230> do<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.530> up<00:03:26.740> down<00:03:26.980> after<00:03:27.460> that<00:03:27.610> just

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
can just do it up down after that just

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.770 
can just do it up down after that just
to<00:03:28.270> fill<00:03:28.420> in<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.780> space<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.240> for<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.330> versus

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
to fill in the space and for the versus

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.550 
to fill in the space and for the versus
the<00:03:31.990> cause<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.530> will<00:03:32.680> need<00:03:32.860> are<00:03:33.130> G<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:35.490> G<00:03:37.560> B

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
the cause that you will need are G a G B

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.970 
the cause that you will need are G a G B
minor<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:40.600> then<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.530> repeat<00:03:41.710> that

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
minor and and then you just repeat that

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.150 
minor and and then you just repeat that
twice<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.600> intro<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.440> know<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.890> on

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
twice so for the intro you know that on

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.280 
twice so for the intro you know that on
sync<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.910> save<00:03:46.090> my<00:03:46.270> life<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.720> I've<00:03:47.080> got

I'll play along with the song so you get

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.469 
I'll play along with the song so you get
the<00:05:41.500> gist<00:05:41.770> of<00:05:41.889> what<00:05:41.949> I'm<00:05:42.340> talking<00:05:42.639> about<00:05:43.180> not

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
the gist of what I'm talking about not

00:05:43.479 --> 00:06:42.869 
the gist of what I'm talking about not
just<00:05:43.509> me<00:06:39.599> chorus<00:06:40.599> with<00:06:41.409> the<00:06:41.680> chorus<00:06:42.159> the<00:06:42.520> chord

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:42.879 
just me chorus with the chorus the chord

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.149 
just me chorus with the chorus the chord
progression<00:06:43.360> goes<00:06:43.539> G<00:06:44.349> a<00:06:44.849> and<00:06:46.050> then<00:06:47.050> you<00:06:47.199> get<00:06:47.349> to

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:48.159 
progression goes G a and then you get to

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:54.029 
progression goes G a and then you get to
choose<00:06:48.659> B<00:06:49.659> minor<00:06:49.990> and<00:06:50.469> a<00:06:51.629> and<00:06:52.650> then<00:06:53.650> you<00:06:53.770> just

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 
choose B minor and a and then you just

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.129 
choose B minor and a and then you just
repeat<00:06:54.190> that<00:06:54.550> that<00:06:54.969> the<00:06:55.240> whole<00:06:55.419> thing<00:06:55.900> twice

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
repeat that that the whole thing twice

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.269 
repeat that that the whole thing twice
so<00:06:56.919> it<00:06:57.099> goes<00:06:57.310> with<00:06:57.759> my<00:06:59.099> non-existant

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:00.279 
so it goes with my non-existant

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:36.330 
so it goes with my non-existant
singing<00:07:01.180> voice

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.800 

and<00:07:37.340> then<00:07:37.430> you<00:07:37.490> get<00:07:37.640> to<00:07:37.730> the<00:07:37.850> second<00:07:38.150> bus<00:07:38.330> which

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.810 
and then you get to the second bus which

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.650 
and then you get to the second bus which
is<00:07:39.050> exactly<00:07:39.800> the<00:07:39.950> same<00:07:40.160> chords<00:07:40.850> as<00:07:40.910> the<00:07:41.330> first

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:41.660 
is exactly the same chords as the first

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.690 
is exactly the same chords as the first
verse<00:07:41.930> and<00:07:42.170> then<00:07:42.830> the<00:07:43.040> chorus

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:43.700 
verse and then the chorus

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.090 
verse and then the chorus
yeah<00:07:44.360> and<00:07:44.540> that's<00:07:44.630> basically<00:07:45.020> the<00:07:45.290> end<00:07:45.560> a<00:07:45.830> song

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.100
