00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.600
Video games.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
Philosophy.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.070
Emma Watson.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.140
Is a first-person shooter really first person
if it’s got more than one person?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.140
Philosophy.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.130
Does Captain Falcon really want to see your
moves?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.230
Show me your philosophy.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.650
And is multiplayer really online if no one’s
online in the multiplayer?

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.650
Logical paradox, “leviosa.”

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.500
It’s Outpost Defender Online—or is it?—for
the Xbox 360.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:57.640
So I don’t know if you can tell, but…this
is an indie game.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.239
It’s also an indie game that feels like
1999, if 1999 finally got off the couch and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.470
decided to get its shit together.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.550
And apparently, if 1999 watched The NeverEnding
Story, ‘cause this game never ends.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.470
And it also uses the same font from the intro
credits.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.020
And it’s also relentlessly depressing.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.850
‘Cause it reminds you you have no friends.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.850
Where is everybody?

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.070
What, did they die in the swamp?

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:36.040
So, uh…I will say this, there’s definitely
an old-school charm to all this.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.530
Like, if this were a Nintendo 64 game, we
would’ve played the crap of it back in the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.530
day.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.310
Only it’s not a Nintendo 64 game.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.469
At least, not technically.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.280
And it’s not back in the day, either.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.549
So I’m a little less inclined to play the
crap out of this.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.720
And that’s mostly because I feel like I
already have.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.299
I mean, this is the only place.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.350
It’s the one place.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.260
How much can you do in one place?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.460
Especially when the Nothing has already destroyed
it.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.369
You know what, if you haven’t seen The NeverEnding
Story, I bet you have no idea what I’m talking

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.369
about.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.720
Look, go watch that movie, and try not to
cry when Atreyu gets to the swamp.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.130
I’m telling you.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.350
That movie is…relentlessly depressing.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.880
Outpost Defender Online can be played either
alone, or with up to four players online.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.740
I was hoping to get some online in, but…
yeah, that didn’t happen.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.250
Maybe I should’ve called her name, Bastian.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.860
Anyway, the single player is…definitely
single player.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.430
You choose a difficulty level, from one of
six difficulty levels…

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.330
And you can do either coop, free-for-all or
death matches.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.600
But mostly, you’ll be doing single player.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.680
Unless you have a friend who also has this
game, which…honestly, that’s probably

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.130
the way to go with this one.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.560
Find a friend who can easily be manipulated
into buying games just so you have someone

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560
to play with.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
Besides, it’s a dollar.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:04.300
And you don’t want to be friends with poor
people.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.280
So you fly around—you’re in a ship, by
the way.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.500
And you fly around, and there are a couple
rounds, and you blow up anything that isn’t

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500
you.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500
Which can be confusing, I know.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.220
This is not a game for the easily confused.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.450
You need a real understanding of the concept
of self.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.450
That’s what “is” is.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.000
You have lasers, which are pretty much pointless,
because you also have missiles.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.930
And the missiles lock onto your enemies automatically.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.700
Kind of makes the laser feel like a canoe,
when you have a jet ski sitting right next

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700
to it.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.540
So you fly around, you blow up bad guys with
missiles, you spend points to refill your

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.470
stock…you create giant Jell-O molds.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.010
Oh, come on, there’s always room for Jell-O.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.410
Watch it jiggle.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.590
Thank you.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.600
I mean, this is one of those games that’s,
like…what you see is what you get.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.480
There’s not a whole lot more to it.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.230
It’s a cool little retro-styled multiplayer
game…but after a few rounds, you’ve seen

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.230
all there is to see.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.260
You’ve also seen physics that would even
make the aliens think, “Holy sh*t, how the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.180
hell are they doing that, Frank?”

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.250
Truth is out there, but you’ll never find
it.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.180
Among other things, you’ll never find.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.540
Recommended only for old-school people with
old-school friends…who have a dollar to

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.130
spend.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.009
And pairs well with The NeverEnding Story,
for some reason.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:39.380
It’s Outpost Defender Online, for the Xbox
360.
