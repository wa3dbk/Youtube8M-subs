00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
um he made a comparison of hat to a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.840 
um he made a comparison of hat to a
magic<00:01:17.569> deck<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.829> know<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.280> key<00:01:19.429> card<00:01:19.670> in<00:01:19.759> the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
deck was basically just a card that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.029 
deck was basically just a card that
allotted<00:01:22.579> to<00:01:22.729> metamorph<00:01:23.240> into<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.630> 3-2<00:01:24.380> flyer

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
allotted to metamorph into a 3-2 flyer

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.879 
allotted to metamorph into a 3-2 flyer
on<00:01:25.509> at<00:01:26.509> basically<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.259> cost<00:01:27.439> of<00:01:27.590> nothing

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
on at basically the cost of nothing

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.349 
on at basically the cost of nothing
which<00:01:28.340> puts<00:01:28.639> you<00:01:28.729> ahead<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.029> the<00:01:29.240> game

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
which puts you ahead of the game

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.010 
which puts you ahead of the game
essentially<00:01:30.170> by<00:01:30.350> two<00:01:30.829> turns<00:01:31.100> um<00:01:31.459> and<00:01:32.329> hat<00:01:32.810> does

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
essentially by two turns um and hat does

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.219 
essentially by two turns um and hat does
the<00:01:33.139> same<00:01:33.350> thing<00:01:33.619> honestly<00:01:34.579> in<00:01:34.789> this<00:01:34.909> game

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
the same thing honestly in this game

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.129 
the same thing honestly in this game
basically<00:01:36.229> what<00:01:36.469> he<00:01:36.829> did<00:01:37.039> was<00:01:37.219> he<00:01:37.249> found<00:01:37.579> a

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
basically what he did was he found a

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:41.410 
basically what he did was he found a
comparison<00:01:39.139> between<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.439> two<00:01:39.679> games<00:01:40.179> he<00:01:41.179> took

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
comparison between the two games he took

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.449 
comparison between the two games he took
advantage<00:01:41.749> of<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:42.139> this<00:01:42.859> place<00:01:43.069> off<00:01:43.279> from

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
advantage of that this place off from

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.550 
advantage of that this place off from
one<00:01:43.639> game<00:01:43.789> translated<00:01:44.749> into<00:01:44.899> another<00:01:45.349> game

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
one game translated into another game

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.889 
one game translated into another game
and<00:01:45.920> maybe<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:46.999> is<00:01:47.179> what<00:01:47.389> the<00:01:47.659> yugioh

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
and maybe this is what the yugioh

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.529 
and maybe this is what the yugioh
players<00:01:48.229> needed<00:01:48.590> um<00:01:48.859> was<00:01:49.459> a<00:01:49.729> different<00:01:50.090> aspect

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
players needed um was a different aspect

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.719 
players needed um was a different aspect
in<00:01:51.079> our<00:01:51.349> own<00:01:51.529> game<00:01:51.740> because<00:01:52.279> you<00:01:52.399> know<00:01:52.490> having

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
in our own game because you know having

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.029 
in our own game because you know having
been<00:01:52.939> involved<00:01:53.209> in<00:01:53.419> yugioh<00:01:53.749> for<00:01:53.959> so<00:01:54.079> long<00:01:54.259> many

been involved in yugioh for so long many

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.889 
been involved in yugioh for so long many
of<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.279> players<00:01:55.520> adapt<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.450> same<00:01:56.659> mentality

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
of the players adapt the same mentality

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.989 
of the players adapt the same mentality
just<00:01:57.499> continuously<00:01:58.099> over<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:58.549> over<00:01:58.669> and<00:01:58.880> over

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
just continuously over and over and over

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.629 
just continuously over and over and over
again<00:01:59.409> our<00:02:00.409> line<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:00.649> thinking<00:02:00.950> can<00:02:01.189> be<00:02:01.429> very

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
again our line of thinking can be very

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.359 
again our line of thinking can be very
linear<00:02:02.060> at<00:02:02.569> times<00:02:02.869> actually<00:02:03.409> almost<00:02:03.709> all<00:02:04.069> of

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
linear at times actually almost all of

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.179 
linear at times actually almost all of
the<00:02:04.490> time<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.599> know<00:02:05.749> when<00:02:06.380> you're<00:02:06.529> going<00:02:07.009> down

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
the time you know when you're going down

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.070 
the time you know when you're going down
a<00:02:07.219> straight<00:02:07.700> tunnel<00:02:07.999> like<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.660> just

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
a straight tunnel like this just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.460 
a straight tunnel like this just
continuously<00:02:10.120> you<00:02:11.120> know<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:11.300> don't<00:02:11.780> have<00:02:12.050> any

played other card games like magic it's

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.670 
played other card games like magic it's
very<00:02:25.060> easy<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.359> just<00:02:25.659> adapt<00:02:25.989> coming<00:02:26.319> into<00:02:26.560> you

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
very easy to just adapt coming into you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.679 
very easy to just adapt coming into you
give<00:02:26.920> because<00:02:27.670> i<00:02:27.939> would<00:02:28.209> say<00:02:28.329> Yugi<00:02:28.599> is

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
give because i would say Yugi is

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.809 
give because i would say Yugi is
probably<00:02:29.049> much<00:02:29.230> easier<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.680> understand<00:02:30.099> then

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
probably much easier to understand then

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.849 
probably much easier to understand then
magic<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.659> in<00:02:31.840> terms<00:02:32.049> of<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.829> know

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859

competitiveness and the things like that
so<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.439> very<00:02:36.120> interesting<00:02:37.319> knowing<00:02:38.319> that

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
so it's very interesting knowing that

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.080 
so it's very interesting knowing that
you<00:02:38.859> know<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.040> can<00:02:39.280> very<00:02:39.489> easily<00:02:39.549> compare
