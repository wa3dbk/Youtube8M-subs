00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.870
 i 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 good kids how are you doing today finally 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.680
 after a long time we have a 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.910
 news video and the truth is that they are 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.710
 very exciting since the players 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.630
 that we loved urban maps we're going to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.489
 receive a few in the next from 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.080
 lcd battlefield four dragons ticia the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.120
 which we will be talking about but before 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.680
 start as I guess many wait 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.030
 I have to thank the answer to 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.040
 assembly the truth is that it was a project 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.809
 it took me a lot of time and effort 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.520
 but I think the reward has been very 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.840
 good and for what God liked a lot 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.820
 Thank you very much but good 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.710
 leaving soldier let's start with 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.660
 the long-awaited list of weapons of the new 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.730
 dlc which is obviously short but the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.020
 truth is that it has a lot of chicha like that 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.700
 that nothing in the first place because no 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.120
 let's go with the new assault rifle that 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.800
 will give us lss rss bulldog 762 and for 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.270
 luck this time I'll have to speculate 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.580
 little less than normal because they have 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 given the statistics and the truth is that 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.310
 this weapon is good enough in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.250
 first place according to your caliber 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.410
 will have a maximum damage of 34% and a minimum 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.910
 of 25% which makes it similar to 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.770
 ashkar but where it will not be so 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.180
 similar is in its cadence that is 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.820
 pretty much on a par with that of the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.009
 cct ball to 805 of 700 rounds per 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.540
 minute which can do it very very 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.890
 girl at least if we do not consider 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.020
 your other data which 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.850
 They can bring a little lower because in 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.800
 first place your kick is one of the 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.630
 highest of the game from 0.5 upwards 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.520
 and from 0.3 to both sides everything is 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.110
 accompanied that his precision in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.640
 automatic does not hold that has 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.740
 few bullets and that its recharge is over 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.479
 three seconds so I think that despite 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.130
 that the first thing is very good about the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.229
 paper does not look like a check 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.759
 amazing apart from this the truth is 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.590
 that as hope in the hollow rifle 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.450
 of assault on this tlc me just like 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.150
 a lot of people we did not want this but 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.470
 we wanted the gun in '94 that 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.090
 he has been asking from the beginning 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.619
 of the game and not just for us is 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.390
 say I'm subscribed to many channels 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.009
 English and Americans who have 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.600
 I also ordered the n but it seems that no 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.490
 they want it so let's hope that the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.080
 take out at the end they are and going to 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.789
 next weapon that they are going to give us we are going to 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.530
 see the new his rifle at first sight I 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.540
 I think this is a discreet way of 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.180
 bring an am5 cava from fil 4 this time 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.040
 bringing in his sig merger called mpx 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.110
 which has like the others 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.940
 weapons of this dlc very very good looking 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.560
 starting with his damage of 27 to short and 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.330
 from 13 to long, it also has a cadence 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.269
 that we have known very vaguely in 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.890
 butterfield 4 thanks to the 850 f2000 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.570
 rounds per minute which in conjunction 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.160
 with that high damage it can be quite 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.690
 good and how not 1 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 biggest problems if you had 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.170
 had to bring the 5k battlefield 4 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.120
 would be the size of your charger since if 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.830
 you remember in battlefield 3 of series 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.450
 I had 21 bullets but I also had the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.400
 extended chargers that elevated it to 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.720
 the 31st and as this is not there in 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.070
 battlefield 4 what they have done is a 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.560
 combo of both sizes and have left 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.540
 in 25 plus one in the bedroom leaving her 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.100
 in an intermediate point but yes and 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.330
 giving it a recharge in the middle of the 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.550
 table to leave very very well 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.050
 balanced the only penalty is to be carried away 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.490
 of exclusive engineer class 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.110
 so I will not use much less 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.090
 in the urban maps of those who boast 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.280
 DragÃ³n ostiz and in the middle of the place we would spend 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.840
 what I personally like the most 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.700
 these weapons and it's the new sniper 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.170
 since as you know I like it 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.000
 quite go from aggression corner by the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.680
 life and this new cs5 looks like being 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.870
 very good to short starting with that 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.130
 super cadence of 63 that I had before 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.870
 something the control a shaft that the energy 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.520
 aaron and also has compensated its unique 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.710
 weakness your charger which in this 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.030
 case will be 11 bullets that also recharges 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.590
 very fast but obviously for 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.540
 balance it they have to do something and that 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.830
 is that in exchange for being short milk 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.330
 distances have made you have 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.040
 a lot of fall so there will be for 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.270
 supposedly people who believe that they are agitated 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.430
 but at that moment they can be 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.200
 remember that long is not worth anything and 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.290
 now moving on to the next weapon that we 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.939
 are going to give we will have the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.739
 of two pistols that we will have in this 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.930
 new dlc first of all we will have the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.700
 flange the Italian only 6 which 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.739
 It looks like something very similar 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.450
 to sw 40 that they brought us in naval 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.700
 strike with which I do not think 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.140
 it makes sense still has some 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.459
 things that I like and is that in 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.620
 principle is likely to not have the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.120
 delay between when you press the button and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.680
 shoot that both punishes both the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.390
 hand as the networks also has more 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.069
 cadence that the rex and a kick 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.079
 quite low so maybe though 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.120
 no sense can work and by 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.590
 end we will go to the preferred point of almost 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.959
 everyone who sees the video the second 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.069
 gun of this dlc the desert eagle and is 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.780
 what do you remember if I asked you 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.459
 several times that weapons that riesch see in 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.650
 battle free 4 and I think at least in one 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.599
 60% of the comments regarding this 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.250
 this diggle wing so even though they have 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.630
 past us with the n at least 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.099
 we can say that they have tried to make us 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.169
 a minimum case with this and in addition 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.370
 it looks pretty good obviously 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.840
 has its limitations since this 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.130
 gun has a very high caliber so 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.289
 which has a fairly slow rate 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.910
 with respect to the rest of the semis but as 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.380
 I told you this weapon has a caliber 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.940
 great so I would consider it the 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.009
 level of a revolver and if we put it to 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.150
 this level this weapon is very good since 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.800
 by putting it here we will have the best 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.020
 revolver of the game as it will have a lot 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.980
 cadence a very high damage and already its 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.690
 change more character 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.120
 regarding a revolver your charger in 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.650
 instead of 6 you will have 9 bullets and with this is 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.030
 possible that we not only have one of the 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.530
 better revolvers but one of the 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.270
 best secondary a kind of 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.490
 battlefield magnum 3 and we already know 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.020
 all how he distributed that and as 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.550
 you will know the ones that you saw my video of 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.110
 one time we're going to have a shield in 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.970
 dragons says this what we know of 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.710
 moment is that it will be exclusive to the 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.600
 support class which is pretty good 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.800
 and that will be handled with both hands besides 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 from what I've been able to see and I know there's 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.400
 people who will criticize me for this 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.110
 It looks a lot like one of call of duty 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.430
 do not get me wrong and I'm not going to 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 start saying that they have already copied 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.610
 that a riot shield is something 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.440
 pretty normal directly I'm 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.480
 criticizing that this is here and that is 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.160
 because from what I see the shield is going to 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.300
 cover whole and we're crouching what 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.010
 which gives you practically 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.260
 invincibility the support class so 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.090
 if we put ourselves in a corner with this 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.770
 it will be very very difficult to kill us I hope that 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.480
 at least we are slower but of all 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.850
 ways I think it's not a good addition 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.890
 to the game and to finish and also to continue 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.150
 with the long list of bad additions to 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.250
 the saga with which you dais has delighted us 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.810
 we will have the new and shiny wali 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.370
 but it will not be as we know as 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.260
 the robot eo with the welder and everything 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.510
 that but we will have a robot with 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.040
 the sound looks like a caliber 50 of these 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.630
 that can not be moved to tower mode 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.310
 also to complete it we will have a 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.590
 launches pep or semiautomatic and this in my 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.970
 head sounds like another of the devices 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.620
 of battle free 4 that work 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.240
 totally against what is in 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.250
 essence a first person shooter e 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.170
 we shoot each other and this is 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.460
 basically a great incentive to people 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.200
 used to not play in a way 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.760
 let's say appropriate since they are going to abuse 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.800
 a lot of this while they are 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.300
 roaming in his favorite corner the 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.640
 map they take their ipad and without even 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.710
 risking death can make some 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.630
 very very large killings also seems 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.250
 which is very armored so it seems that 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.170
 he has a lot of life this also 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.970
 multiply such as assault 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.620
 you could not even look for them 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.090
 they would be literally invincible if you have 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.170
 a bag of ammunition and as I say 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.640
 this the truth is that I do not like 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.530
 absolutely nothing and much less for 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.090
 some maps of which you have said 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.860
 that are going to be urban anyway 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.270
 there could be ways to balance it like 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.880
 prevent you from overcharging that you have very 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.460
 little ammunition or I do not know I will not think 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.560
 since my way of balancing it would be 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.270
 put it directly and good kids 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.740
 that would be all for today I hope that you 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.210
 liked it and as long as you do 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.830
 some video giving my opinion about a 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.220
 news of course I'm going to ask you the 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.080
 your 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.850
 I believe that you have a reef will give us 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.139
 several interesting weapons the maximum 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.090
 desert eagle and sana 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.860
 very much with the shield and with 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.990
 the wali so I'd love to know what 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.509
 what do you think about it so nothing said 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.509
 this I say goodbye goodbye kids
