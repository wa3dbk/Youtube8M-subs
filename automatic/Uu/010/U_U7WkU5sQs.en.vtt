Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago
and<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.170> talk<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> little<00:00:07.710> bit<00:00:07.890> about

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
and I talk to you a little bit about

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.140 
and I talk to you a little bit about
pediatric<00:00:08.730> ultrasound<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.690> head

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
pediatric ultrasound of the head

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.520 
pediatric ultrasound of the head
ultrasound<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.269> ideally<00:00:12.750> suited<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.259> image

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
ultrasound is ideally suited to image

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.829 
ultrasound is ideally suited to image
soft<00:00:13.980> tissues<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.759> works<00:00:14.969> similar<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.509> sonar

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
soft tissues it works similar to sonar

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.630 
soft tissues it works similar to sonar
where<00:00:16.230> sound<00:00:16.619> waves<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:16.980> bounced<00:00:17.369> off<00:00:17.490> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
where sound waves are bounced off of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.050 
where sound waves are bounced off of
underwater<00:00:17.970> objects<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> create<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.230> image

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
underwater objects to create an image

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.340 
underwater objects to create an image
similarly<00:00:21.060> ultrasound<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.840> used<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
similarly ultrasound can be used to

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.080 
similarly ultrasound can be used to
image<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> liver<00:00:23.100> kidneys<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.880> gallbladder

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
image the liver kidneys and gallbladder

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.570 
image the liver kidneys and gallbladder
but<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.109> cannot<00:00:25.380> penetrate<00:00:25.590> bone<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.400> see

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
but it cannot penetrate bone or see

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.450 
but it cannot penetrate bone or see
