00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.000
 heavens he is god who formed the earth 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.250
 he who made it and composed it did not create it 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.180
 in vain to be inhabited he created 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.820

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.250

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.440
