00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
that's how we identify it it's not a

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.770 
that's how we identify it it's not a
climax<00:00:30.580> unless<00:00:30.880> it's<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.150> decision<00:00:31.600> and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
note that with every single one of these

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.820 
note that with every single one of these
they're<00:04:54.750> becoming<00:04:55.050> more<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.440> more<00:04:55.500> like<00:04:55.710> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
they're becoming more and more like the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.159 
they're becoming more and more like the
humans<00:04:56.190> right<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:57.390> let's<00:04:57.540> let's<00:04:57.810> let's

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
humans right so let's let's let's

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.690 
humans right so let's let's let's
somehow<00:04:58.470> annotate<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.220> this<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.550> like

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
somehow annotate that this is like

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.820 
somehow annotate that this is like
they're<00:05:00.330> becoming<00:05:00.630> increasingly<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
they're becoming increasingly like the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:10.100 
they're becoming increasingly like the
humans<00:05:02.220> more<00:05:02.550> human<00:05:05.870> now<00:05:06.870> in<00:05:08.030> spite<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.110> sorry

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
humans more human now in spite of sorry

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.880 
humans more human now in spite of sorry
actually<00:05:10.289> in<00:05:10.729> spite<00:05:11.729> of<00:05:11.760> all<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.890> there's

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
actually in spite of all of this there's

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.779 
actually in spite of all of this there's
still<00:05:14.070> one<00:05:14.460> thing<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:15.110> separates<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:17.460> pigs

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
still one thing that separates the pigs

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.469 
still one thing that separates the pigs
and<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.720> humans<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.740> that<00:05:20.490> one<00:05:20.880> thing<00:05:21.240> when

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
and the humans and that one thing when

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.900 
and the humans and that one thing when
they<00:05:21.630> break<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.350> final<00:05:22.950> rule<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.340> that

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
they break that final rule that that

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.440 
they break that final rule that that
final<00:05:24.840> divider

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
final divider

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.740 
final divider
that's<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.690> climax<00:05:28.460> so<00:05:29.460> let<00:05:29.580> me<00:05:29.669> ask<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:30.000> yeah

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
that's the climax so let me ask you yeah

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.000 
that's the climax so let me ask you yeah
they're<00:05:30.960> drinking<00:05:31.110> alcohol<00:05:31.650> yeah<00:05:31.800> they're

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
they're drinking alcohol yeah they're

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.380 
they're drinking alcohol yeah they're
sleeping<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:32.400> beds<00:05:32.580> yeah<00:05:32.820> they're<00:05:33.090> wearing

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
sleeping in beds yeah they're wearing

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.790 
sleeping in beds yeah they're wearing
clothes<00:05:33.690> yeah<00:05:34.080> they're<00:05:34.289> creating

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
clothes yeah they're creating

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.409 
clothes yeah they're creating
infrastructure<00:05:35.280> killing<00:05:35.760> animals<00:05:36.120> engaging

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
infrastructure killing animals engaging

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.129 
infrastructure killing animals engaging
in<00:05:36.660> trade<00:05:37.640> what<00:05:38.640> are<00:05:38.760> they<00:05:38.880> still

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
in trade what are they still

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.040 
in trade what are they still
but<00:05:41.300> doing<00:05:42.300> that<00:05:42.749> is<00:05:43.229> human<00:05:44.009> and<00:05:44.419> that<00:05:45.419> will<00:05:45.930> be

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
but doing that is human and that will be

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.540 
but doing that is human and that will be
the<00:05:46.139> climax<00:05:46.349> I<00:05:46.710> just<00:05:46.889> want<00:05:47.009> to<00:05:47.069> prepare<00:05:47.189> you

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
the climax I just want to prepare you

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.980 
the climax I just want to prepare you
for<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:47.789> so<00:05:48.030> you<00:05:48.120> can<00:05:48.210> identify<00:05:48.449> what

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
for that so you can identify what

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.760 
for that so you can identify what
happens<00:05:50.719> this<00:05:51.719> is<00:05:51.900> so<00:05:52.110> tricky<00:05:52.529> I<00:05:54.740> think<00:05:55.740> I

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
happens this is so tricky I think I

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.989 
happens this is so tricky I think I
think<00:05:56.159> just<00:05:56.189> I'm<00:05:56.909> gonna<00:05:57.120> give<00:05:57.300> it<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.509> go

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:06.739
