00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.230
 hey people in welcome to these 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.940
 nonsense oriented make-up tutorial 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.490
 we want the look of kayak watch c'est 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.680
 qui reapplication and if you a 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.900
 Wig used as I should then 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.580
 you take your hair away now 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.440
 I use a sliced â€‹â€‹one for this 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.690
 pantyhose is over my head 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.070
 turn over and take care that no 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.070
 hair hanging out more 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.219
 I'll take the hair from behind 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.210
 try it evenly on the back of the head 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.430
 to distribute 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.509
 it looks like this 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.329
 Next, I'll take a sponge 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.500
 and a bowl of water 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.990
 as faschings make-up from 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.610
 eulenspiegel in white and in a different way 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.469
 to apply on my face 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.420
 I personally have the experience 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.009
 made it better to dab than 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.649
 to delete because then the opacity 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.950
 better is when you hear the face 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.479
 you're done 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.740
 Apply on the neck and the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.040
 remaining parts that are visible 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.180
 dollar 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.420
 that could be even later 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.979
 do 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.520
 then I take black eyeshadow 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.780
 mana is for kay cosmetics and palette 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.979
 put it on your eye 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.360
 It's all a bit difficult 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.670
 that's what it's supposed to look like here too 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.040
 sponge carry it both on the rent 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.760
 on and under the eye like this 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.760
 just sees 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 You can do that with your finger 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.460
 little bit blind that it is not quite 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.440
 so strange looks but as far as his 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.310
 principle, then I'll take me 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.050
 a thin brush and four inhabitants 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.240
 therefore be eyeliner should actually can 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.520
 ith be deleted but just 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.970
 the basis for the color on the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.970
 eyelid 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.290
 and as you can see, it does not have to be 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.980
 otherwise it would be neat 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.980
 no more spirit 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.460
 then you can start one like that 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.580
 to create a bit of shadow and that 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.530
 I take a brush here and wear 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.319
 black eyeshadow 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.519
 on my cheek 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.900
 because that's a bit weird now 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.849
 looks like a sponge again 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.849
 with white color and blinded 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.990
 that's what it might look like 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.319
 just do the look of krakow 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.319
 night 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.540
 then the lips are on it, too 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.640
 namely a brush with black again 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.200
 eyeshadow and start differently on the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 inner surface of the lipper apply 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.780
 and to pass a little bit 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.640
 so that it looks nice again 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.820
 we blur the whole with white 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.820
 colour 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.180
 I tend to create more contour 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.519
 on black eyeshadow at the transition 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.500
 from under jawbone and neck given 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.650
 and blur this a bit 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.299
 with the hand 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.879
 above, of course, then again white color 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.260
 to clap on it because that's always one 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.260
 a little bit through education 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.290
 I'm taking a mascara is my 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.900
 by maybelline this is the wrong one 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.800
 Windman feather look mascara and wearing 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.320
 she pretty neat and now comes 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.850
 a channel from the p2 for use with the me 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.850
 my eyes continue to compete 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.590
 if you have aerobatics in the face 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.000
 you want to do that too I have 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.340
 now here on the lip a bit 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.080
 applied 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.489
 The sea was not quite so liked 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.090
 I have a bit of it again 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.090
 blinded 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.139
 ready to go make-up look and now 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.210
 we come to the costume a spirit has yes 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.470
 usually a long white robe 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.389
 I have a t-shirt here now 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.530
 Dress chosen by Freimarkt that has 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.530
 seven euros cost 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.789
 we cut off all the stitches first 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.360
 that are clean that is featured 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.099
 collar he garbage and t shirt ground 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.840
 you can do something violent 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.250
 Proceed and like me here 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000
 bit the whole very much frowned upon 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.000
 more difficult 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.000
 and then of course it's the rest of the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.340
 t shirt on the collar 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.520
 you can create holes 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.220
 It does not have to happen to say so now 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.370
 a slightly dirty t shirt look too 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.150
 I take the chalk from Faber 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.650
 castell 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.290
 it must not only be black 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.729
 but for example red or brown and 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.800
 do it on the t-shirt 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.360
 I give it especially to the 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.400
 I cut before that 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.720
 I think that looks a bit like 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.690
 if you got stuck somewhere and 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.130
 that would be demolished 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.720
 to enhance the effect you can 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.520
 also the chalk directly on safety 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.430
 give and then rub 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.160
 I take red colors once those 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.099
 red text ii color an acrylic paint and 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.110
 then a black acrylic paint around it 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.500
 blood that is about to emerge so one 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.690
 a little bit darker 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.590
 Now I add water to the whole 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.069
 to dilute 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.509
 so that I can spray on it now 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.610
 I also give the blood on the 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.289
 holes and am happy human 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.120
 So I can tell you the wig 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:03.009
 raise that requires a bit 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.009
 Exercise but exercise makes the champion 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:18.529
 yes I think that was something else 

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:19.899
 from me or I did not think 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:22.849
 but I just looked evil 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:25.729
 video files max kelly halloween action 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.559

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.279
 think that looks really cool and 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.749
