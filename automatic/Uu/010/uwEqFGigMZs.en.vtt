00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300 

I<00:00:00.060> learned<00:00:00.510> by<00:00:00.659> holding<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:01.050> hoop<00:00:01.230> here<00:00:01.530> where

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
I learned by holding a hoop here where

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.980 
I learned by holding a hoop here where
it's<00:00:02.460> behind<00:00:02.700> you<00:00:02.970> touching<00:00:03.419> your<00:00:03.540> back<00:00:03.689> and

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
it's behind you touching your back and

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.830 
it's behind you touching your back and
you<00:00:04.830> toss<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.960> make<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.740> rotation<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.840> you

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
you toss it make one rotation and you

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.419 
you toss it make one rotation and you
catch<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.200> with<00:00:10.500> just<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:10.980> hand

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
catch it with just one hand

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.070 
catch it with just one hand
so<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.670> went<00:00:11.820> from<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> one<00:00:15.080> now

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
so you went from this to this so one now

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.359 
so you went from this to this so one now
you're<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> toss<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> other<00:00:17.160> way

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
you're going to toss it the other way

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.730 
you're going to toss it the other way
and<00:00:17.730> catch<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.390> with<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.750> hand<00:00:19.310> one<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.960> your

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and catch it with this hand one so your

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.939 
and catch it with this hand one so your
hands<00:00:23.100> don't<00:00:23.880> really<00:00:24.180> leave<00:00:24.529> this<00:00:25.529> front

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
hands don't really leave this front

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.290 
hands don't really leave this front
thing<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:28.260> front<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> you

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.330 

just<00:00:32.750> get<00:00:32.899> used<00:00:33.050> to<00:00:33.260> how<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:33.530> feels<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:34.100> toss

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
just get used to how it feels to toss

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.460 
just get used to how it feels to toss
your<00:00:34.550> hoop<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.480> stop<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.989> momentum

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
your hoop and the stop the momentum

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.930 
your hoop and the stop the momentum
because<00:00:36.739> your<00:00:36.920> momentum<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.399> going<00:00:37.610> one<00:00:37.790> way

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
because your momentum is going one way

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.819 
because your momentum is going one way
you're<00:00:38.629> going<00:00:38.840> to<00:00:38.899> be<00:00:39.020> stuffing<00:00:39.500> it<00:00:39.680> and

that'll be crazy so keep it flat toss it
back<00:01:01.070> evenly<00:01:01.629> catch<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:03.009> lean<00:01:04.009> into<00:01:04.369> your

catch

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.080 

so<00:01:09.450> turn<00:01:09.749> your<00:01:09.929> body<00:01:10.109> to<00:01:10.499> anticipate<00:01:11.090> your

so turn your body to anticipate your

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.139 
so turn your body to anticipate your
hoop<00:01:12.409> coming<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.999> your<00:01:14.999> hand<00:01:15.299> catching<00:01:16.109> it

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
hoop coming and your hand catching it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.399 
hoop coming and your hand catching it
slowly<00:01:18.149> start<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> move<00:01:18.719> your<00:01:18.780> hands<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.289> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
slowly start to move your hands to the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.859 
slowly start to move your hands to the
side<00:01:19.939> might<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.149> little<00:01:21.240> walk<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
side might get a little walk here you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.859 
side might get a little walk here you
don't<00:01:21.959> have<00:01:22.079> as<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.409> control<00:01:23.630> hit<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.749> from

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
don't have as much control hit it from

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.630 
don't have as much control hit it from
the<00:01:24.929> side<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.500> body<00:01:25.590> instead<00:01:26.429> of<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the side of your body instead of the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270 
the side of your body instead of the
front<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.539> were<00:01:27.630> hitting<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.929> before<00:01:28.319> more

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
front or you were hitting it before more

front or you were hitting it before more
to<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:29.549> side<00:01:30.979> then<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.099> can<00:01:32.250> add<00:01:32.459> in<00:01:33.229> arm

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
to the side then you can add in arm

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.889 
to the side then you can add in arm
breaks<00:01:34.729> you're<00:01:35.729> doing<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> exact<00:01:36.329> same<00:01:36.359> thing

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
breaks you're doing the exact same thing

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.749 
breaks you're doing the exact same thing
you<00:01:36.929> were<00:01:37.170> doing<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.679> hands<00:01:38.009> except

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you were doing with your hands except

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.959 
you were doing with your hands except
you're<00:01:38.939> using<00:01:39.319> this<00:01:40.319> hard<00:01:40.709> part<00:01:41.039> of<00:01:41.459> your<00:01:41.819> arm

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
you're using this hard part of your arm

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.919 
you're using this hard part of your arm
right<00:01:42.239> here<00:01:42.319> your<00:01:43.319> forearm<00:01:44.750> you're<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
right here your forearm you're going to

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.630 
right here your forearm you're going to
hit<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> hard<00:01:46.469> enough<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.679> send<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.129> back

hit it hard enough to send it back

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
hit it hard enough to send it back
might<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.509> wonky<00:01:48.719> because<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.319> have<00:01:49.409> less

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
might get wonky because you have less

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.959 
might get wonky because you have less
control<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.399> catching<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969

other current your brakes may be a
little<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.539> wonky<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.590> side

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
little more wonky because the one side

little more wonky because the one side
you're<00:02:05.069> not<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:05.489> fluent<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.119> hand<00:02:09.420> brakes

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
side arm brakes then there's elbow

side arm brakes then there's elbow
breaks<00:02:16.849> which<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.120> more<00:02:18.480> up<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.900> top<00:02:19.109> of<00:02:19.620> when

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
breaks which I do more up on top of when

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.309 
breaks which I do more up on top of when
I'm<00:02:20.160> shoulder<00:02:20.519> or<00:02:20.639> chest<00:02:20.819> hooping<00:02:21.139> you<00:02:22.139> can

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
I'm shoulder or chest hooping you can

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.890 
I'm shoulder or chest hooping you can
brake<00:02:22.760> with<00:02:23.760> your<00:02:23.940> elbows

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.630 

which<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.739> exact<00:02:30.040> same<00:02:30.250> thing<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.580> are

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
which is the exact same thing you are

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.020 
which is the exact same thing you are
doing<00:02:30.730> down<00:02:31.060> here<00:02:31.360> into<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.530> side<00:02:32.849> book<00:02:33.849> with

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
doing down here into the side book with

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.610 
doing down here into the side book with
your<00:02:34.150> elbows<00:02:36.599> there's<00:02:37.599> also<00:02:37.810> things<00:02:38.170> called

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
your elbows there's also things called

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.320 
your elbows there's also things called
pinch<00:02:38.920> breaks<00:02:39.450> which<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.629> a<00:02:40.659> double<00:02:41.140> break<00:02:41.409> on

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
pinch breaks which is a double break on

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.410 
pinch breaks which is a double break on
one<00:02:43.330> side<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:45.069> you're<00:02:45.220> breaking<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.000> momentum

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
one side so you're breaking the momentum

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970 
one side so you're breaking the momentum
breaking<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.959> momentum<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:47.470> sending<00:02:47.860> it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
breaking the momentum and sending it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.190 
breaking the momentum and sending it
back<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.760> way<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.909> was<00:02:49.030> coming<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:50.140> I'm

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
back the way it was coming so I'm

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.089 
back the way it was coming so I'm
hooping<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.680> left

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
hooping to the left

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.390 
hooping to the left
I<00:02:51.870> break<00:02:52.870> break<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:53.769> still<00:02:54.040> hooping<00:02:54.370> to

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
I break break and I'm still hooping to

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.160 
I break break and I'm still hooping to
the<00:02:54.579> left<00:02:56.819> freak<00:02:57.819> freak<00:02:58.269> freak<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:59.079> I'm

the left freak freak freak and I'm

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.780 
the left freak freak freak and I'm
hoping<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.769> right<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.920> then<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.670> can

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
hoping to the right and then you can

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.750 
hoping to the right and then you can
break<00:03:03.970> on<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.480> side<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:06.340> as<00:03:06.430> good<00:03:06.549> as<00:03:06.640> that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
break on this side not as good as that

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.220 
break on this side not as good as that
there<00:03:07.690> we<00:03:07.810> go

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
there we go

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.960 
there we go
nope<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:10.950> send<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.040> back<00:03:12.069> I'm<00:03:12.400> not<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:12.790> good<00:03:12.940> on

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
nope and send it back I'm not as good on

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.960 
nope and send it back I'm not as good on
that<00:03:13.090> side<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.829> primarily<00:03:14.829> do<00:03:15.310> my<00:03:15.430> pinch<00:03:15.700> breaks

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
that side I primarily do my pinch breaks

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.110 
that side I primarily do my pinch breaks
on<00:03:16.780> one<00:03:17.200> side<00:03:17.609> but<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:18.700> want<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:18.940> practice

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
on one side but you want to practice

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.740 
on one side but you want to practice
both<00:03:19.480> not<00:03:20.170> like<00:03:20.379> me

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
both not like me

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.580 
both not like me
break<00:03:22.750> break

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.199 

and<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.400> change<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.880> amount<00:03:26.970> of

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
and you can change the amount of

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.540 
and you can change the amount of
rotations<00:03:27.780> between<00:03:28.140> your<00:03:28.290> breaks<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.430> you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
rotations between your breaks so you

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.600 
rotations between your breaks so you
could<00:03:29.910> break<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.720> two<00:03:31.319> three<00:03:31.830> great

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
could break one two three great

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.660 
could break one two three great
one<00:03:32.819> two<00:03:33.330> three<00:03:33.810> great<00:03:34.319> one<00:03:37.220> but<00:03:38.220> again<00:03:38.490> you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
one two three great one but again you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.920 
one two three great one but again you
want<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.940> practice<00:03:39.120> hooping<00:03:39.569> in<00:03:39.660> your<00:03:39.780> other

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
want to practice hooping in your other

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.160 
want to practice hooping in your other
current<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.069> when<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.810> break<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.989> from

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
current so that when you break it from

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.490 
current so that when you break it from
your<00:03:43.380> original<00:03:43.470> trip<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.989> don't<00:03:46.020> have<00:03:46.350> it

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
your original trip you don't have it

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.250 
your original trip you don't have it
fall<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.930> lose<00:03:49.050> your<00:03:49.170> momentum<00:03:51.260> hope

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260
