00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.849
 Hello dear friends with you Hades and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.680
 today we will see a mod for minecraft 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.840
 which will allow you to move your home 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.180
 let's say you want to travel on 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 maynkrafta the world go to the new location as well 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.289
 with the house and you part also not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.689
 want with this mod you can just 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 teleport your house and install it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.800
 in the right place let's look at 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.559
 Crafts first item and the corner 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.370
 marker it is needed to move 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.190
 your house 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.129
 crafting it and iron bars and glass 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
 next is the improved corner markers it 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 crafting from a regular corner marker 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.579
 diamond and gold bullion these items 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.920
 replaceable with each other that is possible 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.239
 use either 1 or the other both 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 immediately use even completely 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.980
 optional conditions only such 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.719
 the fact that this item will not be 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.660
 disappear when used that is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.340
 improved normal will disappear so i 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 it seems better to use 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.869
 but if you haven't saved enough 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.119
 diamond and gold bars then why 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.220
 don't use normal now let's 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.320
 look at gkou speaker this is also 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.509
 item that is needed to transfer 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.430
 he is no longer replaced by him 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.830
 surely i would even say it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.049
 the most important subject of fashion and craft 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.030
 he with lapis lazuli gold bars and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.520
 iron bars further we go 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.680
 bluprint by the way I already surveyed once 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.570
 bluprint this translates as drawing and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 here, as you can see, there are some 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 marks that is here we have a drawing 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.020
 just blue that is some 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.000
 construction drawing he craft from 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 lapis lazuli and paper now let's 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 We will understand how we all the same 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.200
 move our house let's for example 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.450
 even 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.820
 we throw this egg into the house already there 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.829
 some kind of egg and chicken we ran out I 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 will show you that nothing is lost in us 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.149
 for example there are hens in the house there are eggs 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.000
 who are just lying in the chest there 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.250
 things in the oven I don't even see the point of something 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.860
 put because the chest there is just 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.479
 happens like I am the first subject 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.750
 we set house poker 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.390
 preferably down the house that is 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.880
 diagonally somewhere here here you 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.130
 it must be established by the way 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.920
 something like private territory on 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.510
 servers with something but not completely further you 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.240
 build some here 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.240
 table to grab your home completely and 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.800
 put here already some of the corner 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.580
 marker let's get set 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.190
 improved 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.130
 and now take a piece of paper that is bluprint 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.700
 kartazh let's even get out of creativity and 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.680
 right click on your 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.320
 block on your floor spyker he and y 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.880
 speakers as you noticed everything is absolutely 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.459
 all the doors are missing for some reason we 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.830
 pulled out probably the doors are not transferred 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.810
 but nevertheless all the same, the mod is completely 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.480
 works even if the door is not transferred 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.190
 why do we need doors and how do you notice us 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.100
 it fell here such here 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.739
 an unusual piece of paper is already a drawing with 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.540
 the scheme here even says that I am 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.400
 by its author and let's try 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.320
 move to somewhere in our house which 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.140
 Any new place somewhere on the mountain 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.030
 such as the mountain pose well, somewhere 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.799
 here here even here more even 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.769
 playground let's go here 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.290
 so we have to take our house poker 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.120
 again you can by the way even that one dig up and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.459
 put it in the ground 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 Well, I think so better then you 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.840
 take your already copied 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.700
 copied drawing ie with the scheme and 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.120
 right click on this 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.250
 block 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.530
 and you have your house completely transported 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.239
 by the way there is even a door that is there 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.489
 there was a jack door or something 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.190
 I see, here you have all the eggs 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.410
 who stayed there and even in the chest 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.840
 remained the same things get 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.120
 some kind of door in my way 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.890
 it seems okay, I hope no one else 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.840
 the doors will not be dumped all will 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.269
 use mod float it is very 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.820
 cool on this all here is nothing more 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.070
 it doesnâ€™t add to you was it if you 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.140
