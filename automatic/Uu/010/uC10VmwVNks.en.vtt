00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 there are also in this news issue 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.620
 again a lot of interesting news 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.480
 including a friend of the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.099
 Her boyfriend is going because he 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.670
 then it's about a lot of gambling 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.690
 hair 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.429
 that's definitely a lot 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.360
 important and very central topic of the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.889
 today's news issue 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.299
 and then it is also about 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.010
 another game whose title is not straight 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.539
 but forgot all that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.330
 of course, right now after the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.330
 intro within the news so tune 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 what is the most important element in one 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 video game heroine like lara croft no 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.520
 not the breasts of course the hair what 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.410
 you again think we speak 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 namely now about the hair of lara 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.390
 croft in the latest launcher rise of the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.820
 tomb raider because you want the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.539
 Technology red and years ahead 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.280
 improve 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 Although the hair saw already in series 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.360
 reboot tomb raider damn well out in front 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.359
 especially on the pc version but you want to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.120
 continue to work quote we believe 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.220
 definitely that the hair or that the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 hna technology together with amd 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 The basis for it was developed 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.100
 the hair in our view 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 render future video games 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 so be game director brian hoarding im 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.470
 tomb raider also lures you 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.049
 are synonymous s.filmen oriented to the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 technology continues to improve 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.270
 this includes, by the way, also 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.549
 the so-called zero gravity effect and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.009
 The occurs when teachers in the water 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.750
 Goes and dives when the water comes out 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.299
 is her hair floating and when she is out 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.409
 rising to the water felt heavier 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.329
 and lumpy 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.520
 and obviously it's wet and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.070
 darker that was a lot now 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.630
 interesting news about hair or the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.759
 Hair from aircraft I really think so 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.710
 interesting because that's for me 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.700
 just another step in the direction 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.159
 realism 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
 I was the series reboot was easy 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.119
 through this technology yet 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.799
 more realistic and the graphic has me 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.869
 I really liked it and I get up 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.990
 Realism in video games and on graphics 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.520
 am a small graphic is critical 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.550
 so far it's really a cool and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.289
 interesting news and rise of the tomb 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.470
 raider will be released on november 13th 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.290
 Of course, 2000 worked for xbox 360 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.960
 stop first microsoft exclusive 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.370
 microsoft consoles exclusive and yes we 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.400
 First, news will hopefully go 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.200
 nothing to do with hair and yes 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.020
 This news has nothing to do with cock 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.000
 but with assassins because there is 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.620
 Now a new short movie about Assassin's 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.150
 creed syndicate that's just the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.290
 latest part of now at some point 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.210
 should appear 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.090
 and just like first, first, like unity 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.430
 There is syndicate too one year 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.060
 now a parcours short film of the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.510
 director and youtuber david graham and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.000
 Although some professionals are running some 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.040
 parcours pros over the roofs of 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.720
 London and yes the director has to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.150
 somehow deathly in the run with the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.910
 camera and has a really cool video 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.290
 yes, you should do that 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.970
 In any case, with her matching 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.370
 making-of-watching 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.100
 besides, this time it's really ubisoft 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.570
 as a sponsor in the background 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.610
 Everything pays for example too 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.700
 the flight from the whole parkour runners 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.230
 and from the whole team and what a lot 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.200
 interesting is because the whole is always 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.310
 so half empty because they are walking or 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.170
 climb on any rumors 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.610
 rumored high what they actually 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.959
 not allowed to come from time to time 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.390
 the police will probably speak 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.950
 even a place reference but yes so 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.200
 but it is cool that ubisoft then 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.090
 Nevertheless, it is behind it even if he 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.560
 the whole project is in a gray zone 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.880
 is definitely watching this 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.200
 paint video is really cool 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.240
 and now we come to a right one 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.850
 cool news yes what's cool a very 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.560
 curious news I would say and on 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.240
 I do not copy any case 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.760
 now right at the end of the news again 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.830
 It's about gambling 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.660
 Of course otherwise the whole thing would not be in 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.650
 the news will be discussed as news 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.210
 a 23 year old from castrop rauxel no 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.580
 not from the ami country here in too 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.130
 Germany happens something like this has its 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.690
 Stunned girlfriend and is now before the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.590
 or has to 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.000
 now before the district court for it 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.830
 can justify the girlfriend 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.960
 around 10 pm from work to home 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.550
 probably wanted a pleasant one 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.530
 spend evening with your friend 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.870
 He had other plans, however 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.580
 had invited a friend and gambled 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.930
 he wanted to gamble all night 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.310
 you can understand somehow, but 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.720
 the girlfriend did not think it was that good 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.080
 but then you have relatively 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.580
 quickly found a compromise 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.900
 shortly thereafter, the friend of the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.120
 girlfriend, however, the idea 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.530
 okay i have sleep here i 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.060
 could my girlfriend anesthetic and then 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.100
 continue to gamble and that's exactly what he did 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.800
 four to five drip this 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.510
 He then has sleeping aid in the tea of 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.070
 done to his girlfriend and she was sleeping 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.720
 just until noon the next 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.870
 day and he could share his 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.480
 friend the night by gambling, however 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.000
 he confessed to her the next day 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.530
 and she was not really excited 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.120
 I do not find it very surprising now 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.200
 separated and sued him because of 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.090
 Mayhem 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.850
 the court was not the whole 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.490
 so great and buzzing just 50 daily rates 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.310
 ten euros each on the ground because he is in 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.900
 the past often against the past 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.900
 narcotics act 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.470
 besides , he is probably considered addicted to 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.850
 schlafmittel so he has although 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.250
 this sleeping aid with which he his 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.140
 friends with place in the apartment in front 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.550
 court then he asserted that he whole 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.930
 would find stupid 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.420
 by now he's probably been ten years old 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.250
 months clean and has a training 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.420
 began 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.970
 Honestly, that's a very weird one 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.430
 Just tell his girlfriend 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.780
 operate because you want to gamble but it 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.010
 worked but with the 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.170
 Of course, consequences have now become 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.190
 of course, or already had 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.810
 have to reckon 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.250
 what do you think you would do something like that 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.740
 You've done something like that before 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.180
 or what do you think of this news 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.529
 said the whole wheel in Germany 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.459
 not always took place 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:56.109
 the land where something happens more often 

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:57.579
 hopefully not and that was it 

00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:58.959
 again a new news issue one the 

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:00.489
 time just flies that is 

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:02.289
 I thank you, of course, thank you 

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:04.089
 At this point company for watching 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.259
 and maybe just let one 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.519
 Comment maybe a thumb after 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.349
 above and then you look at each one 

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:10.059
 if he has the goat in the 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.509
 next news issue again bite then 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.509
 show
