00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.370 
550 the tone zone the bridge erin on in
the<00:00:19.470> neck<00:00:19.620> on<00:00:20.300> guitar<00:00:21.300> goes<00:00:21.540> into<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
California sound pedal pedal goes

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.640 
California sound pedal pedal goes
straight<00:00:24.840> into<00:00:25.020> my<00:00:25.320> mojo<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.860> pre<00:00:27.650> interface

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
straight into my mojo a pre interface

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.740 
straight into my mojo a pre interface
and<00:00:29.100> straight<00:00:30.090> into<00:00:30.140> logic<00:00:31.140> v<00:00:31.680> mi<00:00:31.860> MEK<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:33.450> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and straight into logic v mi MEK so this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.360 
and straight into logic v mi MEK so this
is<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:33.930> basically<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.830> you<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.280> a

so<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.129> next<00:00:57.519> week<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.820> all<00:00:58.059> here's<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.570> bridge

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:20.330 

bridge<00:01:09.610> pickup

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:47.410 

Oh

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:02:05.530 

you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.839 

pretty<00:02:06.540> sweet<00:02:07.520> Molly<00:02:08.520> complaint<00:02:09.440> really<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
pretty sweet Molly complaint really is a

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.210 
pretty sweet Molly complaint really is a
lack<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:12.120> mid<00:02:12.270> control<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:14.130> would

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
lack of a mid control I think that would

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.910 
lack of a mid control I think that would
really<00:02:14.280> help<00:02:14.580> bring<00:02:14.849> out<00:02:15.349> less<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.620> scoop

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
really help bring out less of a scoop

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.990 
really help bring out less of a scoop
sound<00:02:17.190> although<00:02:17.370> that's<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:17.730> bookies<00:02:17.970> are

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
sound although that's what bookies are

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.570 
sound although that's what bookies are
certain<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.660> or<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.920> let<00:02:20.040> me<00:02:20.099> do<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.250> quick<00:02:20.459> demo

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
certain of or so let me do a quick demo

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.870 
certain of or so let me do a quick demo
of<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.150> lead<00:02:21.450> tone<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:22.069> little<00:02:23.069> bit<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.489> steward

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
of the lead tone a little bit of steward

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:45.530 
of the lead tone a little bit of steward
olay<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.520> without<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.180> pedal

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.940

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
especially if we're going to be

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.979 
especially if we're going to be
recording<00:03:13.940> direct<00:03:14.300> sounds<00:03:14.810> killer<00:03:16.750> if<00:03:17.750> you

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
recording direct sounds killer if you

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.190 
recording direct sounds killer if you
need<00:03:18.470> more<00:03:18.620> mids<00:03:19.330> just<00:03:20.330> add<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.569> little<00:03:20.900> mitts

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
need more mids just add a little mitts

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.970 
need more mids just add a little mitts

an EQ pillow in front of it or something

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.110
