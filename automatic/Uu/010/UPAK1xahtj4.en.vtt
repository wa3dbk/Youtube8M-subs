00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.120
 welcome to a new fitness success a 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.060
 new video more specifically from his saga 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.369
 of videos how to gain muscle step by step 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.770
 let's say three videos made about 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 this issue 1 about the importance that 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.640
 have the calories when it comes to winning 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
 muscle others about the importance of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.180
 the proteins and another of the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 carbohydrates and this is the fourth video 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.190
 it's going to consist and we're going to talk 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.829
 about the importance and influence of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.750
 the fats when it comes to gaining muscle 1 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.950
 Golds cleanly as possible but 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950
 then we start 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.650
 The first thing you have to be clear about is 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.680
 that fats is the most nutrient macro 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.870
 dense in fact are 9 calories per grams 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.550
 and it's one of the biggest sources of 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.620
 our body's energy to our day 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.660
 a day is the main nutrient macro 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.610
 to optimize hormonal functions 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.780
 for example testosterone which is very 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.729
 important when it comes to gaining mass 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.430
 muscle also helps us reduce the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.410
 negative effects of cortisol as it says 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.860
 fats are the macronutrients over 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.509
 that's because our body can 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.159
 store it as very adipose tissue 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.560
 easily 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.600
 If your body is beautiful, I better 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.060
 carbohydrates or fats and I explain 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.939
 why several studies concluded that 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.670
 low fat diets less than a 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.100
 15% of the total calories of the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.350
 diet significantly reduced the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.679
 Testosterone levels in the body 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.869
 while high fat diets 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.409
 around 30 percent of the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.729
 total calories of the daily diet 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.890
 significantly increased the levels 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.739
 of testosterone in the room so 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.149
 friends my advice is that when they say it 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.599
 our daily diet 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.849
 the percentage of fats they consume does not 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.340
 they are below 15% but 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:07.250
 that by no means surpasses by far in 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.840
 40% because if not at the time of winning 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.610
 muscle would also be winning a lot 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.730
 fat so ideally I tell you I know 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.590
 the 30 15 30 that's what we have to 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.360
 differentiate two large groups the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 saturated fats and fats 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.099
 unsaturated or oils 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.430
 they are a kind of grace especially of 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:33.159
 food of animal origin and derivatives 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.950
 in two types of oils like coconut 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.310
 and the palm 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.230
 in society as damn since the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.030
 organism since it is a processed fat 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.580
 the organism does not have the quality of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.120
 transform but it tends to accumulate 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.190
 and that originates that ends up obstructing 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.230
 arteries as well as problems in the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.030
 circulatory system within the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.269
 unsaturated fats all against several 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.750
 types for example those of type 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.670
 monounsaturated which are the ones 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.080
 come from olive oil its 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.239
 main component is oleic acid 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.129
 It is a type of fat beneficial for 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.830
 organism since it helps us eliminate 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.959
 the bad fats and control the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.580
 blood cholesterol levels on the other 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.470
 side within the unsaturated we have 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.220
 the polyunsaturates that are beneficial 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.350
 for the organism 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.540
 it has a negative part too and it is 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.110
 which is oscillate more easily than the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.560
 rest releasing toxic substances 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.480
 ends up causing numerous diseases 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.360
 present that especially that the omega 3 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.060
 it's a fat that comes in handy for the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.530
 organism can now find in the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.440
 fish mostly because he learns 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.960
 salmon that in addition to face awaits you 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.780
 dams will provide a large amount of 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.370
 proteins so guys that's all the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.410
 information I wanted to give about 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.930
 fats when it comes to making our 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.030
 diet to gain muscle mass and nothing 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.670
 subscribe to the channel to like 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.590
 to continue supporting this project of the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.310
 paste once these ends and see you in 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.310
