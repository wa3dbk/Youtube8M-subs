were<00:00:30.449> doing<00:00:31.449> another<00:00:31.659> interview<00:00:32.290> and<00:00:32.560> I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
were doing another interview and I

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.250 
were doing another interview and I
assume<00:00:34.000> that's<00:00:34.150> good<00:00:34.810> practice<00:00:35.230> for

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
assume that's good practice for

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.870 
assume that's good practice for
forgetting<00:00:36.250> your<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:38.320> stick<00:00:38.650> have<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:39.730> had

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
forgetting your your stick have you had

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.660 
forgetting your your stick have you had
time<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.150> sort<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.660> build<00:00:40.990> both<00:00:41.740> on<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.220> off

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
time to sort of build both on and off

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.780 
time to sort of build both on and off
air<00:00:43.360> yeah<00:00:44.200> I<00:00:44.230> guess<00:00:44.440> we've<00:00:44.650> had<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:45.160> mean<00:00:45.430> you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
air yeah I guess we've had I mean you

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.510 
air yeah I guess we've had I mean you
know<00:00:45.910> we've<00:00:46.540> got<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> benefit<00:00:47.200> of<00:00:47.380> a<00:00:48.040> long

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
know we've got the benefit of a long

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.520 
know we've got the benefit of a long
time<00:00:48.790> until<00:00:49.000> we<00:00:49.210> can<00:00:49.360> go<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.570> where<00:00:49.780> so<00:00:50.170> it's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
time until we can go to where so it's

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.870 
time until we can go to where so it's
been<00:00:50.770> quite<00:00:51.010> good<00:00:51.250> because<00:00:51.340> we've<00:00:51.550> been<00:00:51.580> able

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
been quite good because we've been able

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.370 
been quite good because we've been able
to<00:00:52.180> sort<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.480> spend<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.750> lot<00:00:52.870> of<00:00:52.900> time<00:00:53.020> outside

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
to sort of spend a lot of time outside

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.680 
to sort of spend a lot of time outside
this<00:00:53.710> year<00:00:54.130> writing<00:00:54.610> together<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.390> obviously

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
this year writing together and obviously

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.660 
this year writing together and obviously
we've<00:00:55.900> done<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.170> bunch<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.950> sort<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.310> many<00:00:57.520> or

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
we've done a bunch of sort of many or

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.190 
we've done a bunch of sort of many or
interviews<00:00:57.700> which<00:00:58.300> have<00:00:58.450> been<00:00:58.570> really<00:00:58.810> good<00:00:59.080> I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
interviews which have been really good I

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.290 
interviews which have been really good I
think<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.470> more<00:00:59.710> time<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.430> we've<00:01:00.850> had<00:01:01.030> to

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
think the more time that we've had to

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.450 
think the more time that we've had to
spend<00:01:01.570> together<00:01:01.690> in<00:01:02.080> two

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
spend together in two

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.880 
spend together in two
the<00:01:03.790> better<00:01:04.000> it<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.330> for<00:01:04.390> us<00:01:04.690> because<00:01:05.680> it's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
the better it is for us because it's

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.080 
the better it is for us because it's
nicely<00:01:06.070> kind<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.520> hit<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.640> ground<00:01:06.850> running

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
nicely kind of hit the ground running

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.910 
nicely kind of hit the ground running
when<00:01:07.330> we<00:01:07.479> actually<00:01:07.659> are<00:01:08.110> finally<00:01:08.680> allowed<00:01:08.860> to

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
when we actually are finally allowed to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.609 
when we actually are finally allowed to
speak<00:01:09.460> on<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.850> right<00:01:10.000> we're<00:01:10.330> so<00:01:10.810> bored<00:01:11.320> of

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
speak on the right we're so bored of

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.880 
speak on the right we're so bored of
pretending<00:01:12.600> pretending<00:01:13.600> radio<00:01:14.470> all<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.710> time

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
pretending pretending radio all the time

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.160 
pretending pretending radio all the time

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
but we'll get that when I once we get

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.490 
but we'll get that when I once we get
going<00:04:06.120> we'll<00:04:06.480> work<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.260> know<00:04:07.350> that

right<00:04:09.690> where<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.300> I<00:04:12.300> kind<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.780> thought

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
right where is and I kind of thought

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.780 
right where is and I kind of thought
you'd<00:04:13.650> have<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.950> expect<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.370> because<00:04:14.550> I've

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
you'd have to expect that because I've

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.430 
you'd have to expect that because I've
seen<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.300> many<00:04:15.330> times<00:04:15.510> before<00:04:15.900> over<00:04:16.320> the

seen it so many times before over the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.580 
seen it so many times before over the
years<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.700> that's<00:04:18.570> okay<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.049> can<00:04:19.260> be<00:04:19.440> worked

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
years and that's okay that can be worked

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.380 
years and that's okay that can be worked
out<00:04:19.829> but<00:04:20.130> we<00:04:20.370> don't<00:04:20.549> have<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:20.760> here<00:04:20.970> we're

places that you are that you're going
and<00:05:56.310> you<00:05:56.550> can't<00:05:56.760> do<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.540> in<00:05:57.750> an

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
and you can't do that in an

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.230 
and you can't do that in an
international<00:05:58.350> show<00:05:58.800> but<00:05:59.520> that<00:05:59.970> doesn't

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
international show but that doesn't

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.300 
international show but that doesn't
change<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.600> content<00:06:01.200> it<00:06:01.440> just<00:06:01.680> means<00:06:02.100> that

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
change the content it just means that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.610 
change the content it just means that
you're<00:06:02.730> expressing<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.990> in<00:06:04.080> a<00:06:04.170> more<00:06:04.320> general

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
you're expressing it in a more general

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.250 
you're expressing it in a more general
way<00:06:04.800> but<00:06:05.670> better<00:06:06.240> than<00:06:06.360> that<00:06:06.630> it<00:06:06.780> provides<00:06:07.140> a

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
way but better than that it provides a

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.230 
way but better than that it provides a
massive<00:06:07.620> advantage<00:06:07.770> it's<00:06:08.460> so<00:06:08.670> much<00:06:08.880> better<00:06:09.090> to

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
massive advantage it's so much better to

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.060 
massive advantage it's so much better to
be<00:06:09.450> national<00:06:09.900> than<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.170> is<00:06:10.290> to<00:06:10.500> be<00:06:10.620> local

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
be national than it is to be local
