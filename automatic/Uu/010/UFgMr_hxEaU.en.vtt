00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello people now who knows me who knows 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.919
 that I do not have my feet under the table 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.960
 can keep still and have accordingly 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.559
 I thought if you could 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 small generator showing off in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.529
 the hybrid traditions try already 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
 knows this is this little thing in there 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.400
 any way even can top 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 and then I thought to top 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.769
 Well, I was at the castle 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.570
 Battery code got the bee one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.649
 video I also have the small generator 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.420
 this battery is gutted while we're there 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.270
 everything not fast enough again 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.969
 has gone and I break the saw 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 battery to foot did so 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.420
 the consultant will become gas technical 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 do not let it close like that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.020
 small there makes with the two acryl 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.039
 plates in this regard the grass 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.020
 technical incarceration I have to because I 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.920
 still something to think about but how the same 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.960
 iphone so also right now there himself 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.240
 is the same hybrid 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130
 dry zinc system if you call it that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.610
 can 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:16.680
 these are in the core 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 chambers 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.360
 and every camera has its own 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.909
 For this I have the electrodes 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.280
 put wet cell in demanding 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.560
 there are six and six programs each 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.040
 that means three plates and three plates 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.380
 three are each - three are positive 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 and the whole is a plus-minus 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.680
 circuit within this same that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.530
 whole is then but generator technically 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 seen a series connection over this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.710
 bridge there and I hope that now 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.320
 until even better work better 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.270
 that it is the small already anyway do from 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.600
 I'm really pleasantly surprised 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.990
 how small the thing is and what that is there 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.990
 you can see how stable and 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.769
 Overall, the little part is happy 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.769
 I hope that the degree of the big one in 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.260
 that's what I'm gonna do 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.599
 now the housing with electrolyte 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.209
 Feel and be energized when we become 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.940
 then how can look as the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.060
 within the individual cells 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.489
 who through the current plate of the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.660
 small generator mirror the previously one 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.849
 can not see what's in there 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.239
 but it should happen here 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.180
 his 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.620
 i'm making this video now and that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.410
 technically i will see like me 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.720
 the generator for the yes I know both 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 Gas tests or mass examinations are available 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.980
 still on 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.260
 from now on feel in the generator 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.870
 with electrolyte on and then we see 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.829
 Something happens to generator with 610 all 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 you can flooded it is on the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.290
 broadcast of the plusminus north pole 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.630
 alignment in the respective zones 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.209
 respect, think highly of 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:25.170
 temperature 18 to 17 and 80 degrees celsius to 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:29.209
 voltage 2.119 probably total voltage 12 9 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.209
 and 7 9 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.390
 how could foresee already does 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.930
 it's quite a generator 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.560
 that's what it's all about 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.810
 technically close the gas generator and 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.370
 to be able to measure the amount of gas for this purpose 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.000
 I have to follow the solution 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.210
 thought that I will show now how 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.580
 again and again for scrap I have 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.090
 In favor of this little plastic 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.010
 almost fetched and then you go and 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.730
 puts the generator completely like him 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.530
 is in this barrel purely 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.840
 so you can now the generator already 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.820
 close once 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.950
 you can now order the generator too 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.290
 you could still cool water around now 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.030
 insert the housing and rom so that 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.020
 the heat from the generator into the water 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.760
 is delivered 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.290
 What else can you do with the water? 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.270
 you can do it yourself 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.210
 leave 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:46.290
 the whole one can then with such a 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.490
 Close the lid before that makes you 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.340
 Hold the electrical connections there 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.950
 Gas connection then the whole with the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.680
 Hidden with a screwing train 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.650
 makes therefore the generator is correct 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.360
 gas tight and now we are absolutely 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.060
 main customers of this whole 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.190
 history and indeed for all the 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.650
 newbies or I have to go for this 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.330
 can inspire design is 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.570
 absolute caution offered 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.490
 as you can see it is about 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.900
 approximately an estimated 30 liters 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.550
 that is when the generator is full 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.080
 is functional there are also 30 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.940
 liter of grass under a certain pressure 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.040
 if necessary, it prevails 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.060
 any reason ignition 30 liters 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.669
 ignited that is a invention it stands 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.820
 a considerable damage 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.610
 therefore at this point warning for 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.120
 all who build this construction 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.150
 Why the generator is in this way 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.620
 and wise only to operate under vacuum 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.930
 that means you would have the gases now 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.090
 in the generator arise over a 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.150
 Vacuum vacuum pump so 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.840
 a generator now getting a silver 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.540
 Vacuum progress is then actually 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.750
 these explosions as well as 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.330
 locked out 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.860
 Now, in fact, this is still 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.380
 wanting to measure at and at this point 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.340
 I'm all looking for yours now 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.160
 ask opinion 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.090
 You now know the big generator 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.560
 since you can now also the little one 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.410
 What do you think which of the two 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.470
 generators will be at the same input 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.440
 saying ampere will produce more gas 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.800
 may have something to do with the size 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.770
 or how will that behave when 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.960
 could you believe that to know her 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.350
 know it as always nice down there 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.550
 its post and do not forget the 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.460
 subscribe to the channel 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.720
 I will then take the gas measurements 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.729
 someday do not shoot me dead 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.100
 someday 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:03.410
 until then, I say thank you for watching 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.410
 Want a good time you they
