00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.539
 the extension of the recycling sports center is the result of some 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.860
 preconditions that require the program to meet the needs 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.579
 current and future 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.789
 and in the medium term 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.319
 In order to achieve the greatest versatility ineffectiveness of spaces 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.239
 sectorizing and centralizing the different uses to facilitate 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.600
 accessibility and management 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.110
 enable action by phases of autonomous operation 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
 the location and operation of possible actions 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.100
 the general approach 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.410
 consists of minimizing the access roads 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.770
 potential of pedestrian circulation 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.570
 relying on seats 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.740
 it contributes to reflect an urban order and does not exist at this moment 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.100
 it's about replacing the entire police sports center 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.400
 to comment 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.240
 all the facilities 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 the other one in an orderly and rational way 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 for it 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.050
 the demolition of the parts of the bleachers and changing rooms of the velodrome is proposed 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.050
 both facilities in poor condition 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.290
 the centralization of the main access is projected with the location 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.140
 from the checkpoint 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.990
 together with a pavilion that will house a restaurant and bar with a terrace 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.650
 Main and secondary routes have been marked to facilitate the fast 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.660
 distribution of activities 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.630
 three other pedestrian entrances are proposed 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.009
 on each side of the triangle that forms the sports center 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.120
 in order to allow easy and quick accessibility to the complex 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.180
 from the center of the population as well as from the new expansion zone 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 of the same one that is adjoining 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.289
 the summer pool enclosure seguiriya with access 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.669
 independent to control the operation independently 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.669
 to the rest of the equipment 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.519
 The reconstruction of the velodrome enclosure and the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.709
 provision of costumes is guaranteed 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.620
 since the city council has projected the location of a 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.480
 enlargement then followed the existing ones in the field of 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.480
 football 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.699
 new sports tracks are proposed 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:53.989
 three tracks multifunction as artist mini tennis two tennis courts one track 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.219
 of football with bleachers and artificial turf 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.379
 two children's tracks for children up to eight years 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.859
 an area of ​​the playground with children's games and swings 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.629
 a conditioning of the current tracks is also proposed 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.409
 as well as velodrome
