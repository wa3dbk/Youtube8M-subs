total level as of march 21st 2015 19 22
total<00:05:27.189> I<00:05:27.340> think<00:05:27.580> I'm<00:05:27.669> 1800<00:05:28.330> rancor<00:05:28.629> so<00:05:28.810> I

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
total I think I'm 1800 rancor so I

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.300 
total I think I'm 1800 rancor so I
really<00:05:29.139> want<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.319> get<00:05:29.409> under<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:29.740> thousand<00:05:30.159> but

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
really want to get under a thousand but

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.129 
really want to get under a thousand but
i<00:05:30.490> think<00:05:30.879> i<00:05:30.909> still<00:05:31.060> need<00:05:31.240> like<00:05:31.360> 80<00:05:31.599> levels<00:05:31.990> for

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
i think i still need like 80 levels for

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.050 
i think i still need like 80 levels for
that<00:05:32.259> so<00:05:32.860> we'll<00:05:33.159> see<00:05:33.339> we'll<00:05:33.580> see<00:05:33.610> what<00:05:33.849> I<00:05:33.879> said

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
that so we'll see we'll see what I said

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.490 
that so we'll see we'll see what I said
to<00:05:34.150> do<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.629> I'm<00:05:34.750> sort<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.169> don't<00:05:35.259> know<00:05:35.379> what

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
to do so I'm sort of I don't know what

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.019 
to do so I'm sort of I don't know what
to<00:05:35.529> do<00:05:35.680> now<00:05:35.830> I'm<00:05:36.009> probably<00:05:36.190> I'm<00:05:36.639> not<00:05:36.759> sure<00:05:36.819> if<00:05:37.000> I

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
to do now I'm probably I'm not sure if I

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.879 
to do now I'm probably I'm not sure if I
should<00:05:37.060> go<00:05:37.270> for<00:05:37.419> 95<00:05:37.779> Slayer<00:05:38.020> that's<00:05:38.710> sort<00:05:38.860> of

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
should go for 95 Slayer that's sort of

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:39.959 
should go for 95 Slayer that's sort of
my<00:05:39.009> goal<00:05:39.219> because<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:39.520> think<00:05:39.580> with<00:05:39.789> the<00:05:39.879> new

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
my goal because I think with the new
