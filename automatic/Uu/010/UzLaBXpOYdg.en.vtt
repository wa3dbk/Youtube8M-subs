00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 Hello and welcome to one

 new further edition on this to the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.650
 cinema block and nice that you again 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 I want to have turned on today 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.710
 you have a blu ray release 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.540
 imagine it is this 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 newest work with sandra bullock george 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.989
 clooney 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 the limited edition of the film gravity 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.480
 in 3d yes this steelbook I have with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 amazon shot and with the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.140
 pre-order price of 28 euros came that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.660
 make an appointment today 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 Of course the movie is not cheap 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 and he has also been in the last days 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.400
 and the last weeks pretty much 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.570
 discussed in some before and just on 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.940
 facebook and co 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.830
 that the movie would not be that great 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.430
 others said the movie would be 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.080
 class 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 and that's why I thought so 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.650
 anyway 3d fan am 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.660
 So I imagine the steelbook and boxe 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.760
 I do or do this beautiful one today 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.300
 limited steelbook on boxes 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 the movie itself as I said I have 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.270
 Of course I'm not happy about that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.560
 we'll see it tonight 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.700
 to watch and if I'm in any case 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.350
 Watch this evening 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020
 because I'm an absolute science fiction 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.640
 I am a fan and I think the story 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.649
 here in the world everything is pretty cool and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.579
 also makes a very authentic 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.039
 impression 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.850
 and yes, I do not want to do so now 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.710
 long chat 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.479
 I just want you now 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.310
 unboxing or respectively 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.929
 blu-ray gravity 3d on boxing so i have 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.549
 Just go to the back and where 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.100
 you take this beautiful blu ray forward 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.219
 we can see we have here again 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.319
 a fsk 12 bottles on it with a 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.179
 banderole I just shoot the movie 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:46.409
 why and you can already see 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.149
 we have one more time here so we do 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.829
 have a running time of total here 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.829
 91 minutes 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.350
 and we have a dolby digital 5.1 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:02.899
 soundtrack in german we see this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:07.889
 it can be a pity that we have such a movie 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.509
 not in a 7.1 track because of the 

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:13.080
 movie is really after the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.640
 latest criteria of sound in the picture 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.500
 recorded 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.880
 and I can not understand it 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.330
 why you do not roll here 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.880
 7.1 track has built I understand 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.880
 not only good is what we have 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.000
 else on the disc on it we have 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.570
 lots of specials here so much 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.840
 bonus material and of course I think 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.180
 we have a second edition here and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.220
 once the 3d version once the normal 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.350
 blu ray and I would just do that 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.290
 I say make time these stupid flyers 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.220
 back from something like that and then 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.960
 Let's see how the good piece now 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.030
 really looks like we have up here 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.620
 again this adhesive professionals and with it is 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.270
 the fsk bottles determined the man 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.240
 Again in the queen bad looks too 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.950
 away we start the other way around today 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.370
 Today I'll show you the backcover 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.740
 what I now so at first, or 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.720
 whoever does not like it for the first time 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.250
 there is only the little at least that has 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.670
 the sender blog is in space 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.990
 would 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.820
 drifts unexpectedly and yes because I do not 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.190
 maybe you would have the one here 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.260
 best where those were blown up with 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.230
 are still in space in space 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.690
 but can not let go 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.670
 great so the backcover is very 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.010
 simply and simply done is 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.830
 not really the absolute right now 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.990
 finger from the front then sits again 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.880
 different from the gravity 3d 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.520
 Steelbook really great and can 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.190
 also really in full glory here 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.870
 the artwork of the frontcover shine 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.730
 looks really awesome and horny 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.730
 I love it 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.830
 one has already in many pages 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.760
 partly seen as the artwork 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.920
 should look like 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.480
 from the inside we naturally have it 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.800
 also very gloomy 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.290
 then of course we have one more 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.060
 digital copy code here but the tower 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.790
 out again or digital 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.049
 ultra violet colt is that yes asked 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.730
 nothing to see and as I said 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.460
 we have a second edition here 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.730
 once here we have the 3d blu ray 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.070
 there is a 3d movie on it and if 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.140
 I'll get that out now 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.930
 then just stop the 2d blu-ray here 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.910
 in there for 2d playback so if you 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.130
 of course, no 3d tv now have 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.360
 or no 3d blu ray player you can 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.680
 pick you still this movie 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.750
 At some point you have to go that way 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.740
 a nice 3d blu ray player and 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.790
 can also shine with that inside 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.350
 this artwork is natural 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.840
 breathtaking that looks really cool 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.160
 responsible really great special or 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.870
 limited edition 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.800
 and I'm curious what we still all 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.870
 on extras on it is and on this film 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.240
 absolutely only recommend this steelbook 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.050
 looks really great 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.810
 I like it 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.720
 gets except a shortcoming of the back pressure 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.610
 or that the bag pressure I just 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.090
 already called I think now completely 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.770
 not quite brought into scene and yes 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.680
 but no one has to know for themselves 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.450
 decide for yourself 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.820
 yes, all in all, I say very clearly 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.730
 Here again clear purchase decision from 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.070
 Andy's cinema blog for gravity 3ds weighed a lot 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.620
 limited edition and that was mine 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.419
 unboxing i hope you liked it 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.210
 See you at my next video 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.280
 and I say clearly buy buy 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.020
 buy the steelbook is really cool 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.760
 looks very cool and if it stops 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.970
 it is really limited 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.370
 definitely sold out soon in this 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.590
 meaning from skin in its pure year to the 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.590
 from anis kino blogschau's doing well
