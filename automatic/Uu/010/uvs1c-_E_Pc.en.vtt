00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.080
 Good day, dear flower lovers 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:15.280
 today continue to watch the petunias 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:20.609
 they have already begun their bloom here are three 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:26.380
 the pot that case 3 weeks ago 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:31.080
 here are 6 bushes of three small and 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 here is the salmon of its needles and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.510
 petunias from the series yes yes he should 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.390
 there was to be no white blotches 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.989
 she's cute too I don't know why 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.649
 here is this petunia multicolor terry 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:54.190
 she erect should be 25 30 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:58.809
 centimeters high here's a pot on 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.090
 already takes its proper form 3 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.020
 low hockey spot which is 15 cm 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.509
 tall 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.990
 they grew up the first I have a lot of them 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:13.209
 cut off a flower rose first so 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.819
 how so small pasty 

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:20.740
 power it matures faster 

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:23.259
 terry need more time and what I want 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.000
 say they cost me all day long 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:31.679
 the sun is at its brightest 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.679
 open sun in the wind 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.830
 at the same time when they do not stand on such 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.250
 the sun accounted for them accounted for them 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.849
 often water until blocked green 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.520
 by weight 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:48.640
 the whole surface of the earth despite the fact that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.270
 he had a hydrogel in the heat had to 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.860
 water every day now i water them 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.050
 1 3 days 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.319
 although the heat is just avira him 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:04.030
 some kind of abnormal on the thermometer 40 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:07.300
 degrees in the sun this composition 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.340
 still not show yourself in all its glory here 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:16.270
 petunias same series doom too evil 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.080
 well yes maroon she now builds up her 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.790
 these this other petunia mean 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.870
 many-flowered terry therefore from them 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 a lot of escape very much and i'm here 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.780
 even added perlite to less 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.780
 dried out and while they were not sick 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.920
 I want to say the advantage still pot 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.950
 when was a heavy downpour 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.320
 when there were winds we cleaned them petunias in 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.300
 open ground of course do that 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.650
 so when you choose 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.080
 decide where to land for yourself 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:01.720
 Here I planted 3 bushes food 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:06.220
 tanho there already begins to acquire well 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.460
 that kind of which was laid 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.280
 even on the bag and what I wanted 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.100
 make a big hat and solid colors 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.170
 it's not very tall petunias 20 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.040
 centimeters but due to the fact that three 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.280
 bush and give a lot of lateral shoots she 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.950
 will be above them this hat will be solid 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.100
 flowers should be here they should go down and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.930
 go up already I'm tearing off this 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.690
 too old too can be torn off 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.850
 so that they build new ones for 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.360
 flowers 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.870
 the first flowers can not be sorry to pick off 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.930
 admired a little bit and everything is in principle 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.740
 what care once in three weeks i have them 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.260
 under the helm 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.780
 fertilizer for food and everything is necessary 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.670
 look so as not to dry up which 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.860
 bottoms sol 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.550
 drought-resistant petunia but from 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:05.069
 drying it may die 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:09.370
 but no our closet hidra gelin 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.410
 here is a glade with petunias which is for business 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.099
 in open ground 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.799
 2 weeks ago, these have not bloomed yet 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.400
 their little bushes too 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.330
 low by 15 centimeters will they 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.580
 so side shoots grow 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.040
 terry large-flowered rapper is still 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.700
 no, there is only one flower going 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.919
 to test 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.370
 she is gaining green mass 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.710
 increasing side shoots and that's good 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.850
 This suggests that petunia 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.889
 will blossom spirit so hurry 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.790
 get upset that there are no early flowers 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.410
 absolutely not ashamed of a little yes he has 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.570
 small there are they like her like they 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.000
 ascended evenly not injured developed 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.310
 but there are also side shoots that is 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.860
 will be a little later now it's this 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.470
 Volga Petunia looks so simple 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.580
 and the only thing I want to say is her 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.020
 have to water 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.449
 well in a day it's a fact better 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.800
 grumble why I planted between 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.530
 them soil mortuary 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.680
 to somehow save la pute to 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.780
 somehow cover the ground so you can 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.740
 weed can be put by humus 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.440
 so it will be easier for example 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.389
 in our climate for some reason now stands 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.460
 heat a petunias 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:43.389
 comfort temperature 21 degrees 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:46.889
 40 certainly a bit much but now let's move on 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.889
 to mobile petunias
